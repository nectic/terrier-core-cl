ENVIRONMENT WATCH; REGAL EAGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bald eagle as symbol is ubiquitous; on 25-cent coins and dollar bills, in 
Native American rituals, festooning countless institutional and governmental 
logos. But in reality the bald eagle has led a much less glorious, indeed a 
struggling, existence. 
</P>
<P>
 There may have been as many as 75,000 of these majestic birds in what is now 
the United States when Europeans arrived. Although the eagle feeds largely on 
fish and carrion and is no threat to humans, settlers considered it vermin, to 
be shot on sight.  
</P>
<P>
 By 1940, bird populations were so devastated that Congress passed the Bald 
Eagle Protection Act, barring possession or sale of any bald eagle, dead or 
alive, its nests or eggs. Despite the penalties in the act, poaching continued 
to decimate eagle populations, as did DDT poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bald eagles hit bottom, ecologically speaking, in 1963, when researchers 
counted only 417 breeding pairs. Following passage of the Endangered Species 
Act in 1973, the eagle was listed as being on the verge of extinction.  
</P>
<P>
 But with the 218th anniversary of this nation's declaration of independence 
comes the good news that our national bird, after decades of decline, has grown 
more robust. Researchers counted 15,000 eagles in 1992 and reproduction rates 
have rebounded to pre-DDT levels. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week 
removed the eagle from the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 The eagle is not the only success story for the controversial Endangered 
Species Act, but today, especially, the eagle's resurgence deserves a special 
cheer.

MORE SHELTER FOR BATTERED WOMEN; CITY AND L.A. COUNTY MOVE TO INCREASE 
FACILITIES AMID GROWING AWARENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All the discussion about domestic violence spurred by the Simpson murder case 
is starting to produce some positive effects. It has prodded the 
budget-strapped Los Angeles City Council and the County Board of Supervisors to 
provide additional shelters for women who flee battering husbands or 
boyfriends.  
</P>
<P>
 These havens are urgently needed. There are only three in the city and only 18 
countywide. At best, these scarce refuges can protect a couple of hundred women 
and their children. Thousands must be turned away because of chronic lack of 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Mark Ridley-Thomas and Rita Walters deserve credit for taking 
the lead in securing money for additional beds in shelters within city 
boundaries. The action will allow nonprofit developers and community groups to 
open, expand or operate shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also has voted to establish a Domestic Violence Task Force, add 
domestic violence experts to the new Community Police Advisory Boards, direct 
the housing authority to establish preference for abuse victims for housing 
assistance and approve the listing of spousal abuse hot lines on the city's 
cable television channel. All of this is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke proposed, and the board approved, a 
similar panel to review arrest procedures, prosecution, victim support and 
protection, public education and early intervention among teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also will spend $1.1 million on the 18 shelters within the 
county. Those funds will come from marriage license revenues designated for the 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Every available bed is needed. In Los Angeles County, local authorities 
received nearly 68,000 domestic violence calls and made more than 16,600 
arrests last year, and the number of calls has risen since the arrest of O. J. 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 How many women in our region have no place to hide because all shelters are 
full? No one can say for sure, but the number now should be reduced, however 
modestly, thanks to this movement in the right direction.

THE AIDS ATTACK ON MINORITIES; NEW STATISTICS UNDERSCORE THE URGENT NEED FOR 
MORE HEALTH EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most recent federal statistics show that AIDS is now the leading cause of 
death -- 62 deaths per 100,000 people -- for African Americans aged 25 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly as grim are the statistics for the nation's Latino population. Acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome has become the second leading cause of death for 
Latinos in that age range. And the Latino figure -- more than 28 deaths on 
average for every 100,000 peoplebetween the years 1987 and 1991 -- is believed 
to be underestimated by 30%, according to the National Center for Health 
Statistics, the producer of the new report. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no good news here. 
</P>
<P>
 For African Americans, the figures show that AIDS exceeded homicide as the 
leading cause of death for those aged 25 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Cooper, the first African American chairman of the AIDS Action Council, 
said that the figures are further evidence of the need to "encourage black 
leaders" to deal with the scourge of AIDS. "No one is dealing with it in a 
comprehensive way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics buttress the concern of Ana Vargas, a client outreach 
coordinator at the Valley HIV/AIDS Center in Van Nuys in the San Fernando 
Valley. "In the Latino community, this is too often seen still as a disease 
that only affects other people. There is a lot of denial going on," she said. 
Vargas needs $4,000 to produce a Spanish-language handbook on the disease and 
on the range of related services available in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of treatment, AIDS remains a maddeningly elusive quarry. There are 
now four approved drugs, but all can have fairly serious side effects and the 
virus can mutate to resist them. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hope offered by the new federal numbers is that they might be used to 
convince minority populations that there is no such thing as a group that is 
not at risk of contracting AIDS. The figures can help persuade people to modify 
their behavior and to be tested for the virus, slowing the spread of this 
disease and saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kate Prager, the primary researcher for the study, suggests: "It has 
already spread in these (minority) populations in alarming fashion. Care needs 
to be taken to try to prevent further infection." Indeed.

WHEN PROTEST GOES TOO FAR; SUPREME COURT GETS CLINIC ISSUE JUST RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The abortion debate has generated nearly as much heat over the First 
Amendment, and its guarantee of free speech, as over the constitutionality of 
the medical procedure itself. Last week's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court 
limiting protests near abortion clinics is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 6-3 vote, the court held that judges and lawmakers can impose a buffer 
zone around a Florida abortion clinic and prevent protesters from picketing and 
chanting on the street and sidewalks in front of the facility and its parking 
lot. The decision, stemming from a long-running confrontation outside the 
clinic, was the court's first detailed pronouncement on a protest issue that 
has arisen in scores of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, vowed to shut down the 
Florida clinic by conducting continuous protests. The clinic staff, complaining 
that the loud chanting during surgical hours was disruptive and constituted 
harassment, obtained a state court injunction. The broad injunction barred the 
chanting, created a 36-foot buffer zone outside the clinic and prohibited 
display of signs and photos that might disturb patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion opponents challenged the injunction, citing First Amendment 
protections. But the high court decisively disagreed. Writing for the majority, 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist upheld key parts of the injunction, 
including the buffer zone and the bar on chanting. However, the ruling struck 
down the ban on signs and photos. In so doing, it clarified the law on this 
issue and drew a reasonable line between legitimate protest and illegal 
harassment.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, when read against the backdrop of other recent developments, the 
decision effectively disarms the most violent, disruptive abortion protesters. 
The message is consistent, whether from Congress in the form of the new Freedom 
of Access to Clinic Entrances Law; from the California Legislature, which 
passed a similar law late last year; from California's appellate courts, 
upholding an injunction in Vallejo similar to that in Florida, or from the U.S. 
Supreme Court itself in narrower rulings handed down earlier this year: 
Peaceful protest is constitutional; disruptive or violent protest is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Although division remains among the justices over the constitutionality of 
abortion, the Supreme Court fortunately has begun to find its voice on the 
narrower, yet no less vital First Amendment question springing from this highly 
charged controversy.

<P>
 The June 10 letter by Cal State Fullerton's Arthur Hansen was written with all 
the chest-thumping certitude of his profession. It was also grossly 
misleading.As any scholar with even a passing understanding of the history of 
the materials of the Nixon White House knows, it was Congress, not President 
Nixon, who changed the rules of ownership of those materials -- so egregiously 
that the courts finally ruled in 1992 that he was as entitled to compensation 
as a property owner whose land is seized for a freeway right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 If the President had, as the professor writes, a "lamentable penchant for 
confounding public with private property," it was one he shared with every 
President from George Washington to Lyndon Johnson. Prof. Hansen knows this, of 
course. But a good cheap shot is hard to resist, is it not?

'INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's "infrastructure crisis" is not the result of an "anti-tax mood" 
as Robert Poole (Commentary, June 23) suggests. With over $27 billion unspent 
in the federal highway trust fund and over $6 billion in California's highway 
trust fund and $117 million in the highway bridge earthquake reinforcement 
fund, it's extremely difficult to justify a "scarcity of highway funds" and the 
need to burden the citizen with additional taxes (tolls).Unfortunately most of 
these proceeds have been "loaned" to the general fund with no legal mandate for 
their repayment. Gasoline costs about 50 cents per gallon when the local, state 
and federal taxes are subtracted from the average pump price.  
</P>
<P>
 Any collusion between government and the so-called private sector will result 
in fiascoes such as the Riverside 91 Freeway toll lanes.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has taken a lot of flak for unsound transportation decisions. But, 
when one lays bare the complete picture it's found that the federal government 
has mandated these impractical policies through restricting of federal funds -- 
the gasoline taxes that you and I have paid at the pump! California's greatness 
will never be restored through the fascism of "public/private partnerships."

CLINTON ATTACKS RELIGIOUS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I shook my head in disgust as I read of President Clinton's recent verbal 
attack on Rush Limbaugh and other conservative talk show hosts (June 25). 
Invoking the memory of those who sacrificed their lives on D-day, he stated, 
"These people did not die so the American people could indulge themselves in 
the luxury of cynicism." That comment is indicative of his Administration's 
utter disdain for our basic freedoms. He obviously does not realize that is 
exactly why they died. 
</P>

<P>
 * Thank God that President Clinton moved from the restrictions of presidential 
imagery to become human and hit back at the sacred-cow privileges of the Rush 
Limbaugh evangelists of American talk radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton correctly pointed out that the constant cacophony of right-wing 
vilification is more than an anti-Administration media circus. It saturates 
America with a negativism that fuels an already dangerous national sense of 
hopelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle of an arrogant Limbaugh strutting across our TV screens peddling 
his political propaganda is a bad-taste hangover from Reaganistic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is 1994. It's time to go ahead and vomit over the nauseating chorus 
of evangelistic blasphemy preached from their protected perches by 
self-appointed political propagandists for the Deity. 
</P>

 * Democrats are alienating Christians. Recent statements from Don Sweitzer, 
the party's national political director, and Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) 
demonstrate an insidious attack against Christians who actively disagree with 
their ideology (June 26). Whenever politicians make personal attacks instead of 
debating the differences of opinion regarding issues, it is an indication they 
are in trouble. Unable to convince voters their philosophy is correct, they 
resort to a personal smear campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats would like voters to believe the Republican Party is being taken 
over by "the radical right" with a scary agenda. An interpretation of that, and 
certainly closer to the truth, is that Christians are concerned with the 
direction of America and are getting politically involved to make changes that 
include less government, lower taxes, better schools and reduced crime. I guess 
it's the less government and lower taxes part that has the Democrats worried.

 * While I agree with Edwin Yoder about Falwell and the religious right ("The 
Religious Right, Doing the Wrong Thing," Commentary, June 28), I disagree with 
his statement that Christianity "is about right and wrong." In fact, the 
persistence of this erroneous belief is one of the prime reasons the religious 
right exists. Christianity is about a loving God who became human, led an 
exemplary life, showed love and mercy to the least deserving, and then died 
willingly to demonstrate God's power over death. If only Falwell would spend 
more time preaching the Gospel instead of spreading his 
pseudo-Christian-conservative agenda, he might find a society more willing to 
embrace his values. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Christian Gospel involves a higher level of moral ambiguity and 
uncertainty than Falwell and the religious right can countenance. 
</P>
<P>
 LAWRENCE TONSICK 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Yoder refers to the conflict developing between President Clinton and 
Falwell, the two Baptist boys. Yoder says that the Baptist God must be confused 
over two Baptists fighting with each other. He then refers to the President as 
"a good Southern Baptist boy who goes to church regularly, Bible in hand, knows 
and loves all the old hymns and is well acquainted with Holy Writ." 
</P>
<P>
 Let me say that Yoder may be confused but God is not confused and neither is 
he mocked. God has X-ray vision. He can see right through humankind. Just 
because somebody goes to church and loves the hymns, does not necessarily mean 
he or she is a Christian. Anybody can put up a successful front. After all, 
evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart did.

JAPANESE ROYAL COUPLE'S VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In an article about the visit of the emperor and empress of Japan ("Royal 
Visit Gives Show of Respect," June 23) an older Nisei expressed regret about 
the loss of allegiance to social values, once a part of Japanese culture. In 
particular, one Confucian teaching was cited: "Be dutiful to your parents, true 
to your friends, study hard, cultivate the arts and work for the public good." 
</P>
<P>
 Restate that in the first person as a pledge of good citizenship and let it be 
used in place of the Pledge of Allegiance in school grades K though eight. 
Acknowledging that those who will wrap themselves in the flag, given any cause, 
will object, at least let it be used in grammar school whenever the pledge to 
the flag is recited. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose I fantasize. Those phrases, "cultivate the arts" and "work for the 
public good" will be classified by some right-wing, self-anointed protectors of 
the American way as radical socialist notions that will threaten our God-given 
national character. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad. For a minute I thought I was onto something. 
</P>

 * To set the record straight in "Protests and Praise Greet Royal Visitors" 
(June 22), I would like to point out there was a similar protest when Hirohito 
visited here in 1975. I was one of the protesters taking the similar route to 
present a protest/demand to the Japanese Consulate in Little Tokyo. Japanese 
soldiers killed my grandmother, who was blind and fragile and was left behind 
when we were fleeing to the woods from them. They sprayed down the slopes with 
machine guns from above the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day, they burned down our house. Within a month thereafter my 
grandfather died because of the losses to the family. My grandfather was an 
American citizen who had returned to China to retire after an abdominal 
surgery. My father was in the United States at that time and I was born a U.S. 
citizen. I had witnessed the brutality of Japanese soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan still does not have the guts to admit the wrongs it has done to millions 
of people, and to make it worse, some Japanese officials have tried to distort 
history and lie.

PERSPECTIVE ON RAOUL WALLENBERG; HONOR THIS HERO BY GETTING TO THE TRUTH ABOUT 
HIS FATE; WORLD WAR II: THE LEAST THAT AMERICA CAN DO FOR ITS "HONORARY 
CITIZEN" IS TO PURSUE HIS CASE WITH THE KREMLIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM KOREY, William Korey is director of international policy research 
for B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was on July 9, 1944, that Raoul Wallenberg, the 32-year-old Swedish 
aristocrat, arrived in Budapest on his extraordinary mission to help rescue a 
desperate Hungarian Jewry. Few knew then and remarkably few know today that his 
employer was an unusual government agency -- the U.S. War Refugee Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in January, 1944, 
shortly after he learned from Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. 
that the State Department had been engaged in a conspiracy to subvert rescue 
efforts. The most stunning achievement of the board was its hiring of the 
courageous Wallenberg to operate out of the neutral Swedish legation in 
Hungary. He saved thousands of Jews from the Holocaust, a significant part of 
the estimated 200,000 rescued by the War Refugee Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallenberg was kidnaped by Moscow's intelligence services in January, 1945, 
and disappeared into the Soviet gulag. The U.S. government, at its highest 
level, has done precious little to ascertain his fate. Only at the beginning of 
Wallenberg's apprehension did Washington seek to vigorously intervene, although 
quite indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the massive and changing Kremlin deception and cover-up of the 
Wallenberg case, continuing until the present, top Washington officials have 
been silent. It is time to end that silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow's policy of dealing with the Swedish hero falls into four stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage 1 coincided with Wallenberg's kidnaping. The Swedish Embassy in Moscow 
was officially informed by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Dekanosov 
that "Russian military authorities have taken measures to protect Raoul 
Wallenberg and his belongings." In fact, he had already been incarcerated in 
the notorious Lubyanka prison and held as a prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only at this stage that indirect high-level Washington intervention 
occurred. On April 9, 1945, Secretary of State Edward Stettinius cabled the 
U.S. ambassador in Moscow, asking him to extend "all possible support" to the 
Swedes in their diplomatic efforts on behalf of Wallenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stettinius cable was prompted by a message to the State Department from 
the U.S. minister in Stockholm that intervention was appropriate as "we had a 
special interest in Wallenberg's mission to Hungary." At about this time, 
Secretary Morgenthau advised the War Refugee Board's executive director: "Let 
Stettinius know that I am personally interested in this man." Afterward, 
high-level inquiries ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage 2 was formally initiated on Aug. 18, 1947, when, in response to foreign, 
mainly Swedish, inquiries, the new Soviet deputy foreign minister, Andrei 
Vyshinsky, declared that "Wallenberg is not in the Soviet Union and is unknown 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Stage 3 was launched in 1957, in response to overwhelming evidence from 
released gulag prisoners who had seen Wallenberg. That April, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Andrei Gromyko acknowledged that Wallenberg had been in the Lubyanka 
prison but had died of a heart attack on July 17, 1947. The evidence was a 
report presumably written by the chief prison medical officer, Dr. A.L. 
Smoltsov to Minister of State Security Viktor Abakumov. Smoltsov went on to say 
that the corpse had been cremated. 
</P>
<P>
 It was assumed that the documentation would prove convincing. Gromyko said no 
"other information whatsoever" was found. Since Smoltsov died in 1953 and 
Abakumov was executed in 1954, the case, conveniently, was said to be wrapped 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, however, sharp challenges could be posed. How could the 35-year-old 
Wallenberg, known to have been in excellent health throughout his stay in 
Budapest, suddenly succumb to a heart attack? 
</P>
<P>
 Casting even greater doubt on the Smoltsov report was a 1992 investigation by 
a Swedish-Soviet commission that revealed that the only crematorium in Moscow, 
in its list of cremations for 1947, carries no mention of Wallenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Stage 4 of the cover-up began with a Tass dispatch of April 24, 1991, about a 
meeting between high Soviet security and foreign-office representatives with 
Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy von Dardel. Von Dardel was told that 
Wallenberg's death in 1947 was "an irrefutable fact" and "there is no reason to 
continue to investigate his fate." Why not? The answer was sharp and pointed: 
"All the available materials" have been opened and "there is nothing more." 
Significantly, nothing at all was mentioned about the Smoltsov document, so 
discredited had it become. 
</P>
<P>
 That security officials are continuing to perpetuate a lie was disclosed by 
the top archival official in Moscow, Rudolf Pikhoya. In late 1991, he bitterly 
complained in a major Soviet publication that the KGB had deliberately 
classified certain documents on Wallenberg as "operational intelligence" and 
thereby closed them to public scrutiny. Indeed, very recent disclosures by 
former spymaster Pavel Sudoplatov identify the specific files where information 
on Wallenberg is located. 
</P>
<P>
 While Moscow was engaged in its vast deception, Congress was stirred to action 
by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), a survivor of the Holocaust in Hungary. It 
enacted a statute in the fall of 1981 granting Wallenberg the almost unique 
status of "honorary citizen." Only Winston Churchill had been accorded that 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the level of diplomacy, however, intervention was modest and only in forums 
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Ambassador Max 
Kampelman vigorously raised the issue at Madrid in 1980, as did Ambassador 
Warren Zimmermann at Vienna in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 We still don't know what happened to Wallenberg nor why he was kidnaped. 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in his 1992 address to the U.S. Congress, 
promised that the Kremlin would engage in "no more lies." It is time to put him 
to the test at the highest level of government. That's the very least we can do 
for the unusual employee of the U.S. War Refugee Board who became America's 
"honorary citizen."

 I am frequently asked to give slide shows on my travels to undeveloped areas 
of Asia. An image of a Tibetan nomad flashes up on the screen, and someone in 
the audience invariably exclaims, "Oh, how healthy they look!" Yes, it's true 
they have rosy cheeks and strong bodies, but their world is not really a 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, this typical family photo. At the right is an elderly 
woman. She looks about 80, but she's only 50. Her teeth are almost gone and 
exposure to the sun has left her skin dark, dry and wrinkled. Life in this 
natural environment has taken a toll. And notice further that there's only one 
of her. The others of her generation are already dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the children. There are many little ones, but few older children. Why? 
Because many babies never make it to adulthood. Every mother can expect to lose 
children to disease or malnutrition, for some families go months without seeing 
any fruit or vegetables, and they are ignorant of ordinary hygiene.  
</P>
<P>
 Think of the last time you broke a bone or had a toothache or severe flu. You 
went right to the doctor, didn't you? What would life be like if you could 
never do that? You might try eating unusual foods or herbs, and if you got 
well, you'd attribute it to their magical properties. But more probably, they 
wouldn't work and you would simply suffer. Children in non-technological 
societies often have misshapen limbs. Elders have cataracts. Women die during 
childbirth. These are the inevitable consequences of living in a "healthy" 
natural environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the nomads in my photos have rosy cheeks and strong bodies. They have to, 
for they work hard all day. What you don't see are the sunken cheeks and 
shrunken bodies of those who didn't survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In television documentaries, non-technological societies are usually portrayed 
as somehow better than ours. It's politically correct to praise what is the 
farthest from our own environmentally destructive urban lives. We are exhorted 
to protect natural ecosystems, to preserve endangered wildlife and to shelter 
Borneo's headhunters and Amazonia's Indians from the ravages of the white man's 
civilization. So when I tell people about my friend Tsewang, a Tibetan who 
lives in Lhasa and who recently acquired a hookup to bring MTV into his home, 
they are horrified. "Contamination!" goes the cry all around. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know anyone in Borneo or Amazonia, but I do know Tsewang. He is not at 
all unbalanced by having MTV to watch. He thinks it's interesting, yes, but 
also odd and rather incomprehensible. He has not taken to wearing baggy 
calf-length pants and huge black sneakers, but even if he had, what of it? 
Isn't that his right? Certainly everyone who vacations in Tibet next year will 
be disappointed to find Tibetans looking just like us, but that doesn't mean 
Tibetans should be imprisoned in the past for the sake of our entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many young Tibetans, who generally have no opportunity to travel outside 
their homeland, Tsewang is burning with curiosity about the outside world. How 
would you feel if someone put up a wall around your hometown, forbade you to 
leave, prohibited outsiders from coming in, took away your television and 
ordered you to forget how to read, all in the name of preserving your cultural 
purity? When you eat Chinese food or see a French film or admire Italian 
fashions, do you feel contaminated? Of course not; most of us are interested in 
foreign things. That we have opportunities to enjoy them we take as a sign of 
progress. So does Tsewang. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to recognize that people are not wildlife. They have ambitions and 
desires that are as legitimate as ours, despite our "superior" knowledge. 
People everywhere want to have longer, safer and more comfortable lives and 
education for their children. They want progress, but at their own pace, from 
their own labor (with some help from outside) and by their own choice. We are 
not less American because we have given up our six-shooters and ten-gallon 
hats. Will Tibetans be less Tibetan if they are stockbrokers and beauticians 
instead of farmers and herdsmen? Of course not. It is up to them, not us, to 
select which customs they will keep and how they will develop.  
</P>
<P>
 We who live in rich societies cannot and should not repudiate our 
accomplishments. Instead, we need to make them consistent with a healthy planet 
while allowing others, if they choose, to follow.

FROM A FOUNDING FATHER, AN IMPERFECT VISION OF AMERICA; THOMAS JEFFERSON: FOR 
TWO CENTURIES, THE NATION'S STRUGGLE HAS BEEN TO LIVE UP TO HIS IDEALS, NOT HIS 
PREJUDICES AND NEUROSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN SCHWARZ, Benjamin Schwarz is a historian and foreign-policy analyst 
at the RAND Corp. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, fashioned after the dreams of its founders, was the first 
self-conscious nation in history. It is a nation possessed by an idea of what 
it ought to be, and that idea is what we celebrate on July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Fourth is our most sacred national day, it is also the holiday 
about which we are most ambivalent. While we are enraptured by the American 
idea, we have always been haunted by the chasm between our ideals and our 
deeds. Possessed by a dream, we have for 200 years yearned for America, in 
Martin Luther King's words, "to live out the true meaning of its creed." 
</P>
<P>
 This ambivalence is epitomized in the curious way in which America reveres and 
reviles its inventor. Ten days before his death and the 50th anniversary of the 
Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, in a fit of self-congratulation, 
wrote that the declaration would be "the signal arousing men to burst the 
chains and to secure the blessings of self-government. All eyes are opening to 
the rights of man . . . . The mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on 
their backs or a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them 
legitimately." 
</P>
<P>
 Today it is impossible to read Jefferson's lines without irony. While we 
applaud ourselves when America's vision of liberty and human rights is 
apparently embraced from Chile to China, and while we believe that America's 
ideals have led naturally to the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity we 
celebrate, we quail at the man who defined those ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 Enlightened schoolchildren now see Jefferson in a most ambivalent light. He 
was a sincere and dedicated foe of the slave trade who bought and sold people 
whenever he found it personally necessary. He believed that all men were 
entitled to life and liberty, yet he tracked down and punished slaves who 
claimed these rights by running away. He was convinced that slavery was morally 
and politically wrong, but wrote a slave code for his state and opposed a 
national attempt to limit the further expansion of the institution. He believed 
one hour of slavery to be worse than ages of British oppression, yet he was 
able to discuss slave "breeding," as if he were speaking of dogs or horses. He 
knew slavery to be a stain on America, but he refused to lift a finger to wash 
it clean; for while he believed in the rights of man, he also believed in the 
right to property, and for him, when the two conflicted, property took 
precedence. 
</P>
<P>
 The radiance of Jefferson's vision of America as "an empire of liberty" -- a 
vision that we have inherited -- is stained by racism. Jefferson's apologists 
are fond of quoting his statement about black men and women, that "nothing is 
more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be 
free . . . " But they fail to quote his concluding clause: ". . . nor is it 
less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same 
government."  
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson hated slavery because he knew it to be wrong, but he also hated it 
because it brought black people to America. Jefferson was convinced that blacks 
were alien, inferior and dangerous, and his vision for America -- a vision 
better explained by psychologists than historians -- required that blacks be 
not only emancipated but extirpated. Advocating a program of ethnic cleansing, 
Jefferson was determined that blacks must be removed "beyond the reach of 
mixture." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing this, many now declare Jefferson's ideas, those that defined this 
country, to be hypocritical and therefore meaningless. Others dismiss 
Jefferson's foibles, saying that it is absurd to hold him to current standards. 
But most of us know that those very standards are rooted in Jefferson's ideals. 
Just as we have trouble separating the ideals from the man, so our national 
agony has been trying to reconcile our egalitarian dream with the sordid 
reality from which it comes. 
</P>
<P>
 To know Jefferson is to know America's tragedy. But it is also to know what we 
must do. For two centuries, America's assignment has been to live up to 
Jefferson's ideals, not his prejudices and neuroses. Abiding by those ideals, 
the American people, Jefferson prophesied, would "go on, puzzled and prospering 
beyond example in the history of man."  
</P>
<P>
 It was not revealed to him, however, that sharing this puzzlement and, to a 
lesser degree, this prosperity, would be 20 million black citizens of these 
United States. His failure to foresee this salient fact of our history has 
enormously complicated the Jeffersonian heritage of freedom and equality, 
majority rule and minority rights. For the ideals and aspirations that 
Jefferson gave imperishable expression in the Declaration of Independence must 
be applied, not in the all-white society of Jefferson's vision but in the 
multiracial society of our America.  
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson, our nation's creator, believed this impossible. To be true to his 
ideals, we must prove him wrong.

By ROBERT J. KELLY, ROBERT J. KELLY, an associate clinical professor in the 
UCLA psychology department, comments about the mental health of those designing 
health-care reform: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's extend our system of checks and balances in Washington to include the 
mental health of the people to whom we give power. Unlike some voters in 
Virginia, I am not disturbed that Oliver North sought therapy years ago.I am 
disturbed that he left treatment too early. 
</P>
<P>
 I have spent too many hours watching congressional hearings on C-SPAN, wishing 
that the politicians who had just given a bravura performance before the camera 
would head straight for their therapist's office to explore why they said what 
they said. I also wonder what it would be like being the psychologist, 
challenging them on unconscious motives for their political actions. 
</P>
<P>
 My wildest hope about health-care reform is that Congress will embrace 
trickle-down psychonomics, in which all people with power, especially 
politicians, clergy and CEOs, will be required to enter psychotherapy -- a bit 
like mandating gun training for those who are armed and dangerous.

 FREEWAY COWBOYS: This year's Orange County Fair, which opens Friday and runs 
through July 24, is called "Saddle Up for Fun," and for good reason. Not only 
are there a rodeo and scads of horse shows, but on July 15, 250 head of cattle 
will be led down Fairview Road to the Costa Mesa fairgrounds from Costa Mesa 
High School, two blocks away. Los Angeles lawyer Eugene Veenhuis, who owns a 
Montana cattle ranch, will be among the 100-plus guest riders. . . . "It'll be 
great fun," he says. "With about one rider for every two cows, we shouldn't 
have too much problem with any of them running off down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 PRETTY FAIR STATS: Last year's total fair attendance was 668,096, down 
slightly from 1992's heavily promoted 100th anniversary event but in line with 
previous years. . . . Among last year's big numbers: 56,000 ears of corn were 
eaten, 43,000 people tried the "Footsie Wootsie" foot massager, 31,000 visited 
the traditional log cabin, and 15,000 rode the elephant. . . . To avoid the 
crowds, try a day besides Saturday. Last year's two Saturdays drew almost 20% 
of the 17-day attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 RIDING HIGH: Maybe you like the shows, the farm animals, the baking 
competitions. But for some folks, the fair is the rides . The fair's carnival 
vendor for 10 years, B&B Amusements of Yuma, Ariz., is returning. Back again 
also is its highly popular wave swinger (above), but new is the Ejection Seat. 
Don't eat cotton candy first: It's described as "a reverse bungee jump." Says a 
promoter: "It's like being shot out of a cannon." . . . This year the fair 
offers unlimited rides for $11 Mondays through Wednesdays, and $15 on the two 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 IT MUST BE HER: It's no coincidence that Vikki Carr is the fair's July 24 
closing act. That's Fiesta Day, the fair's salute to Mexico. That means five 
mariachi bands, a Mexican market and a Mexican rodeo. . . . Carr, Mexican-born, 
has performed worldwide since her 1960s hit, "It Must Be Him." She'll sing in 
both English and Spanish at the newly renovated Pacific Amphitheatre.

<P>
 WAVE THE FLAG: Patriotism is no longer passe at Cal State Northridge. Or, at 
least, that's how Prof. John Broesamle sees it.Broesamle, who has taught U.S. 
history since 1968, says since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, students have 
shown more pride in Uncle Sam. . . . "You can say the word hero without getting 
sneers anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 FAMOUS NAME: It certainly can't be too much fun sharing your name with the man 
most noted for his famous signature on the Declaration of Independence. But 
John (Jack) Hancock, 33, an appliance repairman in Granada Hills, doesn't seem 
to mind, especially on the Fourth of July. . . . "That's one sacred holiday to 
him," said his wife, Karen. 
</P>
<P>
 OLD GLORY: It wasn't that many years ago in this country that people were 
burning the flag. Now they're buying it. Barbara Kaufman (above), owner of 
Flags and Banners Unlimited in Woodland Hills, says she's sold about 200 flags 
in the last month. . . . "Maybe the World Cup has something to do with it, or 
people just wore out their old flags," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 FIREWORKS: The city of Palmdale is way out in the sticks, and that makes 
sense. After all, it's the only city in the north part of Los Angeles County 
that allows the sale of fireworks. One big reason is that nonprofit groups use 
the sale to raise money. . . . "Voters had the background to make an 
intelligent decision," City Clerk Victoria Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 FUN FOURTH: It wouldn't be proper, naturally, to celebrate our country's 218th 
birthday without a big party, and the Valley is no exception. From Burbank to 
Woodland Hills, there will be plenty of concerts and fireworks. . . . 
Performers include the Doo Wah Riders and the Nelson Riddle Orchestra (B3).

<P>
 BURNING ISSUE: Firefighters across Ventura County are bracing for a heavy 
workload tonight. Illegal fireworks and firecrackers sparked about 25 small 
fires in the county last year and sent five people to the hospital. . . . 
Fourth of July mishaps have dropped dramatically over the past decade as cities 
have banned fireworks. Officials warn that Fillmore is the only place in the 
county where fireworks are legal. Oxnard Fire Chief Henry Lenhart's advice: "Go 
to one of the professional fireworks shows and enjoy yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 INDEPENDENCE DAY: You've heard it before: Political agitators pushed for local 
government rule. Taxation was a big issue. But this time, the separatists were 
local residents pushing to secede from Santa Barbara County (B1). . . . It took 
a couple of tries in the Legislature, but Ventura County finally came into its 
own in 1873. When the news reached Ventura, great bonfires fed with petroleum 
lit up the skies, the Santa Barbara Times reported. "There was a general and 
promiscuous jollification, lasting away into the night." 
</P>
<P>
 FIRED UP: All the attention on the World Cup has pumped up interest in soccer. 
. . . Sporting goods stores report swift sales of soccer gear. And the phones 
never seem to quit ringing at Soccer Direct, which runs soccer camps in 
Thousand Oaks and Camarillo for players ages 5 to 18. "Whenever there is a full 
day of coverage on ESPN, we get more calls," camp owner George Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
 RUSSIAN MISSION: Two Russian military officers slipped past security gates 
onto the Point Mugu Navy Base over the weekend. . . . But no one was concerned. 
Maj. Gen. Yuri Ivanovich Savin and Maj. Svetlana Nikolaevna Churkanova were 
invited on base to learn tips from the Navy on how to preserve wetlands. 
Spokesman Alan Alpers agrees that it's unusual to have Russians on a base that 
sprung up during the Cold War. He said, however: "There isn't anything in the 
environmentally protected areas that you cannot see from a satellite."

GEORGE RAMOS: HOSPITAL PROJECT A BITTER PILL FOR THOSE PUSHED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although he has a panoramic view of Downtown L.A., much of what Lorenzo 
Canales sees from his front porch doesn't please him. 
</P>
<P>
 Canales -- a semi-retired mechanist who lives in Boyle Heights -- can see 
Dodger Stadium off in the distance. He dismisses the place because he and his 
mother were forced to leave Chavez Ravine back in 1953 when the city wanted to 
build low-income housing there, but it later gave the land to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has a bigger-than-life view of the sprawling County-USC Medical 
Center, which is just across the street from his modest stucco house. And, like 
what happened more than 40 years ago, he may lose this home, too. 
</P>
<P>
 His dilemma, and those of more than 200 families near the medical complex, has 
an unsettling effect on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I visited Canales and his wife, Hortencia, the other evening to find how he 
could lose his home yet again. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say he must give way to accommodate a $1.1-billion improvement 
project at the medical center scheduled to be completed by 2002. Without it, 
the Eastside institution will close. Federal and state officials, citing safety 
concerns, have insisted on the improvements. A streamlined 
2.1-million-square-foot hospital is planned to replace the aging General 
Hospital and other outdated facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has drawn support from County Supervisor Gloria Molina and other 
area leaders because it meets the continuing health-care needs of the Eastside, 
where blue-collar Latinos cannot afford private medical assistance. These 
politicians don't want to consider the possibility of allowing County-USC to 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is in favor of that," one East L.A. activist said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's an uneasiness about all of this. In making that decision, Molina 
and others have decided to support the elimination of about 200 homes and 37 
majestic-looking Canary Island pine trees for the greater good of the project. 
It means the end of a place the locals call Marengo Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 That has a special kind of resonance in the Eastside, where whole 
neighborhoods have disappeared before to make way for public projects. Among 
those that come to mind are the construction of the Santa Ana, Pomona and Long 
Beach freeways, the Sybil Brand jail for women and previous expansion at 
County-USC. The loss of community identity and control led Molina and others to 
successfully fight a state proposal to build a prison near Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 East L.A. doesn't need another public project dislodging residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At his home on Cummings Street, Canales says he understands the need for the 
work but distrusts the politicians who are asking them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need the hospital, I don't deny that," he says. "But I don't like their 
way of doing it. People like me are losing their homes. It's a rip-off." 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers the bitter experience of being told to leave Chavez Ravine after 
he and family members made improvements to their home on Lilac Terrace. Not 
only were they unfairly compensated for the home, he says, but they were told 
they weren't even eligible for the public housing the city contemplated for the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine?" he asks in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a private entity, the Dodgers, got the land, something Canales 
never accepted. "I've never even been to Dodger Stadium after all these years," 
he proudly announces. "Why should I?" 
</P>
<P>
 He left the ravine for Cummings Street and came to enjoy its family atmosphere 
and the spectacular views of the city. Before long, the county began buying up 
homes in the area for previous expansion work. In Canales' view, another 
private entity, this time USC, seemed to be benefiting from the loss of homes 
-- a charge the university hotly denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "That ain't right," he bellows. "(County officials) never tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Project supporters point out the benefits of the project and the promise of 
fair compensation for homes. Canales, who says he's heard all that before, 
counters with questions about why the improvements can't be done on land 
already owned by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Canales may be placated by a fair price for his home. The same may 
be true for other residents. But the uneasiness is likely to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of seeing (us) pushed around," Cummings resident Alberto Juarez Jr. 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was hoping my own uneasiness over the residents' plight would go away, but 
it didn't. Especially when Canales revealed that his greatest joy of living on 
Cummings was raising his four children and nine grandchildren on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hospital is needed. But there are times when the price is too steep 
and, too often, people like Canales are the ones asked to pay it.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
MARK KROEKER; 'DYNAMIC PARTNERSHIP' CAN ATTACK CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Blair, One of the most visible proponents of community-based policing 
in the Los Angeles Police Department is Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker, who commands 
the South Bureaua 57-square-mile area from San Pedro to the Santa Monica 
Freeway, with an ethnically diverse population of 750,000. In this last of a 
two-part series on the subject, Kroeker discusses community-based policing with 
James Blair. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: How do you define community policing by the Los Angeles Police 
Department? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I see it as an approach which orients the police towards the community 
and its interests. It uses problem-solving strategies, focuses heavily on 
distinct neighborhoods and brings police and community together in a dynamic 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does that differ from community-based policing proposed by Anthony 
Thigpenn of AGENDA, the activist neighborhood organization in South-Central Los 
Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think there is much difference. The similarities, the mutual goals, 
are much more significant than some minor differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What mutual goals? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The reduction of crime and the fear of crime in neighborhoods; the 
improvement of the quality of life and an improved relationship between the 
police and community.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't there the perception in some quarters in the South Bureau that the 
LAPD is minimizing input from existing neighborhood block clubs by using senior 
lead officers to organize the program? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's recruiting. It's not the "anointing-appointing" process -- that 
implies that we as a Police Department are in some kind of superior position. 
In South Bureau -- with 750,000 people -- some neighborhoods are abundantly 
represented by either very effective community-based organizations or existing 
general-purpose block clubs. But many neighborhoods don't have people organized 
to work with the police in solving their own problems. Our doors are open. 
Every time I go to a community meeting I recruit block captains -- especially 
in areas where none have been identified. The organization already includes 
about 150 community police representatives and 600 block captains in the South 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Don't some people claim they're being left out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have a huge Latino community across the South Bureau that is in 
desperate need of inclusion. We've got a long way to go. So the recruitment 
efforts are really deepening when it comes to that 40% to 70% of our 
neighborhoods which are Latino and which have a language barrier. Yes, people 
are being left out. But it's not by design. It's our desire -- it's my desire 
-- that anyone who wishes to work in enhancing the quality of neighborhood life 
should be included. No one should feel that they're on the periphery. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So it's not that you object to neighborhoods picking their own 
representatives in whatever manner they wish; you just don't want the Police 
Department administering what amounts to a citywide election? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Exactly. Our system has to be kept simple and inclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some community activists are pressing for neighborhood participation in 
policy planning, disciplinary reviews and tactics. Isn't that different from 
the kind of participation you're talking about? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Policy for an organization with 10,000 employees cannot be developed in 
neighborhoods. In a city spread over 464 square miles with a tremendous 
diversity of people, you cannot develop a Balkanized policy structure that 
differs radically from one neighborhood to the next. The city of Los Angeles 
and its Charter specifies the manner in which policy is developed through the 
mayor, City Council and, as to the Police Department, the Police Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is community-based policing, as you've described it, an efficient use of 
taxpayers' money? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's squandering tax dollars to do anything but a system of policing that 
maximizes the energy that exists in the neighborhoods. I'm interested in it as 
it affects crime, the fear of crime and those goals which we've set for 
enhancing life in our city. If it's just sweet talk, eyewash and PR, then I 
don't have time for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see any hope for compromise between you and community activists? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think compromise is the right word. I think mutuality of 
understanding is better. It's not as though we've got two very distinctly 
differing ideas. I've got a very clear vision for our city, and that is to make 
it a better place for everyone who lives and works here.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; 
'HAITIANS, AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE NATURAL ALLIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jean-Pierre Brax, Haitian Jean-Pierre Brax is a screenwriter, director and 
author of three books on his native land, including La Societe Haitienne de A a 
Z (Haitian Society from A to Z), an analysis of exiled Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's experiences. Brax, who lives in Los Feliz, was 
interviewed by Trin Yarborough. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Haitian in Los Angeles, married to an African American, I feel deeply the 
bonds that have long bound Haitians and American blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 6,000-member Haitian community in Los Angeles there is much energy 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 While we seek to avoid too much involvement in politics because of divisions 
among us, most of us are very moved by the suffering of our compatriots in 
Haiti. Many of us are involved in efforts to raise aid for our country and are 
organizing cultural gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 We have been aided and encouraged by our African American brothers and 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond between Haitian and American blacks has been strengthened and renewed 
by the May 5 arrests of Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and several other 
black (and some white) American members of Congress protesting U.S. policy 
towards Haiti. Their actions and the courage of African American Randall 
Robinson, leader of TransAfrica (the Washington-based lobbying group for Africa 
and the Caribbean), who vowed to fast until death if necessary to change that 
policy, have inspired Haitians everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Haitians and African Americans are natural allies, historically having gone 
through many of the same things. Haiti, just like the United States, suffered 
under slavery. But in 1804, Haitian slaves won independence from France by 
defeating the soldiers of Napoleon. For this, Haiti paid dearly -- it was 
completely cut off by the slave-owning world. Yet it was from this event that 
Haitians developed their attitude of Haiti Against the World -- an attitude we 
still have, for better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, in 1824, the Haitian government sent a special mission to the 
United States to encourage American blacks -- freemen and former slaves -- to 
emigrate to Haiti. And again just before the Civil War in America, the Haitian 
government opened offices in U.S. cities to encourage black Americans to come 
to our country. The Haitian government paid the passages for those several 
thousand who immigrated. Unfortunately, cultural differences made it hard on 
the transplants. Eventually many returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In this century, the Haitians came in three separate waves to Los Angeles. The 
first arrived 20 to 25 years ago. They were a wealthy group. 
</P>
<P>
 The second group arrived over the past 10 years and were mostly middle class. 
The third group includes about 200 boat people, most of them poor, who have 
come in the past three years. It is easy to understand why there are problems 
among members of these groups. That is why we try to avoid political issues, 
for within Haiti itself these issues can separate members of the same family. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not expect to live in America. I was born in Haiti to a Haitian Creole 
mother and French father, and was taken to France when I was 2 because of the 
bad political situation. My parents divorced when I was 12 and I returned to 
Haiti with my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 As a little mulatto guy with a Parisian accent, in a school where everyone 
else was brown and spoke Creole, I had to learn about Haitian culture as a 
matter of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics in Haiti continued to shape my life. I attended the Sorbonne 
University in France, but in 1986, when Jean-Claude Duvalier left Haiti, I 
decided to return home to build cultural pride. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next five years there were coups and elections and more coups -- 
altogether five changes of government until the election in 1990 of President 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 I was vacationing in Los Angeles, planning to return to Haiti in two days, 
when Aristide was overthrown. And so I have stayed in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. is a big equalizer. The key to surviving is to respect who you are, 
especially as a black and a minority. Of course there are differences between 
Haitians and American blacks -- first, the language, and secondly Haitians are 
more aggressive and have a pride that can be mistaken for arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 I have written a screenplay, "Haiti Cherie," about the relationship between 
Haitian newcomers and their African American sisters and brothers. I would like 
its success to be the success not only of a Haitian but also of an African 
American. We blacks must organize together. We have a lot of work to do.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever a popular public figure falls from grace, there is always one 
inevitable question: How could it happen? How could someone rich, famous, 
powerful and widely admired allow drugs, sex, scandal or crime to ruin their 
life? The answer, many experts say, is simple. We expect far too much from our 
public figures and we too easily confer heroic status on basically ordinary 
people, many of whom tend to have the same character flaws as the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the sight of a sullen O.J. Simpson sitting in a courtroom facing murder 
charges, or President Clinton facing sexual-harassment charges, or baseball 
star Dwight Gooden coping with drug problems leaves many wondering if there are 
any true heroes in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Youth Opinion, some youngsters remind us that there are people 
worthy of unbridled respect and admiration. Not surprisingly, their heroes are 
not likely to appear on some artificial roster of the "Ten Most Admired Men or 
Women in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Their heroes are real people: the folks next door, the unheralded leaders who 
have taken a stand against drugs or prejudice, pioneers in a field, and even 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why is it that in the public's perception the lines often seem blurred 
between heroes, role models and celebrities? Why are many of our so-called 
heroes actors and athletes instead of social workers and teachers? 
</P>
<P>
 "One factor is the media and a culture that defines what a perfect person is," 
says Leo Braudy, author of "The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and Its History." "We 
confuse fame with heroism. There is a desire to admire others but whether 
someone we admire is an actual hero is another question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heroes are often very different; they do strange and historic things," adds 
Braudy. "A hero is someone who accomplishes something for the community. Many 
heroes are anonymous." Adds Charles Adams, an English professor at Whittier 
College, "There is a difference between heroism and just being famous. Heroes 
must have a social consciousness. They must have the desire to transcend the 
mundane in our existence in some positive sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a hero needs to be a perfect being," Adams says. "I don't think 
a role model needs to be a perfect being. That's asking a bit much." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Americans tend to demand perfection of their public figures. They want 
them to be heroes and role models, paragons of our society. Historically, it's 
an impossibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any kind of honest assessment shows heroes are anything but role models," 
says Michael Near, an English professor at Occidental College. "We live in an 
era of metaphor and representation. Rather than looking at the circumstances in 
front of us, we fictionalize the reality around us. Someone like O.J. Simpson 
is the product of our culture. We're creating him as someone larger than life." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the experts remind us, heroes rarely are larger than life. "To be 
famous doesn't require anything good about you at all," Adams says. "When we 
think of heroes, we think of someone having achieved something good."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
TOBACCO EDUCATION: CLEARING THE AIR IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Researched by Catherine Gottlieb / Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every county in California coordinates education activities to help people 
quit smoking and to keep others from starting. In Orange County the overall 
smoking prevalence has dropped by 6% in the last two years, making its current 
18% rate the lowest in the state. The decline, public health experts say, 
resulted in part from outreach efforts by the county's Tobacco Use Prevention 
Program which works in partnership with community organizations, schools, 
businesses and a coalition of volunteers to develop approaches for reducing 
tobacco use. Funding for Orange County's program and others like it throughout 
the state comes from Proposition 99 revenue, the 25-cent tobacco tax initiative 
Californians overwhelmingly supported in 1988. The initiative specifically 
outlined how much revenue tobacco education programs would receive, but these 
allocations have been reduced in the past. Groups like the Americans for 
Nonsmokers' Rights and the American Lung Assn. argue such alterations are 
illegal. Others like the California Medical Assn. and state hospitals say more 
Prop 99 money should fund medical services for the poor. And lawmakers like 
Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) say the issue is deciding how best 
to use shrinking tax monies. The Legislature has yet to determine how Prop. 99 
funds will be allocated for the next fiscal year. HOW A COUNTY KICKS THE HABIT 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County currently has 46 different education programs developed in 
response to its residents' tobacco use patterns. Here's a sample: 
</P>
<P>
 YOUTH PREVENTION 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: In Orange county about 70% of 14-16 years olds say they can purchase 
cigarettes from convenience stores even though selling tobacco to minors is 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Response: Teens Not Tobacco, a new program, trains teenagers to educate 
convenience store vendors about state laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to 
minors. More than 30 teens have talked to more than 60 convenience store 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 POLICY DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Nearly half of all employees in Orange county workplaces without 
smoking restrictions are exposed to smoke; where tobacco use restrictions have 
been implemented only 12.5% of the workforce is exposed to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Response: Work Site Consulting assists businesses and schools to create smoke 
free environments. To date, more than 300 Orange County companies have 
tightened their smoking regulations and 30 companies with 500 or more employees 
have gone smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 CESSATION 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Only 36% of Orange county smokers reported that they were advised to 
quit smoking during their most recent doctor's visit; 43% of Orange County 
smokers who were advised to stop smoking during their last visit to a health 
care professional tried to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Response: Training more than 500 county health care professionals about how to 
help their patients stop smoking has brought information to more than 40,000 
smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Smoking among Orange county's young, urban Hispanic children is 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Response: Community-based groups receive grants up to $20,000 to develop 
outreach programs that promote tobacco-free lifestyles. Among them: St. Jeanne 
de Lestonnac Free Clinic's "Neighborhood Free from Tobacco" program in Santa 
Ana discourages teens from smoking by approaching their families in a 
bilingual, door-to-door information campaign about how to maintain a 
tobaccoless home and community. A Mandate Going Up In Smoke? 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 99 passed by a 58% to 42% margin and included fixed percentages 
describing how the tax money was to be distributed. Here's how spending was 
approved by the voters and where the money goes today: 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 99 proceeds 03,18,06,06 1988 1994 Health Education 20% 13% Medical 
Services 45 52 Research 5 5 Environment 5 5 Unallocated 25 25 TO GET INVOLVED

By As Told to ROBERT SCHEER. Jim Brown, the former National Football League 
star and Hall of Fame member, now runs Amer-I-can, a self-esteem program for 
ex-gang members in Los Angeles.

<P>
 It's hard to relate to what is going on now. This was the third-highest 
watched program . . . the O.J. Simpson chase. 
</P>
<P>
 And what you have is (that) a lot of things are being dismantled now that 
should be dismantled, so instead of looking at it in a negative way, you look 
at it in a positive way. All these conceptions of "role models" are 
distracting. Once you can get it behind you, you can get down to business. We 
have to face the facts any way we can -- but it's good. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time you can ever make a change is when you're dealing with the truth 
-- if we keep dealing with the hypocritical or the false, how are we going to 
talk to a kid when they see the hypocrisy? If you put a hypocrite in front of a 
kid, he sees. 
</P>
<P>
 Where I'm coming from, the O.J. thing don't mean a doggone thing. The big deal 
is getting kids off the ground and being productive. They don't have time to 
sit down and philosophize about O.J. and his situation. Anybody who's got a job 
to do is not going to stop to get into depression about what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Life is going to go on, and it's going to be a better one, not because of what 
happened with O.J. What's happening is we need to reinvest in young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I'll tell you -- there are a lot of people that are working -- a lot of 
young gang members, convicts -- special people that are working in their own 
way, and they're willing to work with other people. Like the NAACP, the Urban 
League. So there is an unpublicized positive movement going on.  
</P>
<P>
 I work with gangs and I work with convicts. I create job opportunities, I 
teach them life-management skills, I teach them at schools, juvenile camps, 
parole, probation. Some of them are working in the studios. We stop killing, we 
help create peace among gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 What we've done is taken those who are supposed to be lost and they've turned 
their lives around and are nowfunctioning as law-abiding citizens that are 
productive and take care of their own minds and helping others take care of 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 My men handle things with self-determination. We're in the state of Oregon, 
we're dealing with Denver, we're dealing with Jacksonville, Fla., we are in New 
York, we're in Chicago, we're going into Trenton (N.J.) with a major contract, 
we're going to probably end up in the state of Iowa, and in all of these 
places, former criminals are now functioning in a meaningful way. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason that I'm dealing with convicts and gang-bangers is because the 
present situation of killing, black-on-black crime and conflagration, all of 
the drive-by shootings and car jackings and drugs -- until you do something 
about that, you cannot implement the entrepreneur aspect. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll give you an example: the NAACP in San Diego invited us in to train 30 
law-enforcement officers from the various agencies, the most cynical 
individuals on earth. In one week, the testimony was unanimous that it had 
affected their lives. So part of what we do is to get the ex-predators and the 
policemen together in the same curriculum so that they can understand how to 
work effectively; it's a whole new approach. In all of this, young people 
understand how to work the system. But it's almost low-key, because if you're 
doing that kind of work, you can't get notoriety. Notoriety makes no 
difference. We don't even solicit funds from our core volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 You got to get it to a sound business front; if you don't get it to that, it 
becomes walking around, preaching, and hoping something's going to fall out of 
the sky. You must deal with the system and it must be business, and 
businesslike. And you must give a service, and you must get paid for that 
service. And that's what we do. We have a contract with the state of California 
for the last three or four years; we service them with manager skills, and they 
pay us and we deliver that service. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't go and beg people for everything. (Boxer) George Foreman volunteered. 
(Former Clipper guard) Norm Nixon has done some work. That's good. But I don't 
go to celebrities. Most people who help these young people volunteer, they see 
what's going on -- (sportscaster) Jim Hill is going to adopt one of these 
schools. Jim is very kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody needs support -- they need someone they can relate to. These kids 
are shattered and so any rebuff, any separation, hurts them, and they can be 
highly aggressive in that stage. If you show them caring and respect and 
strength, you can work with them. But you have to have education that can be 
properly applied, with a combination of caring and education and economics.  
</P>
<P>
 You can't create love and not try to create economic opportunity. I'm very 
energized, very optimistic. We have an office at 292 La Cienega that is run by 
ex-gang bangers. That's our executive office. But they're in that office 
everyday. You don't have to have an office in the ghetto.

 A sports legend becomes a murder suspect. A leading man checks into the Betty 
Ford Center for Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation. And even the President is 
accused of sexual harassment charges. Is it difficult these days for young 
people to find a role model? Or are there people worthy of high regard and 
respect ? EDUARDO TORRES

 My hero is Cesar Gaviria, the past president of Colombia. He's done many good 
things for his people. I look up to him because I think he's a good example for 
all people my age. I especially admire him because of his stance against drugs. 
He shows us not to give up, because his country has really been hit hard by 
narcotics and drug dealers. He never gave up, never stopped fighting. That's 
his message. ALVIN CHAN

 My hero is Rush Limbaugh. I like his morals. He stands for honest work. He was 
down-in-the-dumps in the 1980s and couldn't even afford to pay cash for 
groceries. He has shown that people can work their way out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 I admire his persistence. He has taken a lot of fire from everyone in the 
press and from the Democrats. He may not be the best-looking or the smoothest 
guy around, but he sticks to his beliefs and comes out swinging every day. He 
represents what people should strive for. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Rush is older, I can relate to him. Who does my generation have to 
look up to -- Beavis and Butthead? Bart Simpson? They don't stand for anything 
that anyone in his right mind would want to emulate. ALAINA LYLES

 I look up to Patra, the reggae dancer. She's just the neatest person in the 
world because she stands against prejudice. I like the way she acts, the way 
she portrays herself. She's provocative but not too provocative. She watches 
how she dances. She watches what she does because she knows young people look 
up to her. She's not prejudiced against anything, against any other kind of 
music. She says it doesn't matter what color you are, what you dance to, 
whatever. It's OK with her. ANDREA HARZSTARK

 If there's anyone I look up to, it would have to be Edith Wharton because she 
was really the first great American female writer. I'd like to be a surgeon. 
And there aren't a lot of female surgeons so I'll have to be somewhat of a 
pioneer in my field as she was in her's. She wasn't afraid of what people 
thought of her. She just went out and did what she needed to do. Not to mention 
that her writing is amazing. She has a special insight that you can look at and 
say, "This is true." The sign of a really good writer is the ability to take 
truth about life and put it accurately on paper. And she did that. VALERIE ARCE

 My hero is Mike Vitar, an actor in "The Sandlot" and "The Mighty Ducks." He's 
a good actor, one of the few Latinos in movies right now. He's in good movies, 
like Disney movies, not ones with a lot of violence. It's important because we 
don't have a role model if there are no Latinos out there. I mean, it's like 
you don't count. The bad parts are shown, like gangs and all that other stuff, 
but there aren't enough positive images for Latinos. GRACE S. CHIU

 My parents are my heroes because I admire their work ethic. They're always 
saving and preparing for our futures. It's pushed me to work harder, to set 
goals for myself because they have worked so hard to get us where we are. If 
you have heroes just because of one trait they have, you really don't know 
their entire character. That's why my parents are my role models, because I 
know them so well.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MY FIRST REAL JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA HOWELL, 1994 graduate, 29, Cal State L.A., master's degree in theater 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My dream was acting, but I got my bachelor's degree (in Tennessee) in 
broadcast journalism so I would have something to fall back on. In Nashville 
and in L.A., I got good work in TV, feature films, plays. But I wanted more 
intellectually. I enrolled at Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to combine my theater background with business. And it worked its way 
into something I could never dream of doing elsewhere. I'm an administrator at 
the Harriet and Charles Luckman Fine Arts Complex, a new $22 million facility 
on the Cal State L.A. campus. We open this fall. It's a performing space and 
gallery for professional theater and art. 
</P>
<P>
 I started as a graduate assistant here, doing planning for the opening year. 
Then they offered me a position I created myself. I bring fifth- through 
eighth-graders from East L.A. onto the campus to expose them to the arts. It 
gives them the idea that there's more out there. I also design a family series 
(of performances) that is wholesome and affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Going back to get my master's has given me a new sense of empowerment and 
creativity. And I am giving more back to society than if I was just being an 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
 The most valuable thing for me in my education has been having a mentor. Mine 
has been Clifford Harper, who was chairman of the theater department when I was 
in it and is now executive director of Luckman. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone pursuing a career, it's imperative to look around and find a role 
model to give you intelligent feedback. Also you have to find ways to volunteer 
in your field. It's the only way you learn about an organization hands-on. That 
way you can show your skill and dedication. You have to prove yourself. I don't 
expect anyone to give me anything. 
</P>
<P>
 I know a lot of young kids feel pressure to get out of high school and get a 
job. But going to college is really worth it. It's tough while you're doing it, 
but the benefits are so great. You reap a monetary reward and also a personal 
reward that no one can take away from you. A sense of accomplishment. It makes 
me wake up every morning and smile and thank God.

 THE SENTINEL: LAPD Has Done a Good Job in the Simpson Case 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department was called to investigate a double murder -- 
the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, the ex-wife of Football Hall of Famer O.J. 
Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the LAPD has been under constant scrutiny. Their motives were 
called into question after an initially cooperative Simpson was handcuffed in 
front of his house. Then the officers quizzed him for three hours out of the 
presence of his attorney, and searched the home without a warrant, they say, 
after they were "invited" in. There were also leaks of information to selected 
members of the media. But other than that, the Sentinel believes that the LAPD 
has gone out of its way to make sure that Simpson's rights were not violated. 
</P>
<P>
 The police should also be commended for the way in which they conducted the 
pursuit of Simpson and his best friend, Al Cowlings. They followed from a 
respectful distance and -- as far as we can see -- placed no one in jeopardy.  
</P>
<P>
 It is refreshing to know that in at least this instance, the LAPD has done 
just about everything right. And, the credit must go to their new chief, Willie 
Williams.

 * EASTSIDE SUN: Speedy Enactment of Bills Aimed at Battering Needed 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI has disclosed shocking statistics which show that 50% of married women 
will be beaten in their lifetime. It is also estimated that 80% of the 1.9 
million battered by their husbands annually are also raped by their husbands, 
according to Assemblywoman Hilda Solis (D-El Monte). 
</P>
<P>
 Solis introduced a bill that made marital rape a felony offense. Before her 
bill's enactment, a husband could brutally rape his wife and only face 
misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that it took a high profile murder like Nicole Simpson's to 
focus attention on battered women.  
</P>
<P>
 It is our hope that pending legislation aimed at protecting victims of abuse 
at the hands of batterers will be speedily enacted.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; QUICK USE FOR A TOOL AGAINST FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors leased a special firefighting 
helicopter last week. Within days, it proved its worth. 
</P>
<P>
 When fire broke out near San Juan Capistrano, burning within 150 feet of one 
tract of homes, Orange County Fire Department officials pressed the chopper 
into service. Because training had barely begun, some problems in coordinating 
the aircraft's movements with ground crews were reported. But the on-the-job 
training generally worked and provided essential experience for future fires. 
</P>
<P>
 After the devastating Laguna Beach blazes last year, there was never a 
question about the usefulness of a chopper that can fill a 360-gallon tank with 
water from lakes or reservoirs in 90 seconds, dump it on the flames and quickly 
fill up again. The question was where to find the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors' task became easier when the Fire Department's commendable 
belt-tightening saved more than $1 million in budgeted but unspent funds, money 
that paid for the one-year lease of the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms said after the Laguna Beach devastation, in 
which more than 400 homes were destroyed or damaged and $500 million worth of 
damage was done, that helicopters were no longer a luxury but a necessity. The 
aircraft can be invaluable in stopping a fire before it spreads. The county did 
get help with firefighting aircraft from other jurisdictions, but the response 
was delayed because planes and helicopters were being used to fight other 
blazes when Orange County erupted in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Holms also had a pointed message worth heeding. He said residents living in 
areas prone to fires, filled with wood-frame houses surrounded by brush, must 
take steps to protect themselves, including clearing the brush. That is the 
law, but compliance too often has been haphazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The county declared more than 165,000 acres off-limits to the public last 
month because of the danger of fire. The helicopter gives the Fire Department 
another weapon in its arsenal, but it needs help from the public as well.

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; A SWEET, HOME-COOKED MEAL FOR OUR TIME; BLUE RODEO BY 
JO-ANN MAPSON ; HARPERCOLLINS $22, 318 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGIA JONES-DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jo-Ann Mapson's new novel, "Blue Rodeo," is the perfect dessert for women -- 
and men! -- who liked "The Bridges of Madison County" then found they were 
hungry two hours later: hungry for character development, believable plot, 
dialogue and language at once controlled, mature, romantic, subtle and 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 The bestseller list is where perfectly good novels such as "Blue Rodeo" 
belong, but something goes awry and they rarely work their way up there. Why 
"Bridges" then? It's a minor romance, the perfect length for a flight from Los 
Angeles to Chicago. It makes you feel like a better person: "I do read love 
stories," you protest. "I don't only go in for sexy thrillers with big body 
counts." It's fast-food fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Rodeo" is a long, home-cooked meal of a novel, a fully realized piece of 
writing, balanced in pace and language, a controlled, leisurely work. "The 
Bridges of Madison County" reads like a movie novelization compared to Mapson's 
careful prose construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen Garrett, the hero of "Blue Rodeo," is a far more compelling figure than 
Robert Kincaid, the cardboard hero of "Bridges." He's a real cowboy, a 
52-year-old man of few words and wants. He's also a wanted man with a big 
conscience. He loves his horse, Red-Bow, and his dog, Hopeful. He believes 
ardently in the work ethic, and knows that there is a difference between a babe 
and a lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Owen's fugitive status forces him to keep a low profile in the tiny 
New Mexico ranching community he's settled in, he's too interested in people 
and the life around him to assume an existence as a loner. He works in the 
hardware store and tends a few sheep on a small ranch belonging to an absentee 
landlord. He doesn't shy away from becoming friends with various locals, 
especially Joe Yazzi, a Native American Vietnam vet with terrible physical and 
emotional scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen had been married and is the father of a grown daughter. But he hasn't 
been romantically intimate with a woman since he's been on the lam and he's 
ripe for it, right there on Page 1: 
</P>
<P>
 "To Owen Garret's keen sheepherder's eyes, it appeared entirely likely that 
the woman in the blue shirt and red panties running back and forth between the 
water faucet and the two copulating dogs was the Californian. First off, the 
red panties were the itty-bitty lace variety. You didn't come by those in a 
town like Blue Dog unless you ordered off one of those fancy color catalogs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Californian in the blue shirt and lace red panties turns out to be Maggie 
Yearwood, recently divorced from a hotshot Hollywood director. She's given up a 
sophisticated lifestyle and ocean-front home just as she's hit her 40s. Her 
reasons for coming to live in this backwater ranching community have as much to 
do with building a new life as living in the state so that her son can attend a 
boarding school for the deaf as a state resident. 
</P>
<P>
 They turn out to be neighbors, Maggie and Owen. She's rented the ranch house 
on the property Garrett is caring for, while he occupies the bunkhouse. She's 
disappointed at first, having a neighbor so close by. Maggie imagined painting 
again, in splendid Georgia O'Keeffe-like isolation. Now there's this guy there, 
watching her every move. Maggie doesn't know that Garrett respects her need for 
privacy, even while setting his sights on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie's troubles -- being the recently cast-off wife and rejected parent, 
being new in the tiny, close-knit community and having her economic status 
recently lowered -- dominate the story, while Owen's precarious status remains 
unexplored much of the time. He cannot bring himself to reveal his background 
to her. It drives you crazy because they are both such utterly, honest people. 
</P>
<P>
 How Mapson gets Maggie and Owen to fall in love is touching, humorous and 
romantic. He initiates romance by proposing that they take a dip in the river 
on an early autumn evening. 
</P>
<P>
 They kiss and everything changes. "That kiss said something she had needed to 
be reminded of -- outside this river, on dry land, where contiguous states 
bumped each other at their borders and telephone systems chattered all night 
with orbiting satellites, nothing really mattered except two people in a river, 
making a night pass by holding on to one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson engineers a subplot about Maggie's son, Peter, and how he adjusts to 
living in a silent world. It must be hard enough to enter into the mind of a 
15-year-old male, let alone a boy who has recently gone deaf. But the passages 
in Peter's voice make compelling, fascinating reading. 
</P>
<P>
 A novel like "Blue Rodeo" deserves a little fanfare. No bodies, guns, freeway 
chases, helicopters or machetes. This is a romantic, elegant, low-keyed Western 
for our time -- with sex scenes you can show your mother.

ETHIOPIAN RULING PARTY WINS ASSEMBLY VOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front and its allies 
scored an overwhelming victory by securing 484 of the 547 seats in June 5 
elections for a constituent assembly, the Election Board said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new assembly is mandated to approve a new constitution for Ethiopia 
following the overthrow of the Marxist military dictatorship in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The election was boycotted by groups opposed to constitutional proposals for 
local autonomy that they fear could destroy Ethiopian unity.

NO BLUES SUNG BY VALENZUELA; BASEBALL: CROWD OF 54,167 TURNS OUT AT DODGER 
STADIUM TO PAY TRIBUTE TO LEFT-HANDER, BUT HE AND PHILLIES LOSE, 3-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't a loose game of summer slow-pitch softball, but it felt that way to 
Orel Hershiser and Fernando Valenzuela, two old friends who both happen to have 
won Cy Young Awards in the not-that-distant Dodger past. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, with the crowd chanting "Meh-ee-co, Meh-ee-co," and applauding 
Valenzuela's every wink and shrug, it felt like a festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, with pitches dipping into the 80-m.p.h. zone and batters popping 
pitches high into the air, it looked like an old-timers' contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in between all that, the Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, 
3-1, in a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember a time when I've been more relaxed during a big league 
game," Hershiser said after it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a Fourth of July pickup game, like a bunch of friends who got 
together and I happened to be pitching against an old buddy." 
</P>
<P>
 The warm feelings of familiarity Sunday included the 54,167 in attendance at 
Dodger Stadium who happily, and loudly, cheered both starting pitchers and 
watched Hershiser (5-4) beat his former teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first appearance at Dodger Stadium since 1990, Valenzuela received a 
standing ovation when he went out to take his warm-ups in the bottom of the 
first, and loud applause each time he was introduced to bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad they were cheering him," Hershiser said. "That's what you want the 
home crowd to do when they see a returning champion. When he was in the 
American League, we knew he was back in the big leagues, but we didn't get the 
feeling, that energy he provides when he walks into this ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela spun his way through six relatively strong innings -- and lined a 
single to center against Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out good," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. "Fernando looked good, 
Hershiser pitched good, and we won. It was exciting to see the two of them 
pitch against each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela (0-1), who gave up two runs on six hits and struck out one before 
being lifted for a pinch-hitter in the seventh with his team trailing, 2-1, 
downplayed the significance of the game, though it was the first time Dodger Cy 
Young Award winners had faced each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Dodger players who had never been his teammate knew it was special to 
face Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was such a big thing in Dodger Stadium, and you always wonder what it'd be 
like to face guys like that," said outfielder Cory Snyder, who drove in a run 
in the second on a soft single. "This is something I'll get to tell people, 
that I had a chance to face him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers got their runs against Valenzuela on three soft hits and a suicide 
squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we did get some little dumpers," Lasorda said. "But it's all part of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he looked any different from when we let him go. The only 
difference was he didn't throw the screwball very often." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wallach led off the second with a ground-ball double down the left field 
line, right fielder Tony Longmire misplayed Raul Mondesi's flare into a double, 
Snyder scored Wallach with a bloop to left and Rafael Bournigal drove in 
Mondesi on a perfect squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, Valenzuela kept the Dodgers off balance predominantly with a 
cut fastball bearing in on right-handed hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't hit the ball very hard all day long," Wallach said. "I'll just say 
this: He got us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hershiser: "This guy will be throwing real well for another five years or 
so because he just knows how to pitch. He's a guy with a repertoire of pitches 
lacking any real velocity, and he's still getting people out. That says a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 In a move greeted by loud boos, Valenzuela, in only his second start since 
being signed by the Phillies last month, was replaced by pinch-hitter Jim 
Eisenreich in the top of the seventh inning with the bases loaded and one out. 
Valenzuela threw 93 pitches, 61 for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser got Eisenreich to ground to Bournigal for an inning-ending double 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the Dodgers tacked on another run in the eighth against reliever 
Heathcliff Slocumb and Dodger stopper Todd Worrell pitched the final two 
innings for his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was a day about looking back, not too long ago, to when Valenzuela 
wore blue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was beautiful," Lasorda said of the first-inning standing 
ovation. "They appreciated all that he did for them."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; RUNNIN' ROMANIA STOPS ARGENTINA; SOCCER: HAGI 
MAKES UP FOR ABSENCE OF MARADONA, ORCHESTRATING A FAST-BREAKING 3-2 VICTORY AT 
THE ROSE BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There were more fast breaks than have been seen in a game in Southern 
California since Magic Johnson presided over Showtime, and, just as occurred so 
often in those days, the guys in the gold won. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the Runnin' Romanians, whose 3-2 victory at the Rose Bowl on Sunday 
in the World Cup's second round propelled them into the quarterfinals for the 
first time and eliminated traditional power Argentina, the 1978 and '86 
champion and the '90 runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Seats sold numbered 90,469, but many among the crowd never used them. They 
were kept on their feet by 120 yards of coast-to-coast soccer. One spectator 
was Diego Maradona, the Argentine playmaker who was hired as a commentator by 
one of his home country's television networks after being banished from the 
tournament last week for using banned stimulants. 
</P>
<P>
 In his absence, much of the brilliance from the field emanated from the left 
foot of Romania's Gheorghe Hagi, who, for reasons obvious to anyone who has 
seen him play in this World Cup, is known as the "Maradona of the Carpathians." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the game with two goals and two assists, he had one of each Sunday, 
and, equally as important, his mastery of the midfield enabled Romania to mount 
counterattack upon counterattack while still committing most of its players to 
the defense. It takes a special player to do that, and he is one. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina might have one in the making in Arnaldo Ortega, a 20-year-old 
forward who filled in for injured striker Claudio Caniggia for the final 65 
minutes of Thursday's 2-0 loss to Bulgaria, but either was appointed -- or 
appointed himself -- to assume Maradona's duties in this game. 
</P>
<P>
 With his nimble runs through the defense and his precise passes, he revived an 
Argentine offense that went flat against Bulgaria. He, however, was never able 
to make the pass, the one that the fans who chanted "Diego, Diego, Diego" for 
long periods before, during and after the game no doubt are sure Maradona would 
have made. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega came too close on several occasions for the Romanians' comfort. When it 
was over, relieved Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu described the 
back-and-forth nature of the game as going from "agony to ecstasy." 
</P>
<P>
 In ecstasy at the end, Iordanescu said it was the greatest day for Romanians 
since the Communist dictatorship was overthrown in 1989. It was their greatest 
day ever in soccer, but, if the team continues to play the way it did against 
Argentina, this achievement could be surpassed as soon as next Saturday, when 
Romania plays Sweden in the quarterfinals at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina is going home, a fate upon which Coach Alfio Basile chose not to 
dwell. Agreeing to answer only two questions in the post-game news conference, 
he said he was proud that, even in defeat, his team maintained its dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams were disadvantaged at the start because of the absence of star 
strikers, Caniggia because of injuries to the big toe on his left foot and a 
hamstring and Romania's Florin Raducioiu because of a one-game suspension 
resulting from his two yellow cards in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 When the starting lineups were announced, revealing that Romania would employ 
only one forward and six defenders, it seemed as if Iordanescu's strategy was 
to play for a scoreless tie and let the game be decided by penalty kicks at the 
end of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was evident from the beginning, however, that the Romanians planned nothing 
of the sort. Both teams came out firing, and Romania connected first, on a 
perfectly placed free kick into the top right corner of the net by forward Ilie 
Dumitrescu in the 11th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it time for Romania to withdraw into its defensive shell, as it did seven 
days earlier at the Rose Bowl after scoring the first goal only 17 minutes into 
what turned out to be a 1-0, Group A clinching victory over the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. But it was not possible because Argentina equalized five minutes 
later after defender Daniel Prodan fouled forward Gabriel Batistuta in the 
penalty area. Batistuta converted the penalty kick for his fourth goal of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two minutes later, Dumitrescu scored his second goal after receiving a 
splendid through pass inside the penalty area from Hagi. Hagi's favorite target 
might be Raducioiu, but Dumitrescu obviously will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though neither team scored, the next 15 minutes provided some of the most 
exciting moments of the World Cup. Argentina attacked and Romania countered, 
until both practically collapsed from exhaustion and smog so thick that the San 
Gabriel Mountains in the background were only a rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams came out in the second half and started all over, the Argentines 
needing only 20 seconds to fire their first shot and 1:20 for their second. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the moment they will complain about for years. In the 54th minute, 
Batistuta, penetrating Romania's defense, was sent sprawling and landed inside 
the penalty area. Sure that he would be allowed to take another penalty kick, 
he instead was awarded a free kick just outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
 It produced nothing but a sustained funk for the Argentines, which deepened 
when Romania increased its lead to 3-1 four minutes later. On a three on two 
break, the unmarked man was Hagi, who placed a shot into the net from the right 
edge of the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina eventually snapped out of it, scoring again in the 75th minute after 
Romania's goalkeeper, Florin Prunea, failed to smother a 30-yard blast from 
Fernando Caceres. Forward Abel Balbo scored easily on the rebound.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; SWEDEN PLAYS IT COOL, OUSTS SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sweden was in no hurry to reach the quarterfinals of the World Cup, its next 
stop on this monthlong tour across America. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 3-1 second-round victory over Saudi Arabia, the Swedes introduced their 
version of Little Ball. Instead of going for knockout punches, Sweden kept 
tapping away at the Saudis on a warm Sunday afternoon at the Cotton Bowl before 
60,277. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not have made for the most electrifying match of World Cup '94, but 
the strategy overwhelmed the last Asian group qualifier and sent Sweden into 
the quarterfinals against Romania on Sunday at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching Germany wilt last week in the second half of a 3-2 victory over 
South Korea in Dallas, Coach Tommy Svensson of Sweden knew what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played small, small, small," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The little things made all the difference. Martin Dahlin scored in the sixth 
minute and Kennet Andersson scored twice in the second half, leading Sweden to 
the final eight for the first time since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden had no intention of running around the field chasing Saudis, so it 
conserved energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took it easy, played economically," Svensson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not so easy that Saudi Arabia, the tournament's surprise team, could 
launch its respected attack uncontested. Instead, the Saudis were left 
frustrated and fatigued, and get this: complaining about the heat a little. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they are going home satisfied, knowing they are the first Persian Gulf 
team to reach the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be heroes at home," said Muhammad Abdul Jawwad, who was 
replaced in the 55th minute after Sweden's first two goals were scored on his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, someone must give Sweden its due. It is a clever team that 
strikes quickly and efficiently. And while it is known for its defense, Dahlin 
and Andersson are strong attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the world final. Anything can happen," reserve forward Hakan Mild 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin's fourth goal of the tournament came suddenly, catching the Saudis by 
surprise. Just as the match was settling into a defensive struggle, Andersson 
and Dahlin penetrated the Saudi line. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson hooked a beautiful crossing pass from the left side toward the goal, 
where Dahlin was waiting. Dahlin, who missed a match against Brazil because of 
a one-game suspension for two yellow cards, turned and leaned into the ball, 
heading it past goalkeeper Muhammad Al Daeyea. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden seemed satisfied to take a 1-0 lead into the halftime break, because 
after Dahlin's goal the action diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when Saudi Arabia had an opportunity, something happened to thwart the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 42nd minute, Fahad Al Huraifi Al Bishi got the ball in front of the 
goal uncontested, but slipped. When he recovered, goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli was 
waiting and stopped the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Sweden took control on Andersson's first goal, perhaps the 
game's best play. He leaped over Abdul Jawwad, the team captain and had the 
ball in the top-right corner of the penalty area. Andersson then dribbled to 
his left, stopped and shot. The ball skimmed past the outstretched foot of 
Ahmed Jameel Madani and the diving arms of Al Daeyea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes were content to take a 2-0 lead into the quarterfinals, but 
finally, the Saudi attack came to life. If not for some outstanding saves by 
Ravelli, Saudi Arabia might have pressed Sweden earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But it broke through with a goal in the 85th minute. Fahd Al Ghashiyan raced 
past Swedish defenders on the right wing and scored from 10 yards, the kind of 
play that helped Saudi Arabia reach the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 With the goal, the intensity level increased and it appeared the Saudis might 
score the equalizer with an improved attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Andersson and Dahlin combined in the 88th minute to score again. 
Dahlin brought the ball down from the left and passed across the penalty area 
to Andersson, whose shot hit the corner of the net, much to the dismay of the 
Saudis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to catch Kennet," Mild said. "He uses his body very well." 
</P>
<P>
 And if he continues performing this way, Sweden might be tough to catch, too.

ORIOLES RAIN ON DAVIS' ALL-STAR PARADE, 10-3; ANGELS: DESIGNATED HITTER IS IN 
NO MOOD TO CELEBRATE THE HONOR AS BALTIMORE EXTENDS ANDERSON'S SLUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It should have been Chili Davis' moment to celebrate his scintillating first 
half, climaxed Sunday by his selection to the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 He had every reason to savor it. There were those who didn't dream he still 
would be playing in the major leagues, much less be selected to his third 
All-Star game -- his first since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But there he stood Sunday after the Angels' 10-3 loss to the Baltimore Orioles 
at Camden Yards, chastising anyone who dared suggest that he should be happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm flattered because I wanted to be chosen," said Davis, the Angels' 
designated hitter, "but I wish our record were better so a few more guys could 
be considered. We just can't seem to get it going." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is batting .330 with 15 homers and 56 runs batted in. He hit a homer 
Sunday and his average is 63 points higher than his career mark. Already, he 
has more homers than he produced in five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have him," shortstop Gary DiSarcina said, "can you imagine how 
bad we'd be? I mean, we're bad enough as it is. I'd hate to see what our record 
would look like if he wasn't having an All-Star year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (34-48), losing for the 22nd time in 33 games, once again have the 
second-worst record in all of baseball, barely ahead of the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann used every reliever but Joe Grahe in the game 
to stop the Orioles' assault, but it was of no use. Every reliever but Mike 
Butcher yielded at least one hit, and Craig Lefferts might have lost his job 
after giving up two more homers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is," Butcher said, "but we just keep finding ways to 
lose. No one's panicking, but no one can believe it either. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a record like the Padres, now that's tough to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' latest concern is rookie starter Brian Anderson, who suddenly is 
looking very much like a 21-year-old kid who was in college a year ago. 
Anderson (5-4, 6.10 earned-run average) gave up seven hits and five runs, four 
earned, in only two innings, including a third-inning grand slam by Cal Ripken 
Jr. that sealed the Angels' fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening the season with a 3-0 record and 2.61 ERA, Anderson is 2-5 with 
a 10.24 ERA in his last seven starts, yielding 50 hits and six homers in 29 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It concerns me, and I'm sure it concerns other people, too," Anderson said. 
"It's just a matter of executing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not pitching inside like I used to. I used to break two or three 
bats a game. Now, I don't remember when I last broke a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just getting sick of that experience thing. When am I going to start 
learning?" 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's problems began in the third inning after a rain delay of 1 hour 49 
minutes. Tim Hulett and Brady Anderson opened with singles, and Anderson then 
walked Chris Sabo on four pitches. He fell behind 3-and-0 to Rafael Palmeiro 
before yielding a bases-loaded, run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 That brought up Ripken, who was voted to his 12th All-Star game and will make 
his 11th consecutive start. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson got ahead with a 1-2 count, but before he knew it, Ripken worked the 
count to 3-and-2. Anderson then reared back and fired a fastball on the outside 
part of the plate. Ripken sent it into the right-center field seats for the 
third grand slam of his career and his first since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The rout was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've learned that Chili can't carry the team," DiSarcina said. "We 
have to play well in all different aspects, not just offense, and that's just 
not happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to do something here to turn this around."

MORNING BRIEFING: HE HOPES TO THROW THIS CURSE OUT AT THE PLATE IN FENWAY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If a New England philanthropist has his way, the Boston Red Sox will open 
their 1995 season by burning the contract that sent Babe Ruth from the Red Sox 
to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Shawn Feinstein, the Cranston, R.I., owner of the original copy of the 
1920 contract that shipped the then-Boston pitcher to New York, offered to give 
the document to Red Sox management, if they promise to torch it at home plate 
of Fenway Park next opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the more than seven decades since Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to 
the Yankees, New York has won 22 World Series. Boston, which won five titles 
between 1903 and 1918, has won none. 
</P>
<P>
 Legend has it that Ruth put a curse on the Red Sox for selling him and 
Feinstein thinks burning the contract will end it. 
</P>
<P>
 Add curse: In 1967, Boston lost Game 7 of the World Series to the St. Louis 
Cardinals when Manager Dick Williams tried to pitch ace Jim Lonborg on two 
days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, the Red Sox stayed alive against the Cincinnati Reds by winning Game 
6 on Carlton Fisk's dramatic 12th-inning home run, but lost Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1986, Boston was one victory away from wrapping up a six-game World 
Series triumph over the New York Mets when a ground ball went through the legs 
of first baseman Bill Buckner and gave the Mets a come-from-behind victory. The 
Mets went on to win Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Among Babe Ruth's 714 home runs, how many were inside the park? 
</P>
<P>
 The door is open: Michael Jordan, when asked about the chance of his returning 
to the NBA: "It's real teeny and real weeny." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds logical: The New Jersey Nets are thinking of a name change. Swamp 
Dragons is one of the candidates. The NBA team's management said it wants a 
livelier image, but why Swamp Dragons? 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets' home arena is in the Meadowlands sports complex, which was built on 
what were once wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashing in: Gaylord Perry, who made the Hall of Fame as a pitcher despite 
persistent cries that he was throwing illegal spitballs, has a new item on 
baseball's memorabilia market. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a jar of petroleum jelly, the kind he allegedly used to apply to 
baseballs. It's priced at $39. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough opponent: Britain's Sir Alf Ramsey was once approached by an El Salvador 
soccer coach, who asked how he should get his team ready for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "You arrange 11 garbage cans around the field and dribble through them 
endlessly," Ramsey said. Later, he checked back to see how the El Salvador team 
was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not so good," the coach said. "The garbage cans are ahead, two to nil." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy, on the World Cup: "Soccer 
to me is 90 minutes of nonstop turnovers, with no natural progression to the 
goal. And when it's almost over, they don't even tell you how much time is 
left, for goodness' sake." SHAV GLICK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 If he continues to pitch like he did Sunday, Fernando Valenzuela might have a 
future in this game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela and Orel Hershiser dueled on the first anniversary of the death of 
another Dodger Cy Young Award winner, Don Drysdale. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando wears Philadelphia Phillie uniform No. 33, which matches his listed 
age. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He used to wear No. 34, but how could he possibly ask Ben Rivera to switch 
numbers?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Scalpers who usually wave tickets outside the Dodger Stadium parking lot were 
holding up "I Need Tickets" signs an hour before game time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando's appearance meant nearly 20,000 additional fans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He was greeted by a standing ovation when he took the mound, but, sure enough, 
the same fans cheered when leadoff batter Brett Butler singled in the first 
inning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fans in the right field pavilion chanted, "Meh-ee-co, Meh-ee-co." It must have 
been a salute to Fernando or his native country's World Cup team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How refreshing to see a Dodger shortstop, Rafael Bournigal, who makes most of 
the plays smoothly and efficiently. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Think the Angels regret having traded Dante Bichette to the Milwaukee Brewers 
for Dave Parker before the 1990 season?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And how do the Brewers feel about not protecting Bichette in the 1993 
expansion draft and allowing the Colorado Rockies to draft him?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A National League All-Star team starting lineup without Tony Gwynn is 
counterfeit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kids who refuse to choke up on their bats should watch Barry Bonds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most underrated pitcher in the National League is Ken Hill of Montreal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. showed he is more than merely a slugger when all five of his 
hits against the New York Yankees on Saturday were singles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe the Texas Rangers rank as low as eighth in home runs in 
the American League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Fourth of July used to mean a Pacific Coast League doubleheader at Wrigley 
or Gilmore Field.Now it's a soccer doubleheader on TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Until the World Cup, I thought Americans took sports too seriously. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pete Sampras will be to gentlemen's singles at Wimbledon what Martina 
Navratilova has been to ladies' singles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 News item: No rally lasts longer than six shots during Sampras' victory over 
Goran Ivanisevic. Reaction: Sounds like one of my matches. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 John McEnroe is nearly as outspoken behind a microphone as he was on the 
court. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Key to the Clippers' deal with the Indiana Pacers could be L.A.'s acquisition 
of swingman Eric Piatkowski. The No. 15 pick from Nebraska can shoot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I can't remember an NBA draft as formful as last week's. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers shouldn't give up so soon on Doug Christie, a young player with a 
lot of ability. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' second-round draft pick -- 6-foot-5, 225-pound winger Matt Johnson 
-- was reputed to be the best fighter in junior hockey last season. If so, 
maybe he should try the weak heavyweight boxing division instead of the NHL. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 2 sportscaster Jim Hill has been a voice of reason during the Nicole 
Brown Simpson-Ronald Goldman murder case. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Macho Man: A Channel 4 graphic identified Jose Camacho, the salesperson who 
testified that he sold a knife to O.J. Simpson, as Hector Camacho. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Jones Jr. complains about a lack of recognition and then he apparently 
prices himself out of a James Toney fight that would have given him a chance to 
earn that recognition. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Gary Stevens on Slew Of Damascus' wire-to-wire victory in the Hollywood 
Gold Cup: "He was like a cool, calm jock. The pressure was on him, but he 
wasn't worried about it.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If Arcangues keeps running like he did Saturday, he might be 133-1 again in 
the Breeders' Cup Classic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sign of the times that the regular Friday night card at Hollywood Park 
drew 20,109, and the track's premier race only 17,500 the next afternoon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Joe DiMaggio, Joe Montana, Jerome Bettis, Mike Piazza and Dominique Wilkins 
will be honored Tuesday night at the ninth annual Cedars-Sinai Sports 
Spectacular at the Century Plaza. Tom Lasorda will be the master of ceremonies. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not into the World Cup, perhaps the Tour de France will be more to 
your liking. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldn't it be the Birmingham Barons, not the Chicago Bulls, who are retiring 
Michael Jordan's No. 23?

 At Citrus Bowl Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland vs. Netherlands 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Dutch forward Dennis Bergkamp is the pivotal figure in a game 
that figures to produce few goals. After being frustrated in his first two 
games, he broke through against Morocco for a goal and an assist. "He can raise 
(his level of play) still," Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat said. "He can score at 
any time. It is possible he will make the difference not only (today) but for 
more games after." The task of stopping Bergkamp will fall primarily to Gary 
Kelly and Terry Phelan. Coach Jack Charlton, back from a one-game suspension, 
will deploy only one forward, probably John Aldridge, with five midfielders and 
four defenders. They'll try to keep the play at midfield and keep the ball from 
Bergkamp, Peter van Vossen and the fleet Dutch reserve wingers. Waiting to 
counterattack will be Ireland's game, although Charlton insists he's playing 
for a victory and not for a tie and penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The teams have met 13 times in international competition, and only 
once in their last seven games has either scored more than two goals. This 
probably won't break the pattern. For Charlton, who has no big guns, a 
low-scoring game is essential. For Advocaat, it's a concession to the heat and 
humidity, which prevent his team from playing its usual energetic, attacking 
game. Danny Blind is likely to be added as the fourth Dutch defender and Frank 
Rijkaard, benched against Morocco, will replace the suspended Jan Wouters in 
midfield. Unfortunately, considering the Dutch players' skills and the Irish 
players' feisty style, the heat figures to slow the pace to a near-crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Ireland has the more dogged runners and rugged defenders, plus it 
has the charismatic Charlton. The Dutch players' temperaments are more 
difficult to predict and they still carry the label of wilting in big games, 
such as the 1974 and '78 World Cup finals. That said, the Dutch will win today 
for one reason: They have a game-breaker in Bergkamp, who must generate only a 
couple of chances and convert one. If he doesn't score or set up van Vossen 
before halftime, look for this to be settled in overtime or penalty kicks -- 
and Holland to prevail. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Everyone from the president of the country to Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira's

 In a column last week for USA Today, Pele advised Parreira to make personnel 
moves involving six players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be necessary to try these different suggestions during practice 
sessions in Santa Clara, Calif., because Brazil cannot play any worse," Pele 
concluded.

 If you're still among the American majority who hasn't yet figured out the 
difference between a free kick and a goal kick, here's a cheering word from 
tenor Placido Domingo.He was among the crowd on hand in Washington on Saturday 
to see Spain advance to the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What soccer and opera have in common is that they both unite people. You can 
enjoy either without understanding a word," Domingo opined. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Europeans, Domingo has also spent time on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be a goalie but now I play up front," he joked. "Tenors are 
strikers, really, always pushing forward." WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO

 Peter Bridgwater, World Cup venue director for Stanford Stadium, said he 
expects a capacity crowd of 83,900 for today's game between the United States 
and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two previous games in Palo Alto involving Brazil are any indication, 
about 83,000 will be dressed in green and yellow, carrying drums and cheering 
for Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bridgwater said he believes the crowd's loyalty will be evenly divided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who came to those two games obviously were not Brazilians, 
because there are only between 10,000 and 20,000 fans who followed the team to 
the United States," he said. "Most of those people you saw were Americans who 
adopted the Brazilian team. 
</P>
<P>
 "So two things are going to happen in this game. One is that we will reclaim 
those Americans for the U.S. team. Secondly, a lot of non-Brazilian foreign 
fans who have been coming to our games will be pulling for the underdog." RANDY 
HARVEY

 Good news for the U.S. team. It may win something from this World Cup after 
all -- the FIFA Fairplay Contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on an assessment of a team's conduct during the games, FIFA is tracking 
the Fairplay sweepstakes. Criteria include respect toward opponents, behavior 
of team officials and behavior of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team is ahead so far, having behaved better than the Swiss, the 
Brazilians -- who are tied with the Belgians -- and the Mexicans.

<P>
 Next, the swimsuit competition. JULIE CART

 Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat tried to fake out the press -- and Irish spies -- 
when he switched to a conservative four-defender, four-midfielder, two-forward 
alignment in a scrimmage Saturday at the Florida Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, he said that in today's game he will revert to the 4-3-3 alignment 
he used in his team's 2-1 victory over Morocco. 
</P>
<P>

 One of the more fascinating aspects of World Cup soccer is the work by KTNQ 
radio in Los Angeles. Since there are no timeouts in soccer, the announcers 
have had to do some fancy footwork when it comes to squeezing in commercials. 
So it freqently sounds something like this:

 An Irish Sunday newspaper considered fears of 100-degree temperatures in 
Orlando and the problems Ireland would have with the heat, then sought divine 
intervention for today's game against the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Keene, editor of The Sunday Press, asked the religion columnist, the 
Rev. Colm Kilcyone, for a prayer for rain and published it on Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the headline "A Nation Prays," Kilcyone wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "God our Father, lord of the elements. We ask pardon for the times past when 
we have been ungrateful and grumbled about the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now thank you that you have given us a wet and misty island as home. We 
praise you for the soft ground and regular rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beseech you: Look favorably on our prayers for wet weather in Orlando 
tomorrow. May your clouds shield our footballers from the scorching sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Send your rains to water the pitch. Let a gentle, damp breeze be on the backs 
of our players in both halves. We ask this through Christ Our Lord." The Sunday

 "Something has caught America's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the fact that the games go on for an awfully long time without a 
stop.This might seem a trivial point, but it is not. Like the small boy and the 
naked emperor, American eyes have been young and clear enough to see the very 
essence of football. 
</P>
<P>
 "So how does the coach control the game, then? Simple answer: He does not, and 
therein lies the game's greatest beauty. Coaches can only prepare; they cannot 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in marked contrast to the big American sports, which center on the 
Control Freak. American football is centered on the Fat Controller, striding 
the sideline with his clipboard and his earphones. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "America's most free-flowing sport is basketball, but the national habit of 
Control Freakery imposes the time-out, an invention of the devil. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost as bad is American League baseball's designated hitter, or DH. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "American sport possesses a Control Freak with powers that supersede even the 
coach. The Ad-Man Cometh. Ad-men love time-outs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheer novelty of 50 minutes of action without Chevys and razors and beer 
thrust eternally and repetitively and inanely down your throat has delighted 
America. It is a freedom from market worship; if you like, a freedom from 
America itself." SIMON BARNES, The Times of London

 Most of the players on the U.S. team have been going along with reporters who 
have been suggesting they might have more incentive to win, for flag and 
country.

 Roy Wegerle admitted Sunday the holiday meant little to the players: 
</P>

 "Whether it's the Fourth of July or Christmas Day, it has nothing to do with 
the game on the field. But it would be a great achievement if we win. It would 
be a great birthday present to the soccer fans of America." JULIE CART

 Not that they are unpatriotic in suggesting that Brazil might beat the United 
States today at Palo Alto, but the citizens of Los Gatos, Calif., have to be 
prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Randy Attaway, whose city has played host to Brazil's team and many of 
its followers during the World Cup, has brought in 175 law enforcement officers 
from surrounding areas in anticipation of a victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Revelers, Attaway said, are expected to outnumber the city's population of 
28,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be blocking off streets to take what crowd we can handle," 
Attaway said. "We can't draw 40,000 people. We just don't have the space for 
it. We know there's going to be some form of celebration, but our town will 
only be able to handle so much." RANDY HARVEY

 "Can America win? Of course not. Even the Disney studios would laugh at such a

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; IT'S FAR FROM FUN, GAMES FOR EX-TROJAN JONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the smiles and all-star atmosphere at the Olympic Festival basketball 
tournament is a tall scowl. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 11, it's hard to hide your feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic Festival is not fun for Avondre Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 It's necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In a very real sense, Jones is looking for a job. Right now he is playing for 
the West squad at the Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 When the basketball portion of the Festival ends Tuesday, he becomes a player 
without a team and a student without a school. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the most highly sought high school players in the country last year, 
he chose to play for USC, where he says Coach George Raveling promised him 
significant playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 But his time didn't come. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged only 3.8 points, 3.1 rebounds and 13 minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping up with the Joneses might be hard, but keeping up with Jones' high 
school expectations was something else altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he was hurt by people saying he didn't play well. To him, it was 
more that he just didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
 So he decided to leave USC in May to play elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really improving," Jones said. "It wasn't bad feelings at all, I 
just felt I had to move on. I needed time (in the games) to produce so I have 
to move on to where I can." 
</P>
<P>
 In two games for the West team at the Festival, Jones has played 18 minutes 
each game, scoring eight points on Saturday and four points in Sunday's 103-79 
loss to the South. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is on a team with many shooters, including Long Beach State's James 
Cotton and California's Jelani Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a center, or post, I've just got to be patient -- this is like an all- 
star team and I'm not going to see the ball as much," Jones said. "I try to 
focus on defense and rebounding and the other things." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows there are scouts in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 While other players are taking every opportunity for a flashy dunk or a 
between-the-legs pass, Jones is working hard at shutting down his man and 
boxing out for rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 He has narrowed his choices to Missouri, Iowa and Louisville. There might be a 
problem with Missouri since there are no scholarships available at this time. 
Missouri Coach Norm Stewart did not want to speak about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' Olympic Festival Coach is Tom Asbury, who left Pepperdine for Kansas 
State after last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to gain strength and size and he'll be real good. He's a hard 
worker, a good practice player and has a good attitude," Asbury said. He added 
with a laugh: "We need big guys at K-State, I should be using this opportunity 
to recruit him. But really, I wouldn't do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that I knew about it (leaving USC) but that it wasn't any of my 
business. I haven't talked to George (Raveling)." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said he would like to decide where to transfer by August. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandra Carter of Pasadena won a the gold medal for shooting in the 25-meter 
sport pistol division. Carter scored 688 points. . . . In the second round of 
men's tennis, Jakub Peitrowski of Huntington Beach and the West team defeated 
the North's Adam Neal, 6-2, 6-1.

NEWSWIRE: SCHUMACHER WINS THE FRENCH GRAND PRIX 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Schumacher won the French Grand Prix, his sixth victory in seven 
races, to overshadow the return of Nigel Mansell to Formula One racing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell, making a "guest appearance" because there was no conflicting Indy-car 
race, dropped out midway through the 190.18-mile race at Magny Cours. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher drove his Benetton-Ford to victory a 12.642-second victory over 
Mansell's Williams-Renault teammate, Damon Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 With track temperatures as high as 122 degrees, only 11 of 26 starters were 
running when the race ended after 72 laps over a 2.641-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, who started third behind Hill and Mansell, took the lead before 
the cars hit the first turn and gave up the top spot only during an exchange of 
pit stops with Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't have done any better," Schumacher said. "I think Nigel had a 
little mistake, but my start was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher averaged 115.75 m.p.h. in a race that took 1 hour 38 minutes 35.704 
seconds. Cycling  
</P>
<P>
 A spectacular fall near the finish of the first stage of the Tour de France 
sent two top riders to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium's Wilifried Nilissen was battling for the lead with less than 50 
meters left when he hit a policeman at the side of the course and took down 
several other riders behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 France's Laurent Jalabert was right behind him and tumbled on his head. He had 
blood on his uniform as he was taken away in an ambulance. Organizers said he 
suffered nose and jaw injuries and broken teeth. Nilissen had a slight 
concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Djamoldine Abdoujaparov of Uzbekistan won the stage, while Chris Boardman of 
Britain retained the overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Favorites Miguel Indurain and Tony Rominger were in the pack and did not lose 
any time to the leader. Indurain was ninth and Rominger 45th, but both were 
given the same time as most of the others, and the overall standings changed 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 Indurain is second, 15 seconds back of Boardman and four seconds ahead of 
Rominger in third. World champion Lance Armstrong of the United States was 22nd 
and three-time winner Greg LeMond was 26th. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's stage was 145 miles, from Lille to Armentieres. Today's second stage,

 The United States dominated the Henley Royal Regatta, winning four gold medals 
in eight events, including the Grand Cup, the most prestigious event of the 
155-year-old regatta. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory in the Grand Cup was achieved with unexpected ease by the national 
heavyweight eight, Charles River and San Diego, against the French national 
crew, Sport Nautique Compiegne and Societe d'Encouragement du Sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Any race won by more than five lengths at Henley is described as "easily," and 
is not officially measured. This was the first time in 30 years the Grand Cup 
has had such a result, with observers saying the Americans won by up to eight 
lengths.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ALL-STAR CONE NOTCHES 12TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Cone became the American League's third 12-game winner, giving up only 
four hits and striking out nine in seven innings of the Kansas City Royals' 
11-6 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 victories are one more than he had all last season, his first with the 
Royals, when he was 11-14. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 12-4 with a league-leading earned-run average of 2.68, and Sunday he was 
named an All-Star for the third time.  
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the best one because I'll be wearing a Royals uniform and I grew 
up in this town," said Cone, who represented the New York Mets in 1988 and '92. 
"To start would be icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 The American League's other 12-game winners are the Baltimore Orioles' Mike 
Mussina and the New York Yankees' Jimmy Key. Montreal's Ken Hills became the 
National League's only 12-game winner Saturday. Key or Cone probably will start 
for the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone left Sunday's game with a 9-1 lead in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gagne and Mike Macfarlane homered for Kansas City, which sent Toronto to 
its 13th loss in 15 games. The Blue Jays have not won consecutive games since 
June 9-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 9, Chicago 2 -- On the day White Sox pitcher Wilson Alvarez was 
named to the All-Star team, he looked nothing like an All-Star, lasting only 2 
1/3 innings against the Brewers at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be on the All-Star team," Chicago Manager Gene Lamont said, "but 
he's got to get it going." 
</P>
<P>
 After starting the year 8-0, Alvarez (9-4) is 1-4 in his last seven starts. He 
gave up six hits and walked three against the Brewers in his shortest outing of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Seitzer had three runs batted in, Jody Reed and Matt Mieske each hit 
two-run singles and Angel Miranda (1-0), making his second start since knee 
surgery in December, held the White Sox hitless until the fifth. Miranda gave 
up three hits, walking five and striking out three for his first victory since 
Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, Seattle 2 -- Paul O'Neill, angered by being continually brushed 
back, broke out of a two-for-23 slump with a three-run homer at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The shot capped a five-run rally in the sixth inning as the Yankees ended a 
three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a difference between the inside of the plate and my head," said 
O'Neill, who was knocked down by several pitches during the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 10, Boston 0 -- Bobby Witt extended his scoreless-innings streak to 27 
with his third consecutive shutout. He limited the Red Sox to six hits at 
Boston as the Athletics won for the 17th time in 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
 In Witt's two previous outings, he had a one-hitter against the Royals on June 
23 and a two-hitter against the Angels on June 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt's streak is the longest scoreless streak by an Oakland pitcher since Mike 
Torrez went 38 1/3 innings without allowing a run in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 10, Minnesota 9 -- Second baseman Chuch Knoblauch's first error 
since last September, a span of 85 games, set up the winning run in the 11th 
inning at Cleveland as the Indians won on Paul Sorrento's two-out RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Knoblauch, who was four games away from tying the American League record for 
consecutive errorless games by a second baseman, let Alvaro Espinoza's grounder 
go through his legs for a two-base error with one out in the 11th. One out 
later, Sorrento fourth hit of the game gave him his fourth RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 5, Detroit 3 -- The Tigers committed three errors, two that led to three 
unearned runs during a five-run third inning, as the Rangers won at Arlington, 
Tex. It was the Rangers' fifth victory in seven games, and the Tigers have now 
lost nine of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The sloppy fielding wasted another strong performance from Tiger starter Tim 
Belcher (6-9), who allowed six hits, five runs -- two earned -- in his second 
complete game this season.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; HERSHISER GETS EVEN IN THE END

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dodger starter Orel Hershiser had a little no-hitter going -- and he also had 
a premonition about Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting in the dugout after the second inning and I realized I had a 
no-hitter going and that Fernando was coming up in the third," Hershiser 
said."And I just knew that he was going to get the first hit off of me, and the 
ballpark would go wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is exactly what part-time Mexican League designated hitter Valenzuela 
did during Sunday's game, reaching for an outside pitch and lining it hard to 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser feigned disgust, stared over at Valenzuela, and teasingly tossed the 
ball over to the Philadelphia Phillie dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a little smirk, a little smile, and I threw the ball over there 
jokingly, like he'd want to keep his first hit off of me," Hershiser said. "Of 
course, he's not sentimental about any of that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 He regained his dignity in the fifth, hitting a Valenzuela delivery to left 
field for a single. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing that happened is we both got hits," Hershiser said 
with a smile, "and I won't have to go the rest of my life in those old-timer 
games having to hear that he got a hit off of me and I didn't get a hit off of 
him." TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; CURSE IS CATCHING AS SEASON GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it the curse of Ron Tingley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Angels released the popular veteran catcher at the end of the 
1993 season, bizarre occurrences have been haunting the Angel catching corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident occurred during the weekend. Catcher Andy Allanson, who 
was brought up Tuesday, was placed on the 15-day disabled list because of a 
broken right index finger without appearing in a game. He was replaced by Chris 
Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all of my years in baseball," said Ken Macha, Angel third base coach, 
"I've never seen that. Come on, a guy coming up and then going on the disabled 
list without even playing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allanson: "I've had broken bones before, but before, I always knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The frustrating thing is that I finally got my opportunity, and now I don't 
know if I'll have another one." 
</P>
<P>
 He can join the club: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Myers, the Angels' starting catcher, suffered cartilage damage to his 
left knee and was sidelined two months. He has sat out the last two games 
because of a bruised right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bullpen catcher Mick Billmeyer suffered a broken arm while warming up John 
Dopson and sat out two months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jorge Fabregas, considered the Angels' best defensive catcher, inexplicably 
lost his skills and was sent to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chris Turner, kept on the roster because of his hitting, batted .138 
through June, then was demoted to the minors. He returned five days later when 
Allanson was placed on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been a brutal year," Myers said. "It can only get better. I mean, 
it can't get worse, can it?" BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Salomon Torres, the San Francisco Giants' struggling rookie right-hander, was 
optioned to triple-A Phoenix to make room for Mark Portugal, who was activated 
from the disabled list.

 The 22-year-old Torres (2-8) had lost six consecutive starts and had lasted 
only 3 1/3 innings in his last start, giving up six runs and walking five. 
Frustrated by his performances, Torres left the Giants on June 19 without 
permission.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ANGRY BENES PITCHES ONE-HITTER FOR PADRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andy Benes pitched the first one-hitter of his career and matched his career 
high with 13 strikeouts in beating the New York Mets, 7-0, Sunday at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Padre right-hander was angry. 
</P>
<P>
 It had nothing to do with Rico Brogna, who stopped Benes' bid for the first 
no-hitter in the Padres' 26-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Benes was angry at Padre General Manager Randy Smith, who was quoted 
in Baseball America as saying that Benes might end up as the Padres' No. 3 
starter in the future because of the way Andy Ashby and Joe Hamilton have been 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very motivated going into the game," Benes said. "I guess my motivation 
is to be the best No. 3 starter wherever I'm playing a year and a half from now 
and show people that I'm in shape, I can finish a game, I have good stuff and 
can get people out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see what happens a year and a half from now. We'll see if anybody wants 
a 240-inning-a-year third starter." 
</P>
<P>
 Benes (6-9), besides winning his fourth consecutive decision, also hit a 
three-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 He held the Mets hitless through seven innings before Brogna doubled to center 
leading off the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 17th one-hitter in Padre history. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 12, Florida 6 -- Fred McGriff, chosen as an All-Star reserve, hit his 
22nd home run of the season and 250th of his career to help the Braves win at 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff had five runs batted in, and Dave Justice, picked as an All-Star 
starter, had two. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff was 10 for 18 in the four-game series with three homers and nine RBIs. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Glavine (9-7) gave up six runs in 6 2/3 innings to earn his first victory 
over the Marlins in three decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 8, Montreal 5 -- A foul popup that wasn't caught gave Mark 
Carreon the break he and the Giants needed at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 With two men on in the fifth and the Giants trailing, Expo first baseman Larry 
Walker lost the ball in the sun, keeping Carreon alive at the plate with a 1-1 
count. He sent the next pitch from Gil Heredia into the left field bleachers 
for a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 12, Chicago 6 -- Craig Biggio had four hits, including a homer and two 
doubles, and Greg Swindell broke a five-game losing streak as the Astros beat 
the Cubs at Houston for their fourth victory in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Caminiti hit two homers and rookie James Mouton also homered for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Caminiti's second homer was an inside-the-park, three-run shot down the right 
field line in the eighth that caromed past right fielder Sammy Sosa. It gave 
the Astros a 12-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 5, St. Louis 2 -- Mike Kingery had two doubles, drove in a run and 
made a home-run saving catch for the Rockies at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingery has been filling in for Ellis Burks since Burks sprained his wrist on 
May 17. Burks was hitting .354 at the time, but Kingery is batting .346 and has 
13 doubles and 10 RBIs in his last 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- Tony Fernandez, moved from third to shortstop so 
Barry Larkin could take the day off, hit a two-run homer and a double to lead 
the Reds at Pittsburgh and finish off a .611 weekend (11 for 18) to raise his 
season average against the Pirates to .500. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Branson, starting at second in place of Bret Boone, who also got the day 
off, hit a two-run homer in the fourth to give the Reds a 3-2 lead.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; MANDELLA'S PAIN SOOTHED BY CORRAZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Richard Mandella's strategy is clear. To compensate for the big one 
that got away, he is going to win the little ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup eluded the trainer Saturday when Arcangues ran 
last. The winner, Slew Of Damascus, beat Arcangues by more than 10 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 But later on the Gold Cup card at Hollywood Park, Mandella's Chilean sprinter, 
Memo, won the $107,400 Triple Bend Handicap. And Sunday, longshot Corrazona won 
the $323,400 Beverly Hills Handicap,  
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever I'm doing with Memo and Corrazona, I must not be doing the same 
thing with the other horse," Mandella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrazona, carrying 119 pounds, five less than the Eclipse Award-winning 
co-high weights, Hollywood Wildcat and Flawlessly, won by a neck under Gary 
Stevens, who also rode Slew Of Damascus to victory in the Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Said trainer Charlie Whittingham, hoping to win the Beverly Hills for the 
third consecutive year with Flawlessly: "(Flawlessly) was the best horse today. 
The best horse easy. But she couldn't get through, so what are you going to do? 
That's horse racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly, the champion female turf horse the last two years, was in fourth 
place most of the way, never far back in the 1 1/8-mile race. But leaving the 
far turn the 6-year-old mare's jockey, Chris McCarron, found himself on the 
rail, trapped by one horse on the outside and behind a wall of three others 
directly in front. 
</P>
<P>
 Belatedly, McCarron found room on the fence in the final sixteenth of a mile. 
"It was just one of those unlucky trips," McCarron said. "We never got out. I 
rode her poorly last time, but I just didn't have any luck this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat, champion 3-year-old filly last year, had problems at the 
start Sunday and was next to last for the first half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "(An assistant starter) grabbed her in the gate to settle her and then she 
stayed in there too long," jockey Eddie Delahoussaye said. "Then she broke 
flat-footed and got squeezed. But at the head of the stretch, I still thought I 
was going to win it. She just got a little tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of her first two U.S. starts, Corrazona was timed in 1:47 2/5, 
two-fifths of a second slower than Flawlessly's times the last two years. 
Corrazona, who had a record of three victories in eight starts in France, paid 
$16 and earned $188,400. 
</P>
<P>
 In France, Corrazona had perhaps been running poorly last year because of 
pulmonary bleeding, which can't be treated with race-day medication under 
European rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I get her because of that?" Mandella said. "I didn't ask why. When those 
people want to send me a horse, I just make sure the door is open." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Track chairman R.D. Hubbard was pleased with the opening of the $25-million 
Hollywood Casino on Friday night, but on Saturday horse attendance and betting 
were off considerably compared to recent Gold Cup days. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's on-track attendance of 17,500 was more than 7,000 less than the 
crowd for the Gold Cup last year. Overall, Saturday's attendance was 36,907, 
which was a drop of about 30% from last year's 50,053. The total Gold Cup 
handle was $12 million in 1993 and $10.7 million Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 30 betting windows in the casino, the first such facility to 
co-exist with a track in the United States. Hubbard said that $165,000 was bet 
on horses there Friday night; the total was $154,708 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opening-day attendance in the casino was more than 12,000," Hubbard said. "So 
that means that with the 20,000 at the track, we had more than 32,000 people 
exposed to thoroughbred racing. We were encouraged at the play the horses 
received from the card players, which came despite the crowded conditions 
caused by opening night. The sport is becoming more popular as Friday-night 
racing continues, and it appears that the casino is going to accelerate that 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Corey Nakatani gave for riding Fanmore instead of Slew Of Damascus 
in the Gold Cup was the chance to continue riding top horses for trainer Bobby 
Frankel. Nakatani settled for a $15,000 payday instead of $41,250 when Slew Of 
Damascus beat Fanmore by three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Nakatani was at Arlington International, where he rode favored 
Eagle Eyed to victory for Frankel in the $300,000 Arlington Classic. Eagle 
Eyed, who was 8-5 in betting at Hollywood Park and 9-5 at Arlington, had 
previously won stakes at Santa Anita and Golden Gate Fields under Nakatani. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat and Flawlessly probably will resume their rivalry in the 
Ramona Handicap at Del Mar on Aug. 6. Corrazona might show up for that race, 
too, although Richard Mandella is more certain about the Beverly D at Arlington 
on Aug. 27. . . . Holy Bull, the East's top 3-year-old, won by 6 3/4 lengths 
over Twining in Sunday's Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park, but trainer Wayne Lukas 
is still aiming Preakness-Belmont winner Tabasco Cat toward a showdown in the 
Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 20. Both colts are expected to run one more time 
before that meeting, Holy Bull at Monmouth Park and Tabasco Cat at Saratoga. . 
. . Semillon, who has won three in a row since arriving at Mike Mitchell's 
barn, is the 5-2 morning-line favorite in today's American Handicap, with Gary 
Stevens riding.

 Paige Gordon, who represented Canada in the 1992 Olympics, finished in first 
place in the senior women's three-meter competition Sunday at the Southern 
California Diving Invitational at Marguerite Swimming and Diving Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, 21, representing the Vancouver Aquatic Centre, finished the day 
strong, scoring 444.25 points.But Mission Viejo Nadadores' Sandy Zubrin also 
was impressive, finishing second with 435.75 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nadadores' Summer Brown, who was first in the competition Friday and 
Saturday, was third with 426.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Zubrin, who recently was third in platform diving at the Four Nations Meet in 
Tianjin, China, and 11th in the China Open, expects stiff competition from 
Gordon and Eileen Richetelli, who won the women's competition at the 1991 Pan

BULLFROGS' JUDSON FINDS THE NET, BEATS OAKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Bullfrogs' 9-6 victory over Oakland on Sunday, the crowd of 9,221 at 
The Pond of Anaheim watched the birth of a new hero and villain. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Rick Judson scored his first goal as a Bullfrog, breaking a 6-6 tie 
with 3 minutes 23 seconds remaining, then added two more goals in the next 2:42 
to ensure the Roller Hockey International victory for the Bullfrogs (9-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim captain Kevin Kerr had a goal and three assists and Victor Gervais had 
four assists and two goals, including one that tied the score, 6-6, with 6:10 
left.  
</P>
<P>
 The partisan crowd that cheered for Gervais and Judson, enthusiastically booed 
Oakland forward Doug Lawrence, who had a goal and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim fans remembered Lawrence's scrappy play in last season's championship 
series, and he didn't back down again as he and Kerr exchanged words and were 
separated by officials and players at the game's conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skates (2-8) trailed, 5-1, midway through the third quarter before 
responding with five consecutive goals, starting with Lawrence's score with 
5:47 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After two third-quarter power-play goals by Dave Doucette, Sylvain Naud scored 
on the power play with 9:57 remaining and Mike Robertson scored on a breakaway 
27 seconds later to give the Skates a 6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give Oakland credit because they played well and scored some power-play 
goals," Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier said. "But I really believe the referees 
took us out of this game by calling unnecessary penalties against us. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our player is high-sticking, I expect that to be called. But there were 
lots of interference, holding, and tripping penalties that weren't called (on 
Oakland). 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certainly walking a tightrope. Sometimes, we get ourselves into 
trouble but tonight . . . I really don't know how I would have reacted if we 
had lost this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Sonier's team, Gervais stepped up his play. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gervais scored the tying goal, referees whistled Oakland's Howie 
Rosenblatt for high-sticking. The Bullfrogs cashed in the power-play 
opportunity when Judson scored off assists from Kerr and Gervais. Gervais also 
assisted on Judson's next goals, the final one an empty-netter with 41.9 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrog goalie Chris Gordon made 24 saves, and his teammates outshot Oakland, 
46-30. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching from the bench was Gordon's teammate, goalie Rob Laurie, the 
Bullfrogs' lone representative for the RHI All-Star game July 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie's night off Sunday was well deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 He faced 70 shots and made a league-record 64 saves Saturday in the Bullfrogs' 
9-6 victory over San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Humphrey of St. Louis set the previous mark, making 61 saves June 26 in 
a 7-6 shootout-loss to Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
 "The 70 shots didn't bother me," Sonier said. "It was a weird game. We were 
asleep and they were asleep, too, we just woke up before they did." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bullfrogs woke up just in time again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN will broadcast live the inaugural RHI All-Star game in Vancouver, July 9 
at 7:30 p.m. Bullfrog Coach Grant Sonier will join Buffalo's Chris McSorley as 
a head coach in the game. Last season, Sonier served as an assistant to 
McSorley, the RHI coach of the year who led the Bullfrogs to the league title. 
. . . The Bullfrogs' Brad McCaughey, a player-assistant coach, donned a coat 
and tie instead of a uniform Sunday, joining Sonier behind the bench. 
McCaughey, who had a team-leading 19 points, nine goals and 10 assists heading 
into Sunday's game, suffered a mild concussion in the Bullfrogs' 9-6 victory 
over San Diego on Saturday. . . . Defenseman Yuri Krivokhija, still nursing a 
shoulder injury, should return to the lineup July 10 when the Bullfrogs play 
San Jose at home.

BREAKING AWAY; VENTURA COUNTY STRUGGLED FOR ITS FREEDOM, WON IN 1872 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between munching on hot dogs and gazing at fireworks, most Ventura County 
residents will pause today with other Americans to remember their nation's 
fight for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as usual, there won't be much talk about another historic struggle for 
freedom a lot closer to home -- a battle that made this county what it is 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the revolutionary fight for Ventura County's own independence from 
Santa Barbara County -- admittedly obscure as fights for freedom go, but a 
fight for freedom nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest about it, even the descendants of the key players in Ventura 
County's break from Santa Barbara County don't seem to have much emotional 
involvement in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The details are a little sketchy -- not quite the stuff of legend. Historians 
agree, however, that just as with the American rebels, taxes had something to 
do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big issue for the 3,500 Ventura County residents back in 1872 was the 
desire for local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for all of them, however. Ventura County had its own Tories, those who 
thought that the county was better staying with Santa Barbara because it looked 
to be an easier path. 
</P>
<P>
 But William Dewey Hobson -- who was sort of our George Washington -- wasn't 
the kind of man to take orders from far away, even if Santa Barbara was going 
to end up with its own Nordstrom a century later. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson wasn't the first Ventura County leader to try to break away from Santa 
Barbara County. But he was the man who finally got the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment to separate Ventura from Santa Barbara County began to grow in the 
late 1860s. It was spurred when large Mexican-owned ranchos were subdivided and 
offered for sale to small farmers and fruit growers in the Ventura area. 
</P>
<P>
 That started a mini-population boom, as immigrants from the East and South 
came in search of cheap land and relief from the Civil War. Business in the 
little township of San Buenaventura also began to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Geographic obstacles were also a consideration. There were no easy routes from 
Ventura to Santa Barbara. Travelers in horse-drawn carriages had to brave the 
Rincon at low tide to make the four-hour trip to the county seat in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the discovery of oil in fields near Santa Paula and Ventura 
spurred the local residents' desire to keep money and taxes circulating locally 
-- an idea that didn't sit well with the bureaucrats in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new county had an assessed valuation of $1.2 million, an amount 
the Santa Barbara County tax collector did not want to lose, historian Yda 
Addis Storke wrote in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
 So Santa Barbara County had its guard up in 1869 when Ventura's Angel G. 
Escandon was elected to the state Assembly and began pushing a bill for a 
separate Ventura County. Escandon's bill was defeated. But the revolution had 
formally begun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that everybody in the county was exactly thrilled with breaking away 
from Santa Barbara. In fact, one key opponent of Escandon's bill was Ventura 
County's Thomas R. Bard. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Bard's opposition stemmed from the fact that he was a Santa Barbara 
County supervisor as well as a resident of Port Hueneme. To this day, however, 
Bard's descendants say they do not know why the family pioneer, who went on to 
represent California in the U. S. Senate, turned Tory at the crucial moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't really discussed when we were growing up," said Joanna Bard Newton, 
76, Thomas R. Bard's granddaughter. "He was the Tory in the story, yes. But 
what his motivation was, I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Tories or no Tories, however, Ventura County's revolutionary spirit wasn't so 
easily extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second attempt at gaining independence, Ventura turned to Hobson, a 
prominent businessman with connections in Sacramento. Hobson had lived in 
Sacramento for several years, running a well-known hotel, before settling in 
Ventura in 1857. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were many weeks of acrimonious debate, many hot political fights, 
preceding the cutoff of Ventura County from the parent county of Santa 
Barbara," one historian wrote. "The mother county did not want the child to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hobson proved so skillful at guiding the separation bill through the 
Assembly and later the Senate that it passed with only one dissenting vote on 
March 22, 1872. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent an entire winter in Sacramento coaxing votes out of the state 
Legislature. It wasn't exactly Valley Forge. But it will have to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The law establishing a separate Ventura County officially took effect Jan. 1, 
1873. 
</P>
<P>
 When news of the separation reached Ventura, "great bonfires were lit up in 
various parts of town, and with the assistance of barrels of fluid petroleum, 
the heavens were illuminated with garish light," according to the Santa Barbara 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a general and promiscuous jollification, lasting away into the 
night," the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
 For his role, historians dubbed Hobson the Father of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Haley, a great-granddaughter of Hobson, said she is proud of his 
image as Ventura County's George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you think it would be insane if you lived near Piru and had to go by 
horse all the way to Santa Barbara to file a paper?" said Haley, who lives in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did what needed to be done. It was a very good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 On that point, historians agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an important milestone," said Charles Johnson, librarian at the 
Ventura County Museum of History and Art. "There was already an identity here, 
separate from Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Ventura County was free to take action without first 
consulting the mother county, Johnson said. And even Santa Barbara County 
seemed to see the wisdom of the split. According to an editorial of the era, 
Santa Barbara's last wish was that the "healthy brat" would never grow up to 
trash its "old mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Fat chance. More than a century later, there's still a rivalry between the two 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn is just one official who takes the 
view that Santa Barbara County looks down its nose at its only begotten child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they tend to sling mud at us," Flynn said. "And they still treat us 
as a child, by the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever Ventura County happens to share a political district with Santa 
Barbara County, he said, organizers from the north swoop down and boss campaign 
workers in Ventura County, telling them exactly how to run the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, said Flynn, who was born in Ventura County but grew up in Santa Barbara 
County, he would not mind sparking a counterrevolution seeking to reunite 
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will issue an invitation to the Santa Barbara Board of Supervisors to 
initiate a process to bring us back together," he said. "They need our help, 
our direction, our political talent." 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of that happening, of course, is about the same as the United 
States rejoining England. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Flynn jokes about rejoining Santa Barbara County, most local 
politicians view the split as a move that was definitely for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly was a good deal for me," said Sheriff Larry Carpenter, the 27th 
elected sheriff since the county's formation. "I got a job out of it."

STREET SMART: TRAFFIC SIGNAL DUE THIS WEEK NEAR MOBILE-HOME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We live in the Buenaventura Mobile Home Estates, and the lack of a stop light 
on a nearby road is very dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is at the intersection of Darling Road and Wells Road, also known 
as California 118. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic is so heavy on Wells Road that it is almost impossible to get onto it 
from Darling. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nearly 300 coaches in this park, and many of us agree on the need 
for a signal. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the construction on the roadway and the nearby Saticoy Bridge, are 
there any plans to install a signal at this intersection? 
</P>
<P>
 Herman and Clara Rudin 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Good news: Caltrans is installing a traffic signal at Darling and Wells this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of calls from people who are concerned about this 
intersection," said Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani. "We agree that it is 
very dangerous, and we think this signal will improve conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 A second signal will be installed at nearby Citrus Drive, north of the Santa 
Paula Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the signals are installed, Lalani says, Caltrans and the city of Ventura 
will synchronize the lights all the way from Telegraph Road to Nardo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I've been commuting between Ventura and Camarillo for some time and am unhappy 
with the slowdown going north on the Ventura Freeway where it narrows from 
three to two lanes at Vineyard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Every night when I go home, I end up in a backup that sometimes stretches for 
two to three miles. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a relatively simple solution to this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans could close the northbound on-ramp from California 1 where it merges 
with the northbound Ventura Freeway, and instead put in a third freeway lane 
going north. 
</P>
<P>
 There doesn't seem to be much traffic coming from the California 1 on-ramp 
anyway, and drivers could use the Vineyard on-ramp instead. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be an easy way to solve the slowdown problem. 
</P>
<P>
 How about it? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Probst 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is all too aware of the problem you write about, and fixing it is at 
the top of the agency's list of road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 However, shutting down the California 1 on-ramp is not quite what Caltrans has 
in mind, Traffic Engineer Ali Peykanu says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have examined all the options in this area very carefully," Peykanu said. 
"Closing Route 1 might be good for some drivers, but it would cause a lot of 
problems for others." 
</P>
<P>
 On its current schedule, in 1996, Caltrans is planning to begin a 
$57.6-million project to widen the Ventura Freeway to four lanes in each 
direction from Vineyard Avenue to Johnson Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I resent a traffic signal on Lynn Road in Thousand Oaks that is red more often 
than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal is between Hillcrest Drive and the eastbound Ventura Freeway ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Its purpose seems to be to help cars turning south onto Lynn from the 
westbound Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mind stopping when there are cars actually making the turn, but more 
often than not, there are no cars turning, and I have to wait for no apparent 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be possible for the city to install a sensor so that the signal would 
only change when cars are actually present? 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to make more sense than having the signal automatically turn red 
when there are no cars in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrine Gross 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It may be possible to alter the signal to make it traffic-sensitive, a state 
Department of Transportation spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency must first check out the problem to make sure that installing a 
sensor would not trigger other traffic tangles nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Thousand Oaks Assistant Traffic Engineer Roy Meyers says the city 
would consider picking up half the cost if Caltrans agrees to install a new 
trigger device. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like it would be a good idea to have sensors there," Meyers said. 
"It would help traffic flow more smoothly." CROSSWALK UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to concerns of parents and teachers at Madera School in Simi 
Valley, the City Council has approved the installation of a traffic signal at 
Royal Avenue and Vaquero Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal is scheduled to be installed by the time children return to classes 
in the fall.

ANTI-DRUG PROJECT PUTS EMPHASIS ON POSITIVE; CAMARILLO: AREA HOUSING AUTHORITY 
IS USING FUN AND GAMES THIS SUMMER TO TEACH 200 AT-RISK KIDS COOPERATION AND 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marilyn Berwick knows that 10-year-old Linda Garcia doesn't want to hear a 
lecture -- especially not on a glorious summer afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But offer her a free pool pass or a trip to Knott's Berry Farm and she just 
might pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 So Berwick, a program director at the Area Housing Authority, has designed a 
summer full of fun and games to teach 200 low-income kids to steer clear of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on a $35,500 federal grant, Berwick has set up recreation programs at 
public housing complexes in Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Ojai. Instead of 
boring kids with a "Just say no" message, she teaches them to say yes -- yes to 
cooperation, responsibility and good, clean fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids get the 'Say no to drugs' message everywhere, but it's not enough 
-- we have to give them alternatives," Berwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent housing authority study found that residents of the agency's Ventura 
County complexes have fewer drug and alcohol problems than public-housing 
tenants in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, kids in Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Ojai witness their share of 
substance abuse. And those living in the low-income housing complexes are 
especially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, there's more visibility (of substance abuse) in these complexes, so 
the kids there become more of a target," said Felipe Santana, a director at the 
county's drug and alcohol abuse prevention center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids in Westlake or in Las Posas Estates also see substance abuse, but 
(abusers) there get treatment quickly and quietly," Santana said. In contrast, 
abusers in public housing complexes may not have the money or access to get 
swift treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, their drug or alcohol problems might linger -- making the problem 
more visible to low-income kids. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep children from succumbing to these pressures, Berwick has hired youth 
counselors to act as mentors, buddies and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these kids are really at risk," Berwick said. "We don't want to wait 
until a problem exists and we're putting out fires." 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the housing authority's summer programs contain stark anti-drug 
messages. For example, counselors might don masks and ask the children to talk 
about the different faces that substance abusers wear as sobriety is 
transformed into intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
 More often, however, the activities are simply designed to build kids' 
self-confidence and teach them teamwork. From rope climbing to kayaking to 
simply kicking around a soccer ball, the counselors emphasize fun. 
</P>
<P>
 And Linda Garcia loves it. 
</P>
<P>
 She gets to swim for free, play with counselors at the Camarillo Boys & Girls 
Club and even go on excursions planned for later in the summer. She also gets 
to boss other kids around, just a little, as she works through her morning 
chores of sweeping the concrete courtyard at her Ellis Terrace apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun 'cause you get to go swimming for free," Linda said after urging 
other kids to help her pick up litter on a recent Monday morning. "If you do 
your cleaning, you get a pool pass and it's yours, and you can do whatever you 
want with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Older residents also appreciate the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be a lot of fussing and fighting around here," said Savanah 
French, a mother of three who has lived at Ellis Terrace for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Mondays, I used to walk out of my apartment and then walk right back in 
because the kids would have dropped candy wrappers and trash everywhere," 
French said. "Now, they're monitoring themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Ellis Terrace, like all Area Housing Authority tenants, must meet 
strict income guidelines: A family of four may earn no more than $28,950 a 
year. Since they pay 30% of their income for rent, most residents have little 
left over to spend on recreation. 
</P>

 At the Leggett Court apartments in Thousand Oaks, Debbie Schrader said she 
could not afford to send her 11-year-old twins to summer camp. Even the least 
expensive program run by Conejo Recreation and Park District costs about $30 
per child, she said, and "in a lump-sum shot, that's a little much." 
</P>
<P>
 Since most of the other families in Leggett Court are in the same fix, several 
dozen kids used to spend summers doing "anything and everything they shouldn't 
have," Schrader said. "There was nothing to keep them occupied." 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the federal drug elimination grant, recreation counselors come to 
Leggett Court twice a week to set up basketball games, arts and crafts, and 
sweaty soccer matches. 
</P>
<P>
 As he plays with the Leggett Court kids, counselor Way Tieu tries to nudge his 
rowdy charges toward decorum. Whistle around his neck, he reminds them not to 
call each other "stupid," not to hog the equipment, not to leave crumpled Coke 
cans on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Swaggering mightily, 11-year-old Kellen Roland said he understands why Tieu 
feels the need to instill discipline. Not for him, but for the other kids 
participating in the summer camp program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll teach them manners -- not necessarily table manners, but 
how-to-cooperate and not-get-mad manners," Kellen said, bouncing along the 
sidewalk in baggy shorts and a floppy, striped shirt. "Eventually, kids will 
get the picture: They come and listen and be nice, or they don't come at all." 
</P>
<P>
 As for himself, Kellen said, "I'm pretty cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
 But after a moment of self-reflection, he admitted that he, too, could use 
some guidance. "If someone gets in my face," he said with all the menace he 
could muster, "I'll knock them out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Area Housing Authority programs aim to encourage Kellen's mature side 
while helping him control his bluster. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Berwick: "If we can get them out to try positive activities, if we can 
develop their social skills and motivation, we have a better chance of 
redirecting these kids."

OJAI PILOT AND DAUGHTER, 10, ARE KILLED IN PLANE CRASH; AVIATION: CESSNA 
PLUNGES TO GROUND JUST AFTER TAKEOFF FROM SANTA PAULA AIRPORT, THE AREA'S SIXTH 
FATAL WRECK IN FOUR YEARS. MECHANICAL FAILURE IS SUSPECTED.

 An Ojai pilot and his 10-year-old daughter were killed early Sunday when their 
small plane crashed and burned in a dense thicket of brush just west of Santa 
Paula Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 John Forrest Lires, 44, took flight in his blue and yellow Cessna with his 
younger daughter, Erin, a blossoming child actress, just minutes before the 
plane experienced engine trouble, authorities and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took off from Santa Paula Airport and, about two minutes later, it came 
down," Senior Deputy Coroner Dale Zentzis said. "They were killed on impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The single-propeller Cessna 195 plunged to the ground near the end of Shell 
Road, a narrow dirt road that runs along the north side of the Santa Clara 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters extinguished a small brush fire -- about one-tenth of an acre -- 
before discovering the pilot's body and then finding the charred body of the 
girl, said Sandi Wells of the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth fatal air crash in four years near the airport, which has no 
control tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told investigators that the plane appeared to have mechanical 
problems moments before it slammed into the brush just north of the mostly dry 
river about 8:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up right over the top of those trees and it looked like it was going 
to make a loop in the air," said Bill Dujardin, a security guard at an auto 
parts salvage center off Mission Rock Road outside Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then all of the sudden it kind of spun a little bit and, when it straightened 
up, the motor went 'boom' and it hit the ground," Dujardin said. "It was all a 
matter of five or six seconds and it was all over with." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County sheriff's and fire departments, Santa Paula police, the 
Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board 
dispatched investigators to the crash site Sunday to determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Lires, who enjoyed running and other sports, is survived by his wife, Theresa, 
and another daughter, Windy, 13, coroner's officials said. He worked as an 
electrician at Ventura-based Taft Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
 He owned the antique plane in partnership with John Dolan, also of Ojai. 
Neighbor and family friend Jody Kasch said Lires and Dolan had recently 
examined the craft thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the most conscientious pilot," said Kasch, adding that Lires had been 
flying for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lires and his daughter were planning a para-sailing trip Sunday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin, in addition to her budding acting career, was a straight-A student at 
Summit School and an accomplished horse rider. In addition to roles in local 
theatrical productions, she has appeared on such television shows as "Quantum 
Leap" and "Married With Children." She recently completed work on a television 
commercial, Kasch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency call was received at 8:17 a.m., but it took investigators 
several minutes to make their way through oil fields and citrus groves to get 
to the scene, authorities said. A small brush fire was burning in the thicket 
when they arrived, and the two victims already were dead, coroner's officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real remote location," Wells said. "It was very difficult to find." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that the plane was not equipped with the instruments 
required to navigate in inclement weather, and that Lires was not properly 
licensed to fly in thick fog, such as that which clung to the coastline for 
much of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in conditions over his head," said Cmdr. Mark Hanson of the Santa 
Paula Police Department, which provided mutual aid to lead investigators. "The 
airplane was not equipped with all the necessary equipment to legally comply 
with all of the flight rules." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal accident occurred just two weeks after an experimental ultra-light 
aircraft dropped from the sky shortly after takeoff June 20. Pilot Frank Perry, 
72, of Camarillo was killed instantly in that crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other fatal crashes have occurred in the past several years at or near 
Santa Paula Airport, a private airfield built by local ranchers in 1930. The 
tiny airport operates without a control tower because it has no commercial 
traffic that would require one. 
</P>
<P>
 Lires' Cessna 195 crashed about 15 feet from a series of crude oil and natural 
gas pipes leased by Crimson Resource Management of Denver, which has operated 
the above-ground pipelines for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they would have hit the lines, it would have been a lot worse," employee 
Dave Gangl said as he surveyed the wreckage.

STREET SMART: LYNN ROAD TRAFFIC LIGHT IS BLAMED FOR NEEDLESS WAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I resent a traffic signal on Lynn Road in Thousand Oaks that is red more often 
than necessary. The signal is between Hillcrest Drive and the eastbound Ventura 
Freeway ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Its purpose seems to be to help cars turning south onto Lynn from the 
westbound Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mind stopping when there are cars actually making the turn, but more 
often than not, there are no cars turning, and I have to wait for no apparent 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be possible for the city to install a sensor so that the signal would 
only change when cars are actually present? 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to make more sense than having the signal automatically turn red 
when there are no cars in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrine Gross 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It may be possible to alter the signal to make it traffic-sensitive, a state 
Department of Transportation spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency must first check out the problem to make sure that installing a 
sensor would not trigger other traffic tangles nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Thousand Oaks Assistant Traffic Engineer Roy Meyers says the city 
would consider picking up half the cost if Caltrans agrees to install a new 
trigger device. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like it would be a good idea to have sensors there," Meyers said. 
"It would help traffic flow more smoothly." 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We live in the Buenaventura Mobile Home Estates, and the lack of a stop light 
on a nearby road is very dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is at the intersection of Darling Road and Wells Road, also known 
as California 118. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic is so heavy on Wells Road that it is almost impossible to get onto it 
from Darling. There are nearly 300 coaches in this park, and many of us agree 
on the need for a signal. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the construction on the roadway and the nearby Saticoy Bridge, are 
there any plans to install a signal at this intersection? 
</P>
<P>
 Herman and Clara Rudin 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Good news: Caltrans is installing a traffic signal at Darling and Wells this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of calls from people who are concerned about this 
intersection," said Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani. "We agree that it is 
very dangerous, and we think this signal will improve conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 A second signal will be installed at nearby Citrus Drive, north of the Santa 
Paula Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the signals are installed, Lalani says, Caltrans and the city of Ventura 
will synchronize the lights all the way from Telegraph Road to Nardo Street. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I've been commuting between Ventura and Camarillo for some time and am unhappy 
with the slowdown going north on the Ventura Freeway where it narrows from 
three to two lanes at Vineyard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Every night when I go home, I end up in a backup that sometimes stretches for 
two to three miles. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a relatively simple solution to this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans could close the northbound on-ramp from California 1 where it merges 
with the northbound Ventura Freeway, and instead put in a third freeway lane 
going north. 
</P>
<P>
 There doesn't seem to be much traffic coming from the California 1 on-ramp 
anyway, and drivers could use the Vineyard on-ramp instead. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be an easy way to solve the slowdown problem. 
</P>
<P>
 How about it? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Probst 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is all too aware of the problem you write about, and fixing it is at 
the top of the agency's list of road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 However, shutting down the California 1 on-ramp is not quite what Caltrans has 
in mind, Traffic Engineer Ali Peykanu says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have examined all the options in this area very carefully," Peykanu said. 
"Closing Route 1 might be good for some drivers, but it would cause a lot of 
problems for others." 
</P>
<P>
 On its current schedule, in 1996, Caltrans is planning to begin a 
$57.6-million project to widen the Ventura Freeway to four lanes in each 
direction from Vineyard Avenue to Johnson Drive. CROSSWALK UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to concerns of parents and teachers at Madera School in Simi 
Valley, the City Council has approved the installation of a traffic signal at 
Royal Avenue and Vaquero Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal is scheduled to be installed by the time children return to classes 
in the fall.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PROFESSOR IS CHOSEN TO TEACH IN ENGLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stunning image of the white cliffs of Dover burned into Linda Crowl's 
memory as she crossed the English Channel early in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard College business professor had only a short time to visit southern 
England then. But now she will have a year to explore the area as she begins 
the 12-month Fulbright Teachers Exchange Program in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little nervous and apprehensive," she said. "It's something new, and 
going for a year is quite a commitment. I'm leaving everyone I know and 
everything I own. So I'm a little scared, but I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 A chance to swap places with a foreign teacher came when a program application 
crossed her desk a week after the deadline last fall, she said. But she called 
anyway and found that the application period had been extended two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 So Crowl rushed to get her materials in the mail and, six months later, was 
told that she was one of 200 educators across the country accepted from more 
than 2,000 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised," said Crowl, who traveled Europe following her college 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first time I had applied," she said. "I really hadn't given it 
much hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowl, who has taught business at Oxnard College for 14 years, will leave for 
Brighton College of Technology on Aug. 7. It is a vocational institution about 
60 miles south of London. 
</P>
<P>
 She will trade jobs and houses with David Frayne, an English professor of 
business, who will stay in Crowl's Oxnard home with his family during the 
1994-95 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowl and her 14-year-old son, Casey, will live in Frayne's home in Brighton. 
She will teach business courses, travel and tourism, accounting and finance to 
English vocational students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to bring to them information about the United States," she said. 
"There are a lot of misconceptions, especially about California." 
</P>
<P>
 Casey has never been overseas. But he is preparing for what he knows will be 
an enriching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be awesome," said Casey, who would be a 10th-grader at 
Oxnard High School this fall. "I'm really stoked about the whole thing because 
it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and so few kids get the chance." JEFF 
McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CANDIDATE HOPES FOR NAME RECOGNITION

 When he announced plans to run for Thousand Oaks City Council, Michael V. 
Friedman quickly distinguished himself from other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted flat-out that he doesn't expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get my name out there," Friedman said recently. "Then perhaps 
another two or three years down the road, I'll try again." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, Friedman said he intends to run an "old-fashioned, 
hand-shaking" kind of campaign, spending no more than $5,000. And every cent he 
spends will be his own. Friedman has asked any potential backers to contribute 
money to local charities rather than his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 As he talks to voters during the next few months, Friedman said he will focus 
on family issues, such as crossing guards and children's programming at the 
Civic Arts Plaza. He and his wife have two children, a 5-year-old daughter and 
a 3-year-old son, and are expecting a baby in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people of our generation are represented up there (on the 
council)," said Friedman, who has spent all of his 27 years in Thousand Oaks. 
"They've just got a bunch of old fogies up there. I hope to give things a bit 
of a Generation X perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, Friedman described himself as pro-business and anti-red tape, 
but said he would not like to see much more development. "I kind of like it the 
way it is," he said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CENTER RENAMING TO HONOR NANCY REAGAN

<P>
 Hoping to draw attention to their breast cancer detection and treatment 
center, officials at Simi Valley Hospital announced they would rename their 
facility for former First Lady Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley center, formerly known as the Aspen Breast Center, is home to 
a variety of machines designed to provide early detection of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is one of a small number of hospitals in Ventura County that 
perform biopsies on breast cancer patients using a special needle, thereby 
eliminating the need for more invasive surgery, according to Alicia Gonzalez, a 
hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said hospital officials decided to name the center in honor of the 
former First Lady because she has developed strong ties to Simi Valley since 
the Reagan Presidential Library opened there. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she said, "being that Nancy Reagan is a survivor of breast cancer 
herself, we wanted to put her up as an example to other women," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Reagan will attend a private ceremony Thursday to rededicate the center 
in her honor. MATTHEW MOSK

 Thousand Oaks residents interested in learning how to fight fires, use ham 
radios and rescue hard-to-reach victims are invited to join the city's Disaster 
Assistance Response Team, known as DART. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 team members are recruiting new members this summer and hope to begin 
general disaster-preparedness training in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency response experts will teach monthly classes on such subjects as 
disaster psychology and damage assessment. Participants also learn to perform 
first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, DART members also volunteer to help out with special events, 
such as traffic control during the Fourth of July fireworks show and the annual 
Conejo Valley Days. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's meeting, usually at City Hall or the East Valley sheriff's 
station, are held on the third Thursday of each month and are open to the 
public. For information, call Stacy Park in the city manager's office at 
496-8652. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Robert Q. Valles, a 30-year civilian employee of the naval base in Port 
Hueneme, has announced that he will run for a seat on the board of the Oxnard 
Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Valles, whose five children attended Catholic school, said a major theme of 
his campaign will be the involvement of businesses with local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "If industry and business expect a quality student, then they're going to have 
to get involved with the schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valles, 58, said he has spent 13 years working with the high school district 
on a program that brings business and community leaders together with school 
leaders to talk about curriculum and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Valles works as the director of the employment and equal opportunity division 
at the U. S. Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to working with the school district, Valles is a member of the 
Mexican-American Engineer Society and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1954 graduate of Oxnard High School, Valles earned an associate degree from 
Ventura College, a bachelor's degree from UCLA and a degree in business 
administration from the University of LaVerne. JULIE FIELDS

and what residents can do to dispel the lure of drugs and alcohol to the area's 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she will help launch a petition drive to get local parks designated as 
alcohol-free zones. 
</P>
<P>
 She will work to get a survey going on where liquor stores are concentrated 
around the city. If she finds, as she believes, that there are more of them on 
the Avenue, then she and others in the neighborhood plan to lobby City Hall to 
have a moratorium declared on allowing new liquor stores in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Avenue-area activists are going to spend some of the funds on radio 
and television spots and billboards around the community, exhorting residents 
to find healthier alternatives to drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're way stoked," Payan said of the grant from the Ventura County Department 
of Alcohol and Drug Programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant was awarded to the city of Ventura to support programs provided by 
the West Ventura Community Pride Project. The grant will be administered by 
Payan as well as officials from the Boys and Girls Club, local schools and 
other area agencies. CONSTANCE SOMMER

 Authorities on Sunday said they have arrested 20 motorists on suspicion of 
drunk driving since the start of the Fourth of July weekend. They also reported 
two serious accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists were arrested between 6 p.m. Friday and 6 a.m. Sunday, California 
Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one major injury accident that occurred in Westlake on Saturday may 
have been alcohol-related, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Visser, 29, of Thousand Oaks was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving 
after his car collided with one driven by Corey Klein, 16, of Westlake Village, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 4 p.m. at Westlake Boulevard and Potrero Road. 
Visser's passenger, Elise Phillips, received major injuries, authorities said. 
She was listed Sunday in fair condition at Westlake Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser was being held on $5,000 bail at Ventura County Jail on Sunday. He is 
scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In another major injury accident Saturday, a car driving west on California 
126 east of Hopper Canyon Road caused a two-vehicle crash and left the scene, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six people were injured in the head-on collision that occurred about 7:15 
p.m., the CHP said. An older-model white or yellow Honda Civic driving west on 
California 126 swerved into the eastbound lanes, causing the other driver to 
turn sharply to the right to avoid an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Geraze, 43, of Valencia then lost control and her car swerved into the 
westbound lanes and hit a car driven by Robert Urger, 30, of North Hollywood. 
The Honda fled, traveling west on California 126 toward Fillmore, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Santa Paula Hospital and Ventura County Medical Center said 
Sunday that the two drivers and their passengers were all in good or fair 
condition. PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AUTHORITIES CONTINUE SEARCH FOR MAN

<P>
 Ventura County authorities Sunday continued to search for a man who has seven 
outstanding felony warrants and eluded sheriff's deputies last week during a 
foot chase. 
</P>
<P>
 David Matthew Clawson, 21, of St. Charles, Mo., was last seen hiding in a 
cornfield in El Rio, authorities said.He fled after deputies chased him and his 
17-year-old girlfriend, who was later taken into custody and transported back 
to Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's told his girlfriend he's not going to be taken alive," Ventura County 
Sheriff's Detective Charles Harwood said. "We think he's hanging out in the 
Ventura-Oxnard area." 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood said Clawson is a suspected drug dealer who was raised in Ventura, 
although his parents have since moved to St. Charles. Authorities suspect that 
he came to California because he would have a bigger drug clientele. Since 
returning to the area, he has stayed at the Doubletree Hotel in Ventura, the 
Radisson Suite Hotel in Oxnard and the Oxnard Hilton, Harwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clawson left St. Charles on June 27, and authorities there said he is wanted 
in connection with a variety of crimes, including numerous burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's something stolen out of his neighborhood, that's who we suspect," 
St. Charles County Sheriff's Detective Bob Carmody said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmody said it is likely that Missouri authorities will extradite Clawson if 
he is caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they do not know if Clawson is armed. He is 6 feet, 1 inch 
tall, weighs about 175 pounds, has black hair and brown eyes and a scar on his 
chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who sees Clawson should call their local police department. PEGGY Y.

TENNIS / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; WIMBLEDON WAS PREPARED FOR 'PROBLEM FANS,' 
INCLUDING PIERCE 
</P>

 Security has become a major priority at Wimbledon. Tennis stalkers . . . 
obsessive fathers . . . the possibility of terrorism -- they all have 
contributed to the increased presence of police officers and contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
 So skittish are officials about the arrival of so-called "problem fans" that 
photographs of the best-known offenders have been posted within the Wimbledon 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the list is Jim Pierce, father of Mary Pierce. Pierce, known for 
his abusive behavior toward his daughter, is banned from attending WTA Tour 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons still not entirely clear, Mary Pierce, seeded seventh at 
Wimbledon, withdrew before the tournament. Billie Jean King, a former Wimbledon 
champion and HBO broadcaster, suggested that Pierce's departure had more to do 
with her fear of playing on grass than the possibility of Jim Pierce making an 
uninvited appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but posters of Jim Pierce were distributed to Wimbledon security 
guards that read: "This man is banned from the grounds. Stop him from entering 
if possible. However, if sighted he must not be challenged but control must be 
informed." 
</P>
<P>
 As for King's theory that Mary Pierce ducked Wimbledon, not everyone agreed 
with the assessment. Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker recently had dinner 
with Pierce. The two discussed the situation, specifically Jim Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly think that she had a bit of a problem with her father, and you 
know, she is a very good tennis player obviously," Becker said. "She doesn't 
have to fear nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce defeated Steffi Graf at the French Open and has been hailed as the 
newest star on a tour in need of fresh faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a new life for her, and you know, with having a father like that, 
what could she do really?" Becker said. "You know, everything has been so fast 
now. In about four weeks, you know, she is supposed to save the women's game 
and I think she needs time to think about the whole picture, what she wants to 
do in tennis and then she is going to be back strong." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a mostly uneventful first-round 6-4, 6-3 loss to Larisa Neiland, American 
Katrina Adams was summoned to a postmatch news conference by curious British 
tabloid reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 After an obligatory question about Adams' play, the reporters zeroed in on the 
controversy that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "Your colorful clothing caused a little bit of a stir, I understand, 
on Court Five -- particularly your underwear. Can you tell us about that?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, an underwear expose. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' multicolored tennis undies, called Fancy Pants, were seen early and 
often because of the blustery conditions. If they were noticeable, it was only 
because of the All England Lawn Tennis Club's strict rule regarding 
predominantly white playing wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' tennis pants were pink, green, black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's any consolation to you," the British reporter said, "we all thought 
they were very attractive anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Adams, who was making her seventh appearance at Wimbledon: "Thanks a lot. 
You saw my bottom a lot today, huh? No peeping Toms or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the fashion police found time to criticize the ultra-baggy (by 
tennis standards) shorts worn by Americans Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi has said the shorts were designed at his request, though a Nike 
spokesman reportedly disputed the claim. Nike said Sampras first wanted a 
looser-fitting pair of shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, the baggies weren't much of a hit with the upper crust at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agassi looked an absolute mess," Alan Little, librarian at the Wimbledon 
museum, told the London Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen anyone look so scruffy on a Wimbledon court. I hope this 
doesn't start yet another fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Little has seen every male Wimbledon champion since 1950. He remains no fan of 
Agassi's court-wear tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this rate he could be in long johns next year," he said. 
</P>

<P>
 In an effort to make ATP Tour matches more interesting, the respective Player 
and Tournament Councils recently announced four changes in policy: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spectators, who usually are expected to keep their mouths shut, will be 
allowed "to spontaneously react during a point as long as it is not intended to 
distract players." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The time between points will be reduced from 25 seconds to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fans with seats in the upper reaches of tennis stadiums will be allowed to 
move in and out during points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Microphones will be positioned so conversations between players and 
officials can be heard by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the changes go into effect as early as July 18, but according to Bud 
Collins, a Tennis Hall of Fame inductee who writes for the Boston Globe and 
does analysis for NBC, the ATP Tour could have -- and should have -- done more. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins wanted the ATP Tour to open the men's locker room to reporters. With 
the exception of the U.S. Open, no other tournament allows locker room access 
to journalists -- a given in almost all other major sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The better the access, Collins said, the better chance the average tennis fan 
would learn more about the players on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 That might translate into more interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins also suggested the ATP Tour put a clock on the court ( a la the NBA's 
24-second shot) for the latest time rule change. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The trickle-down effect from Jennifer Capriati's arrest could soon be seen on 
the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a Women's Tennis Council select panel have completed their research 
on age minimums for players and new rules could be instituted by next year. The 
panel's results will be released during the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, players 14 and older are allowed to compete on the tour. But there 
is a movement to increase the limit to 16, maybe even as high as 17 -- partly 
because of reaction from Capriati's April arrest on marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the current minimum-age standard contend that Capriati's situation 
could have been the partial result of her early entrance on the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Billie Jean King, who contributed to the select panel's 
research, are less sure about the effects of increasing the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been many 13- and 14-year-olds, like Steffi Graf and Gabriela 
Sabatini, who have made the adjustment to pro life, but the media deals with 
just the exceptions," King said.

2 KILLED, 6 INJURED IN FREEWAY PILEUP; ACCIDENT: COLLISION SERIES BEGINS WITH 
ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER REAR-ENDING TRUCK AT HIGH SPEED, CHP SAYS. 
</P>

 Two women were killed and six other people injured Sunday in a series of 
collisions on the Santa Ana Freeway that began when an alleged drunk driver 
slammed into the rear of a pickup truck, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead were identified as Elizabeth Newman, 35, of Dominguez Hills and 
Patricia Ann Maglietto, 24, of Studio City.  
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokeswoman Soledad Weaver said the chain of events began shortly after 
3:50 a.m. in the northbound lanes near the Ball Road off-ramp when the driver 
of a Ford Mustang allegedly traveling about 100 m.p.h. rear-ended a Ford pickup 
truck driven by Alfredo Cortez, 51, of Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, identified as Rafael Cruz, 27, of Santa Ana, tried to 
flee on foot but was seized by police, Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after that collision, Newman, Maglietto and Lori Kitagawa, 19, of La 
Palma, who were all in a Honda sedan, crashed into the Mustang. The drivers of 
a Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Thunderbird stopped to assist. 
</P>
<P>
 While the driver of the Thunderbird called 911 from her car phone, the three 
women and the driver of the Camaro stood in the center divider surveying the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that point, Weaver said, that Elisa Ortiz, 28, of Los Angeles, 
driving a Toyota off-road vehicle, slammed into them. Maglietto was killed 
instantly, Weaver said. Newman was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, who is pregnant, was trapped in her vehicle and had to be extracted by 
emergency crews, Weaver said. She was taken to Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo with minor injuries. Weaver said Ortiz was not 
cited pending further investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 Kitagawa and the driver of the Camaro, identified as Justin Saver, were listed 
in serious condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Karen Counsell, 38, 
of Torrance, who was the driver the Thunderbird, suffered minor injuries and 
was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange. The extent of Cortez's injuries were 
not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, who suffered serious injuries, was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana, where he was listed in fair condition and was being held on suspicion of 
drunk driving and misdemeanor hit-and-run, Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Matt Lait contributed to this report.

DEATH STOLE MOM'S CHANCE TO WITNESS SON'S SUCCESS; LOSS: SHE WAS DOUSED WITH 
GAS, SET ON FIRE. HE FINDS SHE STILL GUIDES HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Chris Granier rarely makes a decision without first determining what would 
have pleased his mom. From joining the Navy to buying a car, the 19-year-old 
includes his mother's values and opinions in nearly everything he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I bought my car, I picked out a Saturn because that's the car she had," 
Granier said. "A lot of things I have in my life now are there because they 
remind me of her." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Karin Marie LaBorde, was killed last year when, according to 
police, a La Habra janitor walked into the Tustin company where she worked as a 
bookkeeper, doused her with gasoline, then set her on fire. The suspect, 
Jonathan Daniel D'Arcy, allegedly was angry over a $150 paycheck he claimed was 
owed him by the company. D'Arcy faces trial later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after his mother's death, Granier was forced to move in with a 
friend after his unemployed stepfather was unable to support him and his 
sister. His sister, Renee, was sent to live with relatives in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than a year later, Granier has managed to do more than just 
survive the tragedy -- he has succeeded against great odds, those who know him 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at El Camino Real Continuation High in Placentia, where Granier was a 
graduating senior, picked him as a "student of the year" for both academic 
achievement and service to the community. He had earned a 3.7 grade-point 
average, despite taking a heavy course load to make up for classes he missed at 
Villa Park High School after his mother's death, and was active in student 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was given a commendation during his junior year for talking a man out 
of committing suicide, an act that El Camino Real counselor Linda Henn said was 
just what she would expect from Granier. 
</P>
<P>
 Granier said he was riding his bike in Villa Park when he came across a man 
who was threatening to jump off a bridge. The teen-ager talked to the man for 
about 20 minutes until police arrived. The incident occurred about two months 
after his mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is always thinking of others, always looking for ways to help them," Henn 
said. "He is amazingly sensitive to others and is concerned about how they 
feel. People really respond well to him; they can see his concern is genuine." 
</P>
<P>
 Henn said that despite the magnitude of the loss of his mother, being 
separated from his sister and being forced to find his own home, Granier has 
risen above becoming just a victim of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very grateful for the good things in his life and does not dwell on the 
negative," Henn said. "He never used the situation to manipulate people into 
feeling sorry for him or to get special treatment."  
</P>
<P>
 Most of Granier's teachers and classmates at El Camino Real were not aware of 
his background when he began attending the continuation school last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never would have believed he had undergone such a tragedy," said Glen 
Collard, principal at El Camino Real. "I didn't even know about it until seven 
or eight months after he came here." 
</P>
<P>
 It was while interviewing Granier for the student of the year awards that 
Collard found out how his mother had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "My admiration for Chris shot up 10 notches when I heard that," Collard said. 
"The way he has responded to his mother's murder puts him head and shoulders 
above what you would expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 2, 1993, was the first day of the spring semester at Villa Park High 
School. Granier was new at the school, having spent his freshman and sophomore 
years at Esperanza High School in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just sat down in fifth period when I was called to the office," Granier 
recalled. "I didn't really know anyone so I went there by myself. I was a 
little scared because when I got to the office, I saw the youth counselors from 
my church there. I knew right away it was about my family." 
</P>
<P>
 When Granier's sister arrived, the two were taken outside by the church 
counselors and told that their mother had been in an accident and she was not 
doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Granier begged to see his mom, members of his church who had gathered 
to support the two children were afraid to let him go to the hospital. Finally, 
they drove Granier and his sister to UCI Medical Center, where their mother had 
been taken with severe burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got there my pastor said she had died," Granier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Granier said he does not remember crying when he heard the news. He could only 
think about comforting his sister and his mother's friends who had gathered at 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to take care of everyone," he said. "I thought if I could be there 
for them, I could get through it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a diner in Yorba Linda that he had often visited with his mother, 
Granier said he had no bitterness or anger toward D'Arcy, the man accused in 
his mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgive him because God says we are to forgive," Granier said. "I'm glad 
he's getting help." 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge ruled in February that D'Arcy, who 
authorities say has a history of criminal arrests and violent behavior, was 
competent to stand trial. He is expected to be tried later this year. The 
district attorney's office is seeking the death penalty for the 31-year-old 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Granier credits his church, Evangelical Free Church in Orange, and the family 
he now lives with for giving him the strength to cope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had all these people helping me out and I told myself I'm not going to 
fail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After missing the rest of the school year following his mother's death, 
Granier was seriously behind in the number of credits he needed to graduate. In 
order to graduate on time, he attended school from 7 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. and for 
three hours a night, two nights a week. He also worked as a janitor on weekends 
to help support himself and held several volunteer positions to fulfill the 
school's community service requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Granier, who recently moved to Riverside from Yorba Linda, plans to enter the 
Navy in December and hopes to become a Navy Seal, he said. But he also plans to 
attend college and become a psychologist, another tribute to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before she died, she wanted to start a program (for troubled teens) at our 
church," he said. "I want to be a psychologist so I can do what she wanted to 
do -- help people who are hurting. If I do that, it will be like she is still 
here."

HIGH-FLYING MESSENGER; IT'S ALWAYS A BANNER DAY IN THE AERIAL ADVERTISING

 Doug Stavoe goes to the beach every weekend, but he doesn't have much of a 
tan. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old Detroit native rarely misses a Dodgers or Angels game and he's 
been to every World Cup match at the Rose Bowl -- though he's not a die-hard 
sports fan. He visits Disneyland dozens of times a year and never pays 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
 Stavoe, who runs one of the largest aerial advertising companies in Southern 
California, sees it all from behind dark aviator sunglasses, high above the 
crowds, as he zips along in his two-seater airplane with one arm slung out the 
window and a banner following behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a happy, up, fun kind of business," Stavoe said one recent Saturday as 
he cruised the Orange County coastline towing the smiley-faced banner that 
promotes his own company. "People don't buy it because they have to. It's not 
like health insurance or going to the dentist. People only buy it because they 
want to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be nice being above L.A., being a little removed. You look at it from 
a different perspective. It's healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of jobs he didn't much like, Stavoe started Pacific Drifters 
Corp. eight years ago, and now has some 200 clients. 
</P>
<P>
 They are fast food chains, record companies announcing releases, local clubs 
offering drink specials and random folk who just have something to say. 
Businesses pay about $1,000 for a full day, while personal messages cost $275 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke-rail skywriting -- "when people have a lot of money they've just got to 
spend" -- costs $250 a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done everything from births to deaths," Stavoe said, noting that he 
once flew over Forest Lawn Cemetery with the message: "Thanks for the memories, 
John." 
</P>
<P>
 Stavoe helped Arnold (Schwarzenegger) celebrate Father's Day, congratulated 
Roseanne (Arnold) on her Emmy and sent a message to The Fonz (Henry Winkler) 
from his son. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does have limits. He has refused to drop condoms attached to little 
parachutes onto the beach while flying a safe-sex banner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to get charged for littering," he said with a shrug, gazing 
down at a crowd of thousands surrounding Huntington Beach Pier. "You really 
shouldn't be dropping things out of airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage proposals, like the one Stavoe recently took aloft for Erik Estrada, 
are the most popular. And Stavoe's favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single time it happens, people are so happy," Stavoe said, filling out 
the weekend's agenda with , indicating another soon-to-be couple. "They'll grab 
each other and start smooching. The girls will call me after and they're all 
excited. . . . You get to be part of this person's memory for as long as ever. 
That's really cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the recipient of an airborne proposal refused to answer. Instead, she 
called Stavoe herself and ordered up a "YES YES YES" to be sky-written the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, though, a dejected proposer called the next day reporting 
negative results. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one guy was crushed," Stavoe remembered. "He needed a psychiatrist after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Stavoe's "office" is a rented hangar at the Long Beach Municipal Airport. Red 
canvas letters and numbers, 3 feet wide and 3, 5 or 7 feet tall, hang 
horizontally on wall hooks. The ceiling is draped with old banners: a 
mouth-watering cheese steak from Jack-In-The-Box; logos for Ruby's and the Red 
Onion. 
</P>
<P>
 For decoration, some beer cans from around the world are stacked on a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 The real work is done in the plane -- which Stavoe calls "my girlfriend, my 
baby," though he has a pregnant wife and a 3-year-old daughter at home. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 300-horsepower engine and 36-foot wingspan, the yellow, brown and white 
Cessna 185 is "kind of like a jeep," said Stavoe, who bought it for $62,000 a 
few years back. The plane could hold six passengers, but Stavoe has ripped out 
all but two sheepskin-covered seats, and keeps big pillows and a blanket in 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can throw stuff back there -- skis, people, whatever I need to haul 
around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stavoe, who splits his time between an apartment in Newport Beach and a newly 
purchased ranch in Arizona, learned to fly while in college at Michigan State 
University. After quitting his job as an accountant -- he lasted one year, nine 
days and two hours -- Stavoe considered joining the Air Force, spent some time 
as a flight instructor and even tried aerobatics.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he discovered banners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to start a business and I didn't have a lot of money to risk," 
Stavoe explained. "If I completely fell on my face, I would only lose $5,000 or 
$10,000. That's everything I had." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stavoe hasn't fallen flat. He owns three planes and rents more for busy 
summer weekends. Plus, he has set up a network of banner-fliers in cities 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He also collects extra cash designing and creating flying billboards, such as 
the $2,500, 1,000-square-foot Burger King/Dr. Pepper banner he unveiled on a 
recent weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the message panels, banners have several other parts. In the back, 
black parachute-like netting forms the "tail flags" that create drag so the 
banner does not bunch. On the other side is the "lead pole," carefully weighted 
so the message faces the correct direction.  
</P>
<P>
 Five canvas straps called the "mast assembly" connect the pole to the long 
"tow rope," which has a lasso at one end. 
</P>
<P>
 The trickiest part of the operation is picking up and dropping off the 
banners. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots take off at about 100 m.p.h. and, once off the ground, toss a hook out 
the window. As the planes fly low over two red flags atop 20-foot poles, the 
toe rope suspended between them, the hook grabs the rope. Then the plane shoots 
almost straight up, as the 100-foot rope and banner unfurl. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of cruising the beaches, stadiums and amusement parks, the pilot 
returns to Long Beach, pulling a lever just before landing that allows the 
banner, rope and hook to fall to the ground. If the timing is off, the banner 
ends up in the parking lot or the middle of the street -- with an embarrassed 
pilot chasing behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like dropping a bomb," Stavoe joked. Then, after a perfect drop 
and landing, he added, "Well, put it this way: You don't want it to be like 
dropping a bomb."

TRADING ON THE SIMPSON CASE; COLLECTIBLES: CARDS DEPICTING THE ACCUSED, THE 
VICTIMS AND THE CRIME SCENE ARE HOT ITEMS AT ANAHEIM SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Right there, next to the rare Ty Cobb felt baseball card and the Babe Ruth 
photograph, lay the latest O.J. Simpson trading card. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the display was at a sports memorabilia show here Sunday, this card 
did not show Simpson wearing his Buffalo Bills uniform. Instead, it was the mug 
shot police took when they arrested Simpson last month on suspicion of killing 
his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to that lay other cards showing a dejected Simpson in court, him and 
Nicole in happier times, her driver's license and Goldman's modeling poses. All 
with a logo reading "In Pursuit of Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The set of 10 cards was unveiled Sunday at displays throughout the Anaheim 
Convention Center show that drew hundreds of collectors. The price varied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really sleazy, but if I don't sell it someone else will," said 
Lowell Katz, a Long Beach sports card dealer. "I might as well make money while 
I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Some customers certainly agreed, at least with the first part of his 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shame, shame," said a woman, shaking her head as she passed an array of the 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 David Guisande of D&K Distributors ordered 8,000 packs of the cards from a 
Phoenix firm producing the set, identified on the cards as Interlink News 
Services. They arrived at 10 p.m. Saturday. By 2 p.m. Sunday he had sold 3,000 
packs, most to other distributors, who expect to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all people want, O.J. cards," said Rick Hamiliton, a Minneapolis-based 
dealer at the show. "I've only got 200 sets, so I imagine they'll go pretty 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton has tried selling Simpson's rookie football cards, but added, "That's 
$125. They can buy this set for anywhere from $5 to $15." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Simpson's arrest in connection with the double slayings in Brentwood, 
dealers have reported receiving top dollar for his old cards, signed footballs 
and other collectibles. In addition, a Fleetville, Pa., trading card company 
said it is moving ahead with plans to have Simpson sign 1,000 cards -- under a 
contract signed June 3 -- that will be sold later this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 But the cards featuring players in the Simpson legal case are new. And the 
10-pack is only the beginning -- Guisande said Interlink News Service is 
planning to produce a 50-card set, complete with portraits of Los Angeles Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti, defense lawyer Robert Shapiro and the bloodstained sidewalk 
outside Nicole Simpson's townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The card collecting industry has ventured into current events and popular 
culture before, printing Desert Storm cards during the 1991 war, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Simpson story allows for an unusual convergence of sports, 
entertainment and scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're really doing is giving the public what they want," said Lee Minor, 
who was staffing the D&K Distributors booth. 
</P>
<P>
 But some customers Sunday were not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just exploiting a tragedy," said another show attendee, who described 
himself as one of Simpson's neighbors. "Who knows if he's guilty or innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 For the entrepreneurs in the speculative world of sports cards, however, the 
importance of his guilt or innocence rested on its market impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is found guilty, the price goes up," one noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what happened with Pete Rose," added Troy Deutscher, a Long Beach-based 
distributor. Rose's baseball cards climbed in value after his gambling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 When L.A. Lakers star Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for the 
AIDS virus, his cards sold well for at least a year, Deutscher said. "I'm 
assuming this is going to be hot for a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another card dealer, Derrick (D.J.) Johnson of Buena Park, said he wants to 
sell his Simpson memorabilia as quickly as he can. At Sunday's show at the 
Anaheim Convention Center, Johnson displayed a case full of cards from 
Simpson's Buffalo Bills days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he gets convicted, those cards will drop like a rock," Johnson said. "The 
autographs will shoot up. If he's in jail, how are you going to get his 
autograph?"

2 BUENA PARK OFFICERS SHOOT, KILL ARMED MAN AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Two Buena Park police officers on Sunday shot and killed a man who had led 
them on a short chase after allegedly threatening employees at the Buena Park 
Mall with a handgun, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting marked the second time in less than a week that police in Orange 
County have killed an armed and fleeing suspect. Sunday's shooting occurred 
about 10:30 a.m. in the parking lot of Keno's Restaurant, 2661 W. La Palma Ave. 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man, whose name and age were not released, was apparently living out 
of his car and had parked it at the restaurant the past couple of days, 
restaurant employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was here this morning, blasting his radio, and our general manager had to 
go out there to tell him to shut off the music and chase him off," said Bonnie 
Henderson, the restaurant's assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the restaurant parking lot, the man apparently drove to the 
Buena Park Mall, where employees called authorities to report that he was in 
his car with a gun and threatening them, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The man drove away from the mall, but was quickly spotted by Buena Park patrol 
officers who "attempted to stop him by utilizing overhead lights and sirens," a 
report by Anaheim Police Sgt. Steve Rodig stated. "The suspect failed to 
yield." 
</P>
<P>
 The man drove about a mile to Keno's parking lot and got out of the car with a 
loaded handgun, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Buena Park officers opened fire, hitting the suspect, Rodig said. He was 
treated at the scene and then taken to a hospital, where he died, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the two officers involved in the shooting were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, who did not witness the shooting, said several of the restaurant's 
employees told her they heard about five shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out of the car with a gun and he was headed for our doorway," 
Henderson said, and the employees "thought he was going to come inside."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; EXCITING GAME CAN'T ERASE SADNESS OVER FALLEN STARS; CROWD: 
FANS AT THE ROSE BOWL MATCHUP OF ROMANIA AND ARGENTINA REACT TO THE SLAYING OF 
A COLOMBIAN PLAYER AND THE BANNING OF AN ARGENTINE STAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite the frenzied play in what some called the most exciting game yet of 
World Cup '94, much of the emotional energy was focused on two of soccer's 
fallen heroes Sunday, as Romania scored a 3-2 victory over Argentina at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the cheers, there was shock and sadness: at the murder of Colombian 
defenseman Andres Escobar, shot and killed Saturday in his native city of 
Medellin, apparently in revenge for the accidental goal he scored that 
contributed to his team's loss to the United States at the Rose Bowl, and for 
veteran Argentine star Diego Maradona, banned from the World Cup competition 
last week after failing a drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the saddest thing I've heard about Colombia since I came here five years 
ago," said Nicholas Paez, 30, a Colombian immigrant who now lives here, 
referring to Escobar's violent death. "When I heard the news, I was about to 
cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Although their own team was on the field, Argentine fans among the crowd of 
90,000 at the Rose Bowl found their attention diverted elsewhere -- with 
occasional sightings of Maradona also watching the game from the stands causing 
as much frenzy as the game. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, after spotting him in a section of the stands beneath the press 
box, thousands of fans leaped to their feet and trained their binoculars on the 
soccer idol. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the contest, fans hefted blue and white Argentina banners with the 
words "Viva Maradona!" Another massive banner went so far as to thank 
Maradona's mother for giving birth to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The stocky, black-haired star, once regarded as the world's best soccer player 
and the undisputed leader of the Argentine team, watched his teammates from a 
seat high in the stands, wearing a bright, jungle-print shirt and surrounded by 
a phalanx of security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have your Magic Johnson; we have our Magic Maradona," said Eduardo 
Fevres, 24, of Buenos Aires, who was adorned in a blue and white wig and soccer 
outfit. Down his back streamed a cape made out of Argentina's flag with the 
words "Magic Diego" stenciled on it. 
</P>
<P>
 For Colombians, already disappointed at their team's elimination from the 
World Cup, Escobar's assassination was a particularly bitter pill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really doesn't give Colombia a very good name," said Arturo Villegas, a 
Colombian native who lives here. " A lot of people say that they are going to 
kill someone, but it never happened until now." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, in honor of Escobar, many Colombians taped black slashes over their 
country's emblem on their caps and T-shirts. Some hoisted flags bearing 
Escobar's name crossed out with black tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has ruined the World Cup for us," said Marco Sierra, 35, of Pasadena. 
"It's a tragedy that this happened. Nobody's life is worth a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the absence of Marodona and Escobar, the overwhelmingly 
pro-Argentine crowd managed to stay upbeat, banging drums, shaking tambourines, 
rattling maracas, honking bullhorns and waving banners high in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando Martinoli, 36, of Northridge came with a group of fellow Argentine 
immigrants from the San Fernando Valley, all dressed head to toe in blue and 
white. He brought as a good-luck token the soccer jersey that he wore to the 
'86 World Cup finals in Mexico, which Argentina won. 
</P>
<P>
 The small, badly faded jersey, autographed by the '86 champions, was stained 
and foul-smelling. "I haven't washed it since 1986," Martinoli said, waving it 
over his head. "I brought it for good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Daniel Martinoli, 32, of Northridge, said that everyone was 
disappointed at Maradona's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs or no drugs, he's the best. He can play with one leg," he said. 
"Everybody loses today, because they're not getting to see the best player in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the game Maradona was spotted leaving the stands. The crowd 
chanted "Diego! Diego!" as he walked past, looking straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited to see him," said Emilo Vivot, 10, of Monrovia, as his 
grandmother hugged him excitedly and pointed out the soccer star.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; HIGH-TECH ALLY AIDS U.S. SOCCER TEAM; STRATEGY: ANALYSTS 
WILL USE A REVOLUTIONARY COMPUTER PROGRAM TO ANALYZE BRAZILIAN SQUAD IN TODAY'S 
SECOND-ROUND MATCHUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The U.S. soccer team, a mere infant when compared to some of the giants in the 
world's most popular sport, is using its prowess in the technological world to 
attempt to gain an advantage over its opponents in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will use its new tool, a computer program stored in floppy discs, 
against the powerful Brazilian team when they meet today in the Cup's second 
round in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 The program analyzes every movement of the ball on the field, and coaches will 
use the program to plot a strategy against opposing teams, take advantage of an 
opponent's weaknesses and defend against its offensive strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it's a revolutionary form of analysis," said Steve Sampson, 
the assistant coach of the U.S. team. "To my knowledge, it's never been used in 
any sport." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, used in the impressive victory over Colombia, was created by two 
San Fernando Valley engineers and interpreted by Sampson, 37, a former UCLA and 
University of Santa Clara soccer coach from Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Zvi Friedman, 59, a systems analyst and lifelong soccer enthusiast, and Jon 
Kotas, a co-worker and computer expert, crafted a program that allows them to 
track every movement of the ball in a soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
 With a pair of binoculars, a computer keyboard and mouse, and their patented 
computer code called Scribbler, Kotas and Friedman can sit in the stands or 
press box and enter data that later will be printed out on a chart showing who 
passed the ball to whom, how often, which passes were completed and where on 
the field a player makes his passes or scoring attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 A coach such as Sampson can then study the information, print out a booklet 
that is distributed to the players, and then plan how a particular opponent 
tends to attack or defend. Combined with a videotape of the same match, the 
information comes alive, Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players can look at the information on the bus, on the plane, at the training 
center," Sampson said. "You start to see patterns in the way a team plays, to 
see such things as who a player tends to give the ball to. If we can give our 
players any kind of competitive edge, that's what they really ask of us." 
</P>
<P>
 For players such as starting defender Paul Caligiuri, 30, a native of 
Westminster now living in Diamond Bar, the new computer analysis is a major 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous addition to our operation, I think," Caligiuri said last 
week after practice at the Mission Viejo training center. "This is the first 
time I've used it and it's helped me a lot. . . . Basically, I tend to do 
certain things on the field and if something I want didn't happen, I can see 
why." 
</P>
<P>
 Other national teams such as Germany's have started using a computer, but 
nothing as sophisticated as the program designed by Kotas and Friedman, Sampson 
said. Many purists, such as Coach Bora Milutinovic of the U.S. team, do not put 
much credence in the technology, Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of traditionalists resent it," Sampson said. "Bora himself has been 
very difficult to warm up to this, but a lot of it is that he's not comfortable 
with the computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson predicts that the use of the computer will evolve like the use of 
videotape did. "Now it's practically impossible to prepare a team without 
videotape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer program offers more than preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be used to make quick adjustments during a game -- witness the U.S. 
team's 2-1 victory over Colombia on June 22, a victory that some consider the 
greatest upset in World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime of that match, Friedman, clutching a few charts taken from the 
first half, sprinted from the Rose Bowl press box through rows of fans to 
deliver some critical information to Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
 The charts showed that Colombia's Wilson Perez was attacking constantly on the 
right side of the field and not coming back to defend. The charts also showed 
that the United States was attacking almost entirely from the left side, the 
opposite side that Perez was leaving unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Ernie Stewart scored to give the U.S. a 2-0 lead. The ball 
came down the right side of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, the U.S. team tracked the tendencies of the Colombian attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew going into the game where they were likely to handle the ball," 
Caligiuri said. "We knew they didn't attack down the wings and that allowed us 
to concentrate on funneling them down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Sampson: "Their shots on goal mostly came from a central position, which 
is exactly what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The system's most important test will come today at Stanford Stadium when the 
U.S. team plays one of the favorites to take the cup, mighty Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson and Milutinovic have pored over the charts provided by the system, but 
Brazil plays with a unique style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer has provided us some detailed information, but each game is 
different, especially when you play a team like Brazil," Milutinovic said 
Thursday at the training camp. "Brazil is a team that bases its game on 
improvisation, using players who are the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians also happen to be the other national team involved with Kotas 
and Friedman. After seeing a presentation of the program in January, Brazilian 
Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira bought the services of Kotas and Friedman (they 
provide the program free to the U.S. team). 
</P>
<P>
 By contractual arrangement, however, Kotas and Friedman will not provide 
Brazil any information on the U.S. during or before the match. If Brazil wins, 
Kotas and Friedman will again work with that team. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying stacks of notes on Brazil, Friedman has become a believer in 
the genius of their players. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody is going to win the World Cup, it should be Brazil with their 
great talent," he said. "But, maybe, hopefully, the U.S. can pull off the upset 
of the century. . . . We're going to the quarterfinals either way."

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: SIGALERT, SIGALERT . . . WHEREFORE ART THOU SIGALERT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia gave us perestroika. Norway (via Winston Churchill) introduced quisling 
into the English language. Now, Southern California has made its own 
contribution to the Oxford English Dictionary: SigAlert.  
</P>
<P>
 Editors added the term to the reference manual last year, a toast to a region 
famous for its love affair with the automobile. According to the OED entry, a 
SigAlert is "a message broadcast on the radio giving warning of traffic 
congestion; a traffic jam." The word pays homage to local broadcaster Loyd 
Sigmon, whose breaking bulletins of major tie-ups in the 1950s are legend. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about other automobile- and road-related terminology? 
</P>
<P>
 Where do everyday words such as traffic and driv e come from? Why is it that 
we Yankees insist on stowing our bags in the trunks of cars, whereas across the 
Atlantic, people put things in the boot? And are freeways called that because 
they're free to drive on? How did jaywalker ever enter our vocabulary? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the answer to the first question, look no farther than your dog-eared high 
school copy of "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Shakespeare's beloved tragedy contains some of the first English 
references to traffic and drive in usages similar to those today. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the play appeared at the end of the 16th Century, drive almost always 
meant to force men or animals to move on or away in a negative sense, as in 
"drive back," "drive away" and "drive out." 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare equated driving with guiding a vehicle, which is what we modern 
folk understand best. In "Romeo and Juliet," a chariot is guided by a fairy 
with the power to make men dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck," Mercutio warns the love-struck 
Romeo in Act I, Scene IV, "and then dreams he of cutting . . . throats." 
</P>
<P>
 How many of us frustrated commuters can claim never to have felt the same way? 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic appears in the play's prologue, where we are told that the 
star-crossed lovers' tale will be "the two hours' traffic of our stage." 
</P>
<P>
 In medieval times, the word often meant communication or business, such as 
drug traffic. But soon it came to denote the to-and-fro passing of people, 
vehicles or vessels, and nowadays, two hours' traffic is more likely on the 
Santa Monica Freeway than on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20th Century, the car-crazy United States claimed the word traffic as 
its own and came up with a whole host of new phrases and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did traffic jam originate? America, circa World War I. Who put traffic 
together with engineer for the first time? America. How about traffic cop, 
traffic ticket and traffic court? America again. 
</P>
<P>
 That's only natural, experts say, from the nation with the world's highest 
number of cars per capita. In 1990, there was a car for every 1.8 Americans. 
Second place belonged to Iceland, where each car was split between two whole 
Icelanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the need arises, we tend to form words that suit our purposes. People look 
around, and there's no word that fits," said Bruce Fraser, professor of 
linguistics at Boston University. "The British are perhaps more reticent about 
making up new words. We're not above making up new words here. It's a national 
pastime." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, however, terms exist in the queen's English that Americans 
somewhere along the line decide to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the trunk- vs.- boot dichotomy. The British used boot as long ago as 1781 
to describe the luggage storage space in horse-drawn carriages; Dickens 
mentioned "the hind boot of all the red coaches" in "Nicholas Nickleby." 
</P>
<P>
 But at some point -- it's hard to say exactly when -- the U.S. adopted trunk . 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened with the other end of the car. "What we call the hood 
. . . is a bonnet" in the mother country, the U.S. War Department's "Short 
Guide to Great Britain" (1942) explained. 
</P>
<P>
 And anyone who has journeyed to London knows that their underground is our 
subway, their car parks our parking lots, their coaches our long-distance 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 So why the differences? 
</P>
<P>
 It may have something to do with history, a product of the same rebellious 
spirit that made the 13 colonies thumb their noses at George III in 1776. 
</P>
<P>
 "Noah Webster went to school right at the time of the American Revolution," 
USC linguistics professor Edward Finegan said. "When he wrote his dictionary, 
he was very, very keen on trying to generate a separate idea of an American 
language . . . in the same way that he wanted America to be free of the Brits." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of free, are freeways so named because they don't cost us anything to 
use? After all, in other parts of the country, especially the East Coast, 
they're usually called turnpikes, expressways or highways -- and they often 
charge tolls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans spokesman Russell Snyder dismisses the "freeway means free" idea. 
Instead, the term has to do with the type of thoroughfare it is -- in this 
case, one without intersections or stoplights to impede speedy progress at 55 
m.p.h. or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why they don't allow pedestrians on freeways. You'd have to be pretty 
foolish to risk ambling along or crossing a freeway on foot, no smarter than a 
jay ("a stupid or silly person; a simpleton," according to the OED). 
</P>
<P>
 In short, you'd have to be a jaywalker.

RE-RIGHTING HISTORY; LANDMARK CEMETERY UNDERGOES QUAKE DAMAGE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, the toppled gravestones and cracked statuary trigger the 
worst fears in some visitors to the oldest Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles. But 
no, Carol Bova, manager of Home of Peace Memorial Park, must explain 
repeatedly, anti-Semitic vandals did not rampage through the Eastside burial 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she says, the villains were shock waves of the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
which rolled through the historic cemetery even though it is about 25 miles 
from the quake's epicenter. Now the permanent home of Los Angeles' first Jewish 
settlers and of many Hollywood movie pioneers is being put back together with 
local and nationwide help. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have something that's of such historic importance, you are holding 
it in trust not only for the past but for the future too," said Bova, a 
friendly woman who pauses to pluck out any graveside weeds. "You're preserving 
the memorials so that people in the future will know the past." 
</P>
<P>
 That's going to be a tall order at Home of Peace, 32 acres of palm trees, 
fountains and memories at the intersection of Whittier Boulevard and the Long 
Beach Freeway. The price tag will top $300,000, complicated by the fact that 
many logical donors -- children and grandchildren of the buried -- are also 
deceased or cannot be contacted.  
</P>
<P>
 The quake toppled 438 granite and marble headstones that had been put in place 
between the 1920s and the 1950s. All but 150 of the headstones have been reset 
on their concrete bases with earthquake-resistant epoxies, and the others are 
expected to be righted in time for the Jewish High Holy Days in September, a 
traditional time for visits to relatives' graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs also are under way on the 80 stained-glass skylight panels that hung 
in the large Moorish-style mausoleum on the grounds. Cracked in the quake, the 
windows had cast tinted light on crypts and urns of such famous people as MGM 
studio chief Louis B. Mayer, Universal Studios founder Carl Laemmle and 
entertainer Fanny Brice (portrayed by Barbra Streisand in "Funny Girl"). 
</P>
<P>
 But work may take much longer for about 300 grave markers and tall monuments 
from the late 19th Century that were twisted or otherwise damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a six-foot obelisk is oddly out of kilter at the family plot of 
Solomon Lazard, the French-born merchant and insurance broker who was elected 
to the Los Angeles City Council in 1854 and served as president of the original 
Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. The crowning urn was knocked off the steep 
memorial pillar for Moritz Morris, a vineyard owner who helped found the city's 
first synagogue and served on the City Council in the 1860s. A marble angel 
crashed, its head sliced off its torso, from the monument to two young girls in 
a family named Cohen; one, Pauline, died of a skull fracture in 1890, and her 
sister Etta succumbed to diphtheria in 1891, according to handwritten, 
19th-Century files. 
</P>
<P>
 Home of Peace is significant because "it contains the monuments that point to 
so much of Jewish life and contributions in this entire region, from the most 
famous to the most everyday person," said Stephen Sass, an attorney who is 
president of the Jewish Historical Society of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 What is also unusual, Sass said, is that the cemetery accommodates contrasting 
customs although it is owned by the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, a Reform 
congregation that began Downtown as Congregation B'nai B'rith in 1862. Home of 
Peace has sections for the concrete-covered graves favored by Orthodox Jews and 
other sections for cremation urns; cremation is forbidden in Orthodox Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other cemeteries in the region suffered less damage in January because 
they have more graves marked by plaques in the ground, not upright headstones, 
industry experts said. Also, Home of Peace is on lowlands that may have softer 
soil from ancient streams below. In contrast, Calvary Cemetery, a Roman 
Catholic institution just across Whittier Boulevard on more hilly and rocky 
terrain, was little affected by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of the bodies or remains were disturbed at Home of Peace and the 
overwhelming majority of the estimated 50,000 grave markers and urns were not 
affected, said Stephen Breuer, executive director of the Wilshire Boulevard 
Temple. The congregation's first professional rabbi, Abraham Edelman, is buried 
there, as is Rabbi Edgar F. Magnin, who led the temple to national prominence 
from the 1920s through the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Except on Saturdays, when the cemetery is closed for the Sabbath, tourists can 
view the grave of Jerome (Curly) Howard and the crypt of his brother Shemp, 
both of whom were part of the Three Stooges comedy act at various times. 
Visitors can peer into the imposing mausoleum of movie mogul Harry M. Warner 
and find the underground crypt of his brother Jack Warner, separated by 50 
yards in death after a bitter family feud in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems so tied in with the development and growth of Hollywood," said Tom 
Randall, co-author of "Permanent Californians," a 1989 guidebook to California 
cemeteries. His chapter on Home of Peace begins with a quote from Samuel 
Goldwyn about the dictatorial Louis Mayer: "The reason so many people showed up 
at his funeral was because they wanted to make sure that he was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery was established in 1855 as the Hebrew Benevolent Society burial 
grounds in Chavez Ravine, near what is now Dodger Stadium. At the time, 
rough-and-tumble Los Angeles was home to about 60 Jews who had journeyed from 
Germany, Austria, Poland and France to unimaginable freedom and success. As 
industry grew near Downtown, their hilly, three-acre graveyard became 
surrounded by polluting oil wells and brick kilns. So between 1902 and 1910, 
all 360 bodies were exhumed and the monuments were moved by horse and wagon to 
the current site. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastside burial ground became very popular because it was so close to the 
emerging Jewish neighborhood in Boyle Heights. Today, a generation after Jewish 
life shifted to the Westside and the San Fernando Valley, Home of Peace 
continues to add about 250 graves each year, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish community's exodus from Boyle Heights, along with other moves over 
time, makes it nearly impossible to track down surviving members of families 
that own monuments damaged in January. Few people, it seems, send 
change-of-address cards to cemeteries, Bova said as she flipped through burial 
files that record the heartbreak of influenza and tuberculosis epidemics a 
century or more ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance will cover some of the skylight repairs, but there are no Federal 
Emergency Management Agency grants for cemeteries. So the cemetery is paying 
for the first round of repairs with its regular operating budget, reserve funds 
and donations from temple members and other concerned individuals and 
organizations, according to Breuer. 
</P>
<P>
 As other donations come in, work will be done on the older monuments that 
shifted and cracked, he said. "Not all those towers may be done but we will do 
the best we can," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major donors so far, he said, are the Jewish Federation Council of 
Greater Los Angeles, a consortium of many religious and social welfare groups; 
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the national Reform Judaism 
organization and Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. has a reputation as being new and devoid of tradition," said Jay 
Schuster, a spokesman for the Jewish Federation. "We feel it's important to 
maintain some of our past." Besides, he added, taking care of graves is 
considered one of the most blessed mitzvahs, or good deeds, since the 
beneficiary is in no position to return any favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cemeteries around the world do nothing if natural disasters cause damage 
and the families cannot be found, said Randall, who with his wife, Judi 
Culbertson, has written other books about cemeteries in New York, London and 
Paris. Randall said he is impressed that efforts are under way to fix the Home 
of Peace monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Bova wants things back in shape at Home of Peace as soon as possible. 
During a tour of the cemetery, she stopped to pick up the cracked angel head 
from the young Cohen girls' monument and stroked the cherubic face. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are folks here who don't have anyone else to look after them," she 
said, wearing a straw sun hat tied with a funereal black scarf. "We look after 
them as if they were our own."

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been said about the different freeway shutdowns, but I have never 
heard anything about the transition from the northbound Golden State Freeway to 
the eastbound Foothill Freeway in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, we have had to use Roxford Boulevard to Glenoaks Boulevard in 
order to get into Sylmar. Do you know when this transition might open? 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Scrase Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The transition road of which you write was partially opened at the end of last 
month, with traffic diverted into the car-pool lanes. But it is still not back 
up to snuff. Russ Snyder of Caltrans tells us that the entire $3.2-million 
reconstruction project should be finished by the end of August and all lanes 
will again be open. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of months ago, I saw a television news feature about speed humps that 
were installed to slow traffic in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Where I live on Covello Street is home to numerous small children and is 
generally a peaceful and well-maintained residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that this is one of the few streets that leads out of the 
development and provides easy neighborhood access. Cars often travel this 
quarter-mile, smooth street at full throttle, often in excess of 50 or 60 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 How do I find out more about speed humps? What steps must be taken to have 
them installed? 
</P>
<P>
 David Thornton Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your question is well-timed: Just a few weeks ago, the city issued guidelines 
on how to petition for speed humps in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents interested in applying for speed humps must first contact the city 
Department of Transportation to see if their street qualifies as a "local 
street" on the community plan. Only such local streets are eligible for speed 
humps, and are different from major boulevards such as Victory and Burbank and 
the semi-major "collector roads" in between them. 
</P>
<P>
 If your street is classified as a local street, it still must meet other 
criteria dealing with traffic volume, the posted speed limit, the street length 
and the impact speed humps would have by diverting traffic onto other nearby 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will draw up a priority list based on a neighborhood's accident rate, 
common speeds of cars and other information. But because it has become such a 
popular request, don't expect that you'll get speed humps in your neighborhood 
right away even if your request -- and an official petition with a signature 
requirement -- is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, you and your neighbors may even have to pay for the speed humps 
yourselves; the city will only fund a portion of them. Speed humps can cost 
$6,000 to install three on a street. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical speed hump -- different from the higher, more steeply angled and 
more jarring speed bumps in parking lots -- is 12 feet long and 2 to 3 inches 
high. Tests show the humps reduce average traffic speed by 7 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 To initiate your request, write the city of Los Angeles, Department of 
Transportation, Speed Hump Program, 200 N. Spring St., Room 1200, Los Angeles, 
Calif. 90012.

CHEMICAL LEAK AT STRIP MALL FORCES EVACUATION OF 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One block of a commercial strip mall was cordoned off and about 20 people were 
evacuated Sunday after reports of a chemical leak in a graphics store brought 
firefighters and a hazardous materials unit to the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill, which occurred at 1202 W. Collins Ave. at 10 a.m., apparently 
resulted from a leak in a tank containing ammonia in the A & E Repro Graphics 
building, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters cordoned off Collins Avenue between Main and Batavia streets for 
about 1 1/2 hours and, as a precaution, evacuated people who were on the block, 
firefighters said. No one was injured and there was no damage to buildings in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the leak, which was contained in the graphics building, wasn't 
immediately known and there were no toxic clouds, firefighters said.

PERSEVERANCE REWARDED PIONEER TEACHER; EDUCATION: PROF. JANET MATSUYAMA, NEWLY 
RETIRED AT 70, OVERCAME ANTI-JAPAN TENSIONS AFTER WWII. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMY HYUNJOO KRESTA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Matsuyama has been in school for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 She vowed she would never leave while in the first grade when, after school, 
her kid brother and friends acted as pupils while she lectured on the finer 
points of math and English as their teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the pretend-classroom has been traded in for a succession of real 
ones, and along the way, the Fullerton College professor of accounting has 
become a pioneer in education. Matsuyama was among the first Japanese Americans 
to enter the teaching profession in 1948 and among the first hired at Fullerton 
High School in 1955 and then Fullerton College in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 3, Matsuyama decided to pack up her textbooks and retire from teaching 
at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming the hurdles of discrimination -- which included a six-month stint 
in an internment camp -- that Matsuyama and others have faced was no small 
feat, experts in Asian American studies say. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching was among the more difficult professions for Asians, especially 
Japanese Americans, to break into because it involved face-to-face contact with 
the public, whose anti-Japanese sentiments continued to run strong after World 
War II ended, said John Liu, associate professor of comparative culture at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is a Japanese American woman engaged with the public. This was a very 
important (accomplishment) for her to go out after World War II into a 
profession with a high level of public interaction," Liu said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Matsuyama, who said she was fortunate to enter the profession during a time 
when teachers were in demand, it was a necessary hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching has been my lifelong goal since I was a little girl," said 
Matsuyama. 
</P>
<P>
 But she met many naysayers along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 While she was studying at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, Matsuyama's 
dean once suggested that she change majors from teaching to one more 
"acceptable" for Asians, like pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But their doubts only strengthened her resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where there's a will, there's a way," she added, hands crossed neatly across 
her lap in her Fullerton home. 
</P>
<P>
 Her students at Fullerton College didn't care that she was the first Japanese 
American teacher hired at their school, said Jim Anderson, dean of the business 
school where Matsuyama instructed more than 14,000 pupils over 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They remember a perfectly poised professor who listened to their problems and 
went out of her way to write recommendations and keep track of their 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Students "flock to her," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I have to be positive and set a positive example for my 
students," said Matsuyama, seated on an immaculate sofa surrounded by Japanese 
embroidery, stitched by her 91-year-old mother, who lives with Matsuyama and 
her husband, Arthur, and son, Randy. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuyama was born in 1924 in Tacoma, Wash., the only daughter of oyster 
farmers who immigrated in 1919 from Kochi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 She had spent one quarter at Washington State University when she and her two 
brothers were called home and ordered to evacuate immediately. It was 1941, 
shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor and during the height of anti-Japanese 
sentiment. Her father had died four years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old Matsuyama, two brothers and their mother -- like thousands of 
Americans of Japanese descent -- came under suspicion as possible spies and 
saboteurs for Japan. They and the one other Japanese American family in Tacoma 
were sent by bus to Tule Lake, an internment camp in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, she taught a typing class in the camp, where her family lived 
in a one-room barrack. The rooms were barren and rules strict. No one left the 
camp without permission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been worse," said Matsuyama, not wanting to dwell on the 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Matsuyama added, her mother preferred life in the camp. There, she 
had time to take art classes and relax, rather than having to worry about the 
family business, which was in the hands of family friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuyama spent much of her time in the camp applying to colleges. She decided 
to attend one in the Midwest because of the area's reputation for hospitality, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her two brothers were able to leave as well, but her mother stayed at Tule 
Lake and another camp until the war's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still visualize that moment," she said with tears, recalling the day 
she left her mother to attend school. "It was understood that I'd never be able 
to return." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating at the age of 22, Matsuyama immediately landed a job in 
Osseo, a small town outside Minneapolis populated largely by Norwegians, Finns 
and Swedes, where she was an anomaly with black hair and eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years, she moved to Fullerton with her husband and taught business 
courses to Fullerton High School students for three years before teaching at 
the college, where she had stayed for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 At Anderson's urging, she is now instructing one more summer school course, 
Principles of Financial Accounting 101, and is still active on college 
accreditation committees and other honorary boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Perpetually the educator, Matsuyama lectures that there is something to be 
learned from every experience. That is what she tells her students and what she 
tells herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has experienced discrimination, she said, she does not regret the 
course of her life.  
</P>
<P>
 "If a person keeps looking at the down side, of course it's going to be 
miserable," she said. "You just have to do the best you can no matter how bad 
the situation."

VALLEY CHRONICLE: POOL MADE SUCH A SPLASH, COUPLE SEEKS RELIEF IN CALMER WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve and Linda Erinberg are spending Independence Day in an Arizona hotel 
with a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 This is like Candy and Aaron Spelling -- who own an opulent Beverly Hills home 
as big as a theme park -- deciding to go to a Motel 6 to get away from it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Erinbergs are the creators of a 4,000-square-foot, $350,000 back-yard 
swimming hole with every imaginable bell and whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the Fourth of July, the pool will be home alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Erinbergs moved into their new home in the upscale Circle J Ranch area of 
Santa Clarita more than a year ago and decided to build a pool that would show 
off some of the options available to other homeowners who wanted to build 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
 This seemed a reasonable idea since the Erinbergs own a pool construction 
company. It could be good for business, they figured. 
</P>
<P>
 What they didn't know was just how good it was going to be for business. 
"We've been so busy, we just had to get away," Steve Erinberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool was mapped out by Steve as he walked around his 130-by-120-foot yard, 
marking his ideas with spray paint. "I just tried to think of what would look 
good where," the 42-year-old Van Nuys High graduate says. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the months, the project started taking on a life of its own. Erinberg 
remembers going over and over the plans to add something else he'd just thought 
of. 
</P>
<P>
 Completed about a month ago, it's your average water wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool is on a scenic plot overlooking the Santa Clarita Valley and is 
surrounded by a sandy beach, barbecue area, picnic tables and palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool itself is on several levels with an island, cave, waterfall and two 
10-foot bridges. There's also a swim-up bar. And the cave even has its own 
sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to your usual back-yard swimming pool what Disneyland is to a swing set, 
and it's drawn media from all over the world, according to Erinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a story in The Times, we started having television stations send crews 
over to shoot it. At least one station sent a helicopter so they could get an 
aerial view," Erinberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers and photographers have come from publications in France and England to 
see it, and several pool industry publications have done layouts, Erinberg 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest has been great. Maybe too great. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of work and now that summer's here, everyone wants their pools 
finished now, " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why, instead of inviting a pool full of happy splashers to enjoy 
their back-yard wonder, the Erinbergs have fled to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still going to have friends over and let charities use the pool for 
fund-raisers," says Erinberg. "But we needed a little time to ourselves. It's 
been a pretty hectic year." Focusing on Domestic Violence 
</P>
<P>
 The growing interest in domestic violence has become a challenge for at least 
one facility for battered women in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Fisher, the director of Haven Hills, finds that all of a sudden she is 
in demand for newspaper and television interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while she says she is grateful to be able to provide what information she 
can to raise the consciousness of the public, she hopes the issue doesn't 
become the sociological flavor of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an uphill battle to get the public and legal system to take the 
issue seriously. The victims of domestic violence have often become the victims 
of public indifference too," Fisher says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 17-year veteran in the war against domestic violence, she knows this 
subject well. She has been director of Haven Hills for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fisher, Haven Hills is the only nonprofit local facility offering 
drop-in counseling for women as well as a shelter for battered women and their 
children. To ensure client safety, the agency does not publicize its address. 
</P>
<P>
 She says about 300 women who have been in, or are still in, violent domestic 
situations come in for counseling each year. More than 360 people -- two-thirds 
of them children -- are offered housing in the shelter each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Fisher and Haven Hills counselor Barbara Fultan say the airing of Nicole 
Brown Simpson's 911 calls has provoked an emotional response in many of their 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women feel that at last their situation is legitimized and they feel 
empowered. They feel the seriousness of their situation has been underlined, 
Fisher and Fulton say. 
</P>
<P>
 Other battered women are experiencing great anxiety after hearing the 911 
tapes, perhaps reliving their own feelings of helplessness and fear, the 
counselors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Fultan says the most positive outcome of the fallout from the Simpson tragedy 
is the impact it has had on some of the battering husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 Several women, whose husbands had been in denial about their battering, have 
agreed to go into counseling. She does not know if they will follow through, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Fisher says it is her hope that the courts will now take a closer 
look at the way in which domestic violence is dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen progress in the way the police treat the problem, but the court 
system has been slower in coming along," Fisher says. Book Giveaway Today Marks 
Final Chapter for Bookstore 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is Book Castle in Burbank is going out of business at 10 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the pits for anyone who loved to wander through this bare-bones treasure 
trove of about 1 million used books and magazines where you could often see 
celebrities such as Richard Crenna, Armand Assanti, Roddy McDowell and author 
Larry McMurtry searching for a particular book. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that after several weeks of marking down their book prices, 
today they are giving the remaining books away for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "People won't find many signed first editions or art books," says manager 
Malcolm Macdonald. "The dealers have come in and pretty well stripped us of 
that kind of thing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that there are still about 200,000 books and magazines waiting this 
Fourth of July for a new home, and anyone who shows up at the store at the 
corner of San Fernando Boulevard and Orange Grove Avenue with boxes may cart 
them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've alerted librarians and other institutions to come and help themselves 
to whatever they need for their own libraries," says Macdonald, adding that 
most of them have already come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is strictly for individual book lovers," says Macdonald. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects the shelves to be just about bare by 10 p.m. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "Barkley hides now when I try to put his leash on so I can go outside and walk 
him. He'd rather explode than leave the air conditioning for that heat." Woman

THEATER REVIEW; 'TWELFTH NIGHT' IS A LADIES NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Twelfth Night" is a play that bears many viewings because in any production 
one of a half-dozen major characters may step forward to claim center stage. In 
a summer full of "Twelfth Nights" (Shakespeare Orange County and the Old Globe 
both open versions in the next two weeks), the first is the Shakespeare 
Festival/LA's production, now at the Japanese Gardens of the West Los Angeles 
VA Medical Center. This is clearly ladies night at the garden: Thanks partly to 
a phalanx of bland male performances, the only romance on stage is between the 
Countess Olivia and her reluctant suitor, the shipwrecked Viola, dressed as the 
boy Cesario. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course almost everyone falls in love in "Twelfth Night," often with the 
suddenness of a thunderstorm, which makes this the perfect play to see outdoors 
on a summer evening. Cesario swoons for her master, the Duke Orsino. Orsino, 
while experiencing strange stirrings for his servant Cesario, sends him/her to 
woo his beloved Olivia, who throws off her mourning for her brother after one 
look at this unusual boy ("Even so quickly may one catch the plague?"). 
Homoerotic impulses are the order of the day in "Twelfth Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Arminae Azarian's Olivia, stunning in several wide-brimmed hats, or with her 
hair swept back rather in the style of Imelda Marcos, is both reckless and 
dignified when she throws herself at the perplexed Cesario. Shana Wride is an 
appealingly wry Cesario, whether fending off hopeless female advances or 
adopting an unimpressive male growl during a sword fight. When these two 
discuss the nature of love, it is a conversation of equals. Their chemistry 
points up a weakness in the play: The men are not worthy suitors.  
</P>
<P>
 Orsino, in Patrick Roman Miller's blustery performance, sends a boy to woo in 
his place because he's actually ambivalent. His overheated adoration of Olivia 
reveals both a cowardice and an emptiness, just as his prattling about love 
reveals some misogyny. In Orsino's view, women can't love as fully because they 
"lack retention." He also grandly claims his love is "more noble than the 
world" and "as hungry as the sea." One suspects it is also as predictable. 
Viola's desire for this Orsino is much harder to understand than Olivia's 
indifference to him.  
</P>
<P>
 In the magical land of Illyria where the play is set, Feste can usually be 
counted on to provide some male wit. Under Will Roberson's uneven direction, 
though, Feste is a hulk of a man in a body suit (made of netting and tiny 
masks, a leitmotif of the set), a Mohawk and black lips. This aura of skinhead 
is not a light image for a jester, and Brian Joseph does not overcome it; his 
Feste is morose and a bit of a scowler. He uses a rattle to punctuate his 
witticisms, the way a comic relies on a snare drum. Otherwise, they might go 
completely unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelfth Night" also has a band of merry mischief-makers and idiots. Sir Toby 
Belch (Fred Sanders), the maid Maria (Candi Milo) and the dimwit Andrew 
Aguecheek (Patrick Thomas O'Brien), looking a little like Dana Carvey's Garth 
in a straw hat, take it upon themselves to unmoor Olivia's steward Malvolio. 
Their prank -- to make Malvolio a fool for love -- is unfortunately not 
terribly merry. It should be a sure-fire visual joke: they trick a man who is 
pomposity personified into wearing yellow stockings and ridiculous 
cross-garters. Yet the pranksters and the extent of their maliciousness is 
never clearly defined. They seem almost indistinguishable from one another, and 
their joke is tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 As Malvolio, Tom Ramirez, the only one here attempting a British accent, hints 
at some unexpected feeling when Malvolio is imprisoned and blindfolded. But the 
cruelty of the joke played at his expense is never acknowledged by the mistress 
of the house, Olivia, who is so delighted to find a real male version of Viola 
(Viola's brother Sebastian) that she laughs off his imprisonment as callously 
as her maid Maria.  
</P>
<P>
 In its ninth season, the Shakespeare Festival/LA has just taken over the 
outdoor arena on the VA grounds. Though the site of the theater doesn't yet 
look much like a Japanese garden, set designer Douglas R. Rogers and artist 
Deloss McGraw are able to instill Illyria with magic. The set is dominated by a 
half-dozen huge African masks, as re-imagined by Paul Klee on a festive day. 
Two sit near the back of the stage peering out, like Kilroy, and one lies 
supine, staring up at the sky. Additionally, dozens of tiny masks grin out at 
the audience from poles, hung amid Japanese lanterns painted as colorful 
globes. Feathers and netting, emphasizing the nearby sea, make their way into 
Todd Roehrman's costumes in imaginative ways. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a whimsical and arresting Illyria, as long as the women are the ones 
holding court.

ART REVIEW; MIROSLAW BALKA TAKES SOCIETY'S TEMPERATURE; THE POLISH ARTIST -- 
CONSIDERED THE FOREMOST EASTERN EUROPEAN SCULPTOR OF HIS GENERATION -- IS 
SHOWCASED AT THE LANNAN FOUNDATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The most captivating element in Miroslaw Balka's spare and elegant 
installation of poetically evocative sculptures and drawings at the Lannan 
Foundation is also the most paradoxical: an empty corridor at the entrance. 
Rarely does so little speak with so much eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by the artist, the passage is a kind of sensual decompression 
chamber. Halfway up the walls, which reach 12 1/2 feet in height, a mildly 
perfumed "wainscoting" has been applied, by troweling on a thin coating of 
Polish household soap dissolved in water. 
</P>
<P>
 Visually, the soft, smooth, ocher-colored coating of soap reads as a waxy 
membrane or as aged, translucent skin. Bits of dust and dirt are embedded in 
the soap-skin, like freckles or blemishes in flesh. Sometimes, small insects 
have been trapped, as if in amber. "Soap Corridor" is a space in which 
architecture and the evocation of past life unobtrusively share an intimate 
acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The height of the soapy surface applied to surrounding walls has been 
determined by the artist's height, personalizing the space by making it a 
reflection of human measure. You may not know that Balka's own stature has been 
used as the measuring device, but relative to the full height of the corridor 
and of the even taller room through which it passes, the surrounding skin 
plainly establishes a humanizing dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 The corridor also works to effectively slow down your eye and mind in passing 
from the world of random encounters outside the gallery into the highly focused 
arena you are about to enter. "Soap Corridor" is a cleansing space. 
</P>
<P>
 Miroslaw Balka (pronounced MIR-o-swav BOWK-uh ) is a 36-year-old Polish artist 
who was born and still lives in Warsaw. Since the final rust-out of the Iron 
Curtain, he has shown his sculpture in other European and American cities, 
including a 1991 solo exhibition at Burnett Miller Gallery in Los Angeles (his 
first in the United States). With his success last year representing Poland in 
its national pavilion at the 45th Venice Biennale, Balka is generally 
considered the foremost sculptor of his generation to have emerged in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the drawings, the present installation, acquired by the Lannan, is 
the one Balka showed in Venice. The collective ensemble is titled "37.1 
(Cont.)," a number that refers to the Celsius temperature at which fever begins 
in the human body. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, of course, it's also the temperature at which fever breaks. With 
Balka, the fragile threshold between imminent catastrophe and impending 
normalcy always gives a clear view in both directions. Neither ever arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As suggested by the beautifully simple corridor, made with the humblest of 
materials, Balka's Minimalist-looking sculptures are composed from ordinary 
architectural stuff: rusting steel; cheap black-and-white terrazzo flooring; 
rough carpet; ash from a stove. The shape and surface articulation of two 
pieces that hug the floor and one that hangs flat against the wall recall a 
floor plan describing a small room. 
</P>
<P>
 In one floor sculpture, you look at the terrazzo from above; in another, you 
see its unfinished side from below -- as if you have been buried beneath it. 
The third time the floor has been upended against the wall. The topsy-turviness 
suggests wrenching disorder held in suspension, like holding your breath in the 
face of the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, two rectangular terrazzo slabs lie side by side and low to the 
floor, on small beds of steel covered with felt. Lay a hand on the terrazzo and 
it is warm -- 37.1 C, to be precise, heated by cables embedded inside. The 
slabs are part domestic bed, site of raging fever dreams, and part tomb, in 
which the corpse is not yet cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly the tenor of Balka's "37.1 (Cont.)" is informed by the remarkable 
developments that have reverberated through Polish society in the last decade 
or so; but his sculpture, in its domestic and highly individuated forms, 
encounters the social world through a scrim of experience that is intimate, 
personal and inward-looking. Its materials and sensibility build on the hugely 
influential precedent of the late German artist Joseph Beuys but without Beuys' 
globally minded sense of dramatic pretense. 
</P>
<P>
 The final galleries of the show contain wall cases filled with nearly 200 
charred fragments of paper. The crumbling fragments, burned in a studio fire 
last fall, are edged in smoky brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are drawings that date from 1984 to 1992 -- one is a 1990 drawing made by 
Balka's young daughter. The rest are school items -- pages from an out-of-date 
atlas of Poland and bits of English lessons, each of which is a kind of map -- 
one to socially organized landscape, one to alien language. 
</P>
<P>
 In their way, the blackened drawings and maps, purposefully entombed in museum 
cases, speak to human tenacity and fragility in a manner every bit as 
provocative as the more elaborate sculptures. Balka's is not an art that grabs 
you by the lapels but that whispers in your ear instead.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MCENTIRE'S AIM TO PLEASE MISSES SOME MARKS 
</P>

 Reba McEntire is country music's most frustrating underachiever. She's one of 
its most popular female acts, with a growing cache of Grammys, gold and 
platinum records, an occasional film or television role, and a chart-topping 
new album and autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 But the uncommon vocal chops she demonstrated Friday at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheater couldn't overcome her tragic aim to please. 
</P>
<P>
 Her days as a country "new traditionalist" are nearly a decade behind McEntire 
now, as she has turned increasingly to syrupy tear-jerkers and other mainstream 
formulas, apparently mistaking a crossover toward pop with musical growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oklahoma-born singer began the nearly two-hour concert with a very 
non-country performance of the Aretha Franklin R & B hit "Respect" on a 
massive, multilevel stage with projection screens and other special effects. 
What followed was less a traditional concert than something resembling an old 
television variety show, with bits of comedy and drama, and at least a dozen 
costume changes, from choir robes to sequined gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am 39 years old, and I'm still playing dress-up," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she managed to shake the stage glitz, McEntire was a charming and 
energetic presence. The natural power of her vocals did much to lift things 
above the show-biz hokum surrounding her, though the stage was so overflowing 
with fog during the schmaltzy "For My Broken Heart" that fans in the front rows 
were fanning it away with their cowboy hats. 
</P>
<P>
 McEntire was often at her best during such bluesy numbers as the new "Why 
Haven't I Heard From You?" But she earned a standing ovation Friday when backup 
singer Linda Davis joined her for "Does He Love You?" -- their 1993 
Grammy-winning duet. (Davis also performed a song from her own "Shoot for the 
Moon" album.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the show was chart-topping newcomer John Michael Montgomery, who also 
blends pop elements into his sound, but still has his roots firmly planted in 
the country tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky singer-guitarist swaggered across the stage singing romantic 
ballads from his new "Kickin' It Up" album that echoed both mainstream country 
and early Eagles. Montgomery was also enough of the attentive crowd-pleaser to 
autograph a Stetson or two from the crowd in mid-lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 His seven-man band was too restrained to truly "kick it up a bit," as 
Montgomery promised, through most of the mid-tempo rave-ups. Their mess of 
Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" did work despite itself, mainly because 
Montgomery's lead guitar was so raw and unintelligible (threatening at times to 
explode into "Freebird") that the song actually evoked something real of the 
adolescence he said he was paying tribute.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; ASH GROVE PICKS 'EM UP AND LAYS 'EM DOWN 
</P>

 "We hope you like traditional bluegrass," fiddle great Byron Berline said 
early in Ash Grove's 16-song set Saturday night at Montana & Lace, "because if 
you don't you're in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the folks who packed into the tiny Huntington Beach vintage 
instruments shop were in exactly the right place. For bluegrass fans, Ash 
Grove, an informal group started for fun in the San Fernando Valley living 
rooms of its five musicians, was nothing short of a California bluegrass super 
group, a dream team of the Southland's acoustic music gurus. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the obvious enjoyment with which this million dollars' worth of 
musical talent played traditional bluegrass Saturday, it was easy to form the 
suspicion that the reason bluegrass has remained country's least-commercial 
branch is because the musicians like playing it so much that they want to keep 
it just for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash Grove's first number, "Durham's Reel," set the high-spirited tone of the 
evening. With smiles on their faces and lightning in their fingers, the five 
pickers attacked the traditional instrumental piece with an undisguised sense 
of pure fun.  
</P>
<P>
 Berline -- a perennial national fiddle champion who has done sessions work 
with the Rolling Stones and Flying Burrito Brothers, among others -- added an 
element of danger as he proceeded full bore with his stylish fiddle-playing 
even though the band was wedged so tightly onto the tiny stage that at any 
moment he looked as though he were going to jam the elbow of his bow arm into 
the wall. Meanwhile, guitarist Billy Ray Latham dazzled the crowd with his 
furious flat picking while Kenny Blackwell and Herb Pedersen kept up the 
breakneck pace on mandolin and banjo, respectively. Bill Bryson contributed a 
humorous touch as he slapped his big acoustic bass. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's name, Ash Grove, is derived from the Southern California folk club 
of the '60s where each of the musicians played at one time. The relationships 
among these pickers goes back to that seminal Southern California folk scene 
and is as tangled and complicated as the love lives of the characters on 
"Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Latham replaced Pedersen as banjo player in the Dillards, one of 
the most important groups in the development of California country. Berline, 
Pedersen and Bryson were all at one time in another influential California 
bluegrass group, Country Gazette. More recently, Pedersen and Bryson played 
together in the Desert Rose Band, which brought a California influence to 
contemporary mainstream country. Also, all of the musicians have been important 
session players throughout the past three decades of California country. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Ash Grove's 65-minute early set was devoted to traditional bluegrass 
material. The group performed Flatt and Scruggs' "Your Love Is Like a Flower" 
as well as the banjo workout "Earl's Breakdown," Red Allen's "Somebody Loves 
You Darlin',' " the Osborne Brothers' "This Heart of Mine Can Never Say 
Goodbye" and a fast and furious version of the traditional "Shady Grove." The 
group also did the Jim Croce song "Age," which has become something of a 
bluegrass staple. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson, Latham (an original member of the influential Kentucky Colonels) and 
Blackwell took turns on lead vocals. Latham's high bluegrass tenor added 
spine-tingling authenticity to the singing. Surprisingly, Pedersen, well known 
for his singing ability, took no lead vocals but contributed to the harmonies. 
The harmony singing of Pedersen, Latham, Bryson and Blackwell was one of the 
high points of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet was particularly inspired on several gospel numbers, including 
"Get a Line Brother," "If I Be Lifted Up," "Over in the Glory Land" and 
"Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the show was Eddie Montana, owner of Montana & Lace. He delivered a 
six-song set that showed his diversity with traditional instruments and a 
variety of folk styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by Shirley Jean on electric bass and Rob Kirby on guitar, Montana in 
his brief set managed to touch on country, bluegrass, Western swing, cowboy 
songs and Cajun music. He played guitar, mandolin, fiddle and banjo, all of 
which he grabbed from the shop's walls.

 Jazzed About Coleman: Jazz innovator Ornette Coleman has won the International 
Bird Award. The award, named for the American jazz saxophonist Charlie (Bird) 
Parker, honors musicians who have had a lasting influence on international 
jazz. The accolade is sponsored annually by the group in The Hague, 
Netherlands, that puts on the North Sea Jazz Festival, where Coleman is 
scheduled to perform Sunday. The 64-year-old Texas-born musician and composer 
is noted for an innovative jazz style that allows the rhythm section to 
interact freely with horns, becoming more than strictly a time keeper.

 Fan-Tastic: What a fan. Joan Marie Schaublin is now Michael Jackson, legally. 
The 38-year-old changed her name in a Green Bay, Wis., circuit court Friday to

molested a 13-year-old boy. She also quit her job to be a full-time fan.

 No Taylor After Tenors: Actress Elizabeth Taylor has canceled a post-concert

on July 16. Funds from the dinner, which Taylor was set to host, were to have 
gone toward building a new facility in South-Central Los Angeles providing 
shelter and medical care for HIV and AIDS patients. A spokeswoman for concert 
organizer Rudas Organization said "various matters beyond the control of 
Elizabeth Taylor, including her recent hip operation, have made it impossible 
to properly prepare" for the event. The spokeswoman said she didn't know how 
dinner tickets -- priced at $2,000 and up -- were selling but added that ticket

 Not Enchanted: Two former Benedictine monks who say they scored the music on a 
hot-selling CD of Gregorian chants claim they are entitled to some $5 million 
in royalties. The two-disc CD, "The Best of Gregorian Chants," unexpectedly 
soared to the top of the Spanish music charts this year and has gained 
recognition worldwide. The CD of medieval Latin plainsong was released in March 
in the United States under the title "Chant." It made it to No. 1 on the 
American classical charts -- and then made it into the top 10 on the pop 
charts. The album was compiled from recordings by monks in a Benedictine 
monastery in northern Spain. The two ex-monks -- Ismael Fernandez de la Cuesta 
and Francisco Lara -- served as directors of that choir. Officials at 
EMI-Odeon, the music company that distributed the CD, claim the chants are in 
the public domain and therefore not protected by copyright. PEOPLE WATCH

SCREENING ROOM: GAY FESTIVAL BEGINS WITH TUGS AND TWISTS OF THE HEART

 The 12th annual Los Angeles International Gay & Lesbian Film & Video Festival, 
which will present more than 200 works July 7-17 at the Directors Guild, 7920 
Sunset Blvd., gets off to a terrific start with the Thursday 8 p.m. premiere of 
"To Die For," a sure-fire British heart-tugger written by Johnny Byrne and 
directed by Peter Mackenzie Litten, who've given a fresh spin to the popular 
Hollywood ghost lover genre.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Arklie's Simon, who is into leather, and Ian Williams' Mark, a drag 
performer, have been lovers for several years; Simon is HIV-negative, but Mark 
is approaching the final stages of AIDS. Just when we're expecting a tale of 
devotion in the face of lingering illness, Mark dies swiftly only to return to 
confront Simon with his inability to love, which Simon painfully comes to 
realize is the result of a brutal rejection by his homophobic late father.  
</P>
<P>
 "To Die For" taps genuine emotion and expresses a real sense of what love is 
all about, thanks to a deeply felt, highly concentrated portrayal by Arklie. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlon Riggs recently lost his battle against AIDS but has left behind an 
important legacy of what it means to be gay and black in America. The festival 
takes note of the passing of this endlessly talented and courageous young man 
with a screening of his best-known and most controversial work, the beautiful 
and sensual "Tongues Untied" (Friday at 7 p.m.), a stunning and original 
celebration of love between black men that utilizes dance, poetry, tableaux and 
impassioned stream-of-consciousness narration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiktor Grodecki's riveting "Not Angels but Angels" (Saturday at 2 p.m.) is a 
matter-of-fact, low-key yet compassionate documentary on the lives of teen-age 
male prostitutes who work Prague's magnificent but seedy beaux-arts railway 
station and various gay clubs. Sheer economic survival has driven these youths 
to hustle, some of whom are straight or bisexual as well as gay, and all of 
whom practice safe sex only intermittently. Most striking are a matter-of-fact 
pimp who steers customers, mainly Germans, to the boys, and a feisty 
14-year-old born in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mark of the festival's maturity that it would land such a widely touted 
film as Stephan Elliot's rambunctious, irresistible "The Adventures of 
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" (Saturday at 9 p.m.), which looks to have the 
crossover success of "La Cage aux Folles." The vastly entertaining "Priscilla" 
takes its title from a gaudy van that three drag performers -- played by Hugo 
Weaving, Terence Stamp (whose character is a transsexual) and Guy Pearce -- are 
driving across the Australian desert. Stamp is a wonder as the middle-aged 
dignified but tough Bernadette, and his Australian co-stars are no less 
impressive.  
</P>
<P>
 Also from Australia is Ana Kokkinos' powerful "Only the Brave" (Sunday at 7 
p.m.), a coming-of-age odyssey in which a young Greek Australian lesbian's rite 
of passage involves the starkness of the tragedies of her family's ancestral 
homeland. Elena Mandalis is the rebellious Alex, and Dora Kaskanis is the 
look-alike object of her growing -- and unsettling -- affections. Set in a 
seedy, barren neighborhood outlying Melbourne, "Only the Brave" has been aptly 
compared to Jonathan Kaplan's gritty, alienated youth saga "Over the Edge." 
</P>
<P>
 "Closing Numbers" (Sunday at 9 p.m.), written by David Cook and directed by 
Stephen Whittaker, is the epitome of the literate, carefully crafted British 
drama of social consciousness yet manages to work up strong emotions as it 
confronts with admirable straightforwardness a crisis more common than most 
would admit: a wife who discovers that her husband, whom she always believed to 
be faithful, has a lover, who turns out to be male -- and who has furthermore 
previously indulged in lots of unsafe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Asher is impressive as the wife who receives this stunning double whammy, 
but the film's pivotal character is her husband's lover (Patrick Pearson). Not 
only does he prove supportive to Asher, but he also is nursing a friend (Nigel 
Charnock), rejected emphatically by his father, in an advanced stage of 
Kaposi's sarcoma.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; DANCE; THE JOFFREY INTRODUCES AN EROTIC TRIFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a typical night with the Joffrey Ballet on Friday at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 High energy levels. Low finesse levels. Interesting repertory. Few delusions 
of grandeur. A little bit of this, a big bit of that. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As always, some bits turned out to be better than others. But the medium-size 
crowd loved everything. Vociferously. 
</P>
<P>
 This is still the sort of company that can give eclecticism a good name. 
Gerald Arpino is carrying the torch bravely. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening began with the prim bravura of "Les Patineurs," Frederick Ashton's 
mock-Victorian evocation of skating without ice (or skates), anno 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening closed with the allegorical heroism of "Les Presages," Leonide 
Massine's splashy evocation of the inexorable march of fate on tippy-toe, anno 
1933. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle portion of the program included the athletic elegy of "Return to a 
Strange Land," Jiri Kylian's abstract evocation of convoluted relationships, 
anno 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The center of attention, however, was the sole novelty on the agenda: a 
moderately erotic 8-minute trio by Randy Duncan called "A Tri-Fling." The 
ambiguity of the title is, of course, intentional. Also tempting. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A jazzy champion of contemporary adventure, Duncan served until recently as 
director of the Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theater. For his first Joffrey 
vehicle, first performed in New York in April, he paid respectful homage to the 
tenets of romantic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Tri-Fling," the ever-stoic ballerina, Meg Guirin, dances -- also, slides, 
hops, stretches and gets dragged -- sur les l0 pointes. Her contrasting 
partners, who interact in varying suggestive combinations, are not nearly as 
well bred. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, there is cool David Kierce, apparently an earnest but stuffy 
fellow who wears two-thirds of a three-piece business suit. On the other, there 
is hot Pierre Lockett, a wild, shadowy spirit who doesn't believe in buttoning 
his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 These three engage one another in neatly strenuous intertwining exercises, to 
the plunk-pop-and-drone strains of a simple (don't call it minimalist) taped 
score by Tommy Mother. There may not be much substance here. Still, it is easy 
to appreciate Duncan's languid lifts, his subtle funk and bracing bursts of 
agitation, not to mention his trendy ruminations on the distinctions between a 
pas de trois and a menage a trois.  
</P>
<P>
 Even within the cliche-oriented environment he has chosen, the choreographer's 
control of dynamic focus and concern for emotional nuance look promising. 
Fortunately, "A Tri-Fling" stops before its modest ideas wear out their modest 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the hard-dancing principals performed with skillful dedication to 
the cause. J. Kevin Draves' costumes reinforced the archetypal role 
definitions, and Howell Binkley's elemental lighting effects did their 
mood-setting job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The familiar portions of the program offered few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Les Patineurs," last seen here in 1988 and now staged by Hilary Cartwright, 
seemed a little rough. Calvin Kitten, latest in a line of flying imps cast as 
the long-spinning boy in blue, was properly fleet and, perhaps, improperly 
cute. Conversely, Jodie Gates and Tom Mossbrucker traced the patterns of the 
"white" pas de deux with grim accuracy. Forget charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Return to a Strange Land," last seen here in 1983, does not look particularly 
strange in the darkness of 1994. Kylian's intricate abstractions retain their 
pathos, however, and one still can marvel at the choreographer's sensitive 
response to the intimate clashes in Janacek's piano music. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatriz Rodriguez, strongly partnered by Ryuji Yamamoto and Michael Levine, 
represented the relatively earthy trio. Deborah Dawn, Tom Mossbrucker and Adam 
Sklute provided relatively ethereal counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Les Presages," the presumed piece de resistance, strikes some observers as a 
neglected epochal masterpiece, others as an over-inflated, hopelessly dated 
period piece. This ungrateful observer -- who admits to a low tolerance for 
melodramatic gut-thumping and portentous posing, especially when the soundtrack 
involves Tchaikovsky's Fifth -- should be counted among the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, all is not lost. Historical exhumations are undeniably intriguing, and 
now we know where "Spartacus" and "The Red Detachment of Women" came from. 
</P>
<P>
 Several newcomers joined the excellent cast for this second local performance. 
Fern Miller served as an agreeably programmatic Temptation. Deborah Dawn and 
Pascal Benichou brought reasonable expansion to the overwrought neoclassicism 
of the Passion pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pit, Allan Lewis and a slightly truncated orchestra served a slightly 
truncated Tchaikovsky conscientiously.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'NEXT GENERATION' DIDN'T FLY SO BOLDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PARK BUCKER, Park Bucker is a software consultant and a free-lance writer in 
San Diego.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although "Star Trek: The Next Generation" has ended, the series has fallen far 
short of reaching the final frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appreciation, "Trekking Off With Mission Accomplished" (Calendar, May 
23), Times staff writer Daniel Cerone described the series as presenting an 
"idealized future." The show has several excellent features but in no way 
should its vision of the future be lauded as ideal. Whereas the original "Star 
Trek" featured an interracial cast in key roles, the "Next Generation" has 
continually presented a traditional hierarchy. White males are in command, 
minorities are hidden or absent, and the females are care-givers. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost 30 years, the Enterprise still has not gone where no one has gone 
before. This traditional scenario speaks more to the present than any fictional 
utopia. Granted, the acting is superb and often the writing transcends the 
show's conservative conceit. Yet the only serious flaws Cerone cites refer to 
costume and set design. 
</P>
<P>
 The original series was revolutionary in its use of female and minority 
characters. The producers have made some positive changes to the personnel in 
two decades; we no longer see nurses in mini-skirts aiding male doctors. On 
"Next Generation," two female regulars were the chief medical officer and the 
ship's counselor.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet why would a ship counselor be included among the senior officers, except 
as a token female? Her character belongs more to a talk-show panel than to the 
bridge of an exploring starship where her abilities have only marginal benefit. 
An enemy ship fires on the Enterprise and she reports from her easy chair, "The 
aliens are angry, Captain, and the crew is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 The original "Star Trek" boasted an interracial kiss between Lt. Uhura, a 
black woman, and Capt. Kirk. But African Americans have fared far worse in the 
intervening decades. In the "Next Generation," the only regular black cast 
members are a Klingon, a blind engineer and a bartender -- no commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans in the future are practically invisible. Apparently, Lt. Sulu 
was the last one. Any crew accurately representing a united Earth would 
undoubtedly contain a majority of Asians. Yet on the Enterprise they definitely 
remain in the minority.  
</P>
<P>
 Minorities and females have appeared as visiting guest stars but true 
innovation comes from permanent non-traditional casting. "I Spy" would not have 
been revolutionary if Bill Cosby had been only a recurring guest star. In "Next 
Generation," alien races (with the exception of barbaric Klingons) are almost 
exclusively portrayed by white actors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most glaring example of the show's Eurocentric mindset came in an 
otherwise excellent episode concerning the origin of human life in the 
universe. The writers sought to explain why so many humanoid races inhabited 
the galaxy. One scientist discovered DNA clues sprinkled over many planets. 
When assembled, these clues became a message from the original "mother race" of 
all the humanoids. The celestial "Mother-of-Us-All" was presented as a white 
female. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Earth, most scientists agree that the first people to emerge from the 
plains of Western Africa were black people. Yet the "Next Generation" casting 
director would have us believe that a white woman sired the galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new show's faults may not solely come from its creators, but rather 
from the times in which it premiered. Great science fiction seeks not to tell 
us about the future; it depicts the present but in fantastic settings and 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The original '60s "Star Trek," with its "prime directive" emphasizing 
nonintervention, emerged directly from America's ambivalence about Vietnam. The 
"Next Generation" appeared in the '80s when many Americans were quite content 
with conservative white males in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 If the "Next Generation" fails in its traditional casting, its spin-off, "Star 
Trek: Deep Space Nine," certainly succeeds. An African American male plays the 
commander, females appear as the station's executive officer and science 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps "Deep Space Nine" succeeds because the times in which it was created 
are more exciting. The collapse of the Soviet Union and apartheid can be seen 
in the show's fictional universe. The tyrannical Kardassian empire retreats 
from an oppressed planet, leaving the people to experiment with democracy and 
new-found freedom. The violent rise of nationalism is illustrated by rebellious 
settlers fighting for recognition in the demilitarized zone. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, "Star Trek" is a series about courage -- demonstrated not only by 
characters faced with dangerous aliens, but shown by the series itself in the 
stories it tells. "Next Generation" did exhibit courage in many of its choices. 
It just did not boldly go far enough.

COUNTERPUNCH: BETTE DAVIS WASN'T TYPICAL STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WERB, Mike Werb wrote the screenplay for the upcoming Jim Carrey film 
The Mask and has screenwriting projects in development at Disney, Universal and 
Paramount. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reading Kristine McKenna's quietly savage article on the Bette Davis tribute 
makes one wonder why the Los Angeles County Museum of Art would bother with a 
retrospective at all ("A Thorough Look at All About Bette," Calendar, June 9). 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna refers negatively to almost every film in the program: "mercifully 
forgotten" . . . "larded with maudlin sentiment" . . . "corny" . . . "turgid" . 
. . "bloated." One Davis performance "simply doesn't wash"; in another, she is 
"blown off the screen." Davis has "weird diction," period pieces "don't suit 
her" and she's "impersonating Shirley Booth." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna even seems to dismiss Davis' acclaimed portrayal of Margo Channing in 
"All About Eve" -- by stating that Davis was "essentially playing herself." Who 
cares? A great performance is a great performance. 
</P>
<P>
 With these kinds of reviews, how did Bette Davis even have a career, much less 
become one of the greatest stars of all time? Arriving in Hollywood during the 
reign of chromium blondes, the studio publicity man couldn't even find Bette at 
the train station because "no one there even remotely looked like an actress." 
Producer Carl Laemmle Jr. said, "She has as much sex appeal as Slim 
Summberville" (a hangdog-faced character actor of the '30s). 
</P>
<P>
 What these studio men (and McKenna) missed is that Davis became a great star 
because she was different. Instead of glamour, she had talent, style, guts and 
was a risk-taker. Davis battled Jack Warner for the chance to play Mildred in 
"Of Human Bondage" -- an ugly, dark role that the studio claimed would end her 
fledgling career. Instead, it made her a star and she is amazing in it.  
</P>
<P>
 Bette battled Warner again to play Judith Traherne in "Dark Victory." He 
claimed that no one would go see a picture about a dying woman. The film was a 
huge hit, Davis got another Oscar nomination and the press labeled her "the 
fourth Warner Brother" after its release.  
</P>
<P>
 Grand melodramas like "The Great Lie" and "Old Acquaintance" managed to show 
off Davis' signature emoting as well as her underrated comedic skills. "The 
Letter" and "The Little Foxes" showcase "bad girl Bette" at her best. "Hush . . 
. Hush, Sweet Charlotte" is constantly revived -- and the reason is Davis' 
complex portrayal of an aging woman on the brink of madness. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis made more than her share of bad films. But even in the worst of them, 
she displays that ineffable star quality that holds the screen and keeps you 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
 So don't take Kristine McKenna's word for it, or even mine for that matter. Go 
see any of Bette's films. You'll find out why (as Addison DeWitt said in "All 
About Eve"), she is "a great star, a true star, she never was or will be 
anything less."

JOAO BOSCO: A JOYFUL MOSAIC OF MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no one quite like Joao Bosco. The 48-year-old Brazilian 
singer-songwriter is one of the most energetic and galvanizing musicians in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 His appearance at the Brazilian Music Festival Saturday at the Santa Monica 
Civic Auditorium was his first in Southern California in several years -- far 
too long a hiatus for an artist of his stature. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosco, composing with lyricist Aldir Blanc, is one of the significant 
architects of Musica Popular Brasileira , or MPB, the mixture of bossa nova, 
samba, jazz and other styles that was Brazil's urban popular music of the '60s 
and '70s. His performance Saturday was a masterful exhibition of the colorful 
mosaic of rhythms, harmonies and melodies that contributed to and eventually 
emerged from MPB. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosco -- at his best in the opening part of his set, when he worked as a 
soloist, accompanied only by his remarkable guitar playing -- was a whirlwind 
of strumming and finger picking, building layers of rhythm beneath a series of 
deceptively complex vocals. At one point, he even stopped using his guitar, 
ending a piece on an explosive sequence of hypnotic, gripping vocal sound 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosco defined the sheer joy of making music and the effect that joy can have 
on a receptive, active audience -- regardless of differences of language or 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the bill were Kenia, the highly theatrical Eliana Estevao, the 
Brazilian All Stars band and the 23-piece Bahian ensemble Olodum. 
</P>
<P>
 * The festival continues Saturday at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, 1855 
Main St., 9 p.m., with Emilo Santiago, Kenia, Pau Brasil and the Brazilian All 
Stars, and a guest appearance by Dionne Warwick. $30 and $45. (310) 854-0553.

MUSIC REVIEWS; BOWL ORCHESTRA GETS A JUMP ON THE FOURTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Bowl started ringing in the Fourth of July celebration a few days 
early with "America the Beautiful" and fireworks on Saturday. The concert held 
a capacity audience of 17,979, and the repeat programs, scheduled for Sunday 
and today, also were reportedly sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis was on music by Richard Rodgers and Irving Berlin, as John 
Mauceri led the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra in music that Rodgers wrote for 
television and Broadway and Berlin wrote for Broadway and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mauceri tended to be a bit over-animated on the podium, he reached a 
welcome middle ground of letting the music emerge without hype or exaggeration, 
particularly in the selections from Rodgers' music for the television program 
"Victory at Sea" and his Broadway show "Carousel." 
</P>
<P>
 As an accompanist to singer Patti LuPone, Mauceri was attentive, prone to 
quick tempos but apparently unfazed and helpful when LuPone seemed to drop a 
line or get out of sync momentarily in Berlin's "Hostess With the Mostes' on 
the Ball." 
</P>
<P>
 LuPone provided star power. She sang more than half a dozen songs by Berlin, 
not all of which suited her throaty, expressive, highly articulated vocalism 
well. She was best in ballad-type songs such as "I Got Lost in His Arms," and 
less impressive in upbeat tempo songs, at times almost throwing away the 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowl amplification worked well, revealing an even, full and rich middle 
sound in the orchestra, as well as at the extremes, and allowing delicate 
details of orchestration to be heard clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 The program ended with an impressive fireworks display by Pryo-Spectaculars, 
which was coordinated with uncanny precision to the beats and phrases of three 
marches by John Philip Sousa. CHRIS PASLES

MUSIC REVIEWS; WASCALLY WABBIT MAKES HIS RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bugs Bunny on Broadway," conductor George Daugherty's popular salute to the 
classic Warner Bros. cartoons and the music composed and arranged for them, 
returned to the Hollywood Bowl Friday night to the delight of a vociferous 
audience that whooped, cheered and sang along with the animated patter. 
</P>
<P>
 The current (second) edition of the show, which combines cartoons with live 
performances of the scores and related music, includes the Road Runner short 
"Zoom and Bored" (1957) and "Rhapsody Rabbit" (1946), as well as such favorites 
as "Long-Haired Hare" (1949), "Rabbit of Seville" (1950) and "One Froggy 
Evening" (1955). 
</P>
<P>
 Daugherty drew careful distinctions between melodies that were adapted to 
shorts and the pieces from which they were taken. He overemphasized the accents 
in the Pilgrims' Chorus from Wagner's "Tannhauser" during Bugs' hilarious 
entrance as Brunnhilde in "What's Opera, Doc?" (1957), but avoided exaggeration 
in a vigorous reading of the Ride of the Valkyries. He eschewed the breakneck 
pace of the cartoons in an upbeat performance of the Dance of the Comedians 
from Smetana's "Bartered Bride," the source of the chase theme in the Road 
Runner films. 
</P>
<P>
 Between films, veteran Warners director Chuck Jones paid tribute to designer 
Maurice Noble, whose visual work ranges from the angular mesas of the Road 
Runner series to the futuristic city in "Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century" 
(1953). Voice artists June Foray (Witch Hazel) and Stan Freberg (Junyer Bear) 
honored the memories of sound effects engineer Treg Brown, composer-arranger 
Milt Franklyn and composers Raymond Scott and Carl Stalling. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, who seemed to be having as much 
fun as the audience, gave polished performances that were marred only by a 
blown tube in the video projection system during "What's Opera, Doc?"

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MCENTIRE'S VOCALS RISE ABOVE SHOW-BIZ SCHMALTZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reba McEntire is country music's most frustrating underachiever. 
</P>
<P>
 She's one of its most popular female acts -- with a growing cache of Grammys 
and country awards, gold and platinum records, an occasional film or television 
role and a new autobiography. But the uncommon vocal ability she demonstrated 
on Friday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre couldn't overcome her eagerness to 
please. 
</P>
<P>
 Her days as a "new traditionalist" are nearly a decade behind McEntire now, as 
she's turned increasingly to syrupy tear-jerkers and other mainstream formulas, 
apparently mistaking a crossover toward pop with musical growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oklahoma-born singer (who was also scheduled to play the Universal 
Amphitheatre on Saturday and Sunday) began Friday's nearly two-hour concert 
with a very non-country performance of the Aretha Franklin R&B hit "Respect," 
performing on a massive, multilevel stage with projection screens and other 
special effects. What followed was less a traditional concert than something 
resembling an old television variety show, with bits of comedy and drama and at 
least a dozen costume changes, from choir robes to sequined gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But free from the dehumanizing pop overproduction of her most recent albums, 
including the new "Read My Mind," McEntire was a charming and energetic 
presence. The natural power of her vocals did much to lift things above the 
show-biz hokum surrounding her, though the stage was so overflowing with fog 
during the schmaltzy "For My Broken Heart" that fans in the front rows were 
fanning it away with their cowboy hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the show was chart-topping newcomer John Michael Montgomery, who also 
blends pop elements into his sound but still has his roots firmly planted in 
the country tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky singer-guitarist swaggered across the stage singing romantic 
ballads from his new "Kickin' It Up" album that echoed both mainstream country 
and the early Eagles. Montgomery was also enough of the attentive crowd-pleaser 
to autograph a Stetson or two from the crowd in mid-lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 His seven-man band was too restrained to truly "kick it up a bit," as 
Montgomery had promised, through most of the mid-tempo rave-ups. Their mess of 
Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" worked in spite of itself, mainly because 
Montgomery's lead guitar was so raw and unintelligible (threatening at times to 
explode into "Free Bird") that the song actually evoked something of the 
adolescence to which he was attempting to pay tribute. STEVE APPLEFORD

 "My manager's out there saying, 'Great, Dave, your new album is acoustic ,' " 
joked Dave Alvin after one of many extremely electric rave-ups during his show 
at Jacks Sugar Shack on Friday. Alvin added that he had to keep the noise up to 
drown out the people chatting back at the bar, so he and his solid three-man 
band, the Guilty Men, powered through more than two hours of sweaty rock. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. Though the relatively subdued "King of California" album may be 
Alvin's best since he left the Blasters in the late '80s, full-force rock like 
Friday's adds a compelling sense of menace and momentum.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Alvin's sharp-eyed story-songs (including the timely "Fourth of July" 
from his tenure with X) are deft, complex mixes of music and deep emotions 
rooted in blues, country and rock, and they work in either acoustic settings or 
in the midst of raucous fury. Even at his wildest on Friday, Alvin sacrificed 
none of his literary agility, with cultural references in the show ranging from 
French novelist Jean Genet to "Mystery Science Theatre 3000." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin also twice mentioned L.A.'s new "adult alternative" radio station, 101.9 
FM, hopeful of some overdue hometown airplay. Sure enough, a day later the 
station played his "Barn Burning" -- an acoustic performance, by the way. STEVE

DANCE REVIEWS; NEW CAST CLOSES JOFFREY REPERTORY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Key cast changes in all four pieces brought novelty to the final repertory 
program of the Joffrey Ballet season on Saturday afternoon at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. Indeed, both Randy Duncan's "A Tri-Fling" and Jiri Kylian's 
"Return to a Strange Land" boasted entirely new lineups except for one 
previously reviewed dancer in each. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the partnering gambits in Duncan's trio often looked taxing -- and 
arbitrary -- Davis Robertson brought great force and drive to the twisting 
jumps and other solo challenges of his role. Without ever making her 
involvement with two partners seem anything deeper than mere erotic 
experimentation, Lissette Salgado danced with flair and got through her 
gymnastic tasks with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Return to a Strange Land," Jodie Gates brought so much emotional weight to 
her dancing that her duet with the conscientious Pierre Lockett compellingly 
fused physical text and personal subtext. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Elizabeth Parkinson's style of emoting seemed more like a 
conscious (and not always persuasive) agenda imposed on her duet with the 
intense Pascal Benichou and on the trio with Benichou and the capable David 
Kierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates also contributed artfully modulated dancing to the first ("Action") solo 
of Leonide Massine's "Les Presages." As Fate in the same ballet, Calvin Kitten 
looked under-rehearsed: technically spectacular in some passages, rough in his 
terminations elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederick Ashton's "Les Patineurs" needed more stylish dancing in the "white" 
pas de deux than Meg Gurin could command on Saturday opposite the previously 
reviewed Tom Mossbrucker. However, Ryuji Yamamoto exuded extraordinary elegance 
and technical aplomb as the Boy in Blue. His energy and attack in the trio 
proved somewhat disappointing compared to the solos, but in proportions and 
phrasing, no less than in bravura feats, Yamamoto established himself as a 
classical dancer of distinction. LEWIS SEGAL

KIDNAP VICTIM SAYS PRIORITIES HAVE CHANGED; ABDUCTION: PAULA HARRINGTON, 
REFLECTING ON THREE-DAY ORDEAL THAT ENDED IN ARIZONA MOTEL ROOM, SAYS SHE WILL 
START A FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Chris and Paula Harrington of Val Verde were married nearly six years 
ago, they agreed to hold off on starting a family to work instead on their 
careers. He is a civil attorney and she is a real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 But after surviving a three-day armed kidnaping ordeal that began last week at 
her Castaic office and ended Friday in Gila Bend, Ariz., where she was found 
bound and gagged in a motel room, Paula Harrington said Sunday that her 
priorities have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris and I have decided to start having kids," she announced to her family, 
which gathered at her mother's Yorba Linda home to celebrate her safe return 
and the birthdays of three family members. "Life is too important. I'm not just 
interested in making money anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be spending less hours working and spending more time 
together," echoed Chris Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Harrington's ordeal began last Wednesday when she left her office with a 
man who had walked in and asked for an agent to show him houses in the area. 
But when she failed to return by 6 p.m., Harrington's co-workers notified the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives tracking the use of her credit and bank cards discovered that she 
had made withdrawals Wednesday night in Hacienda Heights and Thursday night in 
El Centro, near the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 She was found Friday morning tied to a bed in a motel room in Gila Bend, about 
70 miles southwest of Phoenix, after a maid heard muffled cries for help. At 
the same time, the kidnaper called Harrington's office and told workers there 
where she could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington identified her abductor from FBI photo mug shots as Timothy Daniel 
Shue, 38, a fugitive with numerous aliases who is also a suspect in a number of 
similar crimes that have occurred since he fled authorities last month in Grand 
Rapids, Mich., where he was wanted in a fraud case, according to FBI officials. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents said they had tracked Shue from Michigan to Oregon to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington has been told by FBI investigators not to discuss details of the 
abduction. As of Sunday night, federal agents said there were no new leads in 
finding Shue. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sunday, with her family gathered around her, Harrington, 26, said in an 
interview that it was primarily her faith in God that got her through the 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went through stages," she said of her emotions. "There were probably 
several times along the way that I thought I was going to die, that I wouldn't 
see my family again. But there finally came a time when I made up mind that no 
matter what happened, for however long I had left to live, I was going to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I decided in my mind, that because of my faith, I wasn't afraid to die, 
because I didn't think it was the end, it helped me deal with the reality 
rather than be frozen in fear. I just kept that faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said she also worried about what her family was going through not 
knowing what was happening to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about my family and what they were having to endure," she 
said. "It was very painful to me, probably more so than what I was dealing 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I did continually have hope that things would be OK. I had that hope 
through staying calm, through trying to have a calming effect on the guy who 
took me. I'm usually a hyperactive person and I talk a lot. I'm active, but I 
thought that if I stayed calm and spoke slowly and told him before I made any 
moves, it would keep him cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said that having her friends and family constantly around her has 
helped her deal with her traumatic experience. But she knows that she will 
eventually have to confront it alone to put it behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will come a time when I will have to deal with it on my own," she said. 
"It helps to have people around and all the hugs and the support. But I'm sure 
in the next day or two there will be a time when I can be alone and cry, 
because I need to cry. I haven't had that chance yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, there was never any question in her mind that Sunday's 
birthday party for her husband and two sisters-in-law should go forward as had 
been previously planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to be with my family now. I don't want to be alone right now," she 
said. "When you've been through something traumatizing like this, you need to 
fall back to a normal schedule. I wanted the party to go forward. I want things 
to be normal again."

BURBANK VILLAGE AT A CROSSROADS; DEVELOPMENT: THE DOWNTOWN AREA IS BEING 
REVITALIZED, BUT IT IS COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF SOME LONGTIME MERCHANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downtown Burbank, once best known as the butt of comedian Johnny Carson's 
humor, may yet have the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 New restaurants and nationwide chain stores such as Blockbuster Video, Ross 
and Starbucks Coffee are swarming into a four-block stretch of San Fernando 
Boulevard in the Burbank Village section of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Skyrocketing rents, up by as much as 300% since 1989, have forced many small, 
independently owned businesses to fold or move out. At least 26 have left since 
1990, with just as many new businesses moving in to take their place, according 
to the city's Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Village, bordered by 1st and 3rd streets, Magnolia Boulevard and 
Angeleno Avenue, is at an important crossroads. A mix of old and new businesses 
compete daily for the attention of passersby along San Fernando Boulevard, the 
main thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The area "is exceedingly important to the well-being of the entire city," 
Mayor Bill Wiggins said. "It is one of the life arteries of Burbank. It's a 
big, big people draw." 
</P>
<P>
 Morey's Shoes & Boutique, for example, opened in 1947 as one of more than a 
dozen shoe stores in the area. Today, it is surrounded by new restaurants such 
as Gourmet 88 and Fuddruckers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town is hotter than a firecracker right now," said owner Morey 
Goodstein, 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Other independent merchants, such as Malcolm Macdonald and David Shekel, said 
that increasing rent and lease rates are squeezing them out of what was once a 
dull downtown area of mostly mom-and-pop stores. Both men have closed their 
stores for good. 
</P>
<P>
 For Macdonald, Burbank Village has become a victim of its own recent success. 
</P>
<P>
 Sections of San Fernando Boulevard struggled economically for years. But now 
the AMC Burbank 14 Theatres on Palm Avenue draw large crowds on weekends, as 
well as investors who see the Village's potential and are willing to pay more 
for space, he said. As late as midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, movie-goers 
searching for things to do roam the boulevard for places to eat, drink and 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been without a lease for some time, but we've not been in any danger of 
being moved out of the building," said Macdonald, 38, manager of Book Castle, a 
used-book shop that closes today to make way for a Blockbuster Video store. 
"This property is so enormous nobody else was prepared to put the kind of money 
into it that it required until the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I'm sorry to see family businesses go. On the other hand, the city 
put a fair amount of money into revitalizing this area, making it more upscale, 
and that's what they're getting." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has pumped about $100 million into revitalizing the greater downtown 
Burbank area, according to Burbank's Community Development Department. The 
money has helped open office buildings, the Media City Center shopping mall and 
AMC's multiscreen movie theater, among other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades the city has tried to enhance the retail climate along San 
Fernando Boulevard. In 1967, a six-block stretch was closed to traffic and 
turned into a pedestrian-only, open-air mall. But in 1989, the city paved the 
road, hoping to boost the area's sagging businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Now even neighboring cities spot the potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over time, i think it will be a very successful area," said Marsha Rood, a 
development official with the city of Pasadena. "It's a major step forward for 
Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Burbank takes that step forward, some longtime area merchants are being 
forced to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Shekel's, a variety store that opened on San Fernando Boulevard in 1977, 
closed because rent had jumped by about $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my life, I put here," said David Shekel, 60. "I started from scratch. We 
put all our efforts in to keep this store up to date and all of a sudden we 
have to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Shekel's landlords, Tom Tunnicliffe Jr., acknowledged that he pressured 
the store owner to pay up or leave within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landowners made a significant investment in these buildings and suffered with 
tenants paying low rents," Tunnicliffe said. "Now, we've got businesses coming 
through the door willing to pay $2 plus (per square foot)." 
</P>
<P>
 An effort is under way to promote a new downtown Burbank through advertising, 
sidewalk sales and hospitality nights. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will soon consider a proposed tax on Burbank Village businesses 
to help fund the marketing scheme, as well as improvements to parking, signs 
and lighting. Taxes would range from $100 to $2,500 per business each year. 
</P>
<P>
 When downtown Burbank is completely refurbished, it won't resemble any local 
hot spots, said Gwen Pentecost, executive director of the Downtown Burbank 
Stakeholders Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be another Melrose Avenue. It's not going to be another 
Third Street Promenade (in Santa Monica). It's not going to be another Old 
Pasadena," Pentecost said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be Burbank."

ALARCON, CHICK WIN PRAISE FOR 1ST YEAR'S WORK; CITY COUNCIL: CONSTITUENTS AND 
COLLEAGUES SAY THE TWO NEW VALLEY MEMBERS HAVE TOILED HARD TO MAKE GOOD ON 
CAMPAIGN VOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If they were students, the report cards for Laura Chick's and Richard 
Alarcon's first year on the Los Angeles City Council would generally be 
glowing, with high marks given by their constituents and colleagues for 
enthusiasm and dedication to the very themes that got them elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, a former council deputy who beat out her boss in June, 1993, to 
represent portions of the west San Fernando Valley, has become a tenacious 
advocate for improved police protection by drafting a slew of 
public-safety-minded ordinances and launching a donation campaign for the 
underfunded force. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also has developed a reputation as a maverick lawmaker who has been 
willing to step on toes when she feels strongly about an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Alarcon, who was former Mayor Tom Bradley's Valley representative 
before becoming the Valley's first Latino councilman, has spent much of his 
first year working to rejuvenate his economically depressed northeast Valley 
district through several renewal programs and improved city services. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the two new Valley representatives had previous City Hall experience, 
both have taken to their duties quickly, racing through the learning curve that 
confronts most rookie politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both have hit the ground running, so to speak," said Councilman Hal Bernson, 
a 15-year Valley representative. "They are good and energetic." 
</P>
<P>
 But their freshman years have not been free of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Chick has been accused by a coalition of Valley churches and 
synagogues of failing to fulfill a campaign promise to support city funding for 
an anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 And Alarcon's fight to close a landfill in his district has some city 
officials worried that if he succeeds, the city will be forced to pay more for 
trash disposal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, City Hall aides and political consultants say Chick and Alarcon 
have learned the first Golden Rule of politics: Stick to the issues that are of 
highest concern to your constituents and they will reelect you. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have not been bashful about representing themselves," said veteran 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose Westside district dips into the Valley. "They 
are not spectators. They are activists." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, a petite 50-year-old former social worker with salt-and-pepper hair, 
beat out her former boss, Joy Picus, during a brutal campaign in which Chick 
promised to cut many council perks and strive to improve police protection. 
</P>
<P>
 On both counts she has made big strides. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she has donated to West Valley police three of seven city cars 
assigned to her staff and nearly $80,000 in cash from her salary, her office 
budget and special funds set aside for community cleanup programs in her 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 But she has taken the quest a step further, by tapping residents and private 
firms to give police their surplus computers, cars, bicycles, high-tech cameras 
and cash. So many donations have come in that West Valley police are passing 
donated computers on to other police divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in her tenure, Chick made the motion to lift the hiring freeze for 
police officers, on some level, but not necessarily a pledge to provide full 
city funding. That misunderstanding was a key lesson of the first year, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've learned is how important it is to stay uncommitted until I've 
reviewed all the information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In City Hall, Chick has gained a reputation as a lawmaker willing to go 
against the grain even when it means angering fellow council members. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she ruffled some feathers last week when she led a move to permit 
the operation of a child-care center in Bernson's Northridge-based district -- 
a project Bernson himself opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson and others protested, saying City Hall's unwritten rule is that the 
council as a whole should support individual council members on neighborhood 
land-use issues because they know what is best for their district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to respect each other," Bernson said in an interview later. 
"If you want consideration, you have to give that to others." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, who ultimately won the dispute when the council approved her proposal 
for the child-care center, said the incident showed that she is willing to 
break from the ranks when she feels strongly about an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the definition of a maverick is that I don't silently acquiesce to rules 
that other people have made in times before me . . . then I'm a maverick," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, a photogenic 40-year-old former schoolteacher with a smooth speaking 
ability, beat out several strong candidates in June, 1993, to fill the vacant 
seat of retiring council veteran Ernani Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
 He inherited a tough challenge: the revitalization of the 7th District's 
decaying neighborhoods, ailing industrial zones and poorly maintained streets 
and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon began quickly to try to spark an economic revival by exploring 
establishment of a redevelopment project in Pacoima, a risky proposal because 
of the criticism that redevelopment projects have generated elsewhere in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has spearheaded a so far unsuccessful effort to find a new occupant 
for the vacant General Motors plant in Panorama City, and is often commended 
for taking a lead in the adoption of an ordinance to permit street vending in 
specific districts. 
</P>
<P>
 He managed to get Pacoima included in a proposed "empowerment zone" that could 
provide up to $100 million in federal aid and tax breaks. And he considers that 
his greatest accomplishment because of the intense competition from other 
economically depressed communities in the city. Federal officials will rule on 
the application in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone said we couldn't do it," Alarcon said. "But we believed we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he has been impressed by Alarcon's work thus far. "He has 
taken it upon himself to energize a part of the San Fernando Valley that has 
been neglected in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The GM plant, on the other hand, has been a source of great frustration to 
Alarcon. He wants to find a firm to buy the plant and create manufacturing jobs 
there. He has met regularly with GM representatives and potential buyers to try 
to broker a deal. But the effort has been hampered, he said, in large part by 
the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 If, in the remainder of his four-year term, Alarcon succeeds at getting the GM 
plant occupied, he believes that will outshine any of his other 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be the biggest victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his efforts on other, more successful, fronts have won him compliments 
from constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Phyllis Hines, a member of the Lake View Terrace Improvement 
Assn., commended Alarcon for taking steps toward meeting his campaign promise 
to build a library in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Alarcon persuaded the council to set aside $1 million for the 
creation of a Lake View Terrace library. The money would come from a trust fund 
created by the city to compensate neighbors for the continued use of the nearby 
Lopez Canyon Landfill, a city-operated trash dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just thrilled that he has taken a very strong stance" on the library, 
Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon's greatest challenge may be the one that generates the greatest 
controversy: the closure of the Lopez Canyon dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in his district have long complained about the landfill's trash, 
noise and odor and have looked forward to the dump's closure when its operating 
permit expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon was as stunned as many of the dump's neighbors in March when a draft 
report from city sanitation officials recommended extending the life of the 
dump to the year 2000. The extension would save up to $72 million annually 
compared to the cost of hauling trash to more remote sites, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Alarcon made a motion before the council to halt all city efforts 
to extend the life of the landfill and instead examine long-term alternatives 
to dumping in Lopez Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials have criticized Alarcon's actions, saying that many of 
the alternatives -- such as using other landfills in the region or hauling the 
waste by rail to remote locations -- could cost the city more. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, who heads the council's environmental quality committee, said she plans 
to vote against Alarcon's motion to halt efforts to extend the life of the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard's perspective on this comes from his community and his constituents 
and I admire that," she said. "But my perspective is very different. . . . One 
of my big concerns is what is this going to cost and where is the money coming 
from?" 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon disputes sanitation officials' estimates of the cost of closing the 
landfill, saying the exact cost of alternatives will not be known until the 
city receives bid proposals from private sanitation firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty percent of the city's trash currently ends up in landfills in Alarcon's 
district, and he said he will spend much of his second year in office trying to 
keep the city from dumping on his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always believed the best way I can help the city is to help my district 
and improve my district," Alarcon said.;

 Life in the real world is hard enough. But for the 150,000 or so people born 
in the U.S. every year with some form of developmental disability, simple tasks 
such as riding the bus, shopping for dinner or sewing on a shirt button can be 
confusing, even frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 260 students enrolled at the nonprofit Tierra Del Sol Foundation, 
mastering such skills is the first step toward living on their own and taking 
control of their lives.

 Clients of the foundation -- which runs campuses in Sunland, Van Nuys and 
Claremont -- participate in a variety of educational programs ranging from job 
training and basic academics to leisure skills and fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
 They learn to plot bus routes and to read food labels. They learn to 
appreciate the beauty and grace of dance as well as the occasional drudgery of 
holding down a job. 
</P>
<P>
 And they discover the individual joys of reaping the rewards of their work -- 
from the indulgence of a professional nail polish to the necessity of buying a 
can of beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Through flexible weekday programs, students learn reading, writing and 
elementary mathematics as well as household skills such as cooking, 
housekeeping and hygiene. Many learn skills such as horticulture, sewing and 
clerical work to prepare them for full-time, real-world jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tierra Del Sol clients face a range of emotional, physical and behavioral 
challenges stemming from a range of disabilities that include mental 
retardation, autism, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Skills for independent living benefit more than just the student. Tierra Del 
Sol estimates the cost of supporting someone in a state hospital at $85,000 per 
year. Supporting their efforts to become independent costs about a quarter as 
much.

FIREWORKS STRIKE FEAR IN MOST ANIMALS 
</P>

 Those fireworks that inspire pride and patriotism in Americans every Fourth of 
July instill only fear in most animals, according to veterinarians and animal 
control officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some dogs will actually jump through a closed window if they are frightened 
enough," said Dr. Kim Henry of the McClave Veterinary Hospital in Reseda, where 
the emergency room is often full on Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs and cats will often run away or hurt themselves when they hear fireworks 
going off. Such holiday mishaps are easily avoidable if pet owners take some 
simple steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep them inside," said Senior Animal Control Officer Keith Kramer at the 
East Valley Animal Care and Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
 With many pets running astray, Kramer said the holiday "usually ends up being 
a very busy day for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scared dogs tend to jump over fences, even if they usually don't," said 
Kramer, emphasizing the importance of keeping pets indoors, rather than just 
confined in the back yard.  
</P>
<P>
 For some pets an oral sedative can help. Henry said the medication should be 
given an hour before the fireworks are scheduled to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you're out having fun, make sure your pet is taken care of," Henry 
cautioned. "We see a lot of heatstroke." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter from the heat, especially for older pets, should be arranged and 
plenty of water should be provided, said Henry.

2 KILLED, 6 HURT IN CHAIN-REACTION FREEWAY CRASH; ACCIDENTS: SUSPECTED DRUNK 
DRIVER ALLEGEDLY CAUSED THE PILEUP. A STUDIO CITY WOMAN IS ONE OF THE DEAD.

 Two women -- including one from Studio City -- were killed and six other 
people were injured Sunday in a series of collisions that began when a 
suspected drunk driver slammed into the rear of a pickup truck on the Santa Ana 
Freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead were identified as Elizabeth Newman, 35, of Dominguez Hills and 
Patricia Ann Maglietto, 24, of Studio City, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokeswoman Soledad Weaver said the string of crashes began shortly after 
3:50 a.m. in the northbound lanes near the Ball Road off-ramp when the driver 
of a Ford Mustang, allegedly traveling about 100 m.p.h., rear-ended a Ford 
pickup truck driven by Alfredo Cortez, 51, of Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Mustang, identified as Rafael Cruz, 27, of Santa Ana, 
allegedly fled the accident on foot after the cars came to a stop in the center 
divider, Weaver said. Cruz, who suffered serious injuries, was arrested by 
police as he tried to flee. He was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, 
where he was being held on suspicion of drunk driving and misdemeanor 
hit-and-run driving, Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the initial collision, Newman, Maglietto and Lori Kitagawa, 19, 
of La Palma, who were all in a Honda sedan, collided with the Mustang. The 
drivers of a Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Thunderbird stopped to assist. 
</P>
<P>
 While the driver of the Thunderbird called 911 from her car phone, the three 
women and the driver of the Camaro stood in the center divider surveying the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that point, Weaver said, that Elisa Ortiz, 28, of Los Angeles, 
driving a Toyota off-road vehicle, slammed into the congregation. Maglietto was 
killed instantly, Weaver said. Newman was later pronounced dead at a local 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz, who is pregnant, was trapped in her vehicle and had to be extracted by 
emergency crews, Weaver said. She was taken to Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo with minor injuries. Weaver said Ortiz was not 
cited pending further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The collisions forced the closure of both sides of the Santa Ana Freeway for 
three hours, said Caltrans traffic manager Paul King.

 Joint Ventures Told to Form Trade Unions: The government has ordered 
foreign-financed joint ventures to set up official trade unions by the end of 
the year, blaming a lack of organizations for a spate of deadly workplace 
accidents. Zhang Dinghua, vice chairman of the state-controlled All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions, said just 12% of foreign-financed joint ventures 
had unions, the official Xinhua news agency reported.Zhang also pledged a major 
drive to put official unions into the 95% of Chinese township enterprises that 
still have no worker organizations, a move that would bring tens of millions of 
workers under the federation umbrella. Zhang said official unions are needed to 
protect workers from unscrupulous or negligent employers, citing "some serious 
problems" among foreign companies that hire Chinese laborers.

ENVELOPE RAISES ETHICS ISSUES IN SIMPSON CASE; COURTS: ATTORNEY OBLIGATIONS, 
NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE ARE DEBATED. PROSECUTOR VISITS VICTIM'S CONDOMINIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell came to court Friday with a bulky yellow 
envelope produced by defense attorneys for O.J. Simpson, she set off a weekend 
of speculation that it contained dramatic evidence in the celebrated murder 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous observers hypothesized that it was a knife; some assumed the 
development was worrisome for Simpson. "The only time I've seen defense lawyers 
turn over evidence is when it is incriminating or at least ambiguous," said Los 
Angeles defense lawyer Harland W. Braun. 
</P>
<P>
 But other legal experts said that even if the mystery envelope contains a 
knife, that may not be harmful to the former football star. They noted there is 
a long line of cases holding that defense attorneys have to turn over physical 
evidence that may be relevant to a crime -- including evidence that may help 
their case. 
</P>
<P>
 "While a defense lawyer has no obligation to go find evidence for the 
prosecution, that lawyer has a high ethical duty," said Loyola University law 
professor Laurie Levenson. "The lawyer may not know how important something is, 
but if it's possible that it's relevant, the lawyer has to turn it over so he 
cannot be accused of hiding evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although sources have indicated that the envelope contains a knife -- much 
like one that witnesses described selling to Simpson in May -- there is no 
guarantee that any details about it will be revealed when the preliminary 
hearing resumes Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators and attorneys worked over the holiday weekend. Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor, and Los Angeles Police Detective Tom 
Lange, the lead investigator, spent about two hours at Nicole Brown Simpson's 
condominium Sunday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither would discuss what took them there, but Clark had earlier visited 
Simpson's home to familiarize herself with the grounds and other details that 
could prove important to court arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite reports that the knife described in court was already in court 
custody, Los Angeles police said their hunt for a murder weapon continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources said they remained skeptical that a knife found by a passerby 
near O.J. Simpson's home Saturday will turn out to be that weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Two things make them suspicious, they said: The area where the knife was found 
had been searched just one day earlier, and the newly discovered knife does not 
appear to be the weapon that killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. The blade of the kitchen knife is slightly longer and wider than the 
one that investigators believe inflicted the fatal wounds, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Sunday, F. Lee Bailey, one of Simpson's attorneys, visited Simpson at 
the Men's Central Jail Downtown. Bailey was accompanied by Simpson's adult 
children from his first marriage, Jason and Arnelle, as well as his friend and 
personal attorney, Robert Kardashian. 
</P>
<P>
 None would comment on the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro has declined comment about the 
envelope produced in court Friday. What is known is that Shapiro gave it first 
to a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to review in private. Cecil J. Mills, the 
presiding judge of the Superior Court, then became aware of its existence and 
made a brief stop in the courtroom where Kennedy-Powell is presiding over 
Simpson's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, she left the bench briefly, went to her chambers and returned to 
court with the envelope -- announcing that she planned to open it. Both Shapiro 
and prosecutor Clark immediately objected to any disclosure of the contents, 
however, and the judge put off disclosure pending further proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the envelope materialized just a day after a sales clerk from a 
Downtown cutlery store testified that he sold Simpson a 15-inch stiletto knife 
on May 3, many theorized that the envelope contained that knife or one similar 
to it. Among those expressing this view was Leslie Abramson, the Los Angeles 
defense lawyer who represents another prominent accused murderer, Erik 
Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is . . . it's the knife that Mr. Simpson purchased," she said Sunday 
on ABC's "This Week with David Brinkley." "And I base that -- not just because 
it's wishful thinking and it would be the greatest theater, but in looking at 
the envelope, it does seem to have a linear object inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson and several other criminal defense lawyers said in interviews with 
The Times on Sunday that they try to avoid coming into possession of any 
evidence that could incriminate their client -- and thus would have to be 
turned over to authorities. "You don't want to become an investigating officer 
against your own client," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate the potential problems a lawyer may encounter, Abramson cited an 
incident a decade ago when she was representing one of two men accused of 
murdering a Northridge family of four who disappeared without a trace. Abramson 
and her private investigator went to a remote hilly area in the Antelope 
Valley, where a sheet from the bed of one of the missing children had been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 "My investigator gets out of his Honda Accord, opens the trunk and takes out a 
shovel. I said, 'What do you intend to do with the shovel?' He said, 'I don't 
think the police have done a thorough search. I'm going to dig.' 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson continued, "I said, 'Oh, really. And what are you going to do if you 
find something?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'If you disturb any evidence, including 
the bodies, then we have to use your car phone to call the police. What if what 
we find hurts our client? Who will represent him?" 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled that she finally directed the investigator: "We're not doing 
this. Put the shovel away." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the same line, Braun said: "If I go to a crime scene and see a knife or 
a gun that may have been used and I don't do anything, just leave it there, I 
don't have any duty to report it. The theory is I haven't affected the 
prosecution's case by doing anything to hide the weapon. But if I were to pick 
up the weapon and take it back to my office and it is potentially 
incriminating, I have an ethical duty to turn it over to the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining his belief that evidence turned over by the Simpson defense may 
be damaging to Simpson, Braun asserted that a lawyer does not have to be 
"hyper-ethical" and turn over evidence that is not incriminating. In fact, he 
said, such an action can unfairly help prosecutors, enabling them to alter 
their theory of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some legal observers, including Abramson, have speculated that 
Simpson's lawyers expect to use the contents of the envelope to aid his defense 
-- perhaps by showing that it was not used in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Most legal experts agree, however, that when in doubt, a defense attorney 
should turn over physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a lawyer comes into possession of physical evidence, the attorney is not 
allowed to keep it, hide it, alter it or destroy it," said University of 
Southern California law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. He and others cited a 
series of relevant cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, for instance, the Washington Supreme Court ruled that a lawyer had to 
turn over a knife that might have been used in a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, a Virginia federal court upheld an 18-month suspension of an attorney 
who failed to turn over money his client had stolen in a bank robbery and a gun 
used in the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 And just two months ago, a California appellate court upheld the murder 
conviction of a man after incriminating notes related to the crime were given 
by the defendant's lawyer to a judge -- who turned them over to the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemerinsky said most courts have drawn a critical distinction between 
physical evidence and information that an attorney learns from interviews or 
other research. Although the hard evidence must be turned over, information 
does not have to be, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the real world, however, the decision-making often is not so clear-cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, an attorney may find himself in a situation where he suddenly is 
presented with evidence, Chemerinsky noted -- as when a client walks into his 
office and proclaims, "Here's the knife!" The attorney then can say, "Don't 
give it to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney cannot tell the client to hide or destroy the knife. Nor can the 
lawyer advise him to turn it over to the police, because that would incriminate 
the client. 
</P>
<P>
 It is even unclear whether the lawyer can give the client any advice about 
what he should do with the knife, Chemerinsky said. "That's the client's 
problem. The lawyer shouldn't make it his problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the classic ethical dilemma," agreed Los Angeles criminal defense 
lawyer Barry Tarlow. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica criminal defense lawyer Gerald L. Chaleff, who has handled 
several high-profile murder cases, said practical considerations -- as well as 
ethical ones -- come into play in these situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to put your client in a position where it looks like anything 
you did was wrong so that it (works) to his detriment. If it's a knife or a gun 
and it looks like you're trying to hide it, it may make something that is 
innocuous, neutral or even beneficial to your case look sinister," said 
Chaleff, who is president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this kind of case, if you come into possession of evidence that's positive 
for your client, you may not want to hold onto it because people could claim 
you manipulated it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, courts have held that the attorney-client privilege protecting 
confidential conversations between a defendant and his lawyer does not apply to 
physical evidence, such as a weapon or stolen money. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, when a defense lawyer turns over such evidence, in most 
instances courts have held that when it is introduced in court, the prosecutor 
is not allowed to tell jurors how the evidence was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, it is possible that there never will be a public revelation 
of what was in the now-famous yellow envelope -- the evidence simply may appear 
in court as one of a string of exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson said she was surprised that Judge Kennedy-Powell "announced in open 
court that she had the envelope and said she was going to open it," before both 
prosecution and defense lawyers objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened in court Friday would naturally cause people to speculate," 
Levenson said. "If there was any matter to handle in chambers, it would seem 
like this one." 
</P>
<P>
 But other lawyers said that with such intense public interest in the case, the 
judge may have been wary about doing anything that might make her look as if 
she were trying to keep something hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the weekend's attention to the contents of the envelope and a 
passerby's discovery of the kitchen knife near Simpson's Brentwood home, 
prosecutors have indicated that their case does not depend on finding the 
murder weapon. Rather, they have emphasized forensic tests that could place the 
former football star at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police conceded that in earlier searches of the area they may have 
overlooked the knife found wrapped in a polka-dot blouse, they noted that it 
was lying in a place where it was easily spotted -- and this makes them doubt 
that it will prove to be the murder weapon, which has been the subject of an 
intense search for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lab tests were incomplete Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests will first attempt to determine whether red stains on the knife are 
human blood. If so, they will then be tested to determine whether the blood 
type matches that of either victim or Simpson, police sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the kitchen knife drew even more of the curious to Brentwood on 
Sunday, where spectators lined the sidewalk across Bundy Street from the 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know everyone in the neighborhood is annoyed," said Geri Sluder, 
vacationing here with her three children. "But we're from North Carolina. We 
don't have many things like this happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to see her house, and see she was a real person." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the woman who found the blouse-wrapped knife wishes she had never 
seen it, her sister said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Gonzalez said her sister Daniella, 21, has had nightmares after giving 
the knife to police. She said police behaved very skeptically toward her 
sister, saying "You know, this is a serious matter." Now, Debbie Gonzalez says, 
Daniella is afraid she will become the object of public skepticism and even 
wrath.

GIRL SAFE, SUSPECT HELD IN KIDNAPING; CRIME: THE ABDUCTION OF A LODI 
12-YEAR-OLD IS REMINISCENT OF POLLY KLAAS CASE. POLICE AND VOLUNTEERS QUICKLY 
MOBILIZE, AND SHE IS FOUND WITHIN A DAY.

<P>
 In a case that began with terrifying similarities to the Polly Klaas 
kidnap-murder, a young girl was abducted from her home at knifepoint in the 
Central Valley city of Lodi on Saturday -- but was found alive Sunday in a 
field in the Sierra foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Kathleen (Katie) Romanek stood up in the field and walked to 
her rescuers shortly after they arrested her suspected kidnaper, identified as 
Steve Reece Cochran, a 25-year-old transient. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie, who was wearing only socks and streaked with mud when she was found, 
was reported in good condition at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The brown-haired, brown-eyed girl was taken from her home at knifepoint 
Saturday by a man who asked about a for-sale sign on the house. He later 
returned, tied up the girl's sister and a friend, and drove off with the child. 
</P>
<P>
 But Katie was rescued less than 24 hours after 100 law enforcement officers -- 
police and San Joaquin County sheriff's deputies backed by the FBI -- joined 
many volunteers organized by the Polly Klaas Foundation to mount a massive 
search by helicopter, police cars and on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has not been seriously hurt," said Lodi Police Chief Larry Hansen. "She 
is in good spirits." Cochran was arrested on suspicion of kidnaping, Hansen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As police searched for Katie, she could hear a police helicopter flying over 
the field where she spent the night with her abductor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He forced her to hide under the grass in the area and he pulled up a bunch of 
the grass and pushed her down," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both victim and suspect were found near the town of Bellota, which is about 12 
miles southeast of Lodi. Searchers were led to the area Saturday night after 
authorities found the car belonging to Katie's 16-year-old sister, which the 
suspect had used to carry off the younger girl, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polly Klaas Foundation, founded last year to find the 12-year-old Petaluma 
girl who had been taken from her home and killed, was asked by Lodi authorities 
to help in the search. It quickly started distributing 20,000 flyers throughout 
Northern California and helped organize Lodi volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
 "You should have heard the reaction here when we learned that Katie was 
found," foundation spokesman Phil Grosse said. "This is just fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community in Lodi turned out in force right away," Grosse said. "They had 
a wonderful volunteer setup. They were mobilizing. They had people who opened a 
hot line. They distributed 20,000 flyers with a picture of the little girl and 
a composite drawing of the suspect. And, thank God, in their case, it took less 
than a day to find her." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Klaas kidnaping, in which a man burst into a slumber party as 
Polly's mother slept in the next room, Katie's parents, Bob and Elsie, were 
vacationing out of state. The man who came to the Romaneks' front door Saturday 
told Katie's sister, who was baby-sitting, that he was interested in buying the 
house, which had a "for sale" sign in front. 
</P>
<P>
 He left after she referred him to a real estate agent, Lodi Police Capt. James 
Schick said. But after the 16-year-old went out for a pizza, the man returned 
about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The bare-chested intruder, who called himself Steve, somehow entered the 
house, tied up Katie and her 12-year-old friend upstairs and was waiting when 
the older girl returned, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man "had a knife and held it to her throat, and threatened her with bodily 
harm," Schick said. After tying up the teen-ager and leaving her upstairs with 
the other 12-year-old, the man left the house, driving off with Katie in her 
sister's car. The little girl may already have been unclothed; she was heard 
pleading for a blanket as she was taken away, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie's sister and friend were not harmed.  
</P>
<P>
 Later Saturday, the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Department received a call 
about a brush fire, and found the stolen vehicle about 25 miles east of Lodi, 
Schick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The small car apparently sparked the fire, which was noticed by a farmer who 
told investigators that he saw one or two people fleeing from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers concentrated on that area, figuring the suspect had no other 
transportation and had to make his way on foot. They were armed with a 
composite drawing from a description by the girls left behind, as well as a 
description of several tattoos on the man's chest, arms and back.

<P>
 On Sunday afternoon, authorities spotted Cochran about 100 yards off 
California 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stated spontaneously, 'What's the matter? What's the matter? I don't 
remember anything,' " Hansen said. Police have yet to determine a motive. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly's father, Marc Klaas, expressed relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody moved fast," he said. "I think we all realized that the longer the 
time period goes, the less your chances of recovering the child are. Everybody 
did what had to be done and she's home." 
</P>
<P>
 Polly's body was found weeks after she disappeared. Richard Allen Davis, who 
led investigators to her body, was charged with murder and could face the death 
penalty. He had a long record as a habitual criminal and sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
 The Klaas murder provided the impetus for California's so-called "three 
strikes" measure, enacted in March. Under the law, after two convictions for 
serious or violent felonies, conviction on any third felony requires a minimum 
term of 25 years to life in prison.

CRACKING DOWN ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY TEACHERS; LAW: O.C. EDUCATOR WHO MOLESTED 
AT LEAST 5 STUDENTS IS ONE OF 177 IN STATE TO HAVE CREDENTIAL REVOKED IN 
1993-94.

<P>
 In January, George Melvin Fairchild, 53, a teacher and coach in Fullerton 
district high schools for 28 years, admitted to a judge that he had a special 
relationship with some of his students. He had molested at least five of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But their side of the story surfaced months later in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 One alleged that Fairchild called her "B.B." in class and told her it stood 
for "big boobs." Another said he exposed himself and asked for oral sex, and 
several said he fondled them. One said he continued to write to her after she 
moved to another school district, repeatedly hinting or asking for sex. The 
suit alleges the harassment extended over at least 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairchild pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual battery, child molestation 
and lewd conduct with a minor and was sentenced to three years' probation, 
including a $500 fine, psychological counseling and 500 hours of community 
service. The conviction cost him his teaching certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 During last year and this, 177 teachers, counselors or administrators in 
California have had their certificates revoked for sexual misconduct with 
students, ranging from sexual innuendo to sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, at least 552 certificates have been revoked, probably more, given 
the inexact reporting methods. It's the most common reason by far for revoking 
certificates, both in California and nationally, and has been over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they are really reckless," says Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Chuck Middleton, whose child-abuse unit prosecuted Fairchild and similar cases. 
"They destroy their careers. You have to think they just can't control their 
appetites." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes unreported by intimidated students, sometimes swept under the rug by 
embarrassed school officials, sometimes passed over by prosecutors because of 
their difficulty, such cases are getting more attention nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 Some states are toughening their laws, including making sex between teachers 
and minor students a crime under any circumstance. A national data bank of 
teachers' names who have lost their certificates for sexual misconduct may make 
it harder for such teachers simply to change states and re-enter the 
schoolroom. 
</P>
<P>
 And child advocates are calling on school districts to confront the problem 
squarely by warning teachers of the consequences of sexual misconduct, then 
coming down hard on those who transgress. Legislation pending in Sacramento 
will allow school districts for the first time to participate in state hearings 
to revoke teaching credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, say some education officials, unreported cases might be reported, and 
the problem might begin to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would certainly like to believe we get all the reports," says Nanette 
Rufo, an attorney for the state commission that issues education credentials. 
Yet, she says, it's certain that some cases are not reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school districts' concern is to get these people out of the district," 
Rufo says. "Our concern is broader; we're concerned that they may still be 
licensed to teach in the state. I'm sure there are reports that should be filed 
that aren't, but the size of the problem we would have no way of knowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some offending teachers are pedophiles, adults who are sexually stimulated by 
children. Gene Abel, a psychiatrist at the Behavioral Medicine Institute in 
Atlanta who sometimes works under federal grants, is researching ways of 
screening for and treating pedophiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, there's nothing unusual about the persons perpetrating this. You 
couldn't see it about them. Many of them have a lot of good traits -- excellent 
teaching, concern about students." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel recalled one 40-year-old teacher who was voted teacher of the year while 
he was molesting an 8-year-old girl by setting up appointments for her to come 
to his office alone. "He sent her an inch-high stack of love letters. He was 
married and had children of his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Separate from the pedophiles are those teachers who become sexually involved 
with adolescents, and again, nothing seems to make these teachers stand out 
from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exceedingly common for males to be attracted to adolescent females," 
Abel says. "When males are young, they're more likely to be attracted to older 
women well beyond their age. As you get older, the arousal shifts. Most males 
are attracted to individuals who are younger and smaller than they. Now, who's 
younger and smaller? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're around these individuals all the time at school, and adolescent girls 
are constantly trying out flirtatious behavior. It should be no big surprise 
that adults are attracted to adolescents." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Wayne Martin, 34 when he was arrested last year in Costa Mesa, pleaded 
guilty to two counts of oral sex with a 17-year-old student at Fountain Valley 
High School. Prosecutors said he had no previous criminal record and was well 
liked on campus. A stream of teachers and students testified on his behalf at 
his sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like a real nice guy," said Middleton, the deputy district 
attorney. "He looked like a typical young teacher, the type where everybody 
would like to be in his class. He showed a lot of interest in his students. 
This guy epitomizes the teacher who you'd never guess was involved in this sort 
of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 It's even less likely that anyone would single out Michelle Lynn Smith, 36, a 
home economics teacher at Kraemer Junior High School in Placentia for 13 years. 
Yet she faces seven felony counts of lewd conduct with a minor that prosecutors 
allege stem from a nearly yearlong relationship of heavy petting, but not 
sexual intercourse, with one of her former students, then 14 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd never expect a female, especially with a 14-year-old," Middleton said. 
"She's married and has kids. It's beyond comprehension." 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of molestation on the child or adolescent can be lasting and 
catastrophic, said Justin D. Call, a psychiatrist who directs child and 
adolescent psychiatry at the UC Irvine California College of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Often children simply keep the molestation a secret or force it from their 
memories. The events are not discovered, or rediscovered, until adulthood. Call 
estimates that one in every four psychiatric patients has sexual molestation by 
an authority figure in his or her background. 
</P>
<P>
 But even when "forgotten," the molestation has its effects, Call said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are mistrustful of all authorities, all figures of power they run into. 
And their own sense of morality is undermined." 
</P>
<P>
 In extreme cases, the child can grow up to be a molester. "What happens in a 
case like that is a young person's sexual development is short-circuited. Their 
evolution in normal sexuality is damaged. It becomes a distortion of one's 
whole personality," Call said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every state declares an age below which a child does not have the legal power 
to consent to sex. This "age of consent" varies -- in North Carolina it's 13, 
in California, 18 -- but all laws are based on the belief that these children 
are too inexperienced and too easily intimidated to weigh such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you talk with perpetrators who molest, they are great supporters of 
children being treated as equals," Abel says. "They take the position that 
anyone can decide what he or she wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say to themselves, 'Well, you know she's just asking me to get involved, 
she wants me to teach her all about sex, and after all, she's flirtatious.' But 
they never check this reasoning out with anyone else. They keep it a secret to 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Succeeding encounters without being caught often embolden molesters to the 
point of recklessness, Abel says. "Eventually they think what they're doing is 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they're first questioned, or first arrested, it's startling. They'll 
just tell you these preposterous explanations -- she initiated it or she should 
have refused -- and you'll say, 'This guy's a nut.' For the first time, they're 
checking out their distortions." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the nation's busiest investigators of classroom offenses is Edward F. 
Stancik, whose office, special commissioner of investigation for the New York 
City School District, was created 3 1/2 years ago in reaction to patronage 
scandals. A former New York County assistant district attorney, Stancik is 
independent of both the city's school board and mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Stancik says the teachers he has investigated fall into categories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are predators. They know which students are vulnerable. They look for 
kids with trouble at home, who don't have positive role models in their lives, 
who might be flattered by the attention. They target them and continually get 
themselves in relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes relationships start off innocently, and after a while something's 
going on. I think there are those who simply get in over their head and find 
themselves in a situation they hadn't planned on. 
</P>
<P>
 "And some do it just out of lust." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims vary, too. According to Abel's research, in child-molesting cases not 
involving touch, 99% of the victims are girls, but if touch is involved, 62% of 
victims are boys. Yet almost all victims who report being molested by their 
teachers are girls. That's because it's expected that "we protect girls," Abel 
says. "We don't protect boys. They're supposed to be little John Waynes." 
</P>
<P>
 Most complaints are made to school authorities, and what happens after that 
can vary. California state law requires that "any child care custodian" who 
"knows or reasonably suspects" that a child has been "a victim of child abuse" 
must immediately report it to a child protective agency, which usually means 
the police. 
</P>
<P>
 But this does not always happen, says Middleton. "Historically they try to 
deal with them in-house, ship them to another school, maybe they'll be OK. 
Sometimes they try to think of ways not to report, and that's where they get 
themselves into trouble. They mix administrative policy with the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairchild case was an example, according to Middleton. There had been 
previous complaints, and school authorities reacted by transferring Fairchild 
to another school, Middleton says. When the latest outbreak of complaints 
occurred, school officials tried to handle the matter themselves and never did 
report the complaints to law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason, Middleton suspects, is a seeming conflict between 
California's education regulations and its criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Education regulations require that such cases be reported to Sacramento for 
administrative action only when the district has firsthand information about 
sexual misconduct, such as a statement from a victim, witness or perpetrator. 
But criminal statutes require educators to immediately report any suspicion of 
sexual misconduct to law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not usually that simple, says Peter A. Hartman, superintendent of the 
1,120-teacher Saddleback Valley Unified School District in southern Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half or more of the cases relate to an incident that happened many years ago, 
usually past the statute of limitations. It's like somebody has grown up and 
gone into counseling and decided to go back and try to clear up their past. At 
that time it's awfully late to verify what actually happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get witnesses. Usually there are no witnesses, even in those 
cases that happened within a year. You have one person's word against another. 
You have to balance against teachers that are falsely accused. Occasionally 
there are false accusations. If you're dealing with a teacher with a lot of 
years with few or little complaints and none in the last four or five years, 
who's generally well liked and gotten good evaluations, it's really hard to 
decide in the middle of the career of this individual who to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 And though there are varying degrees of sexual impropriety -- from improper 
flirting and sexual suggestions to actual sexual intercourse with a minor -- 
school administrators have only two alternatives in dealing with such teachers, 
Hartman says. "You either fire them and take their credentials away or let them 
keep teaching. I think there should be some intermediate discipline -- 
suspension for a month or a year, something not so bad they lose their jobs. 
It's like for everything there's a life sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Many cases do not lead to trial, Middleton says, because "it's a very gray and 
pretty wide area. These are some of the most difficult cases in our office." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's statements must be corroborated in some way, and juries react 
differently in every case, he says. The older-looking and more promiscuous the 
victim, the more likable the teacher, the more likely a jury will refuse to 
convict, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton recalled an Orange County case that prosecutors finally withdrew as 
hopeless. A 13-year-old girl said the teacher had oral sex with her and once 
took her to a motel room for sex, but she could not remember the location of 
the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Though convinced of his guilt, prosecutors could see the teacher "would make a 
very good impression, because he had a lot of support (among teachers and 
students). He had denied it all the way down the line. He was a good-looking 
guy, studious, the educator appearance. And she (the victim) was going to have 
problems with credibility on the stand. She couldn't remember things and was 
very vague about some things. Without the motel room record, we didn't have any 
corroboration." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without criminal prosecution, teachers can be fired and their credentials 
revoked, but there are limitations. To start with, says Hartman, it's 
expensive. Holding hearings to dismiss a teacher can cost a school district as 
much as $100,000 in legal and administrative costs. State authorities who issue 
and revoke credentials have only one investigator and depend mostly on the 
reports of other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 And under state law, persons vocationally licensed by the state, including 
teachers, can wait a year, then apply for reinstatement of their licenses. 
Since July, 1990, four educators convicted of felonies -- having sex with 
underage students -- have had their credentials reissued. A bill now pending in 
Sacramento would plug this hole, forbidding recertification of educators 
convicted of felony sex offenses or felony drug offenses involving minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Revoked credentials have not kept some sex offenders out of the schools. 
Moving to another state and applying for a teaching credential there could 
reopen the field for a disciplined or even convicted sex offender. 
Communication between states and checking of references has been lax in the 
past, says Douglas F. Bates, an attorney for the Utah State Office of 
Education. "It was so unwieldy to trade information among the states," Bates 
says. "There was just a general lack of timely information about people who 
should never have access to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to this, authorities hope, is a clearinghouse formed by the 
National Assn. of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification, for 
which Bates is legal adviser. Formed in the late 1980s, the clearinghouse has 
finally reached agreement with education authorities in all states on reporting 
the names of teachers whose credentials have been revoked for any reason. The 
association now is trying to persuade Canadian authorities to join the 
clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, each state provides and updates information from its own 
records. Then the composite lists are distributed to all states monthly. But 
the system is still imperfect. Though requested to specify the reasons for 
revocation -- sexual misconduct with children is the biggest category -- some 
states refuse to do it. Others lump their sexual misconduct cases with others 
in the miscellaneous category. Some states have reported no revocations at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get underreporting at all levels," Bates says. "Teachers are often 
allowed to resign if they'll just leave for good." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the hesitancy to report is common," says Stancik. "It's sort of a 
natural phenomenon in bureaucracies generally. The temptation is to try to 
avoid a problem. Many times administrators want to sweep it under the carpet 
rather than risk embarrassment for the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Changes are afoot, however. In California, legislation is pending that would 
require the results of hearings into teacher misconduct to be more thoroughly 
documented and available to the public. Legislation would also do away with the 
requirement that complaints must be from firsthand sources, and would allow 
school districts to participate in state hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Utah, where anyone 14 or older can legally consent to sexual intercourse, a 
recent law makes a special case of persons in a "position of special trust in 
relation to the victim," teachers and counselors specifically. In effect, there 
is no age of consent in these cases. For a teacher to have sex with a student 
who is not an adult is a felony, regardless of consent. Punishment can range 
from five years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force in New York City is studying ways to prevent sexual misconduct 
among educators, but some strategies are already apparent, Stancik says. 
</P>
<P>
 "For actual employees, you have to make perfectly clear that the system won't 
tolerate this. You'll be thrown out and prosecuted. I think you will deter 
cases if you do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you have to tell administrators what you expect of them, specifically. If 
they have evidence, they are to report it to the appropriate law enforcement 
authority immediately. And the system should make it clear that if you don't do 
that, disciplinary action will be taken against you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the principals we've dealt with, especially since the requirements 
have been published here, do report now."

TWO O.C. BOYS DROWN DURING CHURCH PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two 12-year-old boys drowned Sunday at a church-sponsored Fourth of July pool 
party in their pastor's back yard as a crowd of children played in and around 
the swimming pool, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a state of shock," said the Rev. An Thien Vo, head pastor of the 
Vietnamese Baptist Church in Westminster. "This is almost impossible. We don't 
know why it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering in Vo's back yard was planned as a reward for young people who 
had worked hard all year in their church's youth program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys were identified as Quoc Thai Cao of Westminster and Man Minh Tran 
of Midway City. Both were described by the pastor's wife, Minh, as "very sweet 
boys who loved God." 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask other Christians to pray with us," she said, choking back tears. "The 
only thing we know to do is pray to God to help us through this." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and witnesses, the drownings occurred about 3 p.m. when 
the two boys -- described as close friends -- apparently climbed out of a 
Jacuzzi in which they were playing and, unnoticed by the church's youth 
minister who was supervising, slipped into the pool. Neither boy could swim, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later they were seen at the bottom of the pool by the youth 
minister, who summoned help while others pulled them from the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were unconscious when paramedics arrived at the house in the 9100 block 
of Daffodil Avenue, police said. The boys were pronounced dead on arrival at 
separate hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 other children were in or around the pool at the time of the 
accident, Vo said. Another 20 high school and college-age church members were 
at a house next door, watching television, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Vo, his wife and the youth minister, several parents were 
present for the festivities at the two homes, which Vo said he owns and 
frequently uses for church activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried our best," the pastor said. "This was something that nobody could 
foresee." 
</P>
<P>
 The party had begun after Sunday services at the 300-member church, during 
which the youth of the congregation -- including Cao and Tran -- had been 
commended for their success and hard work in studying the Bible during the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Minh Vo, the two boys -- who she said liked to spend time 
together -- were good students from hard-working families that had immigrated 
to the United States from Vietnam within the past three years to provide their 
children with better educations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very nice boys who were helpful to their mothers," she said, adding 
that both were fond of basketball and kickball. "I talked to them (Sunday) 
about school and they said they were doing fine, (but) complained about the 
strict rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 18 years since the church was founded, she said, nothing like this had 
ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear about this happening to other people," she said, "but when it 
happens to you, it really feels different. It really hits you." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday afternoon, church members were gathering to offer each other 
comfort at the homes of the two boys' families and at the home of their pastor, 
where the drownings had occurred only hours before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who are strong are trying to help the others," Vo said. "We are 
suffering from shock right now. This is devastating. The people have come 
together closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Minh Vo: "We're like a big family responding to a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 While she had often worried about accidents occurring during such church 
outings as camping trips, Minh Vo said, she had not expected tragedy to strike 
in her own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very careful," she said. "The pool is always fenced up and we open it 
only when we have a party. We never thought that this would happen. You worry 
about something happening and then, when it's right here and you least expect 
it, tragedy occurs." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the church, many of whose members are recent immigrants from Vietnam, 
had never before held a Fourth of July observance. "Maybe this is the last," 
she said.

BATTERED WOMEN DISCOVER LEAVING IS NO SIMPLE TASK; ABUSE: LACK OF MONEY OR 
SHELTER STOPS MANY. FEAR OF MORE VIOLENCE HOLDS BACK OTHERS. AND SOME STAY FOR 
LOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The woman leafs through cards and letters, mementos of a life that very nearly 
killed her. She picks one up and reads from it, and her face glows bright with 
remembered love and comfort. It is 1978 again; she is a newlywed, and beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was written by her husband eight weeks after they took their vows 
-- but before the rape, the death threats, the bruises that would follow, the 
head smashed on the bathroom tiles, the suicide attempts, the therapy bills. 
Before the despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really free, free to be happy," he wrote. "You are the most wonderful 
thing in my life and you are there forever. I love you, Monkey Girl." The notes 
were on the pillow in the morning, in Kat's luggage when she traveled. They 
reeled her in. They kept her close. When they no longer worked, her husband 
beat her until she could not leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, after trying several times to leave, Kat was finally gone for 
good. Why did she stay so long? "I loved him with all my heart," she says. 
"Part of the coming back was that he'd woo me back. Part of it was that he'd 
threaten me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the complex calculus that is domestic violence, there is no single answer 
to the abiding question, tinged with blame and threaded through with doubt: Why 
does a woman stay? For some, the answer is as simple as love; for others, as 
fundamental as money. It is as old as religion and as paralyzing as fear. It is 
hope and optimism, shame, guilt and the children. It is all of these things put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it is the lack of opportunity: "The reason I didn't leave him before 
was that I didn't know there were shelters," says Dianne, who is currently in 
hiding at a San Fernando Valley safe house. "I had nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply knowing about shelters is not enough to push a woman from peril to 
protection. There are but 290 shelter beds in all of Los Angeles County -- an 
area where law enforcement agencies received more than 67,000 domestic violence 
calls in 1993. Another 250 beds cover the rest of the region from Bakersfield 
to the Mexican border -- an area that recorded nearly 50,000 such calls in the 
same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shelters do not take women in on weekends or in the evening. Most do not 
allow male children over the age of 12. Most cannot accommodate women with 
disabilities. Most offer little bilingual assistance. Most require women to 
quit their jobs, pull their children out of school, make sure that the men who 
hurt them do not follow them back. Shelter life is harsh, but these rare beds 
are rarely empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question 'Why do women stay?' assumes that these women have not left, 
when many of them have," says Patricia Occhiuzzo Giggans, executive director of 
the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. "The other question often 
asked is, 'Why do they go back for more?' They don't go back for more of the 
battering. They go back for (more of) the good stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 They go back for the stuff that drew them to their partners in the first 
place. For what is largely forgotten by a public that often comes to know 
domestic violence through headlines and tabloid TV -- as with O.J. Simpson and 
Nicole Brown Simpson -- is that the violence is but one part of a complex human 
equation. 
</P>
<P>
 Love is another. "God how I loved you," Kat wrote in her hospital journal in 
the aftermath of a suicide attempt, four months after she filed for divorce. "I 
used to be unable to do anything but think about you when you were away. I 
loved lying in bed with you, eating oranges or cookies and talking and 
laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 The physical violence began in earnest two years into a marriage filled with 
verbal abuse, sexual terror, being pushed from the car and left in the middle 
of nowhere. The first assault was "stunning," she said, complete with smashed 
furniture, facial bruises, rape. 
</P>
<P>
 She left several times. He wooed her back, wrote her notes, bought her gifts. 
He terrorized her back, said he couldn't live without her, said she wouldn't 
live at all. Fear and shame kept her quiet; she never called police, visited 
the hospital, filed charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time was the worst time. She had already decided to leave him, rented 
a house in Toluca Lake, gone back to their apartment at the Marina City Club to 
gather her things, to see her cat. Her husband was gone. She fell asleep. He 
came home drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 From her journal: "Making me stand there for hours while he raved at me. 
Dragging me by my hair when he had to go to the bathroom and tying me up while 
he did. And then he raped me. Booze on his breath, his weight. The music very 
loud. The terror. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A writer, artist and former battered woman, Kat keeps a photo album of her 
many lives. She takes it with her when she speaks to volunteers on hot lines, 
teaching them the ins and outs of life amid abuse. The album shows between 
times, aftermaths, affection, despair. There is no violence in its pages, just 
a life that spirals out of control, just the love, just the pain. Her husband 
starts out handsome, becomes bloated and angry. Kat starts out a beauty, 
becomes a mannequin. "Look at that face," she says. "I look like I'm dead." 
</P>
<P>
 For this is what exists between the pull of love and the push of violence -- 
an unsteady diet of degradation and daily life, tension and tedium, what Betty 
Fisher, executive director of Haven Hills shelter in the San Fernando Valley, 
refers to as "random reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the batterer is awful, sometimes wonderful, sometimes barely there 
at all. He is controlling in ways that are hard to pinpoint, blaming, 
instructing, demanding, attentive. Kat's husband knew where she was at every 
moment, popped up when he was least expected, omnipotent. Shawn Barton's 
boyfriend cracked the code to her answering service, checked her messages 
daily. Dianne's husband was far less subtle, keeping her home without car, 
phone or money. 
</P>
<P>
 "People hear about domestic violence when the situation is extreme," says Jody 
Brown, a social psychologist with the Family Violence Research Program at the 
University of Rhode Island. "They haven't seen the build-up, the slow 
insinuation of power and control. The first time the violence happens, the 
woman thinks, 'Surely this can't be happening.' The second time she thinks, 
'Surely this can't be happening again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the paradox: The early violence is generally the mildest, the 
easiest to explain away. It leaves the greatest room for hope that the abuse 
will not recur, the greatest room for belief when the battering partner says 
that he will never do it again, the greatest chance to keep a family together. 
</P>
<P>
 But "at an unconscious level, the fact that she stays with him despite the 
violence, symbolizes for him a certain license to repeat the violence," says 
Lee Ann Hoff in "Battered Women as Survivors." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time that Dianne's husband beat her, he used a club of solid oak. He 
knocked her out and split her head open, spent five days in jail and was 
ordered to counseling. She believed him when he said he was sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoholics Anonymous and anger counseling helped for a while. But he 
discovered he could fake attendance at AA, realized that Dianne was going to 
stay. His drinking increased along with his sadism. "We had cockroaches in the 
apartment," she recalls. "He'd burn them, maim them, watch them wiggle, pour 
hot oil on them and watch them suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 He began to stay away at night, and beat her again when he reappeared. Eight 
months after the first beating, she left for good. "I simply could not and 
would not live in fear anymore," she said. But the leaving was a process. Her 
daughter helped by not helping anymore. "She just got tired of listening, tired 
of the fact that I kept going back," Dianne said. 
</P>
<P>
 She started attending Al-Anon meetings, because "I didn't have anything of 
myself left. I'd given him parts of myself that I couldn't afford to lose," she 
said. "Al-Anon gave me some of that back." She talked him into buying a car. 
And when she finally could not envision staying with him and staying alive she 
left. She had the car and the clothes on her back. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get to the point where you're afraid to smile, to say I love you," she 
said. It got to the point where I was living with a stranger. It was as if the 
man I had married had died. . . . I was afraid for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 This is what it's like to be a battered woman, a badly armed soldier in the 
most private of wars: You go in whole. You come out in pieces. You go in with 
perhaps a tenuous hold on self-respect. You come out after doing many, many 
things that you are not proud of. Or you do not come out at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone was around, he was Mr. Charm, the perfect prince," says Dianne, 
45. "I was the 'Psycho.' That was what he called his second wife, too. And his 
mother. . . . By the time I got (to the shelter) I was pretty much drained of 
all the courage I had." 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics: More than a third of all battered women frequently feel sad or 
depressed, say Richard J. Gelles and Murray A. Straus, in "Intimate Violence: 
The Definitive Study of the Causes and Consequences of Abuse in the American 
Family." Forty-six abused women in 1,000 contemplate suicide frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women who walk in these doors have so much courage," says Betty Fisher of 
Haven Hills. "It's courage brought about by desperation. Knowing what they 
know, to be able to come in here is just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Or at very least incredibly lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 First they have to reach a point where change is possible -- a process being 
studied now by Jody Brown at the University of Rhode Island. The key to change, 
says Brown, is for the woman to discover "that there is a possibility for 
something different and to know that it can happen for them." 
</P>
<P>
 They will probably relapse, returning to their violent homes. Brown describes 
this not as failure but as a natural a part of any change, be it quitting 
smoking or losing weight. "Change is dynamic, slow and incremental," Brown 
says. "It happens in stages. . . . Change does not happen all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a battered woman has reached the point where she is ready to leave she 
has to find a shelter spot that's open -- a small miracle in itself. At Haven 
House in Pasadena, bilingual outreach counselor Ana Espinoza figures that 55 
families are turned away each month, largely for lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
 If the battered woman does not find a place to stay she probably will end up 
on the street, says Linda Bodin, Los Angeles County deputy district attorney in 
charge of the domestic violence unit. "She's got the kids and she's going to 
live out of the car. . . . After three days, the money runs out. All she's got 
is what she has in her pocket, because he controls the money. And so, she goes 
home. And finally, she gets killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes she gets killed even if she does not go back. Law enforcement 
officials estimate that 29% of female homicide victims are killed by a husband 
or lover -- most often when they are trying to leave the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mary Hollis, 53, leaving became more dangerous than staying. Hollis still 
bears three small scars, reminders of a relationship that came to an end in 
Boston 27 years ago. One scar is where the bullet went in when her boyfriend -- 
whom she had left more than a month earlier -- shot her in front of her family 
and friends. The second is where surgeons poked around looking for it. The 
third, where it came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about it sometimes," says the woman, who was driven by abuse to 
hiding knives beneath her mattress and practicing how to kill her boyfriend. "I 
think about it because I'm still alive. I think about it when I hear the 
statistics about how many battered women die in the course of a week, in the 
course of a year. I think about it because I could have been one of those 
statistics." 
</P>
<P>
 Her boyfriend got a three-year suspended sentence for battering and attempted 
murder. He spent six months in a Massachusetts jail for possession of a 
firearm. Mary Hollis vowed never to be beaten again. She has kept that promise 
to herself. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think that Mary Hollis' story is an artifact of an earlier generation 
-- the justice system in the bad old days -- all you need to do is listen to 
Shawn Barton, who was not yet born when Hollis was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Barton, 25, learned the ways of battered women and abusive men on the 
campus of a pricey Southern California university. The first time her boyfriend 
raised a hand against her, they were sleeping in her dorm room underneath her 
fan. Barton got cold and turned it off. He turned it on. She turned it off 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He beat the crap out of me just for that, rolled over and went to sleep," 
says Barton, who was 22 at the time and far too frightened to leave. "I lay 
there stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared on campus unbidden, like a wraith, checking up on her, scaring her 
home. Fear kept her quiet. Anxiety kept her close at hand. Break up with him 
while still at school? No way. "I would be too vulnerable. And if I told my 
mother," Barton says, "he would have killed me." 
</P>
<P>
 She loved him at first and hated him later, thought she could save him but 
came up short. The school year ended, she moved back home and slowly, carefully 
tried to ease her way to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not work. First came the stalking. Then the death threats. Then the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't talk to him and said the relationship was over," she recounted. 
"It angered him. He took out his anger one night by setting my car on fire and 
almost burning down my house. That's how it ended." 
</P>
<P>
 She went to court. He went to jail for six months. She is safe. So far.

ANTI-IMMIGRANT MOOD HELPS FUEL CITIZENSHIP RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They hailed from more than 100 nations worldwide, a diverse gathering even by 
the polyglot standards of today's Los Angeles. Many were euphoric, some 
teary-eyed, others solemn. Most clutched tiny red, white and blue flags 
provided for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Alejandro Navarro, a onetime illegal border-jumper from Mexico, 
who, like the others, came to swear allegiance to the Stars and Stripes. "We 
feel more American than those who were born here," said Navarro, one of 14,000 
immigrants who became citizens during a Los Angeles Convention Center ceremony 
last month. "We're American by choice, by conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a powerful, and old-fashioned, way to assert their rights, 
immigrants throughout the country are signing up for citizenship in near-record 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 425,000 immigrants nationwide are expected to become citizens this 
fiscal year, rivaling a 50-year-old record set during a period of wartime 
anxiety. In the Los Angeles area, 90,000 immigrants will probably turn in green 
cards for naturalization certificates -- almost double the number last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in citizenship sign-ups reflects the peak immigration levels of the 
past decade, a period that has seen more newcomers -- both legal and illegal -- 
arrive on U.S. soil than during any other stretch in history. 
</P>
<P>
 But propelling citizenship interest now, say observers and immigrants, is a 
distinctly political factor: fear of fallout from what many call an 
anti-immigrant backlash, particularly in California. With Gov. Pete Wilson 
attacking illegal immigrants and legislators seeking cutbacks in aid for lawful 
immigrants, many have hastened to sign up for citizenship -- and the 
opportunity to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being attacked as government dependents, but most of us are 
hard-working," said Alfonso Gutierrez, a Mexican-born factory foreman who is 
applying for citizenship. "For me, the most important thing is the vote, the 
opportunity to have a say in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates have launched aggressive citizenship sign-up drives -- at 
churches, on television and radio, house-to-house and in the streets. Bus 
benches in Los Angeles' heavily Latino neighborhoods carry the message: 
Ciudadania, la mejor via ("Citizenship, the best way"). 
</P>
<P>
 Courses in English language and U.S. history and civics are booming, 
reflecting immigrants' desire to satisfy requirements for naturalization. A 
record 6,200 students are crammed into citizenship classes offered by the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizenship registration is expected to swell over the next year or more as 
eligibility kicks in for most of the more than 3 million onetime illegal 
immigrants -- more than one of four residents of greater Los Angeles -- who 
gained amnesty beginning in 1987. Some fear that the ever-lengthening queue at 
U.S. immigration offices will overwhelm an already slow-moving process, 
extending delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will the capacity be there to respond?" asked Frank Sharry, executive 
director of the National Immigration Forum, a Washington-based umbrella group 
of advocate organizations. "If not, people get frustrated. It will be a lost 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is seeking an additional $30 million to add 
citizenship staff and streamline and further automate what is often an 
intimidating and burdensome process for applicants. The House reduced the 
amount to $7.5 million, and the proposal is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that U.S. officials have historically been too passive in promoting 
citizenship, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner 
has pledged to foster citizenship as an instrument of national harmony during 
an era of growing anti-immigrant sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The naturalization process is a continuing reaffirmation that newcomers want 
to join up, that they do, by and large, share the values that those of us who 
came before share," said Meissner, the daughter of naturalized German-born 
parents. "I think that does help to ameliorate some of the tensions around 
immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 While Latino leaders and immigrant advocates have praised the commissioner's 
championing of citizen sign-ups, lawmakers and others pushing for limits on new 
immigrants are wary. Some oppose stepped-up naturalization efforts because 
citizens can more easily bring in relatives from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizenship," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), "should not be 
a priority for INS during a time when we are being smothered by an avalanche of 
illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 The boom in citizenship enrollments has buoyed activists' hopes for a united 
front against perceived immigrant-bashing. But it would be a mistake to take 
new citizens' views for granted. Polls have shown many Latinos to be as 
disturbed about illegal immigration as non-Latinos. A voter registration booth 
run by the Republican Party did a brisk business after the mass swearing-in at 
the Convention Center last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Navarro, who was arrested by immigration authorities in a Los 
Angeles shoe factory three decades ago and sent back to Mexico, now finds 
himself agreeing with Gov. Wilson. "Some people come here and just don't want 
to work," Navarro, a father of four U.S.-born children, declared after taking 
his citizenship oath. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Mariana Navarro, who renounced her Mexican citizenship alongside her 
husband, sees it otherwise. "The governor is generalizing against all Latinos," 
she said. "Immigrants work more than anyone else in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Decidedly nonpolitical factors -- cost, convenience, job opportunities and 
other personal motivations -- also impel many immigrants to become citizens. 
(Immigrants are eligible for citizenship after five years of legal residence, 
or three years if married to U.S. nationals.) Along with the right to vote, 
citizens are entitled to serve on juries and hold jobs restricted to citizens 
only, including many positions in government and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the recent new citizens is Hung Tri Tran, a 19-year-old Navy man and 
Saigon native assigned to an aircraft carrier. Tran, one of the thousands of 
Southeast Asian "boat people" who made their way to the United States by 
enduring high seas and attacks by pirates, saw his status hindering his career 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be an officer," Tran, dressed in his Navy whites, explained shortly 
after receiving his citizenship papers at the Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 For Alejandro Espinoza, citizenship is a practical matter. The 68-year-old 
father of four, originally from Mexico, is among longtime U.S. residents now 
required to turn in their old green cards for new ones. The cost is $70 for a 
document that must be renewed every 10 years. Becoming a citizen costs $20 more 
-- and is permanent unless renounced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather get it all taken care of at once and not lose any more time," 
Espinoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Espinoza (no relation), a 36-year-old auto parts salesman in Gardena, 
offers another reason: He wants to petition for his father to come to the 
United States from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But, along with the practical considerations, both Espinozas and Tran express 
desires to formalize their allegiance to their adopted land and gain voting 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great nation, and I want to be a part of it," said Hector Espinoza, 
who emigrated illegally from Mexico in 1979 and later gained amnesty. "My vote 
could make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the advantages of citizenship, recent waves of immigrants -- 
particularly those from Mexico -- have generally eschewed the privilege. Only 
slightly more than one-third of legal immigrants apply for citizenship today, 
considerably lower than the rate earlier in the century, officials say. Yet 
peak immigration levels are pushing raw citizenship numbers ever higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Sign-up rates vary dramatically depending on nationality. Asians traditionally 
have high naturalization rates -- another important reason why sign-ups have 
swollen in recent years as Asian immigration and refugee flows have increased. 
About 60% of Filipinos and 58% of Chinese, for instance, apply for citizenship, 
according to a government study of immigrants who arrived in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, only 16% of eligible immigrants from Mexico seek U.S. 
citizenship, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, officials have explained that Mexican citizens are wary of 
renouncing their homeland, often clinging to an illusion of going back, even 
after their lives take root and children are born in the United States. But 
others see low sign-up rates as a product of a confusing, costly and often 
intimidating citizenship application process. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must pay a $90 fee and fill out a four-page form, which asks a 
bewildering array of personal questions in English. Aspiring citizens are 
queried as to whether they've been Nazis, Communists, narcotics traffickers, 
prostitutes, gamblers, drunkards, tax cheats, deserters or polygamists. 
</P>
<P>
 During a subsequent interview, applicants must demonstrate an ability to speak 
and understand English -- some longtime residents older than 50 are exempted 
from this requirement -- and pass a history/civics test that encompasses themes 
from the obscure to the relevant, including: Name five of the first original 13 
states. Who is your congressman? Who wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many regard the citizenship process as hostile, particularly since the crucial 
interview is conducted by INS officers, who have long embodied newcomers' worst 
fears. "I'm hoping my English is good enough," said Juan Jose Ugarte, an 
industrial painter who has been traveling between the United States and his 
native Mexico for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 An amnesty recipient, Ugarte has little empathy for fellow immigrants who 
hesitate to become citizens based on a misplaced nostalgia for the old country. 
Ugarte tells the story of a beloved uncle who lived in California for 40 years, 
fathered nine children, but always insisted that he would go back to Mexico. 
The uncle died a few years ago -- in Los Angeles, where he is buried. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I visit his grave," Ugarte recalled with a smile, "I tell him, 'See 
uncle, you never did make it back!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The reluctance among many to apply for citizenship also stems, in part, from 
apprehensions grounded both in fact and fiction. Some fear a loss of land 
ownership and other rights back home if they acquire U.S. passports -- and, 
indeed, Mexico, South Korea and other nations limit the ownership rights of 
non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A widely circulated, albeit apocryphal, tale: Mexicans must stomp on their 
flag during swearing-in ceremonies. "That rumor still persists," said Domingo 
Rodriguez, coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District's adult 
citizenship programs. "I heard it back in the 1940s within my own family." 
</P>
<P>
 Some longtime immigrants, such as Graciela Liceaga, simply refuse to cut legal 
ties to home. Liceaga, a 34-year-old amnesty recipient and mother of four 
U.S.-born children, said she still hoped to return to her hometown near 
Guadalajara, away from the crime, fractured family life and lack of traditional 
values that she sees in her Eastside neighborhood. She has no plans to become a 
U.S. citizen, though she is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to grow old here," Liceaga said recently after an 
English-language class, which she is taking to improve her ability to speak 
with her children's teachers. "Here, one can be so alone." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to promote citizenship, immigrant advocates steer newcomers 
through the procedural morass. Staffers interview citizen-aspirants, assist 
them in filling out forms, take the required photographs and fingerprints, help 
set up appointments and arrange for instruction in English and civics. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino leaders express hope that expanded citizenship rolls will help boost 
the community's political clout -- from school board level to Capitol Hill. 
Noting that elections in some of the region's small, heavily Latino cities are 
decided by fewer than 1,000 votes, Harry Pachon, head of the Tomas Rivera 
Center, said, "I'll bet there are city council members and mayors looking at 
these (citizenship) figures with trepidation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, INS officials have bolstered citizenship staffs by one-third, 
and, in a pilot project to be launched this week, plan to interview would-be 
citizens on the grounds of a church -- a striking contrast to what many 
consider the threatening ambience of INS offices. However, officials besieged 
with an ever-expanding volume of requests have pointedly refrained from 
aggressively advertising naturalization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I promote it too much, I overwhelm my system," said Richard K. Rogers, INS 
district director. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizenship applications from the Los Angeles region have surged from fewer 
than 200 a day last fall to more than 500 daily now, as initial waves of 
amnesty immigrants begin signing up. (The first amnesty beneficiaries only 
became eligible for citizenship last fall.) 
</P>
<P>
 Experts have long theorized that amnesty recipients will be more likely to 
seek citizenship than other immigrants. Most have lived here since at least 
1982, and many were already required to study English and U.S. government and 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amnesty people have already gone through the process, they know they 
don't have to face the INS alone," said Jose de Paz, who heads the California 
Immigrant Workers Assn., a community and labor group that is encouraging people 
to sign up for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 De Paz himself finally became a citizen last month, though he has lived in the 
United States for 28 years and is the father of three U.S.-born children. "I've 
convinced hundreds of people to become citizens," said the Mexican native, "so 
I felt I had to do it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite optimistic forecasts about citizenship registrations among amnesty 
beneficiaries, initial figures show those from Mexico still lag behind other 
immigrants in becoming U.S. citizens. That shortfall is potentially significant 
because Mexican nationals account for almost three-quarters of all amnesty 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latino scholars say they expect that the number of Mexican immigrants 
seeking citizenship to rise as word of the opportunity spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Gutierrez, the factory foreman who is also an amnesty immigrant, can't 
wait to get his citizenship papers. Along with his desire to vote and 
participate in the democratic process, Gutierrez, 30, wants to petition to 
bring his wife from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my country now," Gutierrez said the other day after filling out his 
application at an East Los Angeles clinic. "I want to be able to stand up for 
the interests of my community." Citizenship Applications 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for U.S. citizenship have increased dramatically at the Los 
Angeles office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- from a daily 
average of 182 in October to a daily average of more than 500 for each of the 
last three months. The office serves a seven-county region of Southern 
California. 02,15,14 Daily Average Applications 10-93 182 11-93 306 12-93 294

14 FROM L.A. DIE IN CRASH ON TEXAS HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fourteen Los Angeles residents, 12 of them children, were killed in a fiery 
death trap Sunday when a tractor-trailer slammed into the van they were riding 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred as the van was pulling onto an interstate highway six 
miles west of this small Texas city outside of Ft. Worth. The force of the 
collision sent the van careening 500 feet down the roadway, where it burst into 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides those killed, four others in the van were injured. The driver, 
identified by the Texas Highway Patrol as Claudia Funches, 47, of Los Angeles, 
was listed in critical condition at Parkland Hospital in Dallas. Another woman 
and two children were taken to hospitals in Weatherford and Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the tractor-trailer was also injured, but not seriously, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident was one of the worst in Texas history, while other collisions 
around the state made it one of the bloodiest days ever on the state's 
highways. In all, 31 people were killed in three separate crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weatherford crash occurred about 9:30 a.m. CDT. According to the Highway 
Patrol, the 1977 Dodge van was on the side of Interstate 20 after apparently 
stalling. Officials said Funches, after restarting the car, was apparently 
moving onto the roadway when the vehicle was hit by the truck driven by Richie 
Ware, 37, of Arlington, Tex.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, the van burst into flames as the force of the impact 
pushed it onto the highway median after striking a guardrail, leaving a trail 
of clothing and twisted metal. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the 14 who died was tossed from the van. The others died inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The first to arrive at the scene was Mark Baker, a member of the nearby 
Greenwood Fire Department. He said he could see smoke and fire billowing from 
the median from two miles away. Baker said the truck driver pulled Funches and 
two children from the van and then apparently tried to douse the fire with two 
fire extinguishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he poured 300 gallons of water on the burning vehicle before other 
fire engines arrived. He said he was unaware there were others inside the 
wreckage until he was told by another firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said truck 
drivers stopped and helped a boy who stuck his head out a window, screaming for 
help because he was on fire. Cox said the truck drivers threw water on the boy, 
but the effort was in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the bodies was pulled from the wreckage at 4:40 p.m., after the 
top of the van had been cut open by firefighters using hydraulic tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said members of the National Transportation Safety Board were headed to 
the scene, and a state accident reconstruction team was also en route. He said 
the state team is expected to use "state-of-the-art" technology to reconstruct 
the crash, including a laser-imaging machine that would visually re-create the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The wreckage of the van will be transported to Ft. Worth, where the Tarrant 
County medical examiner will examine the corpses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been just an extraordinarily bloody day here in Texas," Cox said. "It's 
particularly bad to see so many children die." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the worst I've ever been to," said State Trooper Bobby Hart, 
who reported that all of those in the van were from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas authorities gave South Main Street as the Los Angeles address of Claudia 
Funches. Members of her family, gathered inside her apartment, declined to talk 
to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 State Trooper B.J. Moore said officials believe that the van passengers were 
going to a family reunion in Vicksburg, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Weatherford crash, 11 people were killed when a 
tractor-trailer slammed broadside into a pickup truck near the West Texas town 
of Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Three adults were in the pickup cab and 12 children were in its open bed when 
the accident occurred at 4:15 a.m. CDT. All of the dead were related, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another six died in a crash near Ballinger, also in West Texas. That also 
involved a tractor-trailer rig. 
</P>
<P>
 Special correspondent Henderson reported from Weatherford; staff writer 
Kennedy reported from Los Angeles. Staff writer Nicholas Riccardi also 
contributed to this story. Van Crash Victims 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, the Texas Department of Public Safety identified the Los 
Angeles residents killed or injured in a fiery van crash. Investigators said 
they did not know the addresses of most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those who died: 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor Simpson, 10; Nicholas Simpson, 9; Rochelle Wince, 2; Rochelle Cummings, 
1; Jovanea Rivas, 1; Henriella Funches, 30; Lavar Funches, 7; Latricia Funches, 
6; Danisha Funches, 5; Darren Funches, 5; Eric Bell, 7 months; Katherine Deal, 
28; Lashawn Wingfield, 11, and Michael Johnson, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those who were hurt: 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Funches, 47; her daughter, Nicole (age unavailable); Greg Bell, 4, and 
Ricky Wince, 4.

COLUMN ONE; PC FUN FLOURISHES AT WORK; THE GROWTH OF COMPUTER NETWORKS SPAWNS A 
BOOM IN GAMES AT THE OFFICE. SOME BOSSES ZAP THEM, BUT OTHERS SEE THEM AS 
ASSETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The weeknight scene at the offices of New Media Corp. is enough to mortify an 
unsuspecting security guard or janitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds of gunfire and maniacal screams emanate from the engineering 
department. From somewhere among the cubicles, a gravelly voice says: "I'm 
coming after you, and I got a big gun." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no lunatic loose in the corridors. It's just Rod Corder's team of 
engineers playing their favorite computer network game, a gut-wrenching science 
fiction combat free-for-all known as Doom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our way of dealing with stress," said Corder, co-founder of the computer 
components manufacturer and vice president of engineering. "We work at 90 
m.p.h. all day long. The games keep us working after hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies like Corder's see the benefits of computer games in the workplace. 
But many others say unchecked gaming can kill productivity, consume computing 
resources and even hurt a firm's image. Critics, who are viewed as party 
poopers by the advocates of game playing, also say computer games encourage 
addictive behavior and shoddy work habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The corporate environment doesn't tolerate game playing for very long," said 
Richard Weinberg, a psychologist at the University of South Florida in Tampa 
who authored a report on computer games. "It doesn't pay to pay people to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies have begun to create policies to control game playing, 
especially since Doom surfaced last December as a cult hit at computer firms, 
which have been especially prone to employee game playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend has grown because of changing technology. Unlike the older 
centralized mainframe computers, where an administrator could monitor every 
task being performed throughout a network, inexpensive networks of PCs allow 
employees to load and use their own software. Such PCs can play the same games 
as home PCs but with even better results, because they are more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 And, played on these powerful machines, the games are also more realistic, and 
therefore potentially more addictive. New technologies and cheaper computer 
horsepower mean that multimedia games often appeal to adults as much as to 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 At some companies, there is no debate. Once games are discovered, they're 
dumped in the electronic equivalent of the garbage can. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn your back, some bosses believe, and everyone from executives to clerks 
will play computer games. Some people say they get more satisfaction from games 
than their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 American workers typically spend half a billion hours a year playing computer 
games at a cost of $10 billion in lost productivity, according to SBT Corp., a 
San Rafael, Calif., accounting firm that surveyed 6,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PC is like TV," said David Harris, SBT vice president. "It's whatever you 
make of it. It can be used for education, but many people are using it to goof 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply banning computer games, however, isn't going to produce a dramatic gain 
in productivity, according to Sabine Helmers, an anthropologist at the Social 
Science Centre in Berlin who is studying computers in the workplace. Removing 
games can be perceived as an "act of distrust" that strains relations between 
managers and subordinates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was there no waste of time before the introduction of computers at the 
workplace?" Helmers asks. "The best way (to deal with game playing) seems to be 
to find out how to motivate people enough that they will find it more 
interesting to do their job than to play a dull computer game." 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Helmers said, employers should consider the psychological 
boost that comes from game playing, rather than just fret about lost 
productivity. In any case, game playing is often a fad that runs its course 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Using such arguments, many companies with laid-back management styles justify 
game playing. It is part of the milieu at places where fun policies, such as 
casual wear on Fridays, are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, games can even be good for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Arbuckle, 50, loves playing a tank battle game called Spectre VR during 
work hours. Players control tanks and shoot each other on a futuristic 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbuckle can get away with it because he's the owner of Arbuckle's Tattoo and 
Piercing Emporium in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In fact, Arbuckle said he has found 
that game playing helps draw a crowd to his store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let our employees and our customers play the game with their own 
discretion," he said. "Sometimes we stay after work playing it for three or 
four hours. We have to stop and help customers when they come. But this passes 
time when it's slow." 
</P>
<P>
 Banned or not, gaming is considered a sanity saver by some beleaguered 
white-collar employees in Orange County's high-tech entrepreneurial belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing games (after hours) is a kind of benefit here," says Richard Nadolny, 
a technical writer at NetSoft Inc. in Aliso Viejo in south Orange County. 
"People work here because they like an environment where you can wear tie-dye 
shirts. We don't have to come here, punch a clock and have our calls monitored. 
We do get our work done." 
</P>
<P>
 But Doom sapped NetSoft's computer network of so much power that President 
Isaac (Zak) Kong had to confine game playing to after business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest gaming rage at TouchStone Software Corp. in Huntington Beach isn't 
as violent as at New Media Corp. Nonetheless, it produces screaming; 
programmers have taken to nightly bouts with the network version of the card 
game Hearts. Sigmund Fidyke, TouchStone's vice president of development, says 
he joins the electronic card games because it builds team spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 As a salaried employee, Tam Pham, TouchStone's head programmer, doesn't get 
overtime pay when he and colleagues work late to meet a deadline. Thus, games 
are considered a fringe benefit when he has to stay beyond the typical 9-to-5 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many others, Pham picked up his computer game addiction in college; he 
used to skip classes to play so-called dungeon games with other students around 
the world via the global communications network known as the Internet. 
(Australia and some universities have banned multi-player dungeon games because 
they consumed too much of computing resources.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pham says he has tamed his obsessive side, but he still likes to play games 
because it soothes him so he can return to a frustrating problem with a fresh 
viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidyke, Pham's boss, buys that argument, but other managers view such 
explanations as mere excuses for goofing off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't tolerate it because it sends the wrong message about what we're all 
about," said Ken Forbes, president of Adaptive Software Inc. in Irvine. "If I 
allowed it, they would think I was playing games behind closed doors too." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Marine, Forbes said he likes to set a good example for his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers have a good legal case against game-playing employees, said Howard 
Derman, an Irvine human resources consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Derman said companies can argue that game playing is improper use of company 
equipment, an abuse of company time, harmful to the corporate image and even 
that it promotes potentially addictive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Seide, marketing manager for Kingston Technology Corp. in Fountain Valley, 
said games were not an issue at the computer board manufacturer until pirated 
games played during office hours introduced destructive computer viruses. 
Within weeks, all games were banned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, not everyone goes along," he said. "But we do deal with the most 
egregious violations. In our case, the viruses brought the issue to the 
forefront and spoiled it for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun, a clerk at a firm in New Zealand, said he played dungeon games on the 
Internet for 14 hours a day -- starting at home in the morning and continuing 
at work -- until his supervisor took away his computer account. Now he plays at 
home on a personal account that cuts off his access after 90 minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial psychologist Nancy Haller, president of Applied Psychometrics, a 
management consulting firm in San Diego, said one client played games at the 
office so often that it interfered with her work. Such behavior is clearly 
addictive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives her a sense of mastery when nothing else seemed like it was under 
control," Haller said. "It's an escape and a way to avoid issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Haller stresses that not all game players are addicts. If the game playing 
doesn't affect work performance, it can be positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's managers also must deal with such other modern obsessions as employees 
who dial into computer bulletin boards to chat with people around the world, 
gaze at X-rated pictures on the Internet, and play adventure games over phone 
lines. Such activities, while seemingly benign, can expose the company to 
sexual harassment lawsuits or other liabilities. Overall, computer-related 
distractions can cost companies as much as $100 billion in productivity a year, 
according to the SBT survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fits in the category of developing policies to deal with how to use 
electronic mail or voice mail," said Allan Halcrow, editor in chief of 
Personnel Journal in Costa Mesa. "I know that people have been fired for 
playing games on company time." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of games at work also reflects greater stress at the office. Under 
pressure, addiction-prone people resort to games as an easy way to let off 
steam at their desks, said Joseph Cassius, a Memphis, Tenn., psychologist who 
has studied computer addictions and is co-author of the study "How Games Play 
People." 
</P>
<P>
 "For workers, it's a way of escaping from society," he said. "During working 
hours, employers have expectations and some people will rebel. It's hard to 
control everything that goes on in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the spread of PC networks into offices, game playing is no longer 
just the domain of programmers. Traveling salespeople can while away the hours 
on planes and in airports with the games stored on their laptop computers. They 
can play with no fear of being monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretaries taking a break from word processing can pull up a game of 
Solitaire or Minesweeper, in which a player tries to uncover hidden land mines 
without being blown up. The games are standard programs in Microsoft Corp.'s 
Windows and Windows for WorkGroups office software packages.  
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft maintains that it isn't undermining its own productivity software. 
The free games it includes teach workers how to use a computer mouse and take 
the fear out of computing, said Tony Garcia, product manager of Microsoft's 
entertainment unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies' computer network administrators often serve as enforcers. Using 
special programs, they can detect which employees store games on their PCs. 
They can erase the games, but workers then sometimes find another way to hide 
them. This cat-and-mouse game goes on for a while until the employee gets the 
message: Quit playing or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 People at offices have learned to be sly. They can use programs that have a 
"boss key," or a button that instantly switches the computer screen from a game 
to a work program when the boss comes near. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that management usually doesn't know about," said Tom Craft, 
president of T & T Research Inc., a computer engineering firm in Irvine. "Some 
of our people who left were pretty tricky. We didn't know they had the games on 
their disk drives until they left." 
</P>
<P>
 Even game companies -- where playing games can be considered research -- have 
rules. At Interplay Productions Inc. in Irvine, playing games by modem, which 
results in hefty phone bills, isn't permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let the employees play games as much as the boss plays games," joked Alan 
Pavlish, executive producer at the multimedia game company, who says fewer than 
10 hours a week is about right. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavlish uses the honor system. His employees are expected to play games only 
if it helps them professionally. If they play for fun, they are expected to do 
it on their own time. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer game companies say they are not conspiring to destroy American 
productivity. But some, like id Software, the Texas-based maker of Doom, have 
benefited from targeting games at the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's Garcia says the next version of Windows will also have a game in 
it. He believes network games are a good testing ground for the interactive 
games that will be distributed on the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Network games -- as opposed to games confined to a single PC -- will expand 
the beachhead in their invasion of the workplace. Jay Wilbur, general manager 
at id Software, says the sequel to Doom will be out in October. And the lessons 
of the original are not lost on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now on," he says, "all of our games will run on networks."

QUAKE FUNERAL GRANTS EXCEED OFFICIAL TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The official death toll for the Northridge earthquake was 58, yet the state 
has received 374 requests for grants to pay funeral expenses for quake victims, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The state already has awarded disaster-related funeral grants for 117 people, 
including one man who hanged himself over the loss of his job from the Jan. 17 
quake and another who died of valley fever more than two months after the 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The deceased for whom grants were given ranged in age from a prematurely born 
baby to a 94-year-old heart attack victim. More than half the deaths were 
caused by heart attacks that followed the earthquake or aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the total bill to taxpayers is $431,129, and 138 requests for funeral 
grants are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a little-known disaster relief program, anyone -- regardless of personal 
income -- can receive up to $6,000 for burial and $2,500 for cremation of 
family members whose deaths were directly attributable to the quake or hastened 
by the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, just a small part of nearly $12 billion in federal quake relief, 
is administered by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 If a doctor determines the death to be disaster-related, "we don't question 
it," said Liz Brady of the state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral grants are available only to those without other financial aid, such 
as private insurance or assistance from the Red Cross, which helped pay for 14 
quake-related funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, citing privacy laws, refused to identify the dead or the 
doctors who certified the deaths as quake-related. 
</P>
<P>
 But interviews and documents obtained under the California Public Records Act 
show that the families of about half the 58 quake victims identified by 
coroner's offices in Southern California received funeral grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Among these victims were people killed in car accidents and trapped in 
collapsed buildings, including the Northridge Meadows Apartments, where 16 
perished. 
</P>
<P>
 Many quake victims whose families received grants were in fragile health and 
died of "earthquake-related stress," officials said. Among those afforded 
government-paid funerals was a man who hanged himself May 17. His doctor said 
he was despondent because he lost his job after the quake, state officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A grant also went to the family of a woman who died of cancer in March in 
Arizona. The 83-year-old woman was in Northridge the day of the quake and 
suffered broken ribs and a crushed spine. Because of the cancer, "she 
apparently wasn't able to heal properly," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 One grant was paid to the family of a truck driver who died April 3 of valley 
fever. Some health officials have said the quake may have churned up the 
fungus-laden dust that causes the respiratory illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But a local health official said the truck driver's death was more likely 
caused by his frequent travel to the San Joaquin Valley, where valley fever is 
endemic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor certified it was earthquake-related," Brady said. "We're not in a 
position . . . to refute a doctor's statement." 
</P>
<P>
 The government also paid the funeral expenses of a person who died of exposure 
after refusing out of fear to go inside after the quake. And it paid for the 
funeral of a person who died when his kidney dialysis machine failed during a 
blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the deaths occurred in the San Fernando Valley, but they were 
scattered throughout Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner said that he was surprised at 
the number of funeral grants but that his office is in "no position to refute" 
a doctor's finding that a death was quake-related. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are we to say?" said spokesman Scott Carrier. "We're not here to police 
the doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner counted 57 casualties from the quake -- a 
figure also used as the official death toll by the state Office of Emergency 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Bernardino County coroner's office reported one quake-related death -- 
a woman who was "scared to death," said a coroner's official, but that death 
does not qualify for a funeral grant because the presidential disaster 
declaration is limited to Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. No 
quake-related deaths were reported by coroners in Orange and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation for the difference between the official toll and the number of 
funeral grants given is that the coroner's office does not investigate every 
death. The coroner is required to investigate deaths of people who had not seen 
a physician for 60 days or died as a result of trauma, such as being trapped in 
a collapsed building. 
</P>
<P>
 But deaths from natural causes, such as heart attacks, are not routinely 
subject to coroner's review, and determination of whether the death was 
quake-related is left to the attending physician. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's list also does not include any deaths that 
occurred after Jan. 25. "We had no other cases reported to us," Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hurricane Andrew, Florida officials limited payouts to deaths that 
occurred within 48 hours of the hurricane. They issued a dozen funeral grants. 
</P>
<P>
 California has never placed a time limit on funeral grants for 
disaster-related deaths. State officials noted that a body was recovered from a 
collapsed freeway more than 48 hours after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. 
The state issued 41 funeral grants in that quake, which claimed 63 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all requests for funeral grants have been approved. One was denied to the 
family of a man who died on a golf course shortly after the Northridge 
earthquake. "The doctor wouldn't certify it was earthquake-related because it 
was a pre-existing condition," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, state officials said they received a number of requests for 
funeral aid to bury pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we denied the request for the horse funeral and dog funeral," said 
Scott Gregerson of the Department of Social Services.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides the 
bulk of the money for the funeral grants, said they were satisfied with the 
state's administration of the funeral grant program. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials said they leave it up to states to determine who qualifies for 
grants, although the agency later will review the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible expenses include funeral home costs, purchasing plots, transporting 
the body or ashes, death certificates, one spray of flowers and memorial 
markers. Ineligible are special clothing, transportation for family members and 
reception expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A state official suggested that perhaps the state should refer its list to the 
coroner "to decide if they should revise the death toll."

STATE'S SPACE FIRMS ADAPT TO NEW MISSION -- SURVIVAL; BUSINESS: INDUSTRY IS 
BUFFETED BY BUDGET FIGHTS, FOREIGN COMPETITION. COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS HELP FILL 
VOID.

 Kim Garvey, an engineer at McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Huntington Beach, well 
remembers her seventh birthday. It was July 20, 1969 -- the day of the first 
moon landing. "I can remember no one was paying any attention to me on my 
birthday," she recalls. "Everybody was watching TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Now on the verge of her 32nd birthday and the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 
11 lunar mission, Garvey works on the team designing the proposed space 
station, including the trusses that would form the station's backbone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garvey and the rest of California's space industry face a far more 
uncertain future than their predecessors did in the 1960s, when the United 
States had a singular goal -- beat the Soviet Union to the moon -- and spared 
little effort or expense to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
 That golden era has long passed, replaced by a U.S. space program whose 
mission is debated constantly and whose funding is an annual tug-of-war in 
Congress. Partly as a result, the space business is trying to ensure its 
survival with its own form of defense conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The $14 billion being spent by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration this year is 14% less than the agency spent in 1969 after 
adjusting for inflation, according to a calculation by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Garvey and the space station are symptomatic of the fiscal problems 
facing the space industry in California, which remains the industrial hub of 
NASA just as it was 2 1/2 decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA last year made huge changes in the station's design and teamed up with 
the Russians to cut the station's costs and get it aloft quicker. Garvey and 
her colleagues had spent four years working on the station's propulsion system, 
but "my job went away" last year after Russians assumed that role, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was lucky enough to find work on other parts of the station, but her new 
job is not secure either. After much debate, Congress looks ready to approve 
another $2.1 billion for the station for this year, but the process must be 
repeated next year and each year after that. Each year, the station could be 
canceled altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," Garvey said. "It would be nice if there were multiyear 
budgets where you knew for the next five years if there was going to be a 
stable program." 
</P>
<P>
 Budget squabbles aren't the only hurdles for the state's space industry. There 
are fewer contracts to build defense satellites and other military space gear 
because of Pentagon spending cuts. Worldwide competition in markets such as 
launch rockets is getting more intense. 
</P>
<P>
 These pressures have been building for years and have forced California's 
space industry to slash costs or merge. The state has lost about 30,000 space 
jobs since the mid-1980s, including 1,700 lost at the McDonnell plant in 
Huntington Beach, which now employs 6,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, space is still a huge business in California -- and will remain 
so even if the space station eventually is canceled.  
</P>
<P>
 The largest share of NASA's annual budget, about $4 billion, still goes to 
California firms. That spending directly employs 37,000 people, or 24% of all 
NASA-funded jobs, the highest level in the nation, according to the governor's 
office. Some 4,000 of those jobs are dedicated to the space station. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of space-related jobs in California is probably closer to 
60,000 when contracts from the Pentagon, foreign customers and commercial 
clients are included. Throw in the jobs indirectly tied to space and the number 
climbs well above 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also hundreds of engineers, scientists and computer experts at firms 
that provide extra brainpower and services to the space industry. They include 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, and Aerospace Corp. and Computer 
Sciences Corp., both in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 All have had to tighten their belts because of the drop in U.S. space 
spending. But many also are developing products for commercial users, and those 
customers are funneling an ever-growing number of dollars into California's 
space industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go back a few years ago, there was almost no commercial space market," 
said Daniel Goodman, an analyst at EDS Management Consulting Services in 
Washington. "Its growth has been remarkable."  
</P>
<P>
 No one is exactly sure how big that market is, but consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft Co. is launching a commercial 
satellite-to-home TV service called DirecTV, is building Malaysia's first 
communications satellite, and plans to launch a $660-million, twin-satellite 
system dubbed Spaceway that would provide "on demand" telecommunications 
services early in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lockheed Corp.'s Sunnyvale-based space group, a leading satellite builder 
for the U.S. government, is also making satellites for Motorola's Iridium 
cellular telephone project and marketing Russian-built rockets to other launch 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * NASA's biggest contractor, Seal Beach-based Rockwell International, is using 
the Pentagon's satellite-based global positioning system to develop electronic 
maps for Oldsmobile cars and tracking-data devices for commercial truck fleets. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRW's space group in Redondo Beach, a leading builder of defense and 
scientific satellites, recently won a $61-million contract to build the first 
satellite for Taiwan's new civilian space program. TRW also is using space 
technology to enhance the features of its vehicle air-bag restraint business. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are hustling for these markets because they don't expect a rebound 
in NASA and Pentagon spending for space before the next century. "We look at 
NASA's prospects at best as flat," said Mel R. Brashears, vice president of 
Lockheed's Space Systems Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as promising as the commercial market might be, it is unclear whether 
those sales will ever grow large enough to offset the loss of government space 
contracts and fill the void left by the massive layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we are looking at opportunities in commercial and international space 
arenas, they will not be a big portion of our business in the near future," 
said Fred Brown, vice president for group development at TRW's space unit. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some space experts believe, the number of workers is not expected 
to grow much and long-term job security will virtually disappear. "Even though 
we expect to do more (commercial) dollar work in the future, we also expect to 
be more efficient," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Cepavicius, a 39-year McDonnell Douglas veteran in Huntington Beach, 
where McDonnell built a part of the Saturn V rocket that lifted Apollo 11 to 
the moon, said not many younger people will have careers in space as long as 
his. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not going to be as many long-term programs," said Cepavicius, now 61 
and a tooling inspector on the space station project. "You're going to see very 
few people like myself with 40 years" in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet others are more optimistic, saying commercial and foreign customers will 
provide the state's industry with substantial growth in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Ramo, 81, co-founder and former chairman of TRW, said the burgeoning 
commercial markets, combined with the "continued need" for U.S. research and 
military spacecraft, will give the industry annual sales "substantially in 
excess" of those in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS' Goodman said the much-heralded information superhighway of the future 
will rely heavily on satellites, in addition to ground-based wired 
communications systems. "But it's going to take longer than people had hoped," 
at least a decade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime the space industry is still retrenching -- and many 
Californians are still losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, Martin Marietta Corp. said it will move most of its Atlas 
rocket business from San Diego to Denver, where the company builds its Titan 
rockets. About 1,400 jobs will be transferred, 400 will be eliminated and 300 
will remain in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell Chairman Donald R. Beall, whose company built the Apollo 11 command 
module and the space shuttles, noted that Rockwell is also under pressure to 
keep cutting the shuttle fleet's operating costs in the face of NASA's tight 
budgets.  
</P>
<P>
 That means doing the same work with fewer people, and "it will be difficult to 
keep it (space employment) where it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four shuttles were manufactured and are still repaired by Rockwell at its 
plants in Downey, Palmdale and Edwards Air Force Base, and its Rocketdyne unit 
in Canoga Park builds the shuttles' main engines. (Rockwell's fifth shuttle was 
the Challenger, which exploded in 1986.) 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Rockwell workers in Palmdale finished a $74-million upgrade of the 
shuttle Atlantis, which is scheduled to fly again in October. But they also 
began modifying Atlantis so the shuttle can eventually dock with the 
U.S.-Russian space station. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the state, TRW -- which built the smaller engine for the lunar 
landing craft that lowered Neil Armstrong and Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. to the 
moon's Sea of Tranquillity -- today builds communications, observatory and 
early warning defense satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples: Tracking and data relay satellites, which form the backbone of 
NASA's space-to-ground communications; satellites that analyze the Earth's 
ozone layer, and scientific and intelligence satellites for the Defense 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, besides working on the Iridium project, assembled and serviced the 
Hubble Space Telescope and services the shuttle fleet between launches. The 
company also is launching a business, called Space Imaging, to provide 
commercial high-resolution images of Earth taken from satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas, in addition to its space station, is developing a radical 
launch rocket called the Delta Clipper-Experimental. The rocket blasts off and 
lands vertically and is one of several "single-stage-to-orbit" rockets that are 
being developed as potential alternatives to the shuttles, whose missions cost 
$360 million apiece on average. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the research into what space vehicles will be used in the future, 
the shuttles keep flying -- keeping Rockwell as NASA's biggest supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the shuttle operating for the next 20 or 30 years," Beall said. But he 
knows that with NASA budgets shrinking, Rockwell must keep reducing the cost of 
flying the shuttle -- or risk accelerating Uncle Sam's search for a cheaper, 
replacement space vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the next century, it is possible that Rockwell will be asked to build 
more shuttles. A permanent space station could be orbiting the Earth. A manned 
trip to Mars might be given serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 All would help protect California's space industry and its workers. But those 
scenarios are expensive, so none is likely to happen without first sparking 
intense debate over whether the projects are worth taxpayers' money. In any 
case, the industry by then could be supported more by commercial sales than by 
NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a far cry from the days of the Apollo program, said TRW's Brown. 
"There's clearly been a major change," he said. "All of it revolves around the 
fact we don't have the Soviet Union to compete with anymore." Major Space Sites

look at some of the industry's major facilities:

FOREST FIRE THREATENS DESERT RESORT TOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two homes were destroyed Sunday and 500 were threatened as a forest fire raged 
out of control in Riverside County, sweeping perilously close to several resort 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials evacuated 250 homes in the well-to-do Pinyon Pines area and shut 
down California 74 for 16 miles south of Palm Desert. "There's white ash all 
over everything," said Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt. John Sebastian. 
</P>
<P>
 Desert-view resort towns including Pinyon Crest, Alpine Village and Pinyon 
Flats were also threatened as the fire -- sparked by lightning that struck a 
tree in the San Bernardino National Forest on Friday -- grew to engulf 14,000 
acres by Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the blackened acreage was in the national forest, with the 
remainder on Bureau of Land Management and private property, said Mary Bowman, 
a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were hampered Sunday by steep terrain, 100-degree-plus heat and 
wind gusts of up to 20 m.p.h., she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resources are stretched thin and firefighters are tired," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a 1,000-acre fire burned out of control near Lake Arrowhead and Big 
Bear Sunday evening, where authorities evacuated several area campgrounds and 
closed California 173 between Lake Arrowhead and the desert community of Mojave 
Narrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday, the blaze was burning three miles northeast of Lake Arrowhead and 
eight miles northwest of Big Bear, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside County fire, which began in the national forest near Pinyon 
Pines, covered little more than 100 acres on its first day, officials said. But 
it jumped wildly out of control Saturday and doubled in size Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials Sunday evening said they could not predict when the fire might 
be contained. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 firefighters were working on the blaze, aided by 12 air tankers, 
Forest Service spokeswoman Ruth Wenstrom said. The steep terrain also played 
havoc with cellular phone connections, adding to firefighters' problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The two blazes capped a week in which wildfires charred more than 30,000 acres 
at more than a dozen sites in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 A small fire, south of Idyllwild near Lake Hemet, was contained Sunday 
morning. It had threatened a housing development and forced evacuation of a 
campground, but no buildings were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters on Saturday controlled another lightning-induced fire near the 
small community of Sage in southern Riverside County, which burned about 160 
acres.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; NO SUMMER LULL FOR FEINSTEIN, HUFFINGTON; 
TRADITIONALLY, THE HEAVY SLUGGING DOESN'T START TILL FALL. BUT THE ATTACK ADS 
ALREADY ARE FLYING FAST AND FURIOUS IN WHAT MANY EXPECT WILL BE THE COSTLIEST 
UPPER-HOUSE RACE IN U.S. HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a month after the two U.S. Senate candidates engaged in their first 
television clash, both sides are locked in a multimillion-dollar exchange of 
attack commercials that has left experts wondering when the fighting will end. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for the second time in the race, Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) responded almost overnight to a new commercial from Democratic Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, proving again just what a candidate willing to spend millions 
of his own dollars can accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the traditional summer lull when campaigns usually regroup and 
prepare for the fall has been delayed longer than some expected. And although 
the race is expected to temporarily cool soon, what is at stake for the White 
House and the two national political parties in the California race also is 
likely to keep it on high alert throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy; it's a marathon," said Huffington campaign manager Bob Schuman. 
"We are kind of in a fall mode already. There was no lull after the primary. . 
. . I just don't know where it goes next." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the campaign has been dominated by both candidates trying to spotlight 
the other's flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has sought to define her opponent by charging that he is not a 
Californian because he moved to the state in 1991. She has also accused him of 
inadequately representing his constituents in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, meanwhile, has tried to tap voters' anger with government by 
portraying Feinstein as a typical politician controlled by powerful special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington made that point in his last television commercial with one of the 
most vicious attacks of the campaign: "Feinstein is a special-interest jukebox 
-- put in your money and get what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-second spot was made in Washington and shipped to California through 
special fiber-optic lines just hours after Feinstein's second ad of the 
campaign hit the state's airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic commercial, workers at a manufacturing company in 
Huffington's congressional district complain that the GOP lawmaker refused to 
help them gain access to a foreign market and that their jobs were saved only 
when Feinstein stepped in. The reference was to Raytheon Corp. and the Clinton 
Administration's recent action to allow it and other U.S. companies to sell 
military technology to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Huffington declined Raytheon's request for help, saying it would 
put him in the role of a lobbyist for a single corporation. When Raytheon 
subsequently went to Feinstein, she wrote letters to the Administration on 
behalf of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's response ad charged that Feinstein was motivated to help Raytheon 
by two $1,000 contributions the company gave her within days of her letters -- 
one to Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the other to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein's campaign says voters will see that the senator was trying to 
help the struggling California economy and save jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came down to a decision of, basically, did we want to have California jobs 
go to France or stay in America?" said Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata. 
"You cannot portray these workers in his county as being some evil interest. He 
should be ashamed of himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing television feud confirms an assessment of this race by political 
insiders who now believe that Feinstein will have a tough fight for reelection, 
that the race will be particularly nasty and that it will probably be the most 
expensive Senate contest in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-May, finance records showed Huffington had spent more than $6 million 
of his own money on the campaign, money he made in the 1990 sale of his 
family's Texas petroleum company. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, his campaign has been on television almost uninterruptedly at a 
cost estimated by political media buyers at from $200,000 to $700,000 per week. 
His move last week to respond quickly to Feinstein was exceptionally expensive, 
buyers said, because Huffington was forced to pay premium rates for purchasing 
specific times at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign also has been on television consistently for the past 
four weeks. But media buyers estimated that she has spent slightly less than 
Huffington in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 With more money, Huffington's campaign has proven itself to be tough on both 
offense and defense. In the spring, he attacked Feinstein's record in 
Washington for weeks, causing her support to shrink and opinion polls to 
tighten. Then, when she tried to fight back with her own message, he quickly 
counterattacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most competitive political campaigns are about allocating scarce resources 
and, many times, who wins or loses is determined by who strategically plays the 
game better," said Republican political consultant Sal Russo. "When you have as 
much money as Huffington is willing to commit to this campaign, he has 
eliminated one major reason why most campaigns lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at Claremont Graduate School, said 
Huffington also has been helped by his quick responses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he blew her out of the water," Jeffe said. "Feinstein did not respond 
(at first), and when she did, she did not respond well. It astounds me that the 
media he has produced has been so quick and so powerfully done and her early 
media just wasn't focused and wasn't powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager, said he is confident that the Raytheon 
workers portrayed in the Democratic commercial are more believable than the 
computer graphics and headlines used in Huffington's quick response ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he acknowledged that Huffington is likely to continue to outspend 
Feinstein on television, he said he is confident the senator's record will 
prove more attractive than Huffington's alternative when voters take a closer 
look at both candidates as the election nears. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwata said he would be more concerned about Huffington's financial advantage 
"if he had a vision of California or if he could say, 'This is what I have done 
and that is why I deserve to be your senator.' . . . He has no message. And you 
cannot win because you have mechanics and money. You have to stand for 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffe agreed the race will be determined by more than who spends the most 
money. And, she noted, it is still early in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's July," she said. "The election is not over until November and that is an 
eternity in politics. Two eternities."

POCKET OF PARADISE; FOR THREE GENERATIONS, LIFE IN GILLIBRAND CANYON HAS BEEN A 
FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago, when Juanita Brooks began planning a massive family reunion at 
her home in Gillibrand Canyon above Simi Valley, the third-generation Ventura 
County resident mailed hundreds of invitations to relatives around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens more family members were easier to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, 59, simply strolled along the curving road that cuts through the 
canyon that was named after her pioneer grandfather and knocked on the doors of 
her cousins, children, nieces and nephews to alert them about the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all lived up here all our lives," Brooks said. "There's a beauty and a 
peace here that keeps us here, makes us realize that there's no reason to go 
anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed the sleepy, shaded canyon four miles north of Simi Valley up Tapo 
Canyon Road is a tiny pocket of rural life locked in a time warp, far from the 
strip malls and sprawling housing tracts that make up much of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the Gillibrands ride horses, bale hay, walk barefoot down dusty roads 
and cross one another's unfenced lawns, passing through unlocked doors for 
shared meals and reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of some 20 homes lining the canyon, about 15 belong to Gillibrand offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid and I tried to spend the night at friends' houses in Simi 
Valley, I would always have to leave because I felt claustrophobic," said 
Melissa Brooks, 39, Juanita Brooks' daughter. "Here you feel open and free and 
safe and you're surrounded by people you love." 
</P>
<P>
 From one home to the next, evidence of the Gillibrand genes abounds in the 
tall, athletic builds, the large cornflower-blue eyes, the honey-brown hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all grew up together, so there's a sense of stability and security," said 
Harlene Holeman, 48, a cousin of Brooks'. 
</P>
<P>
 When Holeman's house crumbled in the Jan. 17 earthquake, she found refuge next 
door with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all got this incredibly strong sense of community and history," Holeman 
said. "All we have to do is go down to Simi Valley or Los Angeles to see how 
lucky we are." 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of Gillibrand Canyon began with a case of tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Leyland Gillibrand, Brooks' grandmother, was diagnosed with TB in 1886, 
spurring her husband, Edward Clayton Gillibrand, to shut down his silk-spinning 
shop in Manchester, England, to seek a better climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by the promise of adventure and cheap land in the American West, he 
decided to try his luck as a California cowboy. The Gillibrands sailed into 
Port Hueneme and headed for the hills, settling on 6,000 acres of prime grazing 
land north of what is now Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Edward Gillibrand made a surprising and lucrative discovery: His 
land was atop a 12-million-year-old mound of oyster and scallop shells, the 
largest known deposit of its kind in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The family set about mining the fossilized shells, whose pure calcium content 
is valued for use in flour, medicine and chicken feed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ellen Gillibrand furnished the ranch house with fine English linens 
and silks and filled a formal English garden with fragrant, colorful blooms and 
a flock of peacocks. 
</P>
<P>
 A century later the cattle are gone, as are most of the shells. The family 
property has shrunk to about 1,000 acres, and the old Gillibrand house is just 
a memory. Having deteriorated over the years, it finally succumbed to the 
recent earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 All that remains of the elegant garden are several dozen peacocks, who spend 
their days sunning near the empty, quake-cracked swimming pool and perching in 
the low branches of centuries-old oaks, their screeches echoing through the 
quiet canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members who work outside the canyon say leaving each day makes them 
appreciate coming home even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a refuge," said Debbie Sandland, 40, a Gillibrand grandchild who 
serves on the Simi Valley school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, David, 40, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived all over the place, but this is the best place I've ever lived," 
he said. "Just a few miles away you've got all the freeways and shopping 
centers you could ever want. Then you come up here and it's paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise is not without its problems. The dry hillsides keep the clan on 
constant watch for brush fires; Juanita Brooks has witnessed 10 especially 
destructive fires in her lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 17 brought another reminder of nature's mighty force. The Northridge 
quake sent truck-sized boulders crashing down the canyon walls into three 
corrals, two barns and a shed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mess," Brooks said. "The cleanup is going to go on for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' granddaughter, 13-year-old Ashley, has another concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like being so far away from everything," she said. "My friends who 
live in Simi Valley can just walk to shops, but when my mom's busy and my 
grandma's working, I have no ride." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, though, Ashley said she enjoys canyon life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my own horse, and it's worth it for that," she said. "I also like 
being so close to my grandmother and having so much space." 
</P>
<P>
 In that space are many relics of the past, including an old family cemetery -- 
one of the few remaining private graveyards in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Used to be lots of people had private cemeteries," Brooks said. "But land got 
too valuable, so folks dug up the bodies and sold the land." 
</P>
<P>
 The marble headstones and withered bouquets all memorialize Gillibrand 
relations, save one: A child buried at the site in 1889 is remembered on the 
marker simply as "Our Neighbor's Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Torgerson, 64, who has lived at the foot of the canyon for 16 years, 
is not related to the Gillibrands, nor does her family associate much with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a problem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's part of the beauty of the place," Torgerson said. "There's room enough 
for everyone."

CAPITOL JOURNAL / GEORGE SKELTON: A HIGH, HARD ONE IN THE BUDGET GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the classic baseball movie "Bull Durham," veteran catcher Crash Davis tells 
rookie pitcher Nuke LaLoosh to throw over the batter's head at the mascot. Nuke 
does, and the stunned batter exclaims, "This guy's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yep. I wouldn't dig in there if I was you," replies Crash (Kevin Costner). 
"Next one might be at your head. I don't know where it's gonna go. Swear to 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 The batter strikes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday night, the politicians' equivalent of Nuke LaLoosh was rookie 
Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer, an untested newcomer to legislative 
leadership. Like Nuke, Lockyer was keeping the other side off balance. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was budgeting, the most important one played by legislators and the 
governor. They were three days away from a new fiscal year, again without a 
budget. Once more, Sacramento was running a deficit. This time, it would need 
to borrow $7 billion. An international banking syndicate had agreed to co-sign 
for $4 billion if a "trigger" bill could be passed guaranteeing repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats wanted taxes in any trigger; Republicans demanded just spending 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations were crawling. The parties were playing chicken, assuming the 
other side would blink rather than permit a politically disastrous stalemate, 
as in 1992. Meanwhile, the controller was planning to issue embarrassing IOUs 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer privately told intimates, "Staying gridlocked all summer means a 
nuclear explosion for Pete Wilson. But the Legislature will be in the fallout." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie leader decided to throw at some heads to announce his presence and 
shake up the Capitol. He took up a "trigger" bill he knew had little chance of 
passing, but would give him an opportunity to attack Wilson and threaten 
everybody with a summer-long deadlock. Your basic brush-back pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a feeling that this guy Lockyer is crazy; he might just march up to 
the edge of the precipice and leap, keeping us here all summer," Lockyer later 
said, grinning. "This was to show 'em they might be right." 
</P>
<P>
 For five months, ever since he'd become Senate leader, the Capitol had 
wondered about Lockyer (D-Hayward). He's brainy but volatile; a veteran 
legislator but a neophyte leader. The other Capitol players considered him a 
wild card. So he took advantage of the image and the mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer's antics immediately jogged Senate GOP leader Ken Maddy (D-Fresno), a 
pragmatist. They began talks within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Maddy told Wilson it was time to vote on a budget proposal. 
The governor protested it didn't contain enough money for prisons, but the 
senator replied that wasn't worth fighting about all summer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Senate narrowly passed a budget. Only four Republicans 
joined Maddy in voting for it, however, and that surprised him. At a stormy 
caucus the next morning in Maddy's office, some Republicans complained about 
state debt and angrily scolded their leader for not involving them in 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody had to make a move," Maddy responded. "If you want to sit here all 
summer and cause the governor's (election) defeat, that's your call. But a 
couple of you will be gone too. I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Effective politics often is ugly. Jealousies, egos, greed, turf can be prime 
motivators, as in any field. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer had been prodded, in part, by pique over Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco) getting close to cutting his own deal with Wilson. Assembly 
GOP Leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) was the proud mediator. The planned 
scenario was for Brown and Brulte to compose the final budget package. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer increasingly felt slighted. And by last weekend, he had become so 
annoyed he wasn't taking calls from the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Lockyer made his move, followed by Maddy, and the Assembly leaders got 
miffed -- especially Brulte. They felt their negotiating had been undercut. The 
senators countered that their negotiating hadn't produced bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilson had the Legislature where he wanted it -- moving toward 
agreement and in his direction. The senators' moves spurred day and night 
negotiations Thursday between the governor and all four legislative leaders. 
Wilson wound up achieving most of his agenda, mainly no tax increase and an 
almost on-time budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A trigger bill passed both houses Friday. Pushed by Brown, the Assembly 
narrowly passed a budget Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 For Californians, it means people who depend on money from state government -- 
through business or benefits -- won't have to worry about getting paid this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A little feigned craziness had jarred the Capitol into sanity.

CHRISTOPHER MAY VISIT VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vietnam's deputy foreign minister said Sunday that U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher might visit Vietnam, paving the way for full diplomatic 
relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials visiting Vietnam to try to resolve the fate of American 
servicemen declared missing in action during the Vietnam War mentioned a 
possible visit by Christopher to Hanoi, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher would be the most senior official to visit Vietnam since the end 
of the war in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton lifted a U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam in February, and 
the two sides have agreed to open diplomatic liaison offices in each others' 
capitals soon. Full diplomatic relations are expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Mai, who has had two meetings with the U.S. delegation since its arrival 
Friday afternoon, said the talks have been constructive and both sides are 
pleased with the results.

POOR PAY THE PRICE FOR HAITIAN MEDICINE SHORTAGE; EMBARGO: MEDICAL SUPPLIES ARE 
OFFICIALLY EXEMPT FROM SANCTIONS, BUT DRUGS ARE SCARCE FOR ALL BUT THE RICH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Saint-Dominique fell the other day and cut his leg. The two-inch scrape 
didn't seem much of a problem and it shouldn't have been, but it could have 
cost the young man his limb or even his life. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a reporter from the United States got something in his eye. 
This too didn't seem much of a problem, and in the end it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences of the two young men testify to a basic contradiction in the 
international economic embargo of Haiti: The poor and ordinary suffer greatly, 
while the well-to-do and connected lead normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs and other medical supplies are officially exempt from the sanctions 
imposed to force Haiti's ruling military to step aside and permit the 
reinstatement of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president driven from office in 
September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But bureaucratic delays by the United States and United Nations, the 
difficulty in finding transportation to bring in the drugs and a slipshod 
distribution system have created intense shortages and high prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "No boat will come here just to bring a few boxes of medicine," said Dr. Franz 
Large, a U.S.-trained ophthalmologist. He said independent peddlers who once 
went to the United States to buy non-prescription drugs for sale to the lower 
and middle classes can no longer make the trip because of a ban on air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a good health system. It was not caused by the embargo," 
Large said. "But this last (embargo) really hurts and has made the problems 
even worse." 
</P>
<P>
 He listed vaccines, nearly all antibiotics, hypertension drugs, malaria 
medicine, ulcer drugs and eyedrops as among the worst shortages, in addition to 
X-ray machines and spare parts for his ophthalmology equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of drugs and equipment is exemplified by the experience of 
Saint-Dominique, a 27-year-old auto mechanic. He was lifting a battery from a 
car when he slipped on spilled oil and fell against some scrap metal littering 
the garage where he worked in downtown Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting cut, more of a scratch, according to Saint-Dominique, barely 
bled and didn't seem much different from the rest of the bruises and nicks on 
his legs and arms. So he left it untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides," he said, "I don't have any money to go to a (private) doctor and I 
can't take the time from work to wait at the national (public) hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 While the shortage of adequate medical supplies and equipment has endangered 
many of Haiti's 7 million people, those who can pay fare fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of pharmacies had enough money to stock enough medicine to last for 
months, as did hospitals that cater to the rich. One such facility, Canape 
Verde Hospital, makes sure it has enough funds to serve its upscale clients by 
charging cash in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The system worked fine for Matt Marshall, a 27-year-old free-lance reporter 
from Washington, D.C., who discovered an irritation in his right eye recently. 
</P>
<P>
 His affliction appeared insignificant until the eye began to swell. Marshall 
visited a private physician in the wealthy hillside suburb of Petionville and 
received a prescription for antibiotics. Within a couple of days, the swelling 
was gone and Marshall was back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saint-Dominique's case, the scratch turned first into a slight bump on his 
left shin and then an angry, bloated swelling that he said became so tender and 
painful he couldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 He found a doctor who examined him for $1 and prescribed an antibiotic. But 
several pharmacies were out of the drug and, for that matter, any other 
antibiotic. So he let the festering wound go untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pain became unbearable, Saint-Dominique went to the national hospital 
and was told he needed an operation to have the swelling lanced and cleaned 
out. But the hospital was so short of medicine, antiseptics and even sutures 
that only emergency surgery was being performed. 
</P>
<P>
 His first doctor was able to convince the hospital that the case was an 
emergency, arguing that the risk of gangrene and blood poisoning could lead to 
amputation and even death. The operation was performed and the swelling went 
down, but Saint-Dominique is still worried. 
</P>
<P>
 The incision is being held together by ordinary Band-Aids because the hospital 
said it had no sutures, and he never could find the antibiotic he needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am afraid," he said. "It still hurts and I think it is getting bigger 
again. The doctor says I have to use the medicine, but I just can't find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors in Haiti resist the embargo's impact, but often at great personal 
expense and with limited results. 
</P>
<P>
 Just outside the impoverished seaside city of Grand Goave, about 35 miles west 
of Port-au-Prince, Dr. Rene Saint-Leger runs a clinic that serves about 40,000 
people. Except for occasional help from a public doctor, Saint-Leger is the 
only physician in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 He built the clinic with his own money, earned during 20 years of private 
practice as an internist in East St. Louis, Ill. Not only does the 70-year-old 
Haitian native pay for the clinic's operation, he flies to St. Louis every two 
or three months to bring back the drugs he can't find here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I can keep going back," he said during an interview in his beachfront 
home near the clinic. "I hope Air France keeps flying." 
</P>
<P>
 Air France has defied U.S. pressure to shut down and has three flights a week 
to the Dominican Republic and Martinique. "If they stop, I will find another 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His effort shows. In his clinic pharmacy and in his home, Saint-Leger has 
nearly every drug unavailable to Haiti's other public doctors -- medicine for 
heart patients, antibiotics for infections, morphine, treatments for eye 
disease, even balm for chafed skin. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with his well-stocked pharmacy and his generosity (no patient pays 
more than $1, and most are treated free), the doctor thinks he is losing ground 
because of the embargo. "We used to be crowded every day, 40 and 50 patients a 
day," he said. "But now you see less and less because transportation costs are 
so high" that the people can't get to the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 He also bemoans the things even he can't get. "What I would give for an X-ray. 
Can you imagine diagnosing tuberculosis without X-rays?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti has never been a paradise," Saint-Leger said, "but now . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 His voice trailed off. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, Dr. Large finished the thought. "Before the embargo, Haiti 
was the second circle of Dante's hell. Now we're in the first circle."

INQUIRY; FAMILY QUESTIONS CIA ROLE IN SCIENTIST'S BIZARRE DEATH; FRANK OLSON 
ALLEGEDLY KILLED HIMSELF IN 1953 DURING AN LSD MIND-CONTROL EXPERIMENT. 
SURVIVORS REJECT OFFICIAL EXPLANATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the sunlight glinted off Frank R. Olson's coffin for the first time in 
nearly 41 years, Eric Olson's last memories of his father came rushing back. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled seeing the dark, hardwood casket at the funeral. He remembered 
watching his father walk across the front yard to catch a ride to work one 
Monday morning. It was the last time anyone in the family saw him alive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 28, 1953, Frank Olson plunged to the pavement from the 10th floor 
window of a New York hotel. His death, ruled a suicide, was later linked to 
mind-control experiments conducted on Olson -- and others -- by the CIA. But 
many questions surrounding his demise are still haunting his family.  
</P>
<P>
 On June 2, a team of forensic scientists exhumed Olson's remains from his 
grave in Frederick Memorial Park Cemetery, hoping to shed new light on the 
cause of his death. While it may be little more than a tragic footnote in the 
history of the CIA, renewed interest in the incident is dredging up old 
anxieties about the actions and integrity of the intelligence community during 
the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, military and intelligence experts began looking into a new 
generation of chemical and biological agents, ranging from deadly toxins to 
truth serums. CIA scientists, fearing the Soviet Union was developing advanced 
"brainwashing" drugs, began testing substances for possible use in 
interrogations, including LSD, a potent hallucinogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those tests involved unsuspecting subjects. Frank Olson was one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, a biochemist who headed the U.S. Army's Special Operations Division 
before his retirement from active military duty in early 1953, was one of the 
first military officers assigned to the Pentagon's biological warfare program. 
On the evening of Nov. 18, CIA officials gathered Olson and a handful of other 
scientists for a working retreat at an isolated log cabin near Deep Creek Lake, 
Md. The next evening, the scientists shared a drink of Cointreau. Twenty 
minutes later, the CIA officials told Olson and the others that the liqueur had 
been laced with LSD. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson displayed a negative reaction almost immediately, according to CIA 
documents later provided to the family. He became agitated, paranoid and 
despondent. Several days later, he was flown to New York to consult with an 
allergist who had been testing LSD and who had CIA security clearance. A CIA 
scientist assigned to monitor Olson said that in the early morning hours of 
Nov. 28, he was awakened by the sound of Olson crashing through the drawn 
shades and closed window of their hotel room.  
</P>
<P>
 Eric Olson keeps a faded green scrapbook full of newspaper clippings about his 
father's death. Article after article states that he "fell or jumped" from room 
1018 A of the Statler Hotel. That was the same explanation the Army gave the 
Olsons in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until 22 years later, when the Senate issued a landmark report detailing 
the CIA's drug tests, did the family learn that Olson had been deceived into 
taking LSD. Ten years ago, Eric spent a night in the hotel room, and noted the 
presence of a large radiator in front of the window. "It would have been very 
difficult to fall or even jump out," he said in a recent interview. "You'd have 
to take a flying leap and dive through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more unsettling was a phone call the hotel's operator reported 
overhearing Nov. 28. Olson's CIA monitor allegedly called another CIA official 
and said: "Well, it's over," minutes after Olson's death. "That's too bad," the 
voice at the other end replied and hung up, according to the operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 Senate report did not identify Olson by name, but it described how an 
Army employee had been tricked into taking LSD, stating that he "jumped from 
the 10th-floor window of his room and died as a result." The study indicated 
that the CIA experiments were part of a larger program aimed at developing new 
methods of controlling human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress awarded the family a $750,000 settlement in 1976. But more recent 
findings, including any new forensic evidence, could lead to further legal 
action, Eric Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Eric and his brother Nils asked George Washington University Prof. 
James E. Starrs, a forensic scientist, to look into their father's death. 
Although the results are not in, Starrs said he suspects Olson might have been 
pushed out of the window because his knowledge of the CIA's clandestine 
activities and his reaction to the LSD experiment made him a security risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The original autopsy was inadequate because the examiner did not check for 
foreign substances or chart Olson's injuries, Starrs said. A cursory 
examination of Olson's remains at a police crime lab this month found multiple 
fractures in both lower legs, with little apparent damage to the head. The 
forensic team plans to test Olson's hair and brain tissue for traces of LSD, 
and expects a final report within 30 days.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert V. Lashbrook, the retired CIA scientist who shared the hotel room with 
Olson, denies that foul play led to Olson's death. Reached at his home in Ojai, 
Calif., he criticized Starrs' speculation about CIA involvement. "I don't 
recall anyone at the CIA suggesting that, just because he flipped his lid a 
bit, that that's a security risk," he said.

CAMBODIA SAYS IT THWARTED COUP BY PRINCE, EX-OFFICIAL

 The Cambodian government said Sunday that it had foiled a coup attempt led by 
a former Interior minister and a son of King Norodom Sihanouk. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital city of Phnom Penh was reported to be quiet but jittery, with 
armored cars patrolling the streets and state radio appealing for calm. There 
was no evidence of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said former Interior Minister Sin Song was placed under house 
arrest and Prince Norodom Chakrapong, one of Sihanouk's many children and a 
former deputy prime minister, was allowed to leave the country aboard a 
Malaysian Airlines plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Sin Song and Chakrapong had been involved in an effort to torpedo the results 
of last year's U.N.-sponsored parliamentary elections.

<P>
 When it became clear that the Communist government led by then-Prime Minister 
Hun Sen had been defeated by the royalist FUNCINPEC party in last May's polls, 
the two men announced a movement to split off several provinces from the 
country. In the end, the royalists and the former Communists formed a coalition 
government and the uprising collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 But it appeared likely that lingering tensions between the royalists and the 
former Communists were in the background of Sunday's reported coup attempt. 
This week the Cambodian Parliament is debating legislation that would outlaw 
the Khmer Rouge, the Maoist guerrillas whose rule in the 1970s left more than 1 
million Cambodians dead. The Khmer Rouge refused to participate in last year's 
elections but remains a potent military force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Khmer Rouge, which was aligned with China, was driven into exile in 1979 
during an invasion by Vietnam, which was backed by the Soviet Union. The 
Vietnamese installed a group of Khmer Rouge defectors in the government, 
including Hun Sen and Sin Song. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace talks between Cambodia's present coalition government and the Khmer 
Rouge ended in failure last month. Some coalition factions fear isolating the 
Khmer Rouge and want to give them a role in the government, while the Hun Sen 
faction wants them excluded totally. 
</P>
<P>
 Some royalist leaders are trying to counter the move by seeking greater powers 
for Sihanouk, whose role in the constitution is defined as a figurehead. But 
the former Communists oppose those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chakrapong told reporters in Phnom Penh on Sunday that he was not involved in 
a coup attempt and said the allegation was a pretext by factions within the 
government to consolidate their control following the failure of the peace 
talks with the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was no physical evidence of a coup in the streets of Phnom Penh, 
reports of an uprising will only add to the sense of insecurity that has 
prevailed in Cambodia since the Khmer Rouge defeated government forces at the 
western town of Pailin in March. Some fear that the instability will frighten 
away tourists, the country's main source of foreign exchange, and foreign 
investors, who had just begun to trickle back to Cambodia after staying away 
for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As Interior minister, Sin Song was considered ruthless and has been accused of 
using death squads to silence opponents in the campaign for last year's 
elections. There was a brief controversy earlier this year when Sin Song was 
given a visa by the State Department to attend a prayer breakfast in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Chakrapong was widely considered one of the most corrupt officials in 
Cambodia, a country where bribery is a way of life.

OJAI MAN, DAUGHTER DIE WHEN PLANE CRASHES AFTER TAKEOFF

 An Ojai pilot and his 10-year-old daughter were killed early Sunday when their 
vintage small plane crashed and burned shortly after taking off from Santa 
Paula Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 John Forrest Lires, 44, took flight in his blue and yellow Cessna with his 
daughter, Erin, about 8:15 a.m. Minutes later, the plane had engine trouble and 
crashed near the airport, authorities and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took off from Santa Paula Airport, and about two minutes later it came 
down," said Dale Zentzis, Ventura County senior deputy coroner. "They were 
killed on impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The single-prop Cessna 195 plunged to the ground near the end of a narrow dirt 
road that runs along the north side of the Santa Clara River. Firefighters 
extinguished a small brush fire before discovering the bodies, said Sandi Wells 
of the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth fatal crash in four years near the Santa Paula Airport, which 
has no control tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Lires owned the plane -- a model that was built about 40 years ago -- with 
another Ojai man, John Dolan. Neighbor and friend Jody Kasch said Lires and 
Dolan had recently examined the craft thoroughly. "He was the most 
conscientious pilot," Kasch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin, a straight-A student, was a child actress who had made appearances on 
such television shows as "Quantum Leap" and "Married With Children."

 Two Buena Park police officers shot and killed a man who led them on a short 
chase Sunday and threatened employees at the Buena Park Mall with a handgun, 
authorities said. The dead man, whose name and age were not released, was 
apparently living out of his car, which he had parked at an Anaheim restaurant 
for the past two days, employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was here this morning, blasting his radio, and our general manager had to 
go out there to tell him to shut off the music and chase him off," said Bonnie 
Henderson, the assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the parking lot, the man apparently drove to the Buena Park 
Mall, where employees called authorities to report that he was in his car 
threatening them with a gun, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 As he drove away from the mall, he was spotted by Buena Park officers who 
"attempted to stop him by utilizing overhead lights and sirens," a report by 
Anaheim Police Sgt. Steve Rodig stated. "The suspect failed to yield." 
</P>
<P>
 The man drove back to the restaurant parking lot and got out of the car with a 
loaded handgun, Rodig said. The two officers opened fire, Rodig said. The man 
died at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Orange County district attorney's office were 
investigating.

2 KILLED, SEVERAL INJURED IN SERIES OF COLLISIONS ON FREEWAY IN ANAHEIM 
</P>

 Two women were killed and several other people were injured early Sunday in a 
series of collisions on the Santa Ana Freeway that began when a suspected drunk 
driver slammed into the rear of a pickup truck, the California Highway Patrol 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead women were identified as Elizabeth Newman, 35, of Dominguez Hills, 
and Patricia Ann Maglietto, 24, of Studio City, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain of crashes began shortly after 3:50 a.m. when the driver of a 
Mustang traveling about 100 m.p.h. rear-ended a pickup truck driven by Alfredo 
Cortez, 51, of Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, a Honda sedan carrying Newman, Maglietto and Lori Kitagawa 
struck the disabled Mustang, and the drivers of a Camaro and Thunderbird 
stopped to help. 
</P>
<P>
 As the driver of the Thunderbird, Karen Counsell, 38, called 911 from her car 
phone, Justi Saver -- the Camaro driver who had stopped to help -- joined 
Newman, Maglietto and Kitagawa in the center divider. 
</P>
<P>
 As they stood surveying the wreckage, Weaver said, a woman driving a Toyota 
off-road vehicle slammed into the collection of cars. Maglietto was killed 
instantly, and Newman was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toyota's driver, Elisa Ortiz, 28, of Los Angeles, had to be extracted by 
emergency crews, Weaver said. She was hospitalized for minor injuries. Weaver 
said Ortiz was not cited pending further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustang's driver, identified as Rafael Cruz, 27, of Santa Ana, was caught 
as he tried to flee. He suffered serious injuries.

RABIN ACCUSES ISRAELI RIGHTISTS OF SCARE TACTICS; MIDEAST: PROTESTS AGAINST 
ARAFAT'S RETURN CONTINUE IN JERUSALEM. PRIME MINISTER CALLS CLAIMS HE WILL TURN 
CITY OVER TO PALESTINIANS AN 'OUTRAGE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As hundreds of angry Jews clashed with police outside his office Sunday, 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin defended the Mideast peace accord and 
accused his opponents of inciting violence with scare stories of a 
Palestinian-controlled Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll put it simply: It's a political outrage," Rabin told a caucus meeting of 
his Labor Party. "There is no disagreement regarding the unity of Jerusalem, 
our sovereignty over it or its continuation as the capital of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's remarks were part of a government counteroffensive against rightist 
leaders who oppose the peace agreement and have used Friday's return of 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, after 27 years in 
exile, to rally tens of thousands to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hours before, one of the biggest anti-government rallies in Jerusalem's 
modern history had turned ugly as thousands of Jews took to the streets late 
Saturday, some throwing rocks at Arab-owned shops, burning cars and defying 
riot police. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Sunday, hundreds of shouting, flag-waving demonstrators gathered 
outside Rabin's office building in an attempt to prevent government ministers 
from attending the regular weekly Cabinet meeting. The government assigned 
bodyguards to the ministers, who entered and left the building by a side 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters taunted riot police from a makeshift "tent city," which 
government opponents set up opposite Rabin's office a month ago. Some blew 
whistles and banged cooking pans, hoping to be heard inside the Cabinet 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said 65 demonstrators were arrested and four were slightly injured. No 
charges were filed, and most of the protesters were later released, with some 
rejoining the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 In their Cabinet meeting, Rabin and his ministers lashed out at the protesters 
and right-wing leaders, accusing them of inciting violence with allegations 
that the government plans to turn Jerusalem over to the Palestinians. Rabin 
said the protests Saturday and Sunday, and the property damage that resulted, 
had "gone beyond the bounds of legitimate political dissent." 
</P>
<P>
 Some government ministers accused the right wing of trying to spark a "Jewish 
intifada ," a reference to the militant Palestinian uprising that began in 
December, 1987, and brought the Israeli government into negotiations on 
Palestinian self-government for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rebellion," said Shulamit Aloni, the communications minister. She 
added that the demonstrators "are presenting a legitimate government as 
traitors." 
</P>
<P>
 But the government received some good news Sunday from an opinion poll by the 
Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University. The poll 
indicated that 60% of Israelis support continued dialogue with the PLO. More 
than half, however, still say they do not believe that agreements with the 
Palestinians or the Syrians will solve the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephraim Inbar, director of the center, said the results indicate the number of 
Israelis willing to make a deal for Palestinian autonomy in exchange for peace 
is growing. "The Israeli public is exhausted by the conflict, and by the lack 
of an opposition which presents a clear alternative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there is no consensus on an alternative solution to Israel's dilemma 
among Jewish Israelis who oppose the peace accord. Some militants say they want 
to drive all Arabs out of Israel and its occupied territories. Other, more 
moderate opponents acknowledge that is impossible. But they admit they have no 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahum Barnea, a columnist for Yediot Aharonot, the country's largest 
newspaper, wrote Sunday that the protests are aimed more at Rabin than Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The animosity toward Rabin is getting close to the hatred that the left felt 
toward (former Defense Minister) Ariel Sharon," Barnea wrote. "In their minds, 
Rabin has insulted and humiliated them. The battle is over belief, property and 
honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Arafat's return, the right wing had been plagued by months of 
infighting. But the PLO chairman's arrival in Gaza focused attention on several 
still-undecided parts of the peace deal, which have left many Jews unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is not stupid," said Zeev (Benny) Begin, a prominent member of the 
opposition Likud Party. "The public knows the prime minister has been lying to 
the Israeli people. He's been an expert at deception on the matter of 
Jerusalem. We will defend Jerusalem -- not against Arafat, but against Rabin." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Israel has handed Gaza and Jericho over to Palestinian rule, only 
future negotiations will determine what other territories will become part of 
the deal. Many of the more than 100,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and 
Gaza are worried about what will happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Government opponents have used that uncertainty to draw broader public 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 As Haaretz, a highly respected Hebrew daily newspaper, put it Sunday, "If the 
government intends to continue with the same determination in the peace 
process, it must come out publicly and tell the Jewish residents of the 
territories what their future will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government doesn't have to be impressed by the demonstrations, but it 
does have to give real answers," the newspaper said.

NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING NEAR VOLCANOES GROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of people who live in areas at risk from volcanic eruptions will 
reach 500 million by the year 2000, according to a report by scientists of the 
U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of the threatened people will live along the subduction zones of the 
Pacific Rim's so-called Ring of Fire, where 75% of Earth's 850 active volcanoes 
are found, said Robert I. Tilling of the Geological Survey's Western regional 
office in Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although eruption frequency and hazards severity have not increased in recent 
centuries, the problem of reducing volcanic risk necessarily becomes more acute 
with continuing explosive population growth, especially for many developing 
countries rimming the Pacific Ocean," Tilling said in the report released last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 He and another Geological Survey scientist, Peter W. Lipman, said more 
intensive monitoring of volcanoes, better techniques for predicting eruptions, 
more effective interaction with civil authorities and the public and improved 
international cooperation are necessary to deal with the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1600, there have been approximately 262,000 deaths from volcanic 
eruptions, about 76,000 in this century, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 55,000 of the deaths in the 20th Century occurred from just two 
eruptions -- those of Mt. Pelee on Martinique in the West Indies and of Nevado 
del Ruiz in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 29,933 people were killed in St. Pierre on May 8, 1902, when Mt. 
Pelee exploded, sending a huge fireball downhill and incinerating the coastal 
city. There was one survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nevado del Ruiz deaths were caused by a catastrophic mudflow from the 
erupting volcano Nov. 13, 1985, which wiped out much of the city of Armero, 
killing approximately 25,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six deadliest eruptions since 1600 -- Laki in Iceland in 1783, Unzen in 
Japan in 1792, Tambora in Indonesia in 1815, Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, 
Pelee and Ruiz -- only Laki did not involve a subduction zone, Tilling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Subduction zones are places where the leading edge of one tectonic plate, 
floating on Earth's mantle, over tens of millions of years dives under another, 
eventually causing great earthquakes and explosive volcanic eruptions that 
often emit high quantities of sulfur, causing a temporary cooling of the 
Earth's climate.

FRENCH SOLDIERS ENGAGE IN FIRST SKIRMISH WITH RWANDAN REBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 French troops and the rebels who oppose their presence fought a brief skirmish 
Sunday, the first time the French humanitarian mission has entered into combat. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefight broke out as French paratroopers were evacuating 270 civilians 
from the path of a rebel offensive in the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 French Col. Didier Thibault said the exchange of gunfire lasted less than a 
minute. There were no French or refugee casualties, he said, but he did not 
know if there were any casualties among the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We passed an RPF checkpoint, and soon after we passed we were shot upon," 
Thibault said. Jean-Francis Pezresse, a French journalist accompanying the 
evacuation, said the shooting broke out after the rebels spotted a government 
soldier in one of the French vehicles. The soldier, a deserter, was dragged by 
rebels from the jeep and shot, Pezresse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels, who have taken about two-thirds of the country and are mounting a 
fierce assault on the capital of Kigali, oppose the 10-day-old French mission 
because they suspect the troops will try to bolster the government. 
</P>
<P>
 They were further provoked Saturday when France informed the United Nations it 
intended to establish a "safe zone" for refugees in southwestern Rwanda -- 
directly in front of the advancing rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rwandan government, which fled from Kigali to Gisenyi, called Saturday for 
French support. But French officials said no help has been offered.

PLO OFFICIAL HAS MADE HER MARK; GAZA STRIP: INTISAR WAZIR, EXILED WITH ARAFAT 
FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES, HELPS GUIDE THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AS ITS MINISTER 
OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her long black dress embroidered with brightly colored flowers in 
traditional Gazan needlework, Intisar Wazir appeared the traditional 
Palestinian matron as she entertained half a dozen morning visitors in the 
front parlor of a Gaza City villa. 
</P>
<P>
 Arab sweets were passed, cold drinks were served against the intense summer 
heat, and the children were shushed and sent outside as Wazir inquired about 
the health of old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all that, the real talk was politics -- serious politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Wazir, 49, popularly known as Umm Jihad, or "mother of the holy war," is the 
social affairs minister of the new Palestinian Authority, a top adviser to PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat and a key player as Palestinians shape their homeland 
and their future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Social development must be the basis for economic development, and we cannot 
speak of social development in Palestine, only of retreat and even collapse, 
during the Israeli occupation," Wazir said. "In many respects, we are at zero. 
In some respects, we are below zero and worse off than when I left." 
</P>
<P>
 Wazir, the first woman to reach the top ranks of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, returned last week from nearly three decades in exile with Arafat 
and other PLO leaders, bringing with her an agenda that mixes social welfare, 
economic development and the transformation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank 
into an independent nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 30 years, we dreamed a lot about what kind of nation we would build, and 
now we have to do it," Wazir said. "Our ambitions are great, our means are 
small, and so much -- first of all peace -- depends on our efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the burden we are carrying today, whether our portfolio is economic 
development or education or social welfare. We have been struggling so long, 
demanding this opportunity as our birthright, and now we are put to the test." 
</P>
<P>
 Wazir's agenda includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Recovering the "lost generation," the youths who grew up in the last years 
of Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, missing more school 
than they attended, fighting troops in the streets and effectively winning the 
chance for the PLO to negotiate with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moving the tens of thousands of families still living in refugee camps in 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank into new communities with decent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rehabilitating tens of thousands of Palestinians jailed, many for more than 
a decade, during the Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing physical and psychological therapy for the thousands disabled 
during the uprising against the occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supporting the families of those killed in the long struggle with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing equal opportunities for women in a society where men remain 
dominant and where a fundamentalist resurgence is forcing many women back into 
traditional subservience. 
</P>
<P>
 Still without a budget as the Palestinian Authority works out its finances, 
Wazir plans to make a worldwide appeal for funds, equipment and expertise. "We 
hold the international community responsible for what befell our people," she 
said, "and there should be no mistake about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wazir is accustomed to speaking her views, plainly and forcefully. She has 
been a member of the Central Committee of Fatah, the main constituent group 
within the PLO, since 1989. She has headed the PLO's social affairs department 
for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 But she also has a popular following as the widow of Khalil Wazir, Arafat's 
revered military commander and strategist who was shot to death April 16, 1988, 
with three bodyguards in an Israeli commando raid on his villa in a suburb of 
Tunis, Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Abu Jihad, or "father of the holy war," Khalil Wazir remains a 
beloved figure in the Palestinian pantheon. There are as many pictures of him 
around Gaza six years after his death as there are of Arafat, and Palestinians 
sing ballads about him and his exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Intisar Wazir's influence and political acumen were felt during Arafat's first 
speeches and visits in the Gaza Strip; she rarely left his side. 
</P>
<P>
 During Arafat's arrival speech to about 70,000 people, Wazir was heard 
prompting him, as he ran through a long list of thank-yous to Arab nations, to 
remember the youthful protesters of the intifada , the rebellion of more than 
six years against the Israeli occupation.

<P>
 "Don't forget," she reminded him several times, and Arafat, using the wording 
she suggested, thanked the "children of the stones, heroes of the stones." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she was cheered as much as Arafat during visits to refugee camps and 
local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 With vivid memories of standing over her husband's bullet-riddled body, Wazir 
shares the ambivalence of many Palestinians about the agreement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is inside me toward the Israelis cannot be easily wiped out," she said, 
choosing her words carefully. "I am happy for returning and sad because my 
husband was not with me on the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were enemies, and we engaged each other in all kinds of war. Now we are in 
a battle, a struggle, a jihad for peace, and so we should focus on this. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this has been a long journey of 30 years, filled with difficulties 
and dangers, with hard work and resistance. The target has always been freedom, 
independence and the return to our homeland."

DEATH TOLL IN N. CAROLINA JET CRASH REACHES 37; WIND SHEAR SUSPECTED; TRAGEDY: 
THE 20 VICTIMS WHO SURVIVED THE CHARLOTTE ORDEAL REMAIN HOSPITALIZED. THE USAIR 
DC-9'S DATA AND VOICE RECORDERS ARE FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The death toll climbed to 37 Sunday as federal officials finished the grim 
task of extracting bodies from the wreckage of a USAir jetliner that crashed 
here Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 20 people aboard the plane remained hospitalized Sunday with 
injuries ranging from superficial to critical.  
</P>
<P>
 The DC-9 jet carrying 52 passengers and a crew of five on Flight 1016 from 
Columbia, S.C., was preparing to land at the Charlotte-Douglas International 
Airport during a violent thunderstorm when the pilot decided to abort the 
attempt and then turned away for a second try at a landing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they heard the plane's twin engines roar as the jet tried to 
regain altitude, but instead of climbing, the airliner slammed into the ground, 
coming to rest against a house and several trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane broke into three sections, scattering debris, and the wreckage burst 
into flames. Sources close to the investigation said the accident may have been 
caused by low-level wind shear -- a phenomenon associated with thunderstorms 
that has been blamed for some of the worst jetliner crashes in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind shears -- drastic changes in the direction that air is moving -- can 
cause a plane to lose vital airspeed at dangerously low altitudes and crash 
without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists issued a wind-shear warning at the airport about a minute 
before the crash, and pilots of two other jetliners postponed their takeoffs 
because of the severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators stressed Sunday that it is still much too soon to 
determine what went wrong on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the jet's two "black boxes" -- recording devices that should reveal 
the cockpit conversations and as many as 40 technical aspects of the flight in 
the seconds before the crash -- have been recovered from the wreckage but their 
tapes have not been fully analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a preliminary reading from the voice recorder indicates that the 
pilot of Flight 1016 announced that he was canceling his landing attempt after 
encountering a heavy downpour. 
</P>
<P>
 T. Jerry Orr, the manager of the airport said officials have not yet studied 
data from low-level wind-shear sensors on the airport grounds to see if 
wind-shear conditions existed at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said the relatively unsophisticated sensors on the ground 
often fail to provide definitive data about wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
 More sophisticated systems are being installed at U.S. airports, and officials 
said the landing field here should get one within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 A dramatic account of the crash was given Sunday by one of the survivors, 
Robert Thomas, 33, who was en route to Philadelphia with a friend and fellow 
resident of Phoenix, Steven Roy. The two had been planning a Fourth of July 
weekend holiday together. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who suffered superficial burns and bruises but was otherwise 
unscathed, said he was asleep in an 11th-row window seat as the plane 
approached the airport Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he awoke to the roar of the engine as the pilot advanced the throttles 
in a futile attempt to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the plane first hit, I thought it was on the runway," Thomas said from a 
wheelchair during a news conference at the Carolinas Medical Center. "But when 
I saw the debris flying I knew we were in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said the impact threw him against the wreckage of what had been the 
seat in front of him, "and when I got up there was nobody left around me. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked around and there was fire," he said. "I looked over to the aisle 
where my friend was sitting, and he was buried in seats and shrapnel." Thomas 
said he managed to unbuckle his seat belt and clambered to safety through the 
hole where the seats behind him had once been.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were lots of people all over the place," he said. "They were alive, but 
they were lying on the ground." Thomas was asked if his friend survived the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Thomas said softly, a shadow of pain crossing his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, he'd helped me out of a lot of binds. We'd been together for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Hammerschmidt, a National Transportation Safety Board member who is 
heading up the federal investigation of the crash, went to the accident site 
Sunday and walked the path the plane followed after it slammed into the ground 
a few hundred yards from the runway where it had been attempting to land.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the plane followed a straight path after impact, scattering debris and 
broken tree limbs as it cut a swath through a small span of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane glanced off a cinder-block foundation and struck two large oak 
trees, which withstood the impact, tearing the aircraft into three pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The tail section came to rest against an unoccupied house. Officials said the 
sight of survivors stepping out through the wreckage of the house had led to 
earlier reports that there were people in the home who had been injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle section of the plane -- the part in which Thomas was riding -- 
largely disintegrated and burned.  
</P>
<P>
 The cockpit section, containing most of the flight crew, skidded a few yards 
farther and came to rest in the middle of a paved road. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said all the flight crew survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive officer of USAir, identified the 
pilot as Michael Greenlee, 38, of St. Paris, Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
 The co-pilot was identified as James Hayes, 41, of Woodstock, Ga. Schofield 
described the two men as "very experienced."  
</P>
<P>
 He said Greenlee has 8,065 hours of flight time, with 1,910 of them in a DC-9. 
Hayes has a total of 12,985 hours, 3,120 in a DC-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Schofield said the plane that crashed was built by McDonnell Douglas in 1973 
and had logged 54,000 hours of flight time. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the plane had just undergone an extensive overhaul.

TROPICAL STORM RUINS HOLIDAY FOR GULF COAST TOURISTS; WEATHER: DAMAGE IN 
FLORIDA IS RELATIVELY LIGHT; NO DEATHS ARE REPORTED. AS ALBERTO PUSHES INLAND, 
GEORGIA, ALABAMA BRACE FOR HEAVY RAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tropical Storm Alberto crashed into what should have been a perfect holiday 
weekend along the Gulf Coast on Sunday, lashing oceanfront highways with high 
winds and sand after scattering thousands of tourists to their homes or inland 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, those who abandoned their Fourth of July weekend plans and fled 
the beaches of Florida's Panhandle may have only run into the worst of the 
weather. Heavy rains of up to 10 inches, along with a chance of tornadoes and 
flash-flooding, were forecast overnight for southern Alabama and much of 
Georgia as the remnants of the first tropical storm of the season pushed 
northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly heavy rainfall was expected later in the week in the foothills of 
the Appalachian Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Among events at risk today was Atlanta's Peachtree Road Race, an annual 
Independence Day extravaganza that is expected to draw about 50,000 runners and 
thousands more spectators for a 6.2-mile jaunt. Race planners said only 
lightning would delay the 7:30 a.m. start. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto's top sustained winds of 60 m.p.h. caused relatively little property 
damage, and no deaths were reported as the ill-defined eye of the storm made 
landfall about 10 a.m. Sunday in the Ft. Walton Beach-Destin area of Florida's 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds toppled signs, ripped down awnings and left tree branches strewn on area 
roads. A five-mile stretch of U.S. 98, the only road along the barrier islands 
that front what is a booming northern Florida resort area, was closed for two 
hours Sunday morning when a seawall began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The major damage, however, was to the area's tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 100% filled yesterday," Kelly Barnes, a reservation agent at the 
450-room Ramada Inn, said Sunday afternoon, even as skies were clearing. "But 
we're down to 50% now." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Farley, general manager of the Destin Holiday Inn, predicted losses of 
$50,000 after guests fled about 100 of his hotel's 233 rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are coming back, and those who were courageous enough to stick it 
out with us enjoyed the uniqueness of the situation," he said. "We had no 
damage, and the biggest problem now is that our beaches are no longer as 
beautiful as they were. The high water left seaweed and debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we dodged a bullet. And if we get some sunny weather tomorrow, we're 
going to survive economically." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Barnes, a recent arrival from Texas experiencing her first tropical 
storm: "It was kind of exciting, even though the winds were not as strong as 
predicted. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In Panama City, Fla., damage was reported to the city's long oceanfront pier, 
and power lines were downed by falling tree limbs. Apalachicola, Fla., reported 
a seven-foot rise in the tide within one hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of Florida saw nothing of Alberto's high winds, the entire state 
was battered throughout Sunday by thunderstorms and rain, much of it the 
outflow of the storm system. 
</P>
<P>
 Over land, Alberto's power waned quickly and when sustained winds dropped 
below 39 m.p.h. Sunday afternoon, the storm was downgraded to a tropical 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Naomi Surgi, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said 
thousands of people along the Gulf Coast obeyed warnings to move away from the 
beach in advance of the storm's approach. "In some ways, this was a good 
reminder to people that even though it's a holiday, hurricane season has 
begun," she said. "People vacationing anywhere on the coastline need to be well 
aware of that." 
</P>
<P>
 What grew into the first named storm of the 1994 hurricane season began as an 
area of low pressure spotted south of Cuba on Friday. By Saturday forecasters 
said the low began to gather strength into a tropical storm -- with minimum 
winds of 39 m.p.h. -- and quickly headed toward hurricane-strength of 74 m.p.h. 
as it spun northward over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Alberto never reached hurricane strength, its potential, as well as 
its march toward the popular white-sand beach towns along the Gulf Coast, made 
it a serious holiday disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday, the storm-warning area extended from Gulfport, Miss., to Cedar 
Key, Fla., and hundreds of vacationers were evacuated along that 400-mile 
target area. 
</P>
<P>
 Some went home Saturday, while other tourists and some local residents without 
secure housing spent the night in emergency shelters opened in schools and 
churches. About 1,200 people were reported in shelters in Destin alone. 
</P>
<P>
 While sunny skies are forecast for the Gulf Coast today, rain and 
thunderstorms may complicate picnics and fireworks displays planned in northern 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Edith Stanley in Atlanta contributed to this story.

SIMPSON CASE TRADING CARDS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right there next to the rare Ty Cobb felt baseball card, and the Babe Ruth 
photograph, lay the latest O.J. Simpson trading card. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the display was at a sports memorabilia show, this card did not show 
Simpson in his Buffalo Bills uniform -- it was the mug shot that police took 
when they arrested him last month in connection with the slaying of his 
ex-wife, Nicole, and waiter Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to that lay cards showing a dejected Simpson in court, of him and Nicole 
in happier times, of her drivers' license and of Goldman's modeling shots. All 
with a logo reading "In Pursuit of Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The set of 10 cards was unveiled Sunday at displays throughout the Anaheim 
Convention Center show that drew hundreds of collectors. The price varied from 
$8 to $10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really sleazy, but if I don't sell it someone else will," said 
Lowell Katz, a Long Beach sports card dealer. "I might as well make money while 
I can." 
</P>
<P>
 David Guisande of D & K Distributors, a Lomis firm, ordered 8,000 packs of the 
cards from a Phoenix, Ariz., company producing the set, identified on the cards 
as Interlink News Services. They arrived at 10 p.m. Saturday. By 2 p.m. Sunday, 
he had sold 3,000 packs, most to other distributors, who expect to sell them as 
far away as Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all people want, O.J. cards," said Rick Hamilton, a Minneapolis-based 
dealer at the show. "I've only got 200 sets, so I imagine they'll go pretty 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Simpson's arrest in the Brentwood double slayings, dealers have reported 
receiving top-dollar prices for his old cards, signed footballs and other 
collectibles. In addition, a Fleetville, Pa., trading card company said it is 
moving ahead with a plan to have Simpson sign 1,000 cards -- under a contract 
signed June 3 -- that will be sold later this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 But the cards featuring players in the Simpson legal case are new. And the 
10-pack is only the beginning -- Guisande said Interlink News Service is 
planning to produce a 50-card set, complete with portraits of Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, defense lawyer Robert Shapiro and the 
bloodstained sidewalk outside Nicole Simpson's townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 But some customers Sunday were not impressed with the Simpson displays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just exploiting a tragedy," said a show attendee who described himself 
as one of Simpson's neighbors. "Who knows if he's guilty or innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 For the entrepreneurs in the speculative world of sports cards, however, the 
importance of his guilt or innocence rested on its market impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is found guilty, the price goes up," one noted.

2 BOYS, BOTH 12, DROWN AT CHURCH POOL PARTY IN PASTOR'S BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two 12-year-old boys drowned Sunday at a church-sponsored Fourth of July pool 
party in their pastor's back yard as a crowd of children played in and around 
the swimming pool, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a state of shock," said the Rev. An Thien Vo, head pastor of the 
Vietnamese Baptist Church in Westminster."This is almost impossible. We don't 
know why it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering was planned as a reward for young people who had worked all year 
in their church's youth program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys were identified as Quoc Thai Cao of Westminster and Man Minh Tran 
of Midway City. According to police and witnesses, the two boys -- described as 
close friends -- apparently climbed out of a Jacuzzi and slipped unnoticed into 
the pool. Neither boy could swim, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later the youth minister saw them at the bottom of the pool. Both 
were unconscious when paramedics arrived at the house. The boys were pronounced 
dead on arrival at separate hospitals.

 The government increased security around embassies Sunday following reports 
that fugitive author Taslima Nasrin was hiding in a Western diplomatic mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin fled her home June 4 when a court ordered her arrest on charges of 
blaspheming Islam. Muslim fundamentalists have demanded that she be put to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 The English-language newspaper the New Nation reported that the "'ambassador 
of a Western country is harboring Nasrin and defying laws of the host country." 
It did not identify the country.

ANN CONWAY: THE MISSION'S SECRET: SIMPLE ELEGANCE, MINUS FRILLS 
</P>

 The minute you arrived at this party site, you were grateful for its 
simplicity. No electronic doors to dodge. No slick marble to navigate. Not one 
blinding chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, on the quiet grounds of Mission San Juan Capistrano, arriving guests 
simply walked across dusty old tiles, stepped under a 200-year-old stone 
portal, and ended up in the sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This a lot better than a smoke-filled hotel room, isn't it?" mission 
administrator Gerald Miller asked guests at the recent Mission Women's Guild 
membership tea. "And, we have very high ceilings, if you notice," he said, 
looking up at a turquoise sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests noticed. Everywhere they looked they saw beauty, from the moss-covered 
Evangelist Fountain -- its four-sided pool honors the apostles Matthew, Mark, 
Luke and John -- to the scarlet and pink rosebushes that surround it. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news: The spacious grounds are available for party-giving (sorry, no 
weddings or wedding receptions). In fact, organizations from the San Juan 
Capistrano area frequently use the site for special events, said guild 
president Helen Noon. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to raising funds to preserve the mission, the goal of the Women's 
Guild is to help the mission become a focal point for cultural and educational 
activities for all of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grounds are beautiful during the day," Miller said. "And they're every 
bit as beautiful at night. We light the trees, and it all becomes a fairyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Costs to rent the facility range from $1,500 to $5,000 per day. "The cost 
depends upon how many people you have at your event," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 When guild members and their guests weren't sipping iced tea and sampling 
scones and tarts, they were listening to serenades by 9-year-old harpist Brynn 
Camery-Hoggatt or touring the grounds, courtesy of Muriel Gustin, a mission 
docent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The buildings here are the oldest in continuous use in the state of 
California," said Gustin, who is also a guild member. "And our Father Serra 
Chapel is the only chapel remaining where Father Junipero Serra actually said 
Mass. Historically, that's our claim to fame." 
</P>
<P>
 When party guests looked up, they saw the ripe lavender blooms of jacaranda 
and African chestnut trees, the flame-colored petals of bougainvillea, the 
delicate white flowers that sprout on wisteria and giant cactus. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the horizon: the basilicas of two magnificent churches -- one, the 
187-year-old Great Stone Church, the other, St. John's, the 10-year-old mission 
parish church. 
</P>
<P>
 At their feet, guests saw old cobblestone paths, rolling green lawns and zanja 
, the native-brick lined channels that once carried fresh water to the mission 
from nearby creeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Intermittently, guests heard the joyful peal of church bells and the nostalgic 
sound of a rushing Amtrak train. 
</P>
<P>
 Guild member Rosalyn Frost calls the mission and its environs "a haven." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so peaceful, so calm here," she said. "It's another world -- something 
out of the old days when there was not such a hectic pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests was the Women's Guild founding president Gloria Brendle. "We 
started this group just one year ago," she said. "A bunch of women who didn't 
really know each other came together and learned to work as a team. It has been 
a fabulous experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Biegle and Lydia Uhrik organized the tea party. "A lot of great events 
in history began with tea parties," Miller said, as he formally welcomed 
guests. "Anybody here from Boston?" 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The Aldrins on the move: The 25th anniversary on July 16 of the Apollo 11 
moonwalk has former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and his wife, Lois, zipping around 
the world like jet-setters. "The world is making such a big fuss about this," 
said Lois during a recent telephone interview from her Emerald Bay home. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a palace visit with the king and queen of Spain and a gala 
hobnob with Prince Albert at the Metropole Hotel in Monaco. Today, the couple 
head for Cologne, Germany, and London and Paris, where Buzz Aldrin will do 
television guest spots. 
</P>
<P>
 And come July 16, the Aldrins will return from Europe to attend a gala the 
same day at the Beverly Hilton with Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 18, the couple will fly to Washington for a round of celebrations that 
begin with a breakfast sponsored by the Forbes family and may include a lunch 
at the White House. "We're not sure yet what the President is doing (to 
celebrate) Apollo 11," Lois said. "But we're sure he must be planning 
something."

JACK SMITH: A FITTING REWARD FOR A SKEPTICAL COLUMNIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I flew to Seattle the weekend before last to attend the national 
convention of CSICOP, the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims 
of the Paranormal. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's targets are UFOs and abduction by aliens, life after death, 
recovered memories of sexual abuse and other phenomena for which they say there 
is no proof. 
</P>
<P>
 I was there because CSICOP was giving me an award for Responsibility in 
Journalism and because it paid my way. I couldn't remember writing anything 
specifically about the phenomena they question, but it is true, I am a skeptic, 
and no doubt I have often suggested my disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other reason I could conjure up for my award was my writing that the 
reason for our recent series of disasters -- fire, flood, earthquake and crime 
-- was that God has the gout. This conclusion was not mentioned in the award, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 Many prominent scientists and academics spoke at various sessions through the 
three days, the highlight being a talk by Carl Sagan, prominent astronomer, 
author and host of the TV series "Cosmos." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagan pointed out that the quality of science teaching in our schools is very 
poor. CSICOP says one in four Americans believes in ghosts and almost half 
believe in UFOs and extrasensory perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagan said 25% to 50% of Americans don't know the earth revolves around the 
sun. He said that by one measure, 94% of the population is scientifically 
illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, he said, American culture has no scientific heroes, science 
teaching is mediocre, and while most newspapers run a daily astrology column, 
only a handful have a weekly science page. "When is the last time you heard an 
intelligent comment on science by a President of the United States?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 While he believes in the existence of life elsewhere in the universe -- he 
cited recent discoveries that suggest other stars have planets -- he said there 
is a big difference between that and visiting spaceships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although, "It would be great," he said, "I'd love it, even if the aliens were 
indeed short, sullen, grumpy and sexually preoccupied." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagan said he became interested in astronomy as a small boy when he learned 
there were billions of stars, many larger than our sun. He said he went to a 
public library and asked the librarian for a book on stars. She brought him a 
book on movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Given equal time, Harvard psychiatrist John Mack said he believes that about 
90% of his patients have been abducted and molested by aliens. I don't know 
about the rest of the CSICOPs, but I didn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Bassett, a North Carolina free-lance journalist, embarrassed Mack by 
saying, "I've never seen a UFO nor have I been abducted." She had been a 
subject in one of his books, posing as an abductee, and Mack had accepted her 
story. She said Mack was simply gullible. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Loftus, a University of Washington psychologist, told the skeptics 
that it is possible to create entirely false memories of things that never 
happened. She is the author of "The Myth of Repressed Memory," alleging 
therapists are planting false memories in sexual molestation cases. Loftus 
received the committee's In Praise of Reason award. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to me it would have been a good time for an alien spaceship to land 
in Seattle and confound the skeptics. The closest thing to a spaceship was a 
new Boeing 777 we saw from our car as the plane landed at Boeing field. It was 
big, streamlined and glossy white. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the new Boeing 777," cried my wife's niece, Marilyn O'Neill, who was 
driving. We'd had lunch with her and her son Dan, both residents of Seattle, at 
a restaurant overlooking downtown and industrial Seattle. "You're watching 
history," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 777 was still in a testing stage, she said, so this was one of its first 
flights. It was a remarkable airplane, undoubtedly, but not likely to be 
landing on other planets. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers at the conference said paranormal claimants aren't necessarily lying. 
But even the smartest person can be fooled by the mind into seeing things that 
aren't there. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier incident had nothing to do with the paranormal -- yet it showed a 
strange lapse in my wife's mind. She is usually very reliable, but when we got 
to my son's house, on the way to the airport for our flight to Seattle, we 
discovered that she had forgotten to pack my neckties. I borrowed two from my 
son. Later she discovered that she had forgotten to pack my dress pants. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter, after all, because most of the skeptics were dressed like 
carwash employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no spaceships landed during the conference, the streets of downtown 
Seattle were thronged by 10,000 people on a March for Jesus, part of a 
worldwide event. None of the marchers were invited to address the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sharon Filip, a Seattle hypnotherapist, spoke, describing her encounter 
with a UFO. According to the Seattle Times, she asked the CSICOP crowd how many 
believed in God. "Not one hand was raised." 
</P>
<P>
 If they're right, my theory about God having the gout must be wrong.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED: COMMITMENTS; LISTEN TO EACH OTHER WITH AN OPEN MIND

 Betty is fed up. "Dave gives more affection to the dog than he does to me," 
says the 38-year-old mother of three, who recently went back to work as a 
teacher. His indifference is driving her crazy: He doesn't listen when she 
talks, refuses to respond when she needs to discuss a problem and never does 
anything that he's promised to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty hates nagging. "But Dave won't do anything unless I ask him a dozen 
times. He thinks his only responsibility is to bring home a paycheck," she 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Evenings are punctuated by battles, and last night was typical: As Betty was 
telling Dave what she'd be serving for a dinner party they were hosting on 
Saturday, he informed her that she had never told him about the bash and, 
furthermore, he had no intention of canceling the weekend fishing trip he'd 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 18 years they've been married, Betty says, they had never fought -- 
but that was only because she kept her complaints to herself. But recently her 
doctor has warned that her chronic headaches and stomachaches are most likely 
triggered by stress, so she's vowed to speak up. Her words, however, fall on 
deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave, 39, is fed up, too, and he insists Betty didn't mention the party: "She 
plans everything the way she wants, then maneuvers me to fit her plans. I go 
along so she won't yell. I can't compete with Betty in an argument. But this 
time, I'd had enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave is sick of being ordered around: "If I don't adhere to her routines or 
meet her expectations, boy, do I hear about it." As a result, he's learned to 
treat his wife the same way he treated his overbearing mother: Whenever she 
criticized him, he simply nodded -- and did exactly as he pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dave has agreed to shoulder more domestic responsibilities now that 
his wife is working, he's not thrilled about it. "My parents were very 
traditional and I can't help thinking a woman's place is in the home," he 
admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave feels that no matter how hard he tries, he can never do enough for Betty. 
He doesn't want a divorce, but he can't understand why his wife can never see 
his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "The all-too-common pattern that Betty and Dave have fallen into is an 
indication that under-the-surface resentment and anger are not being 
communicated directly," says New York marriage therapist Jane Greer Betty and 
Dave need to recognize this pattern and work to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Betty doesn't understand Dave's point of view is that he rarely 
expresses it. When he does, she rarely listens. Although he may not agree with 
her, he can't stand to fight. Although he hears what Betty says, it makes him 
angry, and he's adept at putting it out of his mind and forgetting about it. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're in a situation like Betty's, you must learn to talk to your partner 
in a non-critical, non-demanding way. Calmly tell your spouse what you need him 
to do and give a reasonable time frame. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, listen to your partner's response with an open mind and 
allow him to express an opinion. Let him know you see his point if, for 
example, he says he can't get to something today but will do it on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 If something you ask for simply cannot wait, tell him so calmly and make 
arrangements to handle it another way. Your partner, on the other hand, must 
carefully consider his own needs and wishes and clearly express them to you. 
</P>
<P>
 After practicing these techniques, Betty has learned to express herself in a 
positive way. Dave feels less henpecked and is willing to listen. Because he is 
no longer afraid to speak up, they have been able to negotiate compromises.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; U.S. KEEPS THINKING POSITIVE; SOCCER: KNOWING 
ODDS ARE SLIM FOR VICTORY TODAY AGAINST BRAZIL, PLAYERS AGAIN FOCUS ON ROLE AS 
GIANT-KILLERS. 
</P>

 What scrap of optimism is there to which the U.S. World Cup team can cling, 
going into today's second-round match against three-time champion Brazil? What 
filament of hope dangles like a lifeline before the most important game in U.S. 
soccer history? 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that beyond the on-a-given-day axioms and underneath the pop 
psychology positive-thinking burbling, lies the brutal reality of the moment. 
An inexperienced U.S. team of largely amateur players will line up against the 
most talented and most creative soccer team on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 What encouraging words would anyone offer the United States, the team that 
beat Colombia but fell in disarray against Romania. Will the giant-killers be 
felled by giants, when the teams meet at 12:30 p.m. at Stanford Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 This team of scrappers and overachievers has developed selective auditory 
perception: It hears what it wants to hear and disregards the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 What, Ernie Stewart was asked, will be the United States' greatest weapon 
against Brazil? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our American mentality," was his quick response. 
</P>
<P>
 Translated, this means that even in the face of snickering from international 
media, the American players have consistently maintained they are capable of 
beating Brazil. The U.S. players and coaches mean it when they say it, and they 
are aware of the absurdity of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know who we are playing," goalkeeper Tony Meola said. 
</P>
<P>
 The David and Goliath scenario works well for the United States, just as it 
serves to add more weight to the pressure that threatens to crush Brazil under 
a mountain of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been saying it all week," assistant coach Sigi Schmid said, "the hardest 
thing to do in sports is win when you are supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Brazil is expected to win this game easily. Coach Carlos Albert 
Parreira has been savaged in the Brazilian media and by the public, 
particularly after the team's 1-1 tie with Sweden. The critics are all 
clamoring for Parreira to change his lineup; Brazilian President Itamar Franco 
has given his opinion on the matter, as has Parreira's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one change was made Sunday, as Parreira announced he was benching 
midfielder Rai. His place in the central midfield will be taken by Dunga, and 
Mazinho replaces Dunga as the outside right midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are thought to give Brazil added speed and ball control, and 
Parreira was quick to note the changes were his idea and not in response to 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 It might hearten the United States to know it is capable of forcing a 
Brazilian lineup change. 
</P>
<P>
 The speculation on the U.S. lineup changes center on the midfield. John Harkes 
is serving a one-game suspension and U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic has given no 
indication which player and which tactical philosophy he will employ in making 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic's caution is well-placed. The forward combination of Bebeto and 
Romario has been lethal; Romario has scored in each of Brazil's three 
first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States will concentrate on staying compact and not getting 
stretched, a problem for it in this tournament. Once the midfield loses contact 
with the two forwards, the team's ability to make use of its speed is greatly 
diminished. Winning the ball in the midfield and turning it around on the 
counterattack is the hallmark of the U.S. plan, as is stopping Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't get too concerned about just one of their players," Tab Ramos said. 
"They all attack and they all have the ability to come forward. Romario can be 
stopped. It's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how that would be done, Ramos laughed and said, "I haven't the slightest 
idea."

SAMPRAS PRODUCES A WINNING SEQUEL; WIMBLEDON: IVANISEVIC SAYS HE NEVER HAD A 
CHANCE AS AMERICAN WINS SECOND CONSECUTIVE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Re-Pete. . . . . Two-Pete . . . . call it whatever you want because it doesn't 
matter to Pete Sampras. He came to Centre Court Sunday for a second consecutive 
Wimbledon singles championship, not a slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 He left with both. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras overwhelmed Goran Ivanisevic, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-5), 6-0, in a match 
that left the defeated Croatian mumbling and muttering in disbelief. It left 
everyone else wondering if they had witnessed the beginnings of the next tennis 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "He play too good," said Ivanisevic, who was seeded fourth. "I never had a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is new? Nobody had a chance against the No. 1-seeded Sampras 
during the fortnight. He lost only one set in seven matches. If he has a 
weakness in his game, nobody found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Ivanisevic and his left-handed serve were supposed to change all 
that. According to Ivanisevic, Sampras would spend the day waving at blurs. The 
American would become a one-Wimbledon Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Sampras produced 17 aces, returned about as well as possible against 
Ivanisevic's 119-m.p.h. first serve, won the two crucial tiebreakers, never 
lost his serve and generally humbled his once-confident opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't lose my confidence," said Ivanisevic, who has reached the finals 
twice and lost each time. "I mean, he was just too good." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Ion Tiriac, a former tennis star who now serves as Ivanisevic's 
manager: "Sampras is the best player, the most complete player since Rod Laver 
and with more power. I believe Sampras played better today than any other (day 
of his career) against the only guy in the world who could have beaten him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras knew he had flirted with perfection. When he and Ivanisevic met at the 
net to exchange handshakes, Sampras could manage only a sheepish, "Sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic shrugged. Sampras tried again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played too good," Sampras said. "I couldn't play better." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," said Ivanisevic, "that's great." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Sampras' fifth Grand Slam event title, four of them won in the last 12 
months. The No. 1 world ranking has been his for all but a few weeks since 
April of 1993. And Sampras logged less playing time to win his seven Wimbledon 
matches than it took Todd Martin and Boris Becker to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the important number to remember is this: He's only 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now . . . . I'm feeling pretty stoked right now," said Sampras, sending 
the foreign press contingent into a tizzy. ("Stoked? What is this stoked?") 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare display of postmatch emotion, Sampras flung two of his prized 
graphite rackets into the Centre Court audience. Later he tossed a pair of 
shirts into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have taken all my clothes off because I won two in a row," Sampras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic tossed his racket away, too, as well as a shirt. In retrospect, he 
should have tossed in the towel after the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Sampras had turned back every Ivanisevic challenge. When Ivanisevic 
kept blasting aces past him -- 25 in all -- Sampras looked as if he wanted to 
yawn. When Ivanisevic was up break point in the 11th game of the first set, 
Sampras sent back a service winner. When Ivanisevic took a 2-1 lead in the 
tiebreaker, Sampras responded with six consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 On and on it went. Ivanisevic had break point in the fourth game of the second 
set . . . . and stuck a backhand in the net. You only get so many chances 
against Sampras, and Ivanisevic was blowing each precious one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt, if Goran was going to win, it was going to be a long road for him," 
Sampras said. "It was very hot and I felt like I was getting on his serve more 
and more as the match went on, and the serve probably came down about 10 miles 
an hour slower in the third (set). He just got really down on himself. That's 
when I raised my tennis a notch." 
</P>
<P>
 If a 6-0 third-set blitzing is a notch, then Ivanisevic and everyone else on 
the men's tour isn't in a hurry to see two notches. Sampras won all but seven 
points in the final set. Ivanisevic couldn't do a thing. His ace totals had 
fallen from 16 in the first to eight in the second to one in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 As the aces declined, play improved. Of the 49 minutes it took to finish the 
first set, there was only five minutes of actual play. And depending on the 
statistician, there was no point in the entire match (206 in all) that lasted 
longer than six shots -- and there were only three of those. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put us on clay, sure, we'll have some long rallies for you," Sampras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was grass, where serves and volleys ruled. Or more correctly, where 
Sampras was king. 
</P>
<P>
 When the championship was at last his, Sampras planted a big kiss on the 18 
1/2-inch-high silver gilt cup presented to him by the Duchess of Kent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can write what you want, you can say what you want, but the fact is I 
have got two in a row and that's something that's going to stay with me for as 
long as we're all living," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year he goes for history. No American male has won three consecutive 
Wimbledon titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main concern I have is to win and focus on winning," Sampras said. "I 
just hope people can appreciate how I go about my tennis and how I play."

DODGERS, ANGELS EACH HAVE ONE ALL-STAR; VOTING: PIAZZA IS SELECTED AS THE NL'S 
STARTING CATCHER. DAVIS WILL BE AN AL RESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Dodgers and Angels each placed only one player on the National and 
American league All-Star teams announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza of the Dodgers won the fan vote and will be the starting catcher 
for the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis of the Angels was selected as an outfield reserve by Cito Gaston 
of the Toronto Blue Jays, who will manage the American League team in the July 
12 game at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said it was "strange and surprising" that only 
Piazza will represent the team that leads the National League West, saying Raul 
Mondesi, Brett Butler and Tim Wallach are all deserving. However, he did not 
criticize Philadelphia Phillie Manager Jim Fregosi, who will guide the NL team, 
saying it is impossible to pick every deserving player because the fans select 
the starters and the manager must then make sure every team has at least one 
representative on the 28-man squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year I sent letters to six players apologizing for not being able to pick 
them," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi, who watched his Phillies lose to the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium on 
Sunday, 3-1, joined Gaston in calling for expansion of the teams to 32 players, 
but said he had no problem with the fans selecting the starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the fans' game and they should have the opportunity to see who 
they want to see. I think it generates a lot of interest," Fregosi said. "In 
picking the rest of the squad, I tried to pick the guys who were most deserving 
and gave us the best chance of winning. Not everyone is going to agree, but 
there are only so many spots. Consider the outfield. I could have picked all 
three Montreal outfielders (he picked only Moises Alou). I mean, Marquis 
Grissom leads the league in runs and I didn't pick him." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more difficult, Fregosi said, were first base and third base, where the 
fans selected the St. Louis Cardinals' Gregg Jefferies -- "if the fans hadn't 
voted me in, I wouldn't even be on the team," Jefferies said -- and the San 
Francisco Giants' Matt Williams as the starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi picked the Houston Astros' Jeff Bagwell -- "He leads the majors in 
RBIs and is the best young player in the league" -- and the Atlanta Braves' 
Fred McGriff -- "I wanted the left-handed hitter coming off the bench" -- as 
the first base backups over Andres Galarraga, who is having another big year 
after leading the NL in hitting last season. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked the Astros' Ken Caminiti over Wallach as the backup at third, with 
Carlos Garcia, Pittsburgh's only representative, getting a spot among the 
infield reserves. "Caminiti and Wallach are having similar seasons, but 
Caminiti is the best defensive third baseman in the league," Fregosi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wallach: "I would have enjoyed going, but it's not a must for me. The 
three days off are probably better for me at this point. I mean, I won't be the 
only guy who maybe deserves to go but wasn't selected. Some will have hard 
feelings about it, but I'm not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Butler: "I made it once and that's good enough. Whether I think I should 
have made it or not, it's not for me to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, selected as a rookie reserve last year, received 2,536,825 votes, 
about 300,000 more than Kirt Manwaring of the Giants. Piazza said it was a 
tremendous honor and would count his blessings, considering how many deserving 
players weren't selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed last year, but will have a better idea of what to expect this 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal shortstop Ozzie Smith, who will start for the 11th time, led National 
League balloting with 3,514,824 votes and said, "I think it's the fans way of 
saying 'thank you,' and I'm very appreciative." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle Mariner center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. received a record 6,079,688 
votes.CALIFORNIA A

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; SHOWTIME, STARRING MARADONA; SOCCER: 
SUSPENSION NOTWITHSTANDING, HE DRAWS ATTENTION AS TELEVISION COMMENTATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No, the ghost of Diego Maradona did not haunt the two-time World Cup champion 
Argentine team Sunday afternoon in the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 How could it when the body was warm, in the building and fully credentialed as 
a TV commentator? 
</P>
<P>
 The Buenos Aires television station Artea added Maradona as a last-minute 
guest analyst to its coverage of the Argentina-Romania match at the Rose Bowl, 
drug suspension be damned. (Must be sweeps week in Argentina). In fact, 
Maradona was a later-than-last-minute addition, arriving to his outdoor press 
row seat -- with a police escort -- with the game already two minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona arrived as inconspicuously as possible, as is his nature. With two 
bodyguards and eight stern-looking men in uniform running interference, 
Maradona sauntered up the Rose Bowl steps in official "I'm Maradona!" 
leisure-wear: thick black Ray-Bay sunglasses, glittering gold earring and the 
worst shirt in Pasadena -- a red, green, yellow, white and black fiasco that 
combined photo images of British Beefeater guards and the side of a dairy cow. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA had consented to credential Maradona for the match, but refused to 
sanction a fireworks display, which was all his entrance lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diego! Diego!" chanted the crowd as a surreal scene began to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field below, Team Argentina was playing for a berth in the World Cup 
quarterfinals without its marquee playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Up in the stands, it was the sans Diego zoo, with fans rushing the press area 
for autographs, pictures or a possible handshake, most them thwarted by the 
purple-bereted security force that has come to be known as "Barney's Army" by 
the World Cup media. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, the crush around Maradona's seat threatened to veer out of 
control. So many fans climbed on top of a nearby aluminum bench, straining to 
catch a glimpse of their hero, that the bench broke. Several people threw 
expensive cameras over rows of working journalists to an Artea technician, 
begging him to take a photo of Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 When the technician completed the task for one man, the camera's owner then 
suggested, "I'm gonna throw you my girlfriend. Can he sign her, too?" 
</P>
<P>
 A blue-and-white festooned fan made a run with a sign that read "MARADONA 
SOCCER GOD IS INNOCENT. . . . THE THRILL IS GONE." Seconds later, so was the 
fan, pushed away by security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign-toter carried a message in Spanish: "FIFA NO TIENE VERGUENZA" -- 
FIFA has no shame. 
</P>
<P>
 And another: "DIEGO WE LOVE YOU." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with certain codes of fashion, Maradona broke the cardinal rule of 
sports journalism: No cheering in the press box. When Abel Balbo scored 
Argentina's second goal in the 74th minute, Maradona leaped from his seat, 
clenched both fists and bellowed, "BALBO!" Maradona's wife Claudia, presumably 
issued a companion-of-the-guest-analyst's pass, shouted, too, and wrapped a 
bearhug around her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, when Gheorge Hagi scored to put Romania up, 3-1, the guest 
commentator stopped commentating altogether. For a full 30 seconds, a forlorn 
Maradona plopped his chin on the television monitor in front of him, staring 
glumly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 84th minute, Maradona, and the security brigade, could take no more, so 
they reassembled the escort and headed for the nearest exit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going back with the boys," Maradona said. "I have to return with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I returned after our failure in 1982. I returned in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "And," said MacArthur Maradona, "I shall return in 1994."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; ROMANIA REVELS IN MOMENTOUS ACHIEVEMENT; 
SOCCER: COACH IORDANESCU CALLS VICTORY OVER ARGENTINA "MAYBE GREATEST EVENT 
CELEBRATED BY OUR PEOPLE" SINCE 1989 REVOLUTION. 
</P>

 The religious cross that Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu clutches tightly in 
his hand during soccer matches is as much an inspiration as it is for luck. He 
had never revealed the giver of the gift or the habit to the outside world, 
only to his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Iordanescu wanted the whole world to know shortly after his Romanian 
soccer team announced its arrival among the world's elite, advancing to the 
World Cup quarterfinals with a 3-2 victory over Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 A FIFA press officer asked Iordanescu what he holds in his hand during a game. 
For a moment, it seemed as though the proud coach wasn't going to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is something of intimacy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone at the news conference watched and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a cross passed on to me. This cross was given to me as a gift from 
Father Argath, a saint from Romania. He is 87 years old. My family and I are 
believers. This is a thing I always have with me at every game, at every moment 
of every game." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the ever-changing swirl of emotions continued at the World Cup, and 
Sunday, the Romanians took hold of all the pride and happiness and refused to 
let go. Iordanescu said in no uncertain terms that it was Romania's finest 
moment since the 1989 revolution that changed his and the players' world 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "From all the statistics I have seen, surely this is the greatest moment in 
Romanian soccer," he said. "This moment created a great happiness with our 
people at home. "Maybe this is the greatest event celebrated by our people 
since the revolution. I would like to congratulate my players for something so 
magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
 Understand that the previous biggest moment for the soccer team was last 
week's victory over the United States. Thousands of Romanians got out of bed in 
the middle of the night and poured into the streets of Bucharest, celebrating 
the victory at 1 a.m. More than 10,000 fans packed the main streets of the 
country's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Midfielder Ilie Dumitrescu, who scored twice and added an assist: 
"Romania today had its greatest performance in history. We eliminated one of 
the best teams in the world. We did it for the Romanian people. I am very happy 
for Romania today because it is a unique moment." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a difference because Romania's other sporting triumphs have been by 
individuals. Pre-revolution there were gymnast Nadia Comaneci and tennis 
players Ilie Nastase and Ion Tiriac. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania had always had a proud soccer history -- dating to a 1930 World Cup 
debut -- but this is the first time it has advanced past the second round. In 
1990 in Italy, Romania lost to Ireland in the second round on penalty kicks. 
Romania will play Sweden in the quarterfinals at Stanford Stadium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, almost no one could have guessed Romania's presence in the final 
eight. As for Iordanescu, he wasn't even the team's coach a little more than a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the only coach to take over a European team in the middle of World Cup 
qualifying and lead it into the tournament. Iordanescu replaced Cornel Dinu on 
June 24, 1993, after Romania had suffered an embarrassing 5-2 loss to 
Czechoslovakia earlier in the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Iordanescu, a former Romanian national team star, had scored 26 goals and made 
64 international appearances. One of his biggest problems was trying to get his 
players back from European leagues. The Romanians have been able to play abroad 
since the revolution and the assassination of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the problems in Romania, a little adversity has not bothered the 
team. On Sunday, it was without a top player, striker Florin Raducioiu, who 
drew two yellow cards in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went from agony to ecstasy. It was a very exciting game," Iordanescu said. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have said the same thing about his country.

COMMENTARY: TEAM FIGHTS VALIANTLY TO STAY ALIVE IN TOURNAMENT, BUT TERRIFIC 
PERFORMANCES BY ROMANIA'S HAGI AND DUMITRESCU PROVE TO BE TOO MUCH.

<P>
 We cry for you, Argentina.  
</P>
<P>
 You played in a soccer game for the ages Sunday, played with what your coach 
called "fire and vigor" and still, despite the wondrousness of a Romanian team 
that just gets better and better, you kept trying. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, you never left us.  
</P>
<P>
 You were a team that came as one of the favorites to win World Cup '94, and 
you had to persevere through injury and the distraction of the loss of your 
superstar, Maradona, to yet another drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 But few teams, with or without Maradona, could have been prepared for the kind 
of magic you faced at the Rose Bowl on Sunday in Gheorghe Hagi and Ilie 
Dumitrescu, who turned a soccer game into a basketball fast break. This was a 
series of two-on-ones and three-on-ones, with Magic Johnson in the middle and 
Michael Jordan running one of the wings. And you never stopped chasing and 
breaking on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 When it ended, and Romania had won, 3-2, the true measure of this World Cup 
classic was the scene on the field, a litter of exhausted and drained bodies. 
Even at the end, you were there, in your blue-striped uniforms, scattered amid 
Romanians in yellow jerseys, with the same look of total physical and emotional 
fatigue they had. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not until the Romanians regrouped near midfield 10 minutes after the 
match had ended and formed a yellow circle of celebration, dancing and bouncing 
and rotating all at once, would the reality set in for you. Argentina is out of 
the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 As for fortune, and as for fame, you never invited them in.  
</P>
<P>
 But there you were, in front of 90,496 people and millions more on television, 
facing a team that began the tournament with low expectations and has developed 
into a team that clearly can win it all. You had the reputation, but it now 
seems that they have the players. Hagi made a 40-yard goal against Colombia 
that darted and dipped into the goal like it had been steered by remote 
control. Then Dumitrescu did the same thing against you on a free kick that had 
only one spot of the goal it could reach untouched and, over the defensive line 
and over your goalkeeper and still under the crossbar it went. More Romanian 
remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 With your star, Maradona, 50 rows up in the stands and on the wrong side of 
the television cameras, your young Arnaldo Ortega dribbled and crossed and 
started and ended runs toward the Romanian goal. He wasn't Maradona, but he 
might be someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Your midfielder, Fernando Redondo, might have said it best for all of you: 
</P>
<P>
 "This team's attitude was outstanding. Even when we were down, 3-1, and 
Romania was pulling back on defense, we continued to attack. We have nothing to 
apologize for. We gave everything, down to the last drop of sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 All through your wild days, your mad existence, you kept your promise.  
</P>
<P>
 In a sport that all too often is missing them, yours was a game of dozens of 
chances. This was run-and-shoot soccer. If somebody looks closely, they will 
see paint chipped off the goalposts and cross bars. It was excitement. It was 
showtime in Los Angeles and the Lakers weren't anywhere around. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet you lost, on a day that soccer fans worldwide will remember for the 
intensity of play and the effort put forth on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we were defeated," defender Oscar Ruggeri said, "we have to keep 
our heads high. We earned that today." 
</P>
<P>
 In defeat, you earned the respect of millions, including the man whose team 
sent you home to Buenos Aires, Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though they (Argentina) are no longer in the tournament," he said, "they 
are still one of the best teams to play in it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why we cry for you, Argentina.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; SOCCER; DEFENSE, PLANNING PUT HEAT ON SAUDIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Last Viking," otherwise known as Swedish midfielder Tomas Brolin, was 
talking to writers in the so-called mixed zone when the question of defense 
came up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweden's defense is looking very good. Can you comment a bit about that?" he 
was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's looking very good," Brolin replied straight-faced, then laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brolin who orchestrates the Swedish attack from his position on the right side 
of midfield, knows more about offense than defense, so perhaps his reply might 
have been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been better to have asked fellow midfielders Stefan Schwarz or 
Jonas Thern the same question since it was their tireless work Sunday that was 
a major factor in Sweden's 3-1 victory over Saudi Arabia in front of 60,277 
sun-baked fans at the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, neither was available. Schwarz did not show up in the mixed 
zone and Thern had been taken to Baylor University to have a diagnostic test 
performed on his injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the forwards -- the goal scorers -- get all of the attention after a 
victory, while the defenders usually get the blame after a loss. But Sweden's 
defense was every bit as important in getting the team through to the World Cup 
quarterfinals as the goals by Martin Dahlin and Kennet Andersson. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Swedes, the key to Sunday's success was preparation and planning. 
Unlike other teams -- Morocco, Belgium and, to a lesser degree, the Netherlands 
-- Sweden did not take the Saudis for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Saudi Arabia) is a very good team," Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its best quality is in attack, a very powerful and fast attack. But I think 
we probably are the team that has analyzed the Saudis best and we knew how to 
deal with them. I don't think the other teams have been as serious about Saudi 
Arabia as we have been." 
</P>
<P>
 That was lesson one. Lesson two was learned from the Germans, who barely held 
on for a 3-2 victory over South Korea in the Cotton Bowl last week because they 
expended all their energy early on, then wilted in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took it more easy and played more economic from the start," Svensson said. 
"I think that the Germans rushed for the whole first half, but we took some 
pauses in our play in the first half. We learned a lot from that match, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 It helped, of course, that Sweden had taken the lead on Dahlin's sixth-minute 
header at the far post. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was important and a strong motivation for the Swedish defenders," said 
Jorge Solari, the Saudis' Argentine coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden plays with a four-man defensive line using Roger Ljung at left back, 
Joachim Bjorklund and Patrik Andersson at center back and Roland Nilsson at 
right back. In addition, Schwarz and Thern frequently drop back to help out the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli has a solid wall in front of him and it 
took the Saudis until the last five minutes to find a way through. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew before the match that it was going to be a very difficult task for us 
and we tried to prepare ourselves both for the heat and for the way that we 
knew Saudi Arabia would like to play," Svensson said, giving a nod of 
recognition to his defense. "The defense is the key to success, and I don't 
only speak about the four in the back line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense in midfield and up front is very good. And when we have players 
like Stefan Schwarz and Jonas Thern in the center of the midfield, I think we 
are very difficult to play (against)." 
</P>
<P>
 To their dismay, the Saudis learned that. They relied on the quick 
counterattack, but time and again promising Saudi offensive moves foundered on 
the rocks of the Swedish defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw their lineup before the game, I knew they would play with Hamza 
Falatah and Sami Al Jaber up top," Svensson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very fast, quick players and we knew that we must prevent the Saudi 
midfield from playing the long passes and be very careful in our back line. I 
think we did that very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjorklund, who is Svensson's nephew, said the defenders did not receive much 
special instruction before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted us to play patiently and do what we are best at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they did, Sweden is in the final eight and looking better every day, 
as Romania will discover next Sunday in Palo Alto.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / ROUND OF 16; MOURNING FILLS COLOMBIA; SHOOTING: ALLEGED 
GUNMAN ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF ESCOBAR AS NATION TRIES TO COME TO TERMS WITH 
LATEST VIOLENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 As police announced the capture of an alleged gunman, thousands of Colombians 
surged through the streets of Medellin on Sunday to mourn soccer player Andres 
Escobar, killed for his accidental role in the national team's elimination from 
the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Draped in the Colombian flag and crying "Justice," sorrowful and outraged fans 
crowded a stadium to view Escobar's simple wooden casket and then accompanied 
the funeral cortege to a packed cemetery. As fellow players looked on, the 
27-year-old defender was buried after a eulogy from President Cesar Gaviria. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar was shot to death in his hometown of Medellin early Saturday by gunmen 
who chided him for accidentally scoring a goal against his own team in 
Colombia's World Cup match against the United States. Colombia, despite its 
initial ranking as a favorite, went on to lose the June 22 game in a shocking 
upset and eventually was eliminated from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they suspect drug traffickers who reportedly bet on Colombia and 
lost huge amounts of money might have been behind the murder. Judicial 
officials said Sunday they had arrested a disgruntled bettor who they believe 
is behind the killing, but they did not identify the suspect as a drug 
trafficker. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most Colombians remained suspicious and fearful that the same drug 
violence that has claimed the lives of presidential candidates, journalists and 
hundreds of other Colombians through the years -- and that previously had 
tainted the beloved national sport -- had struck again. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new outrage has descended on the nation with the death of (Escobar)," the 
Bogota daily El Espectador said in its lead editorial Sunday. "Nothing in the 
course of human relations justifies an act like this." 
</P>
<P>
 El Tiempo, Colombia's largest newspaper, said, "We ponder this, and still we 
do not find the answer to who we are, or what the origin is of this violence 
that kills without compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 A man identified as Humberto Castro Munoz was arrested late Saturday and 
confessed Sunday to shooting Escobar, according to Humberto Rodriguez, chief of 
the national intelligence police. Castro Munoz, who was transferred under heavy 
guard to Bogota on Sunday, apparently worked for Santiago Gallon Henao, who 
authorities suspect ordered the murder because of his gambling losses. Gallon 
Henao was also in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 It was still not clear if the murder was premeditated or occurred 
spontaneously in a drunken rage, as some officials claim. Escobar was gunned 
down about 3 a.m. Saturday as he left a restaurant in Medellin, 150 miles 
northeast of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 At the funeral, family and fans wept openly as Gaviria blamed the young soccer 
star's death on the "absurd violence" that plagues Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andres Escobar will remain in our memory as a loyal player, a complete man, a 
good family man and as a model Colombian," Gaviria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar's coffin was wrapped in the green-and-white flag of his club team, 
Atletico Nacional. Mourners draped themselves in national flags, a ritual that 
has become typical at soccer games, chanted for justice and tossed flowers at 
the casket. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourners began filing past Escobar's coffin Saturday night and continued 
through Sunday, at one point lining up for five city blocks to catch a glimpse 
of their fallen hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unpardonable!" shouted the banner front-page headline in Medellin's El 
Colombiano. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had stepped up security for other members of the national 
soccer team. Two assistant coaches, Hernan Dario Gomez and Juan Jose Pelaez, 
announced Sunday they were quitting.

WILLIAMS REPORTED IN FAIR CONDITION; SHOOTING MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golfer Kim Williams, shot in the neck while walking to a store, was reported 
in fair condition Sunday while police said the shooting was possibly an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Williams was shot in the neck about 9 p.m. Saturday while walking 
through the parking lot to a discount store. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles police Capt. Bruce Simeone suggested late Saturday that Williams was the 
victim of an apparent drive-by shooting. But on Sunday, Simeone said a man who 
lives behind the store turned over an unloaded nine-millimeter pistol he had 
used Saturday night for target practice. A projectile believed to be a 
nine-millimeter bullet casing was found near the scene of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 31, of Boca Raton, Fla., was competing in the Youngstown-Warren LPGA 
Classic.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD; SPRINGER WANTS TO CRASH THE MAJORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember at the end of the movie "Bull Durham," when Crash Davis goes to 
Asheville, N.C., to hit his minor league-record breaking home run and no one 
calls The Sporting News with the story? And remember how only Crash and Annie 
Savoy knew it was a record? 
</P>
<P>
 Real life, even in the minor leagues, is a bit different. Baseball America 
keeps track of all manner of records, and the latest edition contains a list of 
top active minor league players. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting the season, Steve Springer, Orange County's Crash Davis, was among 
the top five in hits (1,407) and doubles (247). 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, 33, from Marina High and Golden West College, began his pro career 
in 1982 and has had only two short stints in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I just got a paycheck the other day," he said, laughing. "It could be 
worse. It could be a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Springer is the starting third baseman for the Toledo Mudhens, 
the Detroit Tigers' triple-A affiliate. He's batting .280 and hoping the Tigers 
give him another crack at the majors before the season is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling my wife this is going to be it," Springer said. "But it's 
tough to retire. I've been the MVP on my team three out of the last five years 
and I've never seen the big leagues in September." 
</P>
<P>
 Earning a promotion to Detroit would figure to be an easier accomplishment 
than breaking the all-time minor league hit record, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer probably would have to play into his late 40s to eclipse the mark of 
3,617 hits set by Spencer Harris, who played from 1921 to 1948. Harris, who 
died at 81 in 1982, also played four seasons in the majors with the Chicago 
White Sox, Washington Senators and Philadelphia Athletics. He had 94 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody showed me that list the other day," Springer said. "I think I was 
higher last year, but Skeeter Barnes, my teammate, moved onto the list. I'm 
creeping up on my 1,500th hit. I'm sure I'll get the ball and save it." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer said Toldeo Manager Larry Parrish has dubbed him "Old Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Old man keeps flying, though," Springer said. "Old man is hitting third. It's 
tough to quit. If I were hitting .220 with no production it would be easier." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Springer: He hopes to continue his career in baseball no matter what 
transpires this season or next. He said he's been approached about coaching or 
scouting when his playing days are over. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great benefits of playing for six organizations is getting to know 
a number of baseball people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no real chip on my shoulder," said Springer, whose first major league 
hit came on May 22, 1990, off Angel left-hander Chuck Finley. "I feel I've 
gotten two breaks by getting there (to the majors). I can't complain. I could 
be going to work 9 to 5 every day. I plan on coaching or scouting when I 
finish, but there's always time to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know. You play triple A you never know. You still have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add lists: Seattle infielder Rich Amaral, from Estancia High and Orange Coast, 
the oldest rookie in the majors last year, ranks fifth in stolen bases with 
327. The all-time record is 948 by George Hogrieiver, set from 1889-1912. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaral and Springer are close friends, speaking on the telephone once every 
two weeks or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-handed pitcher Paul Abbott of Sunny Hills is tied for fifth with 865 
strikeouts. Abbott is 4-1 for Omaha, Kansas City's triple-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 The late George Brunet, an Angel from 1964-69, set the all-time strikeout 
record of 3,175 between 1953-85. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four suspensions, $4,425 in fines and another black eye for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the totals after a fight last week between the West Palm Beach 
Expos and the Charlotte (Fla.) Rangers, sparked by a home-plate collision 
between Steve Gill and Daryl Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill, from El Dorado High and Cypress College, was out by a good 10 feet on a 
throw home, but he attempted to jar the ball loose by running into Kennedy. And 
the rumble was on. 
</P>
<P>
 Four West Palm Beach and three Charlotte players either were not at the game, 
in the clubhouse or in the scorekeeper's shack. Otherwise, it was your typical 
benches- and bullpen-clearing scrum. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dust settled last week, Florida State League president Chuck Murphy 
came down hard on the brawlers. Gill and Kennedy each were fined $125 and 
suspended three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time this year we've had what I consider a brawl," Murphy told 
the Associated Press. "This was the turning point, as far as I was concerned, 
that I was going to take action to get this kind of thing stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Promo o' the week: The Lake Elsinore Storm, the Angels' Class-A affiliate, 
last week extended an invitation for Mujibar and Sirajul, salesmen-turned-cult 
heroes on "Late Show With David Letterman" to attend a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are barnstorming the country, feeding Letterman straight lines from 
Niagara Falls to Las Vegas to a Montana trout stream. In keeping with the 
theme, the Storm has offered Mujibar Rahman and Sirajul Islam a chance to take 
batting practice, serve as bat boys or groundskeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already got lockers and uniforms ready for Mujibar and Sirajul," Storm 
General Manager Kevin Haughian said.

THE BUZZ SURROUNDING ALDRIN; PROFILE: EX-ASTRONAUT AND O.C. RESIDENT IS BUSIER 
THAN EVER AS MOON LANDING'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY NEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The televised image of Buzz Aldrin planting and saluting the U.S. flag on the 
moon 25 years ago is one of the most familiar of the Space Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the former astronaut, the second man to walk on the lunar surface, is 
still a familiar face on TV, only now he's in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Aldrin's latest commercial ventures is being a pitchman for Snapple soft 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We chose Buzz because he is one of the first men on the moon and one of the 
most recognized astronauts in history," said a spokeswoman for the New York ad 
agency that created the Snapple spot. (In the commercial, a man who writes to 
Snapple praising its products tours a space memorabilia exhibit with Aldrin, 
who then escorts the customer to a kiddie ride that looks like a spaceship.) 
</P>
<P>
 The former test pilot and Korean War veteran, who lives in the exclusive 
Emerald Bay community north of Laguna Beach, also promotes porcelain astronaut 
figurines, neckties with designs copied from photos of moon rocks and a variety 
of "Buzz Aldrin licensed products" that range from watches to commemorative 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrin's stepdaughter, Los Angeles lawyer Lisa Cannon, said the ex-astronaut 
is much in demand on the speaking circuit, where he commands $20,000 and up for 
each engagement, though he often speaks for free at charity functions. 
</P>
<P>
 As the July 20 silver anniversary of the first moon landing approaches, Aldrin 
"is probably busier than he has ever been," said Matt Bialer, the former 
astronaut's booking agent at William Morris Agency in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being interviewed later this month on CNN's "Larry King Live" talk show 
and was recently the voice of a TV cartoon character in an episode of "The 
Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has his name on a computer game, "Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space," 
which Omni Magazine recently described as "an engrossing experience for anyone 
who has sat glued to the TV watching rockets lift off from Kennedy Space 
Center." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Aldrin can make time to discuss his favorite subject. During a brief 
phone interview Friday -- with three other phones ringing in the background -- 
the former astronaut, who had just returned from Europe and was waiting for a 
limousine to whisk him off to an evening appointment -- wanted to talk rocket 
science. 
</P>
<P>
 On his mind were adding a second-stage booster to the space shuttle, 
developing a new rocket that could facilitate going to the moon and 
establishing a permanent shuttle between Earth and Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks with passion about those subjects at an age, 64, when many of his 
contemporaries are contemplating retirement. Aldrin, however, has no intention 
of slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to live in the past," he said. "I want to live as a contributing 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 His many commercial ventures, he said, are a way of paying the bills so he can 
focus on his true mission: spreading the gospel of space travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "My name becomes associated with credible products, and in varying degrees 
they help my livelihood," he said. "The work that I do on the space program is 
uncompensated directly." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges that when he speaks in public, most audiences would rather 
hear about his moon-walking experience than about strap-on reusable rockets. 
"There aren't that many people really interested in this detailed stuff," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrin, who has a Ph.D. in orbital mechanics from the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, is finding an outlet for some of his scientific ideas by 
co-authoring a science fiction novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not by nature a writer," said Pittsburgh novelist John Barnes, the 
collaborator. "Between being a natural athlete and the busiest person I've ever 
seen in my life, he had no time to sit in a chair." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is based in part on Aldrin theories that a spaceship could travel a 
permanent route between Earth and Mars powered by the whipsawing gravitational 
pull of both planets. The spacecraft, which would be like a link in a cosmic 
bicycle chain, would be intercepted by shuttles from both Earth and Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of that aside, Aldrin remains a moon man at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's regrettable that Apollo went to the moon and then stopped," he said. "It 
gives us a lesson that says we should think twice before starting something 
that will only have a temporary lifetime."ALDRIN, EDWIN E JR (

STRENGTH IN NUMBERS; 11 FIRMS JOIN TO GET CUTS IN HEALTH INSURANCE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With federal health care reform on shaky ground, U.S. employers are taking a 
harder look at self-help strategies for driving medical costs to rock bottom. 
They might look to California, where a group of major corporations have 
demonstrated how to squeeze costs by pooling their purchasing power -- without 
help from government. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Bay Area Business Group on Health accomplished what was nearly 
unthinkable a year ago: It won big rate reductions from health insurers vying 
for the business of 11 big employers and their 300,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 By enticing health plans with about $400 million in potential premiums, the 
group -- including such influential employers as Bank of America, Pacific 
Telesis and Safeway -- got 17 health maintenance organizations to roll back 
rates from 5% to 10%. In contrast, health insurance costs statewide increased 
6% to 8% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate reductions will slash millions from the employers' health care bills 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care executives say the rate rollbacks -- accomplished through 
competitive bidding -- will serve as leverage for other California employers 
when they sit down with insurers to negotiate next year's contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is bellwether change," said Albert Green, chief executive of Alta Bates 
Medical Center in Berkeley. "Other purchasers of health care -- employers, the 
union trust funds and CalPERS (the California Public Employees Retirement 
System) -- are going to say, 'Wait a minute, if this coalition got this type of 
rate decrease, we want the same thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Gelbert, a former chief executive of a Northern California health plan who 
headed the negotiations for the Bay Area Business Group, added, "I think we 
started a process that won't stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, in fact, didn't start the premium deflation process; it just gave 
it a big shove forward. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS, which negotiates health care coverage for 920,000 public employees, 
won a 1.1% decrease in premiums this year. And the Health Insurance Plan of 
California, the state-run purchasing alliance for small businesses, recently 
won a 6% average drop in premiums for its 45,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Big and small businesses across the country have formed insurance-purchasing 
coalitions, and in California efforts are also under way among employers in 
Orange County and Silicon Valley. But members of the Bay Area Business Group -- 
whose employees are equally split between Northern and Southern California -- 
is believed to be the largest effort by private employers in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an example of how a group of large employers that are already 
knowledgeable about managing their health costs can get together and do it even 
better," said Sean Sullivan, president of the National Business Coalition on 
Health, a Washington-based group representing 85 employer groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance purchasing cooperatives that pool their power to drive down health 
care costs are at the heart of the "managed competition" concept that underpins 
President Clinton's health care reform plan. Congress seems likely to reject 
Clinton's approach -- calling for state-organized regional health care 
purchasing alliances -- but experts say the California effort shows how private 
business can accomplish similar objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits managers say the premium cuts reflect the shake-up in health care 
over the past year. Industry consolidation in California, where insurers and 
hospitals are merging frantically, has emboldened employers to take a tougher 
stance with health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employers can exercise a lot more influence now, much more than they did when 
the market was more fragmented," Gelbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bay Area group, which has worked closely with HMOs and hospitals, says it 
has told health care providers they must do more to slash costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're saying there is a lot of room for efficiencies," said Patricia 
E. Powers, executive director of the San Francisco-based business group. 
Employers can see that hospitals around the state are half empty and that 
health plans are madly scrambling for market share. 
</P>
<P>
 As employers pressures HMOs to reduce costs, hospitals, doctors and other 
health care providers worry that health plans will try to pass the buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The HMOs are already coming back to us and saying we want you to cut your 
rates," said Jack Fries, chief executive of St. Luke's Hospital in San 
Francisco. "They're saying, 'We're getting less, so you have to take less.' We 
say, 'You guys are getting 30% of the health care dollar, and that's 
outrageous. You need to absorb (the rate cuts).' " 
</P>
<P>
 Alain C. Enthoven, a health economist at Stanford University and the main 
theorist of managed competition, said the unique nature of California's medical 
marketplace is a big reason for the success of the state's purchasing 
alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 California has "the best-developed managed care system, more doctors in group 
practice and more doctors in HMOs than any state," he said. "This illustrates 
that the only forces known to man that can reduce costs are market forces. 
Government controls simply do not reduce costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised by the unexpectedly aggressive bids by the HMOs, the Bay Area 
Business Group also took steps to prevent insurers from trying to recover 
revenue by seeking big increases in subsequent years. The group negotiated caps 
on potential premium increases for 1996 and 1997. Powers wouldn't provide 
specifics on those caps, except to say they will be closely tied to consumer 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the HMOs -- including such firms as Aetna, Kaiser 
Permanente, Health Net and Pacificare -- wasn't aimed only at slashing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17 health plans also agreed to bid on a standard benefits package and to 
meet an extensive list of performance standards covering such areas as quality 
of care, preventive services and customer satisfaction. In the quality area, 
for example, the benefits package includes mammograms for women every one to 
two years after age 50 and yearly clinical breast exams after age 40. 
</P>
<P>
 The employers also put some teeth in those guidelines: If an HMOs fails to 
meet the minimum performance standards, it is required to return 2% of its 
premium dollars to the firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unsung benefit in all this is we have a common rate and a common 
benefit," said Arlene K. Singer, a vice president for Wells Fargo Bank. "You 
looked at the 11 different companies and there were 11 different rates out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 That price disparity among the HMOs was one of the key reasons the employers 
-- a diverse group of organizations, with very different work forces, corporate 
cultures and employee benefits strategies -- opted for joint negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis, which spends more than $170 million a year to buy medical 
insurance for its employees, is an example. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommunications giant had long assumed that its sheer size gave it lots 
of bargaining clout with health insurers, said Marianne P. De Luca, director of 
benefit planning for Pacific Telesis. It found out how wrong it was after 
learning the results of a private survey of health care benefits funded by the 
Bay Area Business Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The study showed "that we, with 212,000 workers, weren't getting any bigger 
discounts than employers that were delivering 5,000 members" to the health 
plans, De Luca said. "And companies with similar health plans and similar 
health risks had lower premiums than us." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that these 11 employers have locked in their rate cuts, they must decide 
whether to pass on the savings to their workers. Most say they will pass on at 
least some of the savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said the group will consider next year whether to add members. The 
nonprofit group now includes 19 employers, only 11 of which participated in the 
group negotiations with the HMOs. The group may also consider a similar joint 
purchasing effort for another type of insurance known as "preferred provider 
organizations," another form of managed care that typically allows greater 
choice of doctors.

<P>
 Some may find the story hard to swallow, but vitamins are being given at least 
some of the credit for a hit film. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech last week to Los Angeles advertising executives, Perry Katz, 
Universal Pictures' marketing chief, listed some of the reasons the studio's 
summer film "The Flintstones" turned out to be such a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious reason was that the Hanna-Barbera cartoon is so recognizable. 
Another reason he cited was that kids "get their daily vitamin by eating its 
main character for breakfast," referring to Fred Flintstone and the Flintstones 
vitamins that have been popular for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Katz added, that isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "If being a vitamin was all it took to make a hit, then you'd be seeing 
'Chewable Gelcaps: The Movie' in theaters everywhere," he said. Talking It Up 
</P>
<P>
 The O.J. Simpson murder case has led to some unexpected business plugs. 
</P>
<P>
 This past Thursday, KABC Channel 7 featured on its 11 p.m. news a segment 
describing how the Simpson case -- in which the former football star is accused 
of killing his ex-wife and one of her friends -- is the hot topic at the new 
Los Angeles talk radio station, KMPC. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter Steven Noh, in introducing the segment, said he was "here at KMPC-AM 
710, the new talk station," according to a broadcast transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 Noh ended his report by again plugging the station, telling viewers he was 
"live at KMPC-AM 710 Talk, the new talk station studios," according to the 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 Left unsaid in the broadcast: KMPC has just been bought and converted to talk 
radio format by media giant Capital Cities/ABC, which happens to also be the 
parent company of Channel 7. Collectors Run to Daylight 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Simpson memorabilia binge continues unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1991, Salvino Inc. in Corona paid Simpson for the rights to sell 1,000 
figurines personally signed by the onetime star running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Each figurine showed Simpson in a Buffalo Bills uniform standing behind the 
number 2,003, his rushing total in a record-setting 1973 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The $250 figurines weren't such hot items when Salvino sold them to dealers, 
with about 400 still gathering dust on the shelves up until the Simpson murder 
case broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Company owner Wayne Salvino said that a check of dealers now shows the 
figurines have sold out, with some dealers getting as much as $800 for them.

THE NEW FACE OF MEXICAN ELECTION COVERAGE; WITH TELEVISA'S BROADCAST MONOPOLY 
BROKEN, THE NATION'S FIRST TV RACE IS TAKING SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mexico's publishers and editors gathered last month to hear presentations 
from the nine presidential candidates, veteran news anchor Jacobo Zabludovsky 
was seated in a place of honor that befits the man who for two decades has been 
the news voice of media giant Televisa. 
</P>
<P>
 But that catbird seat became a hot seat when third-place candidate Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas rose to speak. Looking directly at Zabludovsky, he said: "Televisa has 
been one of the pillars that today hold up the authoritarian regime we suffer." 
Then he promised, "If I am elected, you will have a freedom previously denied 
you: the freedom to criticize the president." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Cardenas' attack might have been published in a few sympathetic 
newspapers with circulations in the five-figure range. This year, the cameras 
of Televisa's upstart rival, Television Azteca, were there to beam the scene 
across this country on the nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the government sold off its two networks, breaking Televisa's 
private broadcasting monopoly, competition is changing television news 
coverage, especially that of politics. The 1994 presidential race is shaping up 
to be Mexico's first television campaign, complete with this nation's first 
television candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes include the new network owners' plans to use technology from their 
new partner -- National Broadcasting Co. -- to conduct exit polls on election 
day. Polls are expected to be extremely important in the Aug. 21 presidential 
election because most Mexicans suspect the government of vote fraud and 
distrust the official tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a striking example of how the administration's free market 
economic policies -- such as privatizing government-owned companies -- are 
forcing social and political change as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Televisa has abandoned its notoriously pro-government, pro-ruling 
party stance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an ongoing study by the independent Human Rights Academy found that 
both major television news shows have provided increasingly balanced coverage 
as the campaign has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have improved their coverage of the various actors in the electoral 
process, but still do not present the various parties and presidential 
candidates in a balanced and objective manner," the academy's most recent 
report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 No figures are available for comparisons with past elections, when opposition 
candidates were largely ignored by television news. However, there is a sense 
that Televisa's main nightly newscast -- called "24 Hours" -- has been forced 
to expand its coverage of opposition candidates as Azteca has built the 
audience for its nightly news show from insignificant to about one-third the 
viewership of the veteran news broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, while Televisa executives have loosened their control over what 
their networks show, the overall influence of television has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television is the medium for winning elections, but it takes a candidate who 
has a message and knows how to transmit it," said Ricardo Salinas, chairman of 
Television Azteca. 
</P>
<P>
 The first televised presidential candidates' debate last month catapulted 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos from a distant third place to a solid second and 
even first place in some polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez surprised viewers with his sharp attacks on the government and his 
top two rivals, turning around the rather stodgy image of his National Action 
Party (PAN). He was the clear winner of the debate. His ratings in the polls 
soared and remain above 30% in many surveys, significant in a nine-candidate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the gray-bearded Fernandez frequently appears in the featured spot on the 
nightly news. About 43% of those questioned in a recent survey by MORI de 
Mexico (with a 4.5% margin of error) said they knew Fernandez appeared on a 
weekly Television Azteca interview show. Of those, nearly half said they liked 
what he said. That's quite a change from the last presidential campaign six 
years ago when PAN activists distributed bumper stickers that read: "Don't 
watch Televisa. They lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Alcala, who runs Televisa's international news operation, minimizes 
the effect of Television Azteca on his company's coverage, but acknowledges: 
"We have to be more careful with our coverage, with our images and editing. 
Competition has forced us to be more professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Televisa has also added a youth-oriented news show on a less popular networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime television observers, such as Raul Trejo, say competition, along with 
increased pressure from viewers, has had more of an impact than Alcala admits. 
Televisa has been forced to provide wider coverage that includes more 
opposition parties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every campaign -- some for candidates barely expected to eke out the 
1.5% of the vote their parties need to maintain their registration -- receives 
a few minutes of coverage each night on "24 Hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Cardenas, who complains loudest about poor TV coverage, has begun to get 
sound bites on the air, instead of just an announcer's voice summarizing his 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 The MORI survey showed that more than half of those questioned had heard the 
voices of the three leading presidential candidates on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas and Fernandez received long news spots when they drew large crowds at 
the Mexican National Autonomous University, the campus in the south of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas also says that he is not looking over his shoulder at the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have as my goal to create the best news operation in the world," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many of his shows' goals are clearly directed at Televisa's often 
ponderous style. "We try to have less announcers telling and more showing with 
images telling the story," he said. "We try to give the news at a faster pace, 
but at the same time more relaxed without so much political and intellectual 
jargon that no one understands." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas also plans a more active role for his network's coverage. Instead of 
just transmitting news, he plans to actively seek it. The exit polls using NBC 
technology would be an start. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime television observers warn not to expect drastic changes. Despite the 
privatization of the networks, the air waves are still government concessions 
and subject to control. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fierce competition in Mexican radio, for example, news and 
commentary shows still have clear limits, with government censors present 
during live broadcasts, according to many announcers. Radio personalities who 
step over the line are promptly removed, usually because authorities or station 
owners find a technical irregularity in a license or contract. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes broadcast stations different from the other nearly 1,000 government 
companies privatized over the past decade. Those companies could come to have 
important roles in changing this nation as their new owners begin making 
decisions based on different criteria than the government would have used. 
</P>
<P>
 Many such companies have already initiated layoffs and plant shutdowns, but 
the long-term effects of those changes will probably be more subtle than the 
differences that television viewers see on their screens every night as private 
television networks compete to keep their interest.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; GOLDEN SYSTEMS FINDS SUCCESS IS IN THE PRICING; 
MANUFACTURING: THE SIMI VALLEY ELECTRONICS FIRM'S CHEAPER LABOR COSTS HAVE MADE 
THE DIFFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer parts manufacturer Golden Systems Inc. has almost everything a young 
company could want: a price advantage, growing demand and cash to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, that is, except a unique product. What Golden Systems makes are 
power supplies -- the small boxes that regulate the electric current for 
personal and portable computers. The devices are relatively simple to make, so 
price -- not technical prowess -- is all that matters in Golden Systems' 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 But Golden Systems may have an advantage in that it does all of its 
manufacturing in India, where labor costs are low and where the work force 
includes many well-educated and technically skilled people. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep growing, the 3-year-old company must make its product even cheaper 
than that of competitors, who are also busy cutting their costs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy. Even giant General Electric abandoned the market, partly 
because of difficulty in getting an edge on the competition, according to Mohan 
Mankikar, president of Santa Rosa, Calif.-based Micro-Tech Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers in India are "a dime a dozen; they are galore all over the place," 
said Vasisht Malhotra, a professor of international relations at USC and a 
specialist on India. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Tandon, Golden Systems' 43-year-old president and chief executive, is of 
Indian descent. He is also the younger brother of Jugi Tandon, who built Tandon 
Corp. into a highly successful PC maker in the 1980s. Tandon gave Golden 
Systems its start in 1991 by purchasing power supplies from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Systems grew quickly, supplying larger firms. Sales increased 38% to 
$29.4 million in the fiscal year ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent sales figures have been disappointing, but the company still appears to 
have a bright future, said James Reynolds, an analyst with Los Angeles-based 
Wedbush Morgan Securities, lead underwriter of Golden Systems public stock sale 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
 But others aren't so sure. "If Golden Systems can do it, 50 other companies 
can do the same thing," Mankikar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Golden System's use of cheap Indian labor is critical to its ability 
to keep costs a notch below those of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Indian engineers hired by Golden Systems earn about $150 a month, while 
Golden Systems' high-school-educated manual laborers earn about 40 cents an 
hour, said Jay Thomas, Golden Systems senior vice president and chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Reynolds, manual laborers in Taiwan, where many of Golden 
Systems' rivals are based, can earn several times as much. 
</P>
<P>
 India's desperate unemployment can lead to exploitation of workers by foreign 
manufacturers. But Mankikar, who has visited the Golden Systems plant in 
Bombay, said many of the Indians who work there are firmly ensconced in the 
ranks of a privileged middle class. Their salaries, large by the country's 
standards, help feed a growing appetite for consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 But production in India alone won't guarantee Golden Systems' success. The 
company's price advantage may amount to only a few dollars on a $25 power 
supply, Thomas said. When service agreements and other factors are taken into 
account, Golden Systems' margin narrows further, Mankikar added. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep besting its competition, Golden Systems must increase its production, 
Thomas said. The company is scrambling to open two new plants, one in Madras 
and the other in Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
 The company produced 275,000 power supplies in its fiscal third-quarter 1994, 
and hopes to produce 950,000 units in the last quarter of 1995, said Ian 
Gilson, an industry analyst.

MONEY CHASE KEEPS EXPERTS CIRCLING GLOBE; INVESTMENTS: SURGING POPULARITY IN 
INTERNATIONAL MUTUAL FUNDS HAS CREATED GLOBETROTTING SPECIALISTS WHO RARELY SEE 
HOME.

 Got a yearning to see the world? Then become a diplomat, a sea captain -- or 
the portfolio manager of an "emerging markets" mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Michael Hoffman, who at age 31 runs the new Robertson Stephens 
Emerging Markets Fund from its headquarters in San Francisco or, more often, 
from a seat on an airplane bound for South America, Asia, Eastern Europe or 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes him a member of a small but growing breed of globetrotting 
investment specialists, products of the surging popularity of international 
mutual funds, who are fast dispelling the image of money management as a 9-to-5 
desk job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say about a week a month is when I expect to see my office," Hoffman said 
on a recent visit to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Many international investment managers spend a lot of time checking out 
companies and economic conditions in foreign financial capitals such as Tokyo, 
London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 But an emerging markets specialist like Hoffman usually skips those staid 
locations in favor of places like Thailand, Turkey, Poland and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of several trips to South America in recent months, Hoffman picked up a 
parasite that has been "rather difficult to get rid of," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also acknowledges that his profession probably is best suited to a young 
person without a spouse and children. "I don't think I would succeed at this 
point in having a family," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoffman also extols the benefits of such a life, which he first discovered 
while at the University of South Carolina getting a graduate degree in 
international business, and later as emerging markets portfolio manager at 
Cigna International Investment Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I got a taste for the international travel, I haven't looked back 
since," he says. "You encounter many different cultures, different customs, 
different standards. I personally find it all fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of international investing is simply to expand your horizons beyond 
opportunities in the United States, which some view as a mature economy after 
several centuries of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging markets, which offer some of the wildest and wooliest places anywhere 
to put your money, attract investors looking for the fastest growth rates of 
all -- perhaps double the pace in the developed world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the risks can run high as well, operating in environments where the 
political climate may be unstable, the accounting standards highly variable, 
and the formal markets rudimentary at best. 
</P>
<P>
 After climbing 60%, 70% or more in some cases last year, emerging markets 
funds on average have suffered a 10% setback so far in 1994. Hoffman's fund is 
too new to have a record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I very strongly believe in the long-term potential of these markets," says 
Hoffman. "But you have to be broadly diversified across countries. Emerging 
markets are extremely volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with this increasing sophistication, Hoffman's fund, unlike its typical 
competitor, uses a strategy known as short-selling, which is based on an 
assumption that a stock will fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, if he believes a market or company is overpriced, he tries to profit by 
borrowing and selling shares of the local stock in question, or perhaps those 
of a publicly traded country fund. He hopes to repurchase the shares at a lower 
price, following the dictum "buy low and sell high" in reverse order. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman also aims to keep a part of the fund's assets in pre-emerging markets, 
where capitalism itself may be just creeping into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the technology and communications advances of just the past few years, 
a portfolio manager making frequent 12, 15 or 20-hour flights around the world 
would have trouble keeping in touch with home base and the markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoffman says portable computers, high-tech market information services, 
fax machines and similar gear keep him connected.

 GM and Chrysler Announce Recalls: The auto makers' actions involve more than 
40,000 pickups and front-drive minivans from the 1991 to 1994 model 
years.Chrysler is asking owners of about 35,000 of its older style "D-body" 
Dodge Ram trucks powered by Cummins diesel engines to have the fuel injection 
pump inspected and possibly replaced. Some of the pumps could allow 
higher-than-normal fuel flow, the auto maker said. GM is asking owners of about 
5,600 1993 and 1994 model minivans equipped with both the power sliding door 
and built-in child seat to take the vehicles to dealers to have the shoulder 
belt rerouted.

 California Gets a New Plant: Broken Hill Proprietary Co. of Australia said it 
will build a $60-million plant in Rancho Cucamonga to coat sheet steel with 
Zincalume, a zinc and aluminum product that resists rust.The plant will have a 
capacity of 550,000 tons a year and will be the only such installation in the 
western United States. The company, which says it is the world leader in 
production of the coating, contends it is more durable than conventional 
galvanized steel, which is coated with zinc alone. Broken Hill did not say when 
the plant would be built or how many jobs it would generate.

 10 Honda Employees Admit to Bribery: A former sales executive with American 
Honda Motor Co., a unit of Honda Motor Co., pleaded guilty in U.S. District 
Court in Concord, N.H., to participating in a nationwide bribery conspiracy. 
U.S. Atty. Paul Gagnon said 10 defendants have admitted to a scheme in which 
Honda executives and employees demanded bribes and kickbacks from dealers in 
exchange for franchises and allocations of hot-selling models, particularly the 
Acura. Frank Pisano of Elgin, Ill., admitted he accepted cash, gifts and a 
hidden ownership in a Honda dealership in Caldwell, N.J., while he was employed 
by American Honda as a zone manager in Denver from 1987 to 1991.

 Current Account Deficit Falls Sharply: The figure fell to $80 million in May 
from $250 million in April, the Bank of Korea said.The reduction came as the 
country's trade account showed a surplus of $50 million in May, after deficits 
during the four previous months, the central bank said. The cumulative current 
account deficit during the first five months of this year amounted to $2.68 
billion, nearly five times that of the same period last year. Bank officials 
said the current account deficit for this year is expected to fall below the 
original projection of $2.5 billion because exports are expected to continue to 
gain throughout the year.

 China has ordered foreign-financed joint ventures to set up official trade 
unions by the end of the year, blaming a lack of organizations for a spate of 
deadly workplace accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Dinghua, vice chairman of the state-controlled All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions, said 12% of foreign-financed joint ventures had unions, the 
official Xinhua news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang also pledged a major drive to put official unions into the 95% of 
Chinese township enterprises that still have no worker organizations, a move 
that will affect tens of millions of workers. Zhang said official unions would 
protect workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some small manufacturers neglect safety in production, and some overseas 
investors force workers into unreasonable overwork and then underpay them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 8,100 trade unions now represent 1.32 million workers at 
overseas-financed ventures in China, Zhang said.

THE PACIFIC; WITH HIGH HOPES, SOUTH KOREANS STEP UP PLANS FOR TRADE WITH THE 
NORTH; ASIA: GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS LEADERS WANT JULY 25-27 SUMMIT TO DEFUSE 
MILITARY CRISIS, IMPROVE COMMERCIAL TIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While there's no such thing as a sure bet when it comes to dealings with 
Pyongyang, the apparent breakthrough in the military crisis on the Korean 
peninsula has companies south of the demilitarized zone thinking, however 
tentatively, about the pool of cheap labor on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the South Korean government and businesses are now stepping up plans 
for economic exchanges with North Korea. Their hope is that the historic summit 
July 25-27 between the North's President Kim Il Sung and South Korean President 
Kim Young Sam will defuse the military confrontation on the peninsula and 
improve trade ties. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be a very tall order, given the fact that Pyongyang has enough 
firepower trained on Seoul to turn the South Korean capital into rubble. Still, 
Seoul is dangling some big incentives to persuade Kim to play ball with United 
Nations inspectors, who want to make sure North Korea isn't developing nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seoul government said late last week that it will increase its South-North 
(Korean) Cooperation Fund, designed to help expand inter-Korean cooperation and 
exchanges, by $50 million to $181 million during this year and to $1.25 billion 
at some point in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, South Korean companies are also casting a covetous gaze at the 
North's low-wage work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dusting off the old business plans in the North, which have waited for 
a breakthrough in inter-Korean relations," said Kim Sang Nyun, a spokesman for 
the Hyundai conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Seoul said it will use part of its Economic Development and 
Cooperation Fund, another government-raised fund designed to help developing 
nations, for the revitalization of North Korea's economy, which has contracted 
for four consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 An official at the Economic Planning Board said efforts will be made to 
implement a historic peace treaty between the two Koreas, adopted in 1992, if 
and when the summit helps clear suspicions about the North's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is now ripe for the two economies to join hands for co-prosperity," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses in the capitalist South are also reactivating their old plans for 
business in the communist North, which were formed a few years ago when the two 
states were moving toward reconciliation, but then shelved when suspicions 
about Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions started to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Daewoo Group Chairman Kim Woo Choong and Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju Yung 
visited North Korea a few years back and agreed to build joint venture 
factories and large resort facilities there. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plans are being held up until a resolution of the nuclear issue can be 
reached. The Seoul government also bans visits by South Koreans to North Korea 
and allows only limited commercial trade through third countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if the current thaw holds, that could change. A spokesman for the Daewoo 
conglomerate said its chairman Kim will quickly visit the North again to pursue 
the delayed projects if the summit helps resolve the nuclear problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent impasse may have been busted up by the recent visit to Pyongyang by 
former President Jimmy Carter. Many South Koreans hope the summit provides 
needed momentum for inter-Korean economic relations. During the first five 
months of this year, two-way trade remained low at $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the prospects for inter-Korean economic cooperation are good. Many 
analysts see a combination of South Korea's capital and technology with North 
Korea's cheap labor as ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering from serious shortages of foods, fuel, daily necessities and hard 
currencies, the North hopes to build a huge free trade zone along the Tumen 
River bordering with Russia and China, by attracting the capital of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seoul government has promised full support to the Tumen River development 
project, sponsored by the United Nations Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
 While all of this is promising, South Korean companies had better be patient. 
Given Pyongyang's track record for following through on commitments to make its 
nuclear energy program more transparent, dreams of economic unification are 
probably just that -- dreams.

THE PACIFIC; CHINA CRITICIZES FOREIGN INVESTORS FOR HIDING PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China on Saturday sharply criticized the "capital games" of foreign investors 
who whisked their profits out of the country through accounting deceptions and 
tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome foreign businessmen's investment in China and will protect their 
lawful rights and interests," the official People's Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we will absolutely not allow foreign businessmen to seek exorbitant 
profits, to violate our country's laws, or to use all sorts of illegitimate 
means to extract (profits)." 
</P>
<P>
 The article, headlined "Capital Games and Profit Leaks," accused some foreign 
investors of using many fraudulent methods to deny China its rightful share of 
taxes and profits and to secretly spirit foreign currency abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In one survey, the newspaper said, more than half the foreign-funded ventures 
had failed to pay in their full amount of registered capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign firms had jacked up the price of the equipment they put into the 
Chinese investment or used poor-quality machinery to artificially boost the 
size of their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign ventures exaggerated their rate of dividend or the prices of the 
raw materials they used, the article said. Others padded their local expenses 
and shipped their finished goods back to the head office at below cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The article admitted that China's frenetic emphasis on foreign investment, as 
part of economic reform, had led to some abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In recent years, many places linked the number of established foreign-funded 
ventures with the achievements of local leaders, which gave rise to false 
enterprises," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper, demanding a "strict and standard" system, said laws must be 
strengthened, particularly those aimed at curbing tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 China this year reported a sharp drop in foreign investment from the record 
levels of 1993, when legions of board directors flocked to Beijing in a race to 
participate in the world's fastest-growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Official media have reported that contracted foreign investment in the first 
five months of 1994 was $32.7 billion in 20,230 projects, against $58.76 
billion in 43,632 projects in the first half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, contracted investment was $25.39 billion in 10,739 
projects, down 51.3% and 43.6% respectively from the same 1993 period. 
</P>
<P>
 In the whole of 1993, contracted foreign investment was $122.7 billion, up 
76.7% on 1992, a figure China said was the highest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists blame the drop on fewer privileges offered to joint ventures, 
stronger competition for investment dollars and tighter credit policies by 
Beijing that have cut growth, especially in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign business people have said they are wary of the dangers of 
investing in China, which is wrestling with an economy on the verge of 
overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, China said Sunday it hoped to rejuvenate its sagging Class B share 
markets by adopting unified national regulation of the shares, which Chinese 
firms sell to foreigners to raise foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
 National newspapers also said China's central bank is moving anew to seize 
control over the ill-regulated investment fund market, ordering a temporary 
halt on new funds and banning other agencies from approving funds.

 Yen's Rise Boosts Debt Burden: The Japanese yen's recent appreciation against 
global currencies has raised China's debt burden and made Japanese imports more 
expensive, the official China Daily newspaper reported. During the past month, 
China's renminbi has fallen 5.7% against the yen, tracking a 6.1% decline in 
the dollar's value against the Japanese currency."First of all, the rising yen 
is increasing the pressure on China to pay back Japan's government loans in 
yen," the China Daily quoted Shi Yonghai, president of China's International 
Trade Research Institute, as saying. Between 1979 and August, 1993, the 
Japanese government provided China with 1.7 trillion yen in loans, worth about 
$10.9 billion at previous exchange rates, the paper said. The yen's rise, 
coupled with this year's depreciation of the yuan against the dollar, has 
pushed the value of those loans up by about 55% to $17 billion, the paper said. 
"So, in addition to interest, China has to pay a further $6 billion," it said.

THE PACIFIC; CHINA DRAFTS REGULATIONS, STIFFER PENALTIES FOR FRAUD; SECURITIES:

 China is drafting laws that allow five-year jail terms for securities fraud 
and better regulation of foreign investors' shares, to boost confidence in its 
slumping stock markets, major papers reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The national regulations for B-shares, traded only by foreign investors, 
should be issued before the end of the year, the official China Daily reported 
Sunday.The laws will improve the issuing and trading of these shares, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investors say their confidence has been hit by poor disclosures by 
listed companies, especially in interim reports, and too many companies 
diversifying into fields unrelated to their main businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the official China Securities newspaper reported Saturday that a 
supplement to China's criminal law had been submitted to the parliament's 
standing committee, listing tough jail terms for stock market crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 China's two infant stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen have slumped this 
year, as Chinese people have turned to low-return investments like treasury 
bonds and bank deposits, complaining that stock markets are too risky. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shanghai composite index fell 7.4% last week to close at 458.37 points, 
down from 1,600 points last February. Shanghai B-share prices have slipped 
about 25% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal law supplement lists jail terms for a string of crimes China has 
encountered in its three-year experiment with stock markets, China Securities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed penalties include two years for spreading false rumors; three 
years for fraud in applying for a company license, lying in a prospectus or 
colluding to manipulate share prices; and five years for issuing stock without 
approval, insider trading or embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the securities industry 
watchdog, is armed with fewer than 100 staff and a set of sketchy, provisional 
securities regulations to control often chaotic trading. The drafting of a 
national securities law has been repeatedly delayed.

 Import-Export Bank to Sell Bonds Overseas: The Import & Export Bank of China 
is turning to overseas bond markets to provide the nation's infant high-tech 
industry with funds needed to crack global markets, the official China Daily 
reported. The bank, which was formally established on Friday, plans to extend 3 
billion yuan ($347 million) in low-interest loans to machinery and electronics 
exporters this year.The bank is also reviewing requests for another 10 billion 
yuan in loans, the paper said. "It is time for us to focus more on high-tech 
and value-added exports," said Tong Zhiguang, bank chairman and a former vice 
minister of foreign trade. "The birth of the bank is a natural response to that 
need." The bank will help Chinese companies win contracts in developing 
countries by providing export insurance and arranging financing for such 
projects.

 Hotels Experience Sharp Drop in Occupancy: Hoteliers suffered in May as 
Taiwan's monthlong ban on group travel to China reduced the number of tourists 
seeking rooms.For all hotels, the overall room occupancy rate fell to 82% from 
88% in April and 87% in the year-earlier period, the Hong Kong Tourist Assn. 
said. The medium-tariff hotels, which are often favored by the Taiwanese, were 
hit hardest. Their occupancy rate slipped to 81% in May from 89% in April and 
91% in May, 1993. However, occupancy in the territory's luxury hotels wasn't as 
badly affected: 80% in May compared to 86% in April and 78% in May, 1993.

HOT JOBS; BUILDING UP TO A CAREER

 Brad Shipcott, a construction supervisor for Kaufman & Broad, advises those 
interested in construction management to learn about building from the ground 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was a general contractor and I worked with him on custom homes," 
said Shipcott, 34. He learned about framing, cement work, masonry, roofing and 
general carpentry while becoming a licensed contractor. "But the hard, physical 
work started to wear on me, and I thought, 'There has to be an easier way to 
earn a living than this,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly after Shipcott began a management position, he learned that mental 
stress can be just as exhausting as physical labor. "There are days when I 
would gladly take the physical work over the mental, because there are so many 
details to keep track of. If someone doesn't do their job right, I'm the one 
who is responsible. But I enjoy my work. It's a good way to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 All the years he spent learning various parts of the building trades pay off 
on a daily basis for Shipcott. "I am responsible for the quality of the work 
and having done so much of this myself at one point makes it easier for me to 
make decisions. I can put myself in the men's shoes and I know what kind of 
pressures they are under," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the satisfaction of seeing a project through from start to 
finish, Shipcott enjoys the teamwork required to build a house. "Everyone is 
dependent on the other guy doing his job right," Shipcott said. "All the work 
is interrelated. We set goals and work hard to meet them." OCCUPATION: 
Construction Manager 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Oversee all aspects of a construction project, including 
major and minor details; coordinate with subcontractors, meet deadlines and 
ensure quality of work. Accompany building inspectors during inspections and 
report problems or delays to construction company administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Knowledge of construction trades, including roofing, 
framing, cement work and masonry. Some managers have a college background, but 
most work is learned on the job. Ability to supervise and encourage teamwork is 
important, as well as the ability to focus on both the big picture and 
important details. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of jobs is projected to increase 13.9%, to 
2,300. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary: Average is $60,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Working outdoors; overseeing projects from start to finish; daily 
contact with workers and all aspects of the construction process. 
Responsibility for large teams of workers, their safety and the quality of work 
performed by each.  
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Rise as early as 4 a.m. to be on a job site by 6 a.m. and often remain 
until 8 p.m. Long commutes are sometimes required. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Movement to administrative positions such as director of 
construction or vice president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I enjoy building quality homes for families. There's a lot of 
satisfaction in driving past a development after the people have moved in, 
knowing that you helped create a nice environment for them." -- Brad Shipcott, 
construction manager, Kaufman & Broad JANICE L. JONES

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: YOUR MONEY; WHY CLOSED-END FUNDS HAVE TAKEN A 
BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's clearance time along the closed-end fund aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 These investments, near cousins to regular mutual funds, have had a 
forgettable first half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that a large number of closed-end funds focus on 
emerging global stock markets or municipal bonds -- two popular areas that have 
been hit hard this year. The fact that many of the bond portfolios leverage or 
borrow against their holdings has made things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the slump in closed-end funds has proved painful for existing 
shareholders, it has also squeezed much of the speculation out of the market 
and created many bargains for new buyers, advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some tremendous buying opportunities," says Peter Madlem, editor of 
Frank Cappiello's Closed-End Fund Digest, a newsletter in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Closed-end funds, like regular mutual funds, are professionally managed 
portfolios that hold dozens of individual stocks or bonds, usually of a similar 
type. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the price of a mutual fund will rise or fall in direct relation to 
the value of its holdings, the price of a closed-end portfolio can fluctuate 
above or below that amount -- to where the fund is said to be trading at a 
premium or discount. This feature adds another element of risk for investors, 
because premiums can vanish and discounts can widen. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, many closed-end funds were downright expensive at the start of 
the year. Since then, they have gotten cheaper, mostly because their portfolio 
holdings have depreciated. Some funds have also seen their premiums contract or 
their discounts widen -- a second way to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially hard hit have been certain foreign closed-end funds that invest in 
the companies of developing nations. The price of the Turkish Investment Fund 
plunged 53% during the first six months of this year, on the heels of a 169% 
surge in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Latin American and Asian funds have lost 25% or more in 1994 after 
strong showings last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pacific Rim nations, excluding Japan, have been slaughtered," says Colin 
Mathews, a closed-end fund analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami investment adviser who specializes in the 
closed-end area, observes that many of the funds that have fallen the most this 
year were the ones that traded at the highest premiums in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now many of these funds are trading at reasonable valuations again," Herzfeld 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these purchases include portfolios that own shares in German, Spanish, 
Mexican, Thai and Philippine stocks. Madlem says his newsletter also likes 
certain funds that invest in Germany, Spain and Mexico, along with funds in 
Korea, Pakistan and India. 
</P>
<P>
 Since many foreign closed-end products focus on the stocks of a single nation, 
it's good to diversify among at least a few funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Closed-end bond funds have been falling this year for somewhat different 
reasons. They got pinched by higher interest rates -- which erode the value of 
all bond investments -- and by their widespread use of leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the vast majority of regular mutual funds, a significant number of the 
tax-free closed-end funds utilize borrowed money as a way to boost returns. The 
strategy works well during periods of flat or falling interest rates, but it 
has boomeranged so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most closed-end muni funds leverage their holdings -- to a maximum of $1 in 
borrowed money for every $3 in assets, Mathews says. Some muni funds are off 
more than 10% this year, excluding dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Some muni funds are selling at discounts near 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10% discount on a closed-end fund essentially allows investors to buy a 
dollar's worth of stocks or bonds for 90 cents. The rub is that the same 
portfolio could drop to perhaps a 15% discount next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Madlem and Herzfeld, who publishes his own closed-end investment 
newsletter, see bargains in the muni area these days. 
</P>
<P>
 And both say there are attractive buys among "term trusts" -- special 
government bond funds that liquidate in a predetermined year, typically in the 
late 1990s or early 2000s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reuss, chief economist for brokerage Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, 
predicts municipal closed-end funds will rebound, because he believes interest 
rates will stabilize and because he expects demand for tax-free bonds to grow 
as supplies decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Most closed-end muni funds have dropped in value this year, which has helped 
boost their leveraged, tax-free yields. For example, California muni funds are 
paying 6.75% yields on average, says Madlem, with some selling at discounts in 
excess of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to regular mutual funds, closed-end funds on the whole are more 
complex and risky. They're also less convenient -- each trade must be made 
through a stockbroker (with a resulting commission cost), and small subsequent 
investments aren't cost-efficient. Mathews says interested beginners should 
consider using some closed-end products to round out their portfolios of 
regular mutual funds, rather than the other way around.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY KRISTOF: YOUR MONEY; NEW LAW WILL HELP ADOPTIVE 
PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of parents who have had difficulty securing health coverage for 
their adopted children are expected to benefit from a little-noticed law passed 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the law, which was passed as part of the 1993 tax act, was to put 
adopted children on an even plane with kids who were born into the family. In 
effect, the law says that if your health plan provides coverage for 
"biological" children, it must provide substantially identical coverage for 
adopted children too. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the coverage must start from the moment the parents assume 
"total or partial" financial obligation for the child -- rather than when the 
adoption is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 That's pivotal because many adoptions take months -- even years -- before they 
are complete. In the past, insurers were able to deny coverage during the 
placement period and, if a medical condition cropped up before the adoption was 
final, they could bar reimbursements related to that condition indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that many states, including California, already have 
insurance laws that bar discrimination against adopted children. However, state 
insurance laws generally do not apply to companies that self-insure and are 
regulated by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), says 
Steve Humerickhouse, legislative affairs director with Adoptive Families of 
America Inc., a Minneapolis-based support group. And some experts estimate that 
these companies employ 40% of the nation's workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, some parents say the impact of the law has been dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Jim and Patty McLaughlin, Midwestern parents of two adopted children. 
When the McLaughlins adopted Nathan in 1991, they battled for 11 months to 
secure his insurance coverage. (Their state has a law barring adoption 
discrimination, but their group plan was covered by ERISA.) But when Bethany 
was adopted four months ago -- after the federal law was passed -- the insurer 
covered her without a peep. That was a huge relief, Jim says, because Bethany 
was hospitalized for a heart condition before the adoption was final. 
</P>
<P>
 However, others note that their insurers had to be notified about the new law 
before they would agree to coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Alestalo, a Syracuse, N.Y., adoptive parent, for example, says she sent 
a copy of the law to her insurer when she realized the company planned to deny 
coverage for her son's heart condition. Kristofer was born with a small hole in 
a heart muscle, she notes. If he were her biological child, coverage would be 
automatic. But the insurer previously imposed an 11-month waiting period for 
coverage of adopted children's pre-existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still many insurance companies that haven't figured the law out 
yet," Humerickhouse says. Adoptive Families of America suggests parents get 
copies of the law to send to recalcitrant insurers. Usually, after the insurer 
receives the information, the adopted child's medical expenses are reimbursed, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are exceptions. Despite the law, some insurers can and do deny 
coverage to adopted kids. They are legally able to do this because of 
exceptions to the law and because of technical provisions in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the law, which revised the ERISA of 1974, has some exceptions: 
Specifically, it does not cover plans offered by federal, state or local 
governments, including military plans. It also exempts churches and 
church-related organizations that are not covered by ERISA. And, if you buy 
private insurance -- in other words, your coverage is not provided through an 
employer -- your health plan may also be exempted. (Some of these plans are 
covered by state laws, however.) 
</P>
<P>
 The new ERISA revisions also allow insurers to legally exclude coverage for 
some kids. How so? The law says an insurer can't discriminate against adopted 
kids by covering an ailment for the family's newborn but not for its adopted 
child. But if the insurer excludes coverage for newborns and adopted children, 
there's no discrimination. And that's legal. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the insurer can say it will not cover children who are 
HIV-infected as long as the rule applies to "birth" kids as well as adopted 
kids, says Humerickhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, some insurers say all kids are covered as long as they are IRS 
dependents. That test isn't necessarily discriminatory, but it primarily 
excludes adoptees. That's because employed parents are generally assumed to be 
the primary source of support for their newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 But adopted children, particularly those with special needs, may not qualify. 
That's because the parents are frequently provided with some government subsidy 
to offset the cost of the adoption, or the cost of counseling or of special 
schooling for kids with emotional problems or drug addictions, for example. The 
subsidy amount is compared to the "imputed value" of parental support -- a 
complicated formula that takes into account the amount you earn, the amount you 
spend and the number of children you have. If the subsidy appears to be greater 
than the value of parental support, the child is not an IRS dependent and is 
consequently not covered under these insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more children you have, the harder it is to prove dependency," says 
Connie Farquhar, a Maryland mother of 10. Partly because Farquhar is a nurse by 
training, the Farquhars make a point of adopting medically needy children. Six 
of their children are considered IRS dependents, she says. But four are not.

HONORING THOSE 'AMAZING COLOSSAL' FILMS; AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL KNEW HOW TO 
PLEASE THE CROWDS AT THE DRIVE-INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anybody who thinks all movies should be deep-think masterpieces by visionary 
auteurs probably won't be camping out at the Nuart Theatre for its ongoing 
American International Pictures festival. Max von Sydow won't be playing chess 
with Death there. 
</P>
<P>
 But other games -- less taxing perhaps -- are being played. Beach blanket 
bingo, for example. And Death is certainly not being overlooked. In "The 
Amazing Colossal Man," a dyspeptic bald guy with a major attitude problem -- 
he's having a no hair day -- skewers a pint-sized medic with a syringe. In the 
trailer for "The Amazing Colossal Beast" -- colossal was always big at AIP -- a 
rubberized, vegetabilized serpentoid thingie shorts out on a string of 
high-tension wires. 
</P>
<P>
 Death, in fact, will be a staple on the Nuart's screen, often accompanied by 
the high-pitched yowls of nubile dainties or the aarghs of manly men. So will 
incredible two-headed transplants, saucer men, psycho beatniks, vampires and, 
most terrible of all, tripped-out hippies! 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuart's AIP series, which opened Sunday with a lineup of beach party and 
Edgar Allan Poe films, extends through Saturday with 26 more titles and then, 
beginning July 15, with double-feature Friday late shows through Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 AIP was started by Samuel Z. Arkoff and the late James Nicholson in 1954. The 
company went on to produce, co-finance or distribute more than 500 movies, 
right up to its last one, Brian DePalma's 1980 thriller "Dressed to Kill." 
Nicholson, who, in the early years came up with many of the company's classic 
titles, such as "I Was a Teenage Werewolf," left the company in 1972 to become 
an independent producer and died the same year; Arkoff remained until near the 
end, when a merger with Filmways accelerated the company down the unadvisable 
path to major studio statehood and prompted his resignation. AIP -- as a 
Filmways subsidiary -- became a steroid-pumped David with a Goliath-sized 
headache and almost two years later was gulped down by Orion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Arkoff's reign was one of the longest and, one of the most 
comparatively profitable in the annals of American film production. His No. 1 
commandment, as reported in his 1991 autobiography "Flying Through Hollywood on 
the Seat of my Pants," sums it all up for him: "Thou shalt not put too much 
money into any one picture." (Arkoff, most likely preceded by one of his 
jumbo-sized cigars, will appear in person at the Nuart with surprise AIP alumni 
on Friday, Saturday and July 27.) 
</P>
<P>
 Arkoff and Nicholson recognized an opening in the post-war movie scene when 
the major studios were forced by a 1948 Supreme Court antitrust decision to 
divest themselves of the theaters they owned. This opened the way for 
independent companies to supply pictures for the bottom half of double bills. 
At the same time, television increasingly was keeping audiences at home. 
Working-class moviegoers who might ordinarily have flocked to the B-movie 
programmers were moving into the middle class -- and middle age. Arkoff and 
Nicholson realized that their movies could zero in on the youth audience that 
the major studios had either ignored or pooh-poohed. Beginning with movies 
costing $50,000 to $150,000, AIP was soon turning out about 20 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty soon it was offering up its own combinations both at the hard tops and 
the passion pits. An entire generation fogged the windows of their parents' 
cars at drive-ins that were playing pictures like "The Brain Eaters" and 
"Dragstrip Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 AIP wasn't the only company targeting youth, but it was the best at what it 
did because Arkoff and Nicholson kept pace with the kids. Their youth movies 
virtually eliminated adults from the landscape and, with them, the fuddy-duddy 
moralizing that clammed up the youth pix of their competitors. And yet, despite 
what the bluenoses claimed, AIP pictures were, beneath all the lurid ballyhoo, 
essentially wholesome . That was another one of Arkoff and Nicholson's trade 
secrets: Their movies coaxed the rebellions of kids and then made them comfy. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkoff and Nicholson pretested movie titles and ad campaigns before making 
their early films. It's the kind of business practice that nowadays has helped 
hammerlock Hollywood into a take-no-chances mediocrity, but for the perpetually 
undercapitalized AIP, it was a sink-or-swim tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the decades rolled, AIP moved lickety-split in and out of fast-buck genres: 
Rock 'n' roll pictures gave way or merged with youth-in-trouble pictures, which 
then swerved without missing a beat from teen revolt to the more bubble-headed 
beach party bashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Poe adaptations, almost always starring a hyperfervid Vincent Price 
("Garrote them!) and nearly all directed by Roger Corman (practically AIP's 
house director), featured plenty of piped-in mist. They were giggly-scary 
affairs -- head-trip movies for the preteens and teens who, five or six years 
later, would be lurching into the counterculture and primed for AIP 
hippie-dippie rebellion movies such as "The Trip" and "Psych-Out" and "The Wild 
Angels" and "Wild in the Streets," a fantasia where everyone over 35 is shipped 
to internment camps and pickled with LSD. 
</P>
<P>
 AIP was able to jump quickly in and out of these genres because, unlike the 
major studios, its filmmakers could move right into production before the 
Zeitgeist trail grew cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Something else worked in AIP's favor as the '60s moved into the '70s -- 
something that Arkoff and Nicholson probably couldn't have anticipated: The 
generation that grew up with AIP movies now wanted to make movies. Unlike the 
'50s film generation in France that became the New Wave, the '60s Hollywood 
film generation embraced the pop commercial mainstream with a vengeance. And 
because the studios were generally closed to newcomers, a company like AIP was 
able to siphon an extraordinary talent pool of young filmmakers thirsting to be 
exploited in exchange for a shot at directing, writing, acting in a real movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking through the credits of '60s AIP movies is like doing an archeological 
dig for the origins of what Hollywood became a decade later. Francis Coppola 
directed "Dementia 13." Robert Towne wrote "Tomb of Ligeia." Martin Scorsese 
directed "Boxcar Bertha." In "What's Up, Tiger Lily?," Woody Allen took a 
Japanese spy movie and dubbed the dialogue so that the film turned into a 
thriller about the search for the perfect egg-salad recipe. Jack Nicholson 
starred in "Psych-Out," which was directed by Richard Rush. Nicholson appeared 
in other AIP movies as well, and he wrote "The Trip." Dennis Hopper and Bruce 
Dern cropped up. Richard Pryor made his first film appearance in "Wild in the 
Streets." A very young Robert De Niro was in "Bloody Mama." An even younger 
Richard Dreyfuss was the maniacally motormouthed Baby Face Nelson in John 
Milius' "Dillinger." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of AIP in its heyday was the success that comes from knowing your 
limitations. Even the frills in AIP movies were of the no-frills variety. The 
spirited, corny, wacky hucksterism of the pictures didn't have much to do with 
the art of film, but it did have a lot to do with why we're first attracted to 
movies as kids. Why bother with the lumbering big-top circus attractions when 
you can check out the carnival sideshow with the two-headed snake and the 
bearded lady? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, AIP, despite its huckster rep, was essentially all-of-a-piece with 
the major studios that looked down on it -- the piece was just smaller. When 
AIP made a horror or youth picture, it was "exploitation." But when the major 
studios added on the bucks to their own exploitation fare, the flicks suddenly 
became inexplicably classy. Even today, there's nothing much separating a wan 
film like "Wolf" -- starring that AIP vet Jack Nicholson -- from "I Was a 
Teenage Werewolf." Except moola. 
</P>
<P>
 AIP was a triumph of showmanship and shamelessness. The rooming house that 
Arkoff and Nicholson built may have been single-room occupancy, but, compared 
to the mansions of Hollywood's major studios, the graffiti on its walls was a 
whole lot grabbier.

 Fred Hersch doesn't have a lot of time for self-pity these days. With no less 
than seven albums on the market that include his participation as piano 
soloist, producer or composer, his 20-year career in the jazz business has 
suddenly begun to take off. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the increased attention is, in some measure at least, related to 
his announcement last year that he is HIV-positive and gay -- one of the first 
such public revelations by a well-known jazz performer. Perhaps more than any 
other area of the entertainment world, jazz has avoided addressing the issues 
of sexual orientation and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Hersch, 38, a Grammy-nominated performer (for his album "Dancing in 
the Dark" on Chesky Records), the disclosure might well be a double-edged 
sword, enhancing his visibility while potentially risking his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few of the gay jazz musicians I know are out of the closet," he says. 
"Gary Burton, I kind of pushed out of the closet, and now he's come out, 
publicly, on National Public Radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, a vibraphonist, responds: "Fred was one of the first persons I called 
when I decided to come out. I didn't actually know him at the time, but he was 
the only other jazz musician I knew of who had announced he was gay." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a longer list than you might think," says Hersch, "and nine out of 10 
are still in the closet. So I decided it was time for somebody to break the 
mold a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Hersch, who has been AIDS asymptomatic since 1986, has underscored his 
determination to "break the mold" by producing an all-star jazz album, "Last 
Night When We Were Young: The Ballad Album," as an AIDS fund-raiser for 
Classical Action: Performing Arts Against AIDS. It includes 13 ballad 
renderings by a lineup of performers both gay and heterosexual that ranges from 
Burton, Hersch, alto saxophonist Bobby Watson, harmonica player Toots 
Thielemans and pianist George Shearing to singers Mark Murphy, Janis Siegel and 
Andy Bey. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many highlights are "Little Prayer," featuring the excellent, if 
little-known Texas pianist Dave Catney, now ill with full-blown AIDS and also a 
gay jazz musician who has gone public. Other superb moments in this gorgeously 
atmospheric collection include Thielemans' passionate reading of "Estate," 
Brazilian pop star Leny Andrade's "Quiet Nights (Corcovado)," Siegel's "More 
Than You Know" and Murphy's almost painfully moving interpretation of the title 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear 'Last Night When We Were Young' in this context, it really has 
a poignant quality," says Hersch. "I think Mark's reading kind of sums up the 
whole project." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The album has been out for about a month. Initial reviews have been excellent 
and sales have slowly begun to pick up momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distinction of the music and the impressive name value of the 
participants, Hersch has thus far been unsuccessful in placing the album with a 
major record company. At the moment, it can be obtained only by phone orders, 
(800) 321-AIDS. Broadway Cares, the agency that initiated the red-ribbon AIDS 
program, is administering the album sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, I had hoped to have it picked up by a major label," Hersch 
explains. "I thought for sure that I would have no problem at all placing it. A 
lot of labels said, 'We love it, it's a beautiful record, with great artists, 
and it's a great concept. But, hey, if we're going to do something like this, 
we'd rather do it in-house with our own artists.' But, of course, they're not 
doing it. And I was handing them what I already had done, for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he feel there has been undue reluctance on the part of major jazz labels 
to deal with an AIDS fund-raising recording? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say that. After all, there have been some successful AIDS 
fund-raising albums," replies Hersch. " 'Red Hot & Blue' and 'Red Hot & Dance' 
did pretty well. I think there's a country one, too. But the only one that I 
really know about in the jazz area was something on GRP Records that came and 
went quickly a year or so ago called, I think, 'We're All in This Together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 GRP spokesman Michael Bloom confirmed that the record was released in 1993 and 
contains classic tracks from Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and John Coltrane 
as well as tunes from Patti Austin, David Benoit, Dave Grusin and others. The 
company plans to release another AIDS benefit album titled "Red, Hot & Jazz" in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersch did not reach his decision to go public with his sexual orientation 
easily. The jazz world has long held onto the myth of the macho, 
self-destructive male musician, as Hersch was well aware when he moved to New 
York from his Cincinnati home in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first and most important goal at the time was that I really wanted to make 
it in jazz," he recalls. "I came to New York to play with the best people I 
could play with, and I wasn't going to let anything stop me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hersch was "so ambitious" and "so driven" that he felt compelled to suppress 
who he was, terrified of the consequences if the jazz legends he was working 
with were to discover his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I knew no other gay jazz musicians," he says, "so I led a kind 
of dual existence -- gay friends on one side, musician friends on the other, 
but never the same. And the funny thing is that the feeling of isolation I 
experienced in the jazz community wasn't really all that unfamiliar to me, 
because that's how gay people often feel throughout their childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the "Ballad Album," Hersch has a new solo release on Concord 
("Fred Hersch at Maybeck"), a trio album on Chesky ("The Fred Hersch Trio Plays 
. . . "), several compositions on two other AIDS benefit albums ("The AIDS 
Quilt Songbook" on Harmonia Mundi/Nightingale and "Memento Bittersweet" on 
BMG/Catalyst), and has produced and played on albums for Andrade and cabaret 
singer Mary Cleere Haran. 
</P>
<P>
 But he worries that his expanded visibility may be countered by a hesitation 
on the part of promoters to book him for future dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, the simple fact is that I'd like to work more," Hersch says. "I'd like 
to work as much as I possibly can. When you're facing the clock, you just sort 
of say, 'Well, what's important to me?' And making music is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know there are some people out there who are going to say, 'I'd like to 
book Fred next summer, the summer of '95, but I don't know if I want to risk a 
booking. Maybe he won't be here.' I can't control that kind of ignorance. Of 
course, it's true, I might not be here. But that could apply to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bottom line hasn't changed for Hersch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing for me is what it's always been," he explains, "to keep 
growing as a musician, to keep trying new things, to keep stretching by playing 
with people with whom I can be myself, and to keep challenging myself."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where Hersch may be different is in his desire to believe that the jazz 
community is receptive enough to embrace every lifestyle -- and in his 
willingness to come forward to support that belief at a time when his own 
future is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I wish I wasn't HIV-positive," he says. "But that's just the way it is. 
I wish there was no war and no cancer, too, but it just doesn't work out that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some people with AIDS go through amazing transformations, with 
great realizations," Hersch concludes. "It's ironic that they sometimes don't 
get it together until the last years of their lives. But as long as you get 
there, it really doesn't matter when it is. There's a line from George Eliot 
that says it all: 'It's never too late to be what you might have been.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Hersch will be at the Jazz Bakery, 3221 Hutchinson Ave., Culver City on Aug. 
5 and 6. (310) 271-9039.

A DREAM GIG: ROCK 'N' ROLL CURATOR; IT'S A HARD (ROCK) JOB, BUT JOHN ROSENFIELD 
IS HAPPY TO DIG UP MUSIC MEMORABILIA. HECK, SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DO IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some kids kept their noses in their textbooks, diligently applied themselves 
and were rewarded with professions or positions in high-tech industries. Then 
they lost those jobs in our rocky economy and possibly found themselves among 
the 3,000 applicants seeking food service jobs at the Newport Beach Hard Rock 
Cafe when it opened in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 John Rosenfield, meanwhile, spent his formative years crowding the walls of 
his room with rock 'n' roll posters, drawing Rat Fink cartoons on his friends' 
T-shirts and pondering the big questions, such as: "I wonder where Jimi 
Hendrix's Woodstock Strat is now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his hapless contemporaries, Rosenfield has a swell job, one that allows 
him to jet around the world and hobnob with the rock elite. And he gets paid to 
wonder about the whereabouts of the now-legendary guitars of Hendrix and other 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
 As curator for Hard Rock America, which owns half of the world's growing 
supply of Hard Rock Cafes, it is Rosenfield's job to find and acquire 
rock-related rarities -- from Buddy Holly's glasses to Kurt Cobain's guitar -- 
for display in the mega-popular restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't simply serendipity that landed Rosenfield, 38, his position. Between 
times spent staring longingly at the guitars on Eric Clapton album covers, he 
also studied art and design, dealt in antiques and spent time in management, 
taking the helm of some of Ralph Lauren's shops. That experience all comes in 
handy, but one suspects he's where he is -- working in blue jeans, driving a 
'56 ragtop T-Bird, and inhabiting an office so cool that you hear John Lee 
Hooker music when he puts your call on hold -- because he clearly has followed 
Big Joe Campbell's famed maxim and followed his bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love rock 'n' roll music. It's my life," Rosenfield said. "When I was a 
kid, I always went overboard with posters on the wall and everything. I had 
collected lots of signed photos and had a huge record collection, thousands of 
records, which I lost in the fire in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "And vintage guitars are a real passion for me. Like vintage cars, there's an 
authenticity to them that's so real . I could have a guitar, like a 1954 Les 
Paul, and never touch it, just look at it and go, 'God, what a piece of art.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is at the Beverly Center Hard Rock Cafe, the one that's set apart from its 
upscale neighbors by the befinned Cadillac jutting from its roof. The interior 
is scarcely less flashy, with such prizes as a 1958 Harley Elektra Glide once 
owned by Elvis Presley and a gaudy gold metal-flake guitar of Chris Isaak's. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield got his start with the Hard Rock by managing this location when it 
opened in 1982. Previously, while managing the Beverly Hills Ralph Lauren 
store, he had become friends with Hard Rock founder and owner Peter Morton. 
Visiting Morton once in the late '70s at the original London Hard Rock, which 
opened in '71, Rosenfield suggested that Morton build an L.A. location and that 
he would like to work for him if he did. 
</P>
<P>
 So Morton did, and Rosenfield did, although he soon found that being a 
restaurant manager didn't provide much satisfaction once the place was set up 
and running. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked working for Peter, but I didn't like the job that much. What I really 
wanted to do was collect the stuff full time. But back then, this was the only 
Hard Rock (in the United States) and no one knew how it was going to take off." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield wound up going back to work for Lauren until six years ago, when 
the Hard Rocks had become such an expanding proposition that they needed a 
full-time curator. The chain now has the world's largest collection of rock 
items, leading People magazine to call it "the Smithsonian of rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Newport Hard Rock, you'll see Prince's "Purple Rain" outfit and guitars 
that were formerly the possessions of stars ranging from the Cure to local surf 
guitar legend Dick Dale. There's more color in displays of the skate and surf 
boards of local celebs, and even a motorcycle gas tank from fashion kingpin 
Mossimo Giannulli. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy finding such treasures -- Rosenfield routinely works 10-hour 
days -- and his success at it just makes the job harder. Rosenfield maintains 
that the Hard Rock Cafe practically created the present market for rock 
memorabilia and certainly upped the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 When the London Hard Rock opened, rockers were glad to donate their relics to 
hang on the walls. Now, the value of their castoffs is so great that those in 
possession of them understandably want heaps of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield wouldn't disclose the budget he has to work with, saying only: 
"It's big ." But it evidently has limits. When the Fullerton-made Fender 
Stratocaster guitar played by Hendrix at Woodstock (the same instrument 
Rosenfield mused about as a kid, original list price $330) came up for auction 
a while back, he had to pass on it -- an Italian collector made a 
record-breaking bid of $325,000 for the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 He did turn up Hendrix-played Flying V and acoustic guitars, though, as well 
as one of his fringed buckskin jackets. The L.A. Hard Rock also host's Elvis' 
most photographed guitar, a black Gibson adorned with a karate sticker that 
Elvis used through his Vegas years. Rosenfield bought it at a Sotheby's auction 
for $25,000 and says it has quadrupled in value during the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some rock icons that have eluded him so far. He'd love to acquire 
the prime guitars of Duane Allman and Eddie Cochran, as well as the 
psychedelic-painted Gibson SG that Clapton played in his Cream days. (Cream 
drummer Ginger Baker's personalized bass drum heads reside in the Las Vegas 
Hard Rock.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield has his own favorites of the things he's turned up. A big Roxy 
Music fan, he spent some time tracking down the leopard jacket Bryan Ferry wore 
on an early album cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was really knocked out to get Buddy Holly's custom cowboy boots that he 
handmade himself. Leather tooling was his side interest. . . . They are 
amazingly beautiful, the most beautiful cowboy boots I've ever seen in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His work day usually starts about 8:30 a.m. "It's mostly faxing and phone 
calls, studying auction catalogues, coming up with ideas for framing and 
concepts for different displays we're going to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the Hard Rock's reputation, he often is the first person approached 
with a rare item, so he has to know his stuff. About half his callers are 
established dealers he's dealt with and trusts; others are unknown quantities. 
During a telephone interview, he kept excusing himself to deal with a party on 
another line claiming to have one of Elvis' 1950s microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has photos of Elvis using it up close, so it might be a good piece," he 
said. "Sometimes it's hard to authenticate things like that. If some guy says, 
'Bob Dylan threw this shirt off the stage in 1966,' how can we prove that? I 
usually only buy things if there's full documentation, or if I know the person 
or if there's photographs of the person wearing the particular item. There is 
some fake memorabilia out there, but I know it pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 He often works into the night, hanging out backstage at concerts to talk to 
acts about donating items for exhibit. (Often, in return, the Hard Rock will 
make donations to the acts' favored charities.) 
</P>
<P>
 His job has grown more complicated in the last couple of years, having to 
determine not only what's rare, but what might someday be rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to stay cutting-edge. These kids come in, and a lot of them 
don't know who Jerry Lee Lewis is. They want to see Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and 
Nirvana. So that's where my head is now. I don't want this to be a mausoleum," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Universal City Hard Rock Cafe, due to open in a year, will be "very '90s, 
real thrash, grunge, skating, Generation X, Pearl Jam, Gin Blossoms, Primal 
Scream style stuff, as new as you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield tries to stay on top of trends, to determine which artists are 
going to last for a while. "A lot of bands who want to give us stuff are just 
one-hit wonders. I already have storerooms full of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to stocking the 13 Hard Rock America-owned cafes -- which are as 
far-flung as Australia and Israel -- Rosenfield has been working overtime on 
the Hard Rock hotel and casino due to open in Vegas in December. There even the 
rooms, such as a proposed Elvis suite, will sport memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as he enjoys the hunt and hustle of finding rock rarities, his real 
satisfaction comes after they're in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I'm in a city with a Hard Rock, I go in and watch people's reactions 
to things. Most people really are into it. They walk around and really study 
the stuff, get excited when they see certain pieces. Then there are others who 
will walk right by a really amazing piece and not even look at it. I wonder 
about people like that, but that's OK too."

DEATH OF A FAMILY; IT'S A SAGA OF SEXUAL ABUSE, CLASHING CULTURES, UNTOLD 
RICHES AND MULTIPLE SUICIDES. BUT EVEN AFTER THE LATEST TRIAL IS OVER, PROBABLY 
NO ONE IS EVER REALLY GOING TO KNOW WHAT WENT ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS IN THE CHO 
HOUSEHOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two-hour home video could have been a chronicle of any happy suburban 
family over a 10-year period, a house full of proud parents and growing 
children on a number of joyous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 They celebrate birthdays. They take family trips to American landmarks. In one 
culturally distinctive ceremony for this affluent Korean-American family, the 
children come forward one by one and bow to their father, touching their 
foreheads to the floor in a gesture of obeisance and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no hint of what was to ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, Kyung Mook (Edward) Cho, 54, a multimillionaire Orange County real 
estate developer, was accused of molesting four of his children. His oldest 
daughter and her boyfriend committed suicide soon afterward, another daughter 
denounced him in court as "possessed by Satan," and a year ago this month he 
was convicted of 25 counts of sexual abuse and child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho's 84-year prison sentence on Dec. 17, followed by his shocking Christmas 
Day suicide in the Orange County Jail, made headlines throughout Southern 
California. But it was in the Korean-American community -- where Cho was 
already controversial -- that the tragic saga provoked the most soul-searching 
and continues to puzzle many. 
</P>
<P>
 While the judge called Cho's behavior despicable and his children were 
devastated, Cho continued to assert his innocence in the days after his 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are confused because Mr. Cho killed himself," said Dr. Injong Hong, 
executive director of the L.A. Korean Family Counseling and Legal Advice 
Center. "Some people believe he killed himself to prove he was innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, many in the Korean-American community believe that Edward Cho was 
the victim of vindictive children who rebelled against his strict, traditional 
parenting by inventing unthinkable accusations, believed by the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Culture killed him," said Chris Nam, vice president of the Korean Assn. of 
Orange County, who emigrated from the same Korean village as his friend Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho strongly asserted the same point. In a letter to his minister -- written 
from jail and later published in two Korean-language newspapers -- Cho 
contended that "Orange County's all-white jurors' biases and their inability to 
understand other cultures brought about" his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 During a custody case and a criminal trial, and in documents filed for a civil 
lawsuit over Cho's estate, Cho's children argued that his behavior grew from 
his feudal notion that they were his property. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho's son claimed at the criminal trial that his father sexually abused him 
because Cho appeared to believe that "he owned me or something." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes Korean fathers exert unreasonable discipline or exercise an 
authoritarian way of rearing children, which creates tremendous emotional 
turmoil in their children," agreed Moon Ju Kim, education minister at Bethel 
Korean Church in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations that have poured out in the three court proceedings stand in 
stark contrast to the idyllic image the Cho family offered to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 After immigrating in 1971, Cho prospered in Orange County, concentrating his 
real estate business in Garden Grove and amassing holdings that at one time 
were estimated at nearly $3.5 million. He lived in a large home in Fountain 
Valley and worked his way to prominence in the Korean-American business 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before allegations of sexual abuse were made against him in 1992, 
Edward Cho was a controversial figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in the Korean community didn't like him because they thought he 
was like Scrooge," said Myong Hwan (David) Son, one of Cho's best friends. Cho 
was well-known for his reluctance to pick up a meal check, and he argued over 
bets at weekly penny-ante poker games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Cho made large donations to civic and cultural 
organizations, said Son, a frequent visitor to Cho's home. 
</P>
<P>
 All who knew Cho -- family members, business associates, attorneys and even 
his minister -- agreed that he was a strict disciplinarian, an authoritarian 
father who inflicted corporal punishment at times. He tried to exert almost 
total control over his children's lives, dictating everything from whom they 
could befriend to what colleges they would attend and what professions they 
would pursue, friends and family said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Korean household, the father is the dominant figure," said Erica Kim, 
Cho's civil attorney. "Everyone obeys everything that Dad says. Mr. Cho was an 
extreme example of that. He was extremely stingy, very shrewd, very bright, 
very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth of eight children born to poor, uneducated parents in a rural 
Korean village, Edward Cho worked his way through a church college in Seoul. 
Upon his arrival in the United States, he worked as a Seventh-Day Adventist 
minister for eight years in the Northern California community of San Lorenzo. 
After a short marriage that produced two children, Cho remarried and had two 
more children. 
</P>
<P>
 Cho had increasing success as a restaurateur and developer. But his life as a 
conventional family man was interrupted in 1983, when he moved to L.A. and sent 
to South Korea for his two daughters from a previous relationship, Young Sun 
Cho and her younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened between 1983 and 1992, in various residences in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, is documented in police reports, in testimony at Cho's 
eight-day criminal trial and in documents filed in connection with the civil 
suit brought by four of Edward Cho's children. Despite Cho's death, that suit 
will be tried against Cho's estate and his widow. 
</P>
<P>
 Further documentation comes from a juvenile custody hearing during which the 
two youngest Cho children were removed from the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after her father brought her from South Korea, Young Sun Cho told 
authorities, he began forcing her to have sex with him. She was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just comes in, and I will be laying there," she testified, "and he . . . 
will just have sex with me." 
</P>
<P>
 By acquiescing, Young Sun Cho testified, "I always thought I was protecting my 
sister . . . from him having sex with her." 
</P>
<P>
 But, the younger sister testified, Edward Cho also began to abuse her sexually 
at the age of 9 and continued for nine years. Both daughters said they were 
unaware that the other was being victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 The children testified that their father also regularly kicked and beat them 
and his wife, sometimes with a stick and a tennis racquet. He threw bowls and 
furniture at them, they said. Cho's widow acknowledged that her husband 
physically disciplined the children but denied that he was brutal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1992, Young Sun Cho, then 23, moved out. Several months later, on 
April 23, she contacted the Orange County Department of Social Services Child 
Abuse Registry, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 6, Young Sun Cho and her younger sister repeated their charges to 
Fountain Valley police. On May 11, the Department of Social Services removed 
the two younger children from the home. The younger children also testified 
later about inappropriate touching by their father. Edward Cho was arrested 
several days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after bringing the sex abuse charges, Young Sun Cho and her 
boyfriend, who had encouraged her to come forward, killed themselves in their 
Los Angeles apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt in my mind that Young Sun killed herself due to the abuse," 
Detective Kim Brown of the Fountain Valley Police Department wrote in a report. 
"In talking with her, she was very disturbed about the sexual abuse and the 
methods of fear used by their father to make her submit. The torment he caused 
fueled her decision to take her own life." 
</P>
<P>
 During the custody proceedings, Edward Cho vigorously denied the abuse 
charges. On the witness stand, he called the charges unthinkable, the 
accusations "gross, heinous things." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Cho's attorney, John Barnett, invoked the Salem witch trials, telling 
the jury at Cho's criminal trial that Cho's older daughters were 
"sophisticated, and they (were) cunning, and they knew what they wanted. And 
what they wanted was not vindication . . . what they wanted was money. . . . 
There was not any sex . . . that didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On May 5, 1993, a jury found Cho guilty of 25 counts of sexual abuse against 
three of his children. He was acquitted of molesting his son. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil lawsuit was filed on behalf of four of Cho's six children: the two 
minors, now in foster care; a daughter who is in college, and Young Sun Cho, 
who committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit asks for $13 million or whatever remains of Edward Cho's holdings. 
The children also sued Cho's wife for allegedly allowing the molestation to 
occur. Depositions are being taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Cho estate and his widow have responded by blaming his two 
older daughters for a plot to acquire his wealth -- a charge they deny. 
</P>
<P>
 But money -- even a great deal of money -- would not have been enough 
temptation for the Cho children to expose themselves to the shame experienced 
by victims of incest and sexual abuse, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dragging your family in, bringing such a suit is a big disgrace," said Dr. 
Eun Mee Kim, associate professor of sociology at USC. "No amount of money can 
restore their name." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, to the day he was found hanging in his jail cell from a noose of 
bedsheets, Cho maintained that what happened to him could happen to any stern 
Korean parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were to go to jail as a criminal," he wrote in a letter to the Orange 
County United Korea Student Assn., "then our 30 million Koreans should all go 
to prison."

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; THERE'S NO RUSHIN' OUT OF RUSSIA; THEY FELL IN LOVE 
AND PLANNED TO BE MARRIED. BUT TRYING TO SHARE THEIR JOY WITH FAMILY HERE HAS 
MEANT ONLY RED TAPE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was 1 year old, a beautiful, dark-haired girl was born thousands of 
miles away. Her parents named her Svetlana Svyataya, which in Russian means 
roughly "Light of the Saints." 
</P>
<P>
 When Svetlana was 4, she played on the muddy banks of a creek running past her 
grandparents' Ukrainian farm. I was 5, mucking about on the muddy banks of 
Pittsburgh's Allegheny River, which ran past my grandparents' cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 Svetlana eventually moved to St. Petersburg, where she grew up and began to 
work on a doctorate in astrophysics. I ended up in St. Petersburg as a 
journalist. We met, fell in love and decided to marry. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, more than a year after our marriage, Svetlana cannot enter the 
United States to stay. She has been there once -- with me, after an epic 
struggle with the U.S. government, one that indeed has still not ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most foreigners, my wife needs a visa: permission from the U.S. 
government to enter the country. In the frank words of Duke Austin, a senior 
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington: "Just 
because you're marrying someone doesn't mean they're eligible to come to the 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a visa isn't easy. It depends on your citizenship, why you want to 
visit the States, whether you are rich or poor, sick or healthy, married or 
single, male or female. 
</P>
<P>
 Svetlana and I learned all this about 17 months ago when we got engaged and I 
decided to introduce her to my parents. So we went to the U.S. Consulate in St. 
Petersburg for a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department handles all tourist visa applications. Diplomats judge 
applications at their whim: They are not required to explain denials and there 
is no appeal. In Russia -- and in other countries where the economy is wheezing 
or the political situation unstable -- the State Department is particularly 
miserly with tourist visas. Diplomats say about 20% of the Russians to whom 
they grant tourist or business visas don't come back, choosing instead to live 
and work illegally in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, single Russians -- and especially young, pretty Russian women -- are 
the least likely applicants to return from the States, diplomats say, and so 
their applications are often denied. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said it denied 
about 20% of all Russian non-immigrant visa applications last year, and 45% of 
all such applications from people 18 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
 None of which, we thought, concerned us. We were wrong. At the consulate, we 
were told not to even bother applying. The officer on duty said a single 
23-year-old like Svetlana could not receive a tourist visa because "she might 
marry someone and not come back." 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that we were engaged and that I wanted Svetlana to meet my 
parents. I explained that I had a job and Svetlana her studies, that we had an 
apartment and a dog and a car in St. Petersburg and would have to come back. 
The officer was unmoved; the State Department just couldn't trust us. If 
Svetlana and I sneakily got married on a tourist visa, he said, "it would 
really screw up our paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer suggested a different route: the K-1 fiancee's visa. This 
"fast-track, hassle-free" visa would "be ready very quickly, perhaps in a 
month." But we would have to get married within 90 days of arriving in the 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 For Russian-American couples like us, there are no other options. The 
government forbids you to introduce your Russian girlfriend (or boyfriend) to 
your parents unless you're prepared to get married. We were prepared; but not 
every couple looking down the barrel of Uncle Sam's shotgun can say that. 
</P>
<P>
 So we agreed to apply for the K-1. The State Department, at least, was happy: 
They had passed the buck. The K-1 is an immigration visa, which meant we would 
be dealing with the INS. The diplomats would have to do much of the work on our 
case, but technically we weren't their problem anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we asked, what does getting the K-1 visa involve? Diplomats that day -- 
and every day for the next several months -- gave us wildly different, often 
incorrect and infuriatingly vague answers. Several insisted that I would have 
to fly to Washington to collect an INS application in person . Not true; my 
father mailed one to me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite our requests, no one would lay out the application process for us; 
most diplomats would instead tell us only enough to get us to the next step in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, we called the INS. A computer answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our automated system is less than perfect," admitted INS spokesman Austin 
dryly. "We got 7 million telephone inquiries the year before last. If we 
answered telephones manually, it would take every employee working every 
working hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the diplomats had been evasive, INS officers were too busy drowning 
in their own paperwork. Our bulky file was added to a pile of nearly 4 million 
immigration applications, reviewed by a mere 2,166 officers of the 
18,000-member INS.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're permitting in excess of 900,000 people to immigrate to the United 
States (annually). In the marriage category, the numbers are running 140,000 to 
150,000 a year," Austin said. "Nor is it an easy rubber stamp." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it. We gathered and filled out a mountain of documents for the INS, 
only to have our application rejected for using "old forms." The rejected 
application was sent not to my parents in Maryland but into the black hole of 
the Russian regular mail system. (Today, more than a year later, it still 
hasn't arrived.) We got the "new forms" -- which were exactly the same as the 
old ones, except for an errata slip raising the filing fee from $35 to $75 -- 
and reapplied. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the infamously disorganized Russian government issued Svetlana her 
passport in three days, thanks in part to a chocolate cake and a bottle of red 
wine given to passport officials. And Svetlana and I got married in her 
hometown church (unofficially -- if we got legally married, Svetlana would then 
need a wife's visa). 
</P>
<P>
 The INS approved our application in June. We arranged to rent a beach house in 
Maryland in August. Svetlana took leave from her graduate work, while I priced 
tickets to the States. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, instead of a visa we were given more forms: 
Packet Three. "After you've filled out Packet Three, you can come get Packet 
Four," the unsmiling official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packets Three and Four were the beginning of "the Questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever trafficked drugs? Ever gambled? Do you intend to be a ward of the state? 
Have you ever engaged in genocide or ordered the killing of any person? Do you 
plan to practice polygamy? Work as a prostitute or a pimp? Overthrow the U.S. 
government? 
</P>
<P>
 That government, guardian of the Bill of Rights, even asks whether applicants 
have ever been accused -- not convicted, just accused -- of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 We turned in Packet Four and were told to report a week later to a grungy 
Moscow clinic for Svetlana's medical exam. The exam included an AIDS test; an 
HIV-positive result means no visa. The clinic contacts -- by telegram -- only 
those applicants whose results are positive. AIDS tests are notoriously 
unreliable, but the U.S. government reports all positive results to the Russian 
government, whose policies strip people with AIDS of many rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer slipped away without results (and, thankfully, telegrams). We let 
the beach house go. Finally, in September, we got the visa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My parents met us at the Baltimore airport with flowers and hugs (but not 
before INS officers had fingerprinted Svetlana). We got married -- officially, 
this time -- at the Rockville County Courthouse in Maryland, where bride and 
groom take a number and wait in a lobby under signs that sternly forbid 
rice-throwing. A more substantial wedding -- the kind my mother would have 
liked -- would have required long-term planning made impossible by the 
uncertainties of the visa process. 
</P>
<P>
 At the INS Baltimore office, we traded our marriage certificate for more 
forms. We were unexpectedly asked to pay $120. And then the kicker: We were 
told to come back in two months for our next interview and -- surprise! -- not 
to leave the country in the meantime. (Never mind that the diplomats had 
repeatedly assured me we would be able to return to Russia immediately.) 
</P>
<P>
 I told a supervisor that my job would be jeopardized if we stayed. But he 
wouldn't consider my request to advance the interview date, so I demanded the 
$120 back. He refused, explaining that's the fee for getting an interview date. 
</P>
<P>
 We got a lawyer. He was sympathetic, but this late in the game, $100-an-hour 
sympathy was about all he could offer. 
</P>
<P>
 So we quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we are back in St. Petersburg, waiting for a wife's visa. Consular 
officials say this visa is more complicated than the "fast-track, hassle-free" 
K-1. We have plans to travel to America later this summer, but when I suggested 
Svetlana buy a bathing suit for the trip, she just laughed.

COMMITMENTS; HUMAN CONDITION; A KISS IS NOT JUST A KISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your dog does not understand kissing. 
</P>
<P>
 Licking the dog gets, but not kissing. When you smother Bowser with smooches, 
what does he do? Does he pucker up and kiss you back? No. He drools. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same with your parakeet. Of course, parakeets don't have lips, but 
even if they did they wouldn't kiss, they'd peck. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, humans get a particular kick out of osculating. (We also have 
an ingrained hankering for karaoke, for whatever that's worth.) 
</P>
<P>
 We enjoy kissing one another, as well as watching other people do it (in the 
movies and in Certs commercials). No proper cinematic love story is complete 
without a last, lingering locking of lips. 
</P>
<P>
 This much we know. But why, oh why, do we like kissing so darn much? 
</P>
<P>
 When Chicago psychotherapist Sylvia Babbin wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on 
"Kissing and Its Relationship With Marital Satisfaction and Sexual 
Satisfaction" in 1984, she found surprisingly little had been written about 
kissing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her survey of the subject uncovered references to kissing in Roman poetry, the 
"Kama Sutra" and medieval European courtly romances. But scientific studies of 
kissing were scanty and outdated, many of them from the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 To test her hypothesis that the quantity and quality of a couple's kissing is 
a barometer of marital and sexual happiness, Babbin gave a detailed 
questionnaire to 100 married men and 100 married women (who were not married to 
one another). She found willing subjects enduring layovers at Chicago's O'Hare 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Babbin learned that married people kiss 4 1/2 times a day 
on average. That includes romantic and passionate kissing, as well as 
"hello/goodby" and "good morning/good night" pecks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised," Babbin says. "I thought it was going to be more." 
Nevertheless, most people said they were satisfied with the kissing they were 
getting. 
</P>
<P>
 She believes kissing fulfills important psychological needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kissing has to do with touching, intimacy and communication," she says. "So 
why do people kiss? Those are the three goodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Because kissing brings people face to face and eye to eye, it is especially 
conducive to intimacy, which involves a lowering of our physical and 
psychological barriers. Kissing, in short, asks us to explore our 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kissing for many people can be more intimate than sex," she says, noting that 
prostitutes may be willing to perform a variety of sexual acts for hire but 
draw the line at kissing. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an unexpected fringe benefit to Babbin's research. "My husband 
became a much better kisser during the process," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Our predilection for kissing is probably an outgrowth of both our evolution 
and our hairless skins, says Dr. Louis West, a professor of psychiatry at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Humans and apes alike engage in what West calls "sensation-exchanging 
behavior," such as mutual grooming, which seems to enhance the bonding process. 
</P>
<P>
 "In humans, skin-to-skin contact is more important than in any other creature, 
because we don't have pelts," West says. "Our earliest experiences involve the 
stimulation of the mouth and the face against the warm skin of the most beloved 
of all beings -- the nursing mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the infant suckling reflex vanishes in the early years of life, 
the sensitivity of the lips and face remains, West says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may seem a kiss is just a kiss as time goes by, kissing methods 
change according to fashion and cultural norms, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my lifetime, the styles of kissing have changed," observes West, 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "A passionate kiss in the 1930s involved pressing the lips together. You just 
never saw people eating each other's faces to show passion the way they do now 
in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Erotic kissing was not popular in ancient China or Japan, although it was 
known in Arabic cultures and in India. In Europe, kissing was originally the 
province of the gentlemen and ladies who perfected the art of courtly love, but 
it eventually came into fashion among the lower classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eskimos and Laplanders are known for nose-rubbing, while anthropologists 
reported in the 1920s that Tobriand Islanders in the South Pacific liked to rub 
noses, cheeks and mouths together; suck one another's tongues; bite each 
other's lower lips, chins, cheeks and noses, and, in particularly passionate 
moments, bite off one another's eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to a cross-cultural survey in "Sexual Practices" by Edgar Gregersen 
(Franklin Watts Inc., 1982), kissing is unknown among such tribal peoples as 
the Somali, Cewa, Lepcha and Siriono. The Thonga of South Africa are said to 
regard kissing as disgusting because of the possibility of exchanging saliva. 
</P>
<P>
 And while public kissing now is commonplace in most Western countries 
(although some states once had laws regulating it), it is still seen as 
scandalous in such places as India, where movies featuring Western-style kisses 
are controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all kissing is romantic or erotic, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissing can also be a way of demonstrating non-sexual affection (for our kids, 
friends, in-laws, pets), as well as an act fraught with symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissing for symbolic purposes has a long and rich history. We need only recall 
how at the Last Supper, Judas betrayed Jesus with a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, three kisses upon the cheek became seen as a symbol of the Holy 
Trinity. It also became the custom to kiss the Pope's ring, and the Roman 
Catholic liturgy refers to the "kiss of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Let us not forget air kissing among celebrities and the dreaded "kiss of 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ted McIlvenna, president of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human 
Sexuality in San Francisco, says such symbolic forms of kissing arose as a way 
to recognize or formalize an occasion.  
</P>
<P>
 Randy Thornhill, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of New 
Mexico, hypothesizes that kissing permits potential mates to check out one 
another's health. 
</P>
<P>
 "The breath is very diagnostic of health, so you want to get intimate with the 
breath to test people," says Thornhill, who researches sexual attraction in 
humans and animals. He has shown, for example, that hens prefer to mate with 
roosters with bright red combs because they are healthier. 
</P>
<P>
 So even though kissing itself can lead to the transmission of some diseases -- 
including colds, strep infections and mononucleosis -- it may play an important 
reproductive role. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're choosing a mate," Thornhill adds, "one thing we want to look for, 
whether it's humans or roosters, is health."
