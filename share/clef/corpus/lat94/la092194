MOVIE REVIEW; 'STONES': POURING OUT PASSION OF THE WORKING CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Loach has a taste for humanity and a gift for involvement. The most 
influential of living British directors, an inspiration to filmmakers as 
diverse as Neal Jordan, Stephen Frears and Mike Leigh, Loach has been working 
with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of compassion for close to 30 years. 
"Raining Stones" is his latest film, and one of his best. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of a Special Jury Prize at Cannes in 1993, "Stones" is in the tradition 
of previous Loach films like "Cathy Come Home," "Kes" and the recent 
"Riff-Raff." All share a passionate and sympathetic view of Britain's 
underclass, a belief that, as a character in this film puts it, "When you're a 
worker, it rains stones seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Committed though he is, Loach is the furthest thing from grimly doctrinaire or 
dogmatic. His sympathy for people at the margins of society is always intensely 
dramatic, and, much like his subjects, his more recent films show an 
understanding that humor can be present in even the most despairing situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raining Stones" was shot in an economically depressed area in the north of 
England, a locale familiar to the film's working-class screenwriter, Jim Allen. 
And, in an act of faith that has had almost magical consequences, it was also 
cast locally with nonprofessional actors who understand and handle their parts 
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus of all the attention is Bob Williams (Bruce Jones) and his wife, Anne 
(Julie Brown). On the dole though they are, Bob and his buddy Tommy (Ricky 
Tomlinson) are always embroiled in doomed schemes to earn a few quick pounds, 
like the plot to kidnap and sell a few good sheep that opens the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodhearted but not lucky, Bob is struck by an unexpected misfortune just as a 
special need for money arises. His darling daughter Coleen (Gemma Phoenix) is 
about to celebrate her first communion, and close to 100 pounds will be needed 
to properly outfit her. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not particularly religious, it is a matter of fiery pride to Bob that 
Coleen look perfect on "the most important day of her life." So "Raining 
Stones" takes the simple route of following Bob as he attempts to raise the 
needed funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Loach does this with great deftness, as Bob tries his hand at cleaning drains, 
digging up bootleg turf and other decidedly odd jobs. Tommy accompanies him on 
most of these quests, and as played by Tomlinson ("Riff-Raff's" chagrined 
bathtub man) he brings humor to every situation. Comic stories about small boys 
and Lourdes bubble out of him, and when the seller of an old van insists it 
only had one owner, he cracks, "Who was it, Ben-Hur?" 
</P>
<P>
 But even at its funniest, "Raining Stones" never forgets the pained reality 
that underlies the humor. Loach and Allen understand how desperate these people 
are to better themselves and break the cycle of poverty, and how awfully 
difficult that can be. Caught between the sporadic solace of the church and the 
anger of the local grass-roots leaders, Bob finds himself "just ducking and 
weaving, trying to keep my head above water." 
</P>
<P>
 Both playful and sad, often at the same time, "Raining Stones" also has 
moments of lacerating power. Plainly unforgettable is a blistering visit to the 
Williams house by a character named Tansey (Jonathan James), a sequence that is 
shocking in its bluntness and lack of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Raining Stones" has a problem, at least for American audiences, it is the 
performers' thick North Country accents that make it difficult to completely 
catch what is said. But though a word gets lost now and again, the gist is 
never in question, and time here is considerably better spent than with those 
too numerous films where you can follow everything but desperately wish you 
couldn't. 
</P>

 Shakur Indicted: Controversial rapper Tupac Shakur pleaded not guilty Tuesday 
in Los Angeles Superior Court after being indicted by the county jury for an 
alleged weapons violation. The rapper, who co-starred with Janet Jackson in the 
film "Poetic Justice," was arrested April 30 after police allegedly found a 9mm 
semiautomatic handgun in a computer case under his car seat. The grand jury 
charged Shakur with being a convicted person having a concealed firearm in a 
vehicle. Shakur is due back in court for a pretrial hearing in a week. The case 
is just one in a host of legal troubles facing Shakur, who earlier this year 
served 15 days in county jail for assault and battery. Last week, he pleaded 
guilty in Michigan to misdemeanor assault charges. Shakur also faces sexual 
assault charges in New York and an aggravated assault charge in Atlanta. A 
prerecorded interview with the rapper will air on cable's Black Entertainment 
Television at 6 tonight.

 Concert Chilled Out: Elton John ended his scheduled 2 1/2-hour concert about 
30 minutes early Monday night at the Greek Theatre because he was too chilled 
on stage, his publicist said. "Elton wasn't prepared for the drop in 
temperature during the evening and he felt the chill was affecting his 
playing," said Sarah McMullen. "There will be additional heaters on stage for 
the rest of the shows and he'll be dressed accordingly." The Greek engagement, 
which continues through Thursday, will raise about $750,000 for the Elton John 
AIDS Foundation. TELEVISION

Aspen, Colo., Comedy Festival. In its expanded format, the March 22-26 festival 
will spotlight virtually every comedy discipline, including one-person shows, 
plays, short films, animation and stand-up. "This festival will focus on both 
the art and the business of comedy," said HBO Senior Vice President Chris 
Albrecht. "We hope that it will do for comedy what the Sundance Festival has 
done for film." Portions of the festival will air on both HBO and Comedy 
Central. MOVIES

 Restored 'Lady': Donald and Marla Trump, Laurence Tisch and Douglas Fairbanks 
Jr. were among those who attended the premiere of a newly restored version of 
"My Fair Lady" Monday night at New York's Ziegfeld Theatre. The 1964 musical, 
starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, recently underwent an Eliza 
Doolittle-like transformation at the hands of film restorers Robert A. Harris 
and James C. Katz. "It's absolutely magic," said Marni Nixon, who sang most of 
Hepburn's songs in the film. "This preservation (means that) children will be 
able to see this." An additional film clip that had Hepburn's original vocal 
track for "Wouldn't It Be Loverly" was also shown. The restored "My Fair Lady" 
opens Friday at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza. THE ARTS

 Chung's Baton Rewarded: The Paris Opera is kicking him out next month, but the 
audience and orchestra love conductor Kyung-Whun Chung. The audience charged to

Boccanegra" Monday night at the 2,700-seat Opera Bastille. The musicians gave 
him a standing ovation and threw flowers. "That was the first time the 
musicians threw me flowers," said Chung, who lost his job in a dispute over 
salary and artistic control.

 LACMA Discussions: Members of the director's search committee at the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art were in Minnesota recently for discussions with 
Evan Maurer, 50, director since 1988 of the Minneapolis Institute of the Arts. 
LACMA officials said last month that by late September they hoped to be close 
to naming a new director for the Wilshire Boulevard museum. Maurer, whose 
academic specialties include early modern, African and American Indian art, is 
one of few names to have surfaced during LACMA's yearlong search to fill the 
vacant post.

THEATER REVIEW; HIGH-SEAS DRAMA WITH THE MET'S 'FOOL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Dorn Moody's "The Fool" at the Met Theatre is the theatrical 
equivalent of an N. C. Wyeth painting, a colorful adventure yarn full of brawn 
and derring-do. The play concerns the piratical exploits of Francis Drake who, 
facing arrest and ignominy in his native England, sails off to the New World to 
raid Spain's coffers so that he can return home a hero, covered with gold and 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's rich, multilayered play, which vividly captures the language and 
history of the late 1500s, was understandably nominated for a Pulitzer in 1985. 
Manly exploits abound on this bounding main, but in addition to the purely 
physical feats of courage and endurance, there's also an intellectually 
satisfying Hegelian dialectic, personified by Drake (Don Harvey) and his bosom 
friend and second-in-command Thomas Doughty (Wayne Pere). 
</P>
<P>
 The low-born Drake is a man of action, all bluff, bravado and bulldog 
tenacity, whose primary purpose on his perilous voyage is the amassment of a 
huge fortune, money he hopes will purchase him a pardon and win him favor with 
Queen Elizabeth (O-Lan Jones). 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Doughty, as courageous as his name implies, is a gentleman 
intellectual who needs no such material enticement to win advancement with the 
queen. In fact, he has already advanced himself well into her heart -- and her 
bed. Imbued with visionary dreams of a new world order, Doughty persuades 
Elizabeth to secretly finance Drake's voyage, hoping not only to further her in 
the New World but also to found a utopian "New England," based on principles of 
equality and egalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 When in balance, Drake and Doughty are two halves of a formidable whole. 
However, when opposites collide, as they inevitably must on this fateful 
journey, Drake is forced to destroy his better half, the sole exalting impulse 
of his otherwise base nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Director James Gammon captains Moody's three-act drama with great energy, 
though occasionally the play enters the doldrums. Gammon has assembled a 
capable cast but has not fully succeeded in imposing a consistent period style 
upon his actors, some of whom seem to be playing more for a camera rather than 
an audience, an unfortunate technique that leaves us cupping our ears even in 
this modestly sized house. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake was only 35 at the commencement of his voyage, long before his escapades 
had rendered him respectable, but even so, Harvey seems a tad too young and 
fair to jibe with one's historical notions of the great sea captain. 
Preconceptions aside, however, Harvey's air of gruff command and sheer physical 
vitality propel the play. Pere is particularly affecting as Doughty, a 
life-loving man whose ideals doom him to martyrdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The production's technical elements are superb. Patrick McFadden's handsome 
and versatile set, Denise Caplan's period costumes, Leonora Schildkraut's 
sound, and Chris Collins' superbly rendered lighting design contribute great 
excitement and authenticity to this high drama on the high seas. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'PIG FARMER' LARDED WITH CONTRIVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Leon the Pig Farmer" is a conventional, minor British comedy of limited 
interest that could just as easily have been set in America with virtually no 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Frankel is the film's appealing star, a young London Jewish realtor who 
finally walks out on his rapacious firm only to wind up working for his 
mother's catering business. It's a familiar story of being pressured to get 
married, of having a fling with a free-spirited shiksa (Maryam D'Abo) but of 
finally accepting himself, as the nice but dreamy Jewish girl (Gina Bellman) 
who thought she wanted a more exciting guy accepts him. 
</P>
<P>
 But feature debuting co-producer-directors Vadim Jean and Gary Sinyor (Sinyor 
wrote the script with Michael Normand) throw a monkey wrench in the love-hate 
view of a Jewish enclave where everybody knows everybody else's business. This 
occurs when Frankel's Leon Geller discovers he was sired by a sperm bank donor 
who turns out to be a well-off Gentile Yorkshire pig farmer (Brian Glover), a 
larger-than-life type with an eccentric and complicated extended family who 
embrace Leon warmly.  
</P>
<P>
 At this point the filmmakers resort to a silly gimmick that is supposed to 
spin a moral and tie everything up but that instead bulldozes a comedy already 
strained and overly familiar. 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; SHORTER GETS SHORT SHRIFT AT BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was Wayne Shorter doing at the Jazz Bakery Monday night? Good question, 
because neither he nor the audience seemed quite sure. Shorter had been 
scheduled as an unadvertised, surprise guest, but the real shock was that this 
world-renowned jazz saxophonist was nowhere to be seen until the performance 
was nearly over. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was not with Shorter, who spent a good part of the evening in the 
dressing room with his soprano saxophone waiting to be called on stage by 
pianist Guilherme Vergueiro, whose Brazilian big band was the nominal headline 
act. Vergueiro is an interesting composer, and his ensemble is filled with 
first-rate players, but there was little doubt that much of the overflow crowd 
had been generated by the anticipation of a relatively rare appearance by 
Shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 Vergueiro, however, spent the opening half of the evening displaying his own 
music, without assistance from anyone except his group. Some of the pieces were 
very good. Vergueiro's contrasting mix of subtle timbral textures and sudden, 
explosive brass accents suggested a rapidly growing compositional talent. Other 
works, especially the vocal numbers featuring his wife, singer Ana Carolina, 
had the feel of prepackaged Brazilian pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Vergueiro finally invited Shorter on stage toward the close of the program. 
But, rather than allow the saxophonist a moment to get into the flow of the 
music, Vergueiro immediately kicked off a breakneck samba rhythm. Shorter took 
the challenge and pulled the music up to a higher, more engaging level of 
improvisation. The best testimony to his impact was provided by the band's 
saxophone players, who watched him intently, captivated by his every note. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Shorter didn't get to do much more than that. Vergueiro once 
again brought back Carolina, and one of the finest jazz saxophonists in the 
world was relegated to dispensing background fills. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a curious conclusion to a curious program. Granting Vergueiro's desire 
to showcase his own group, he would have given his music far greater 
distinction had he been willing to flavor it -- in a more respectful fashion -- 
with a larger contribution from Shorter.

TV RATINGS; ABC TAKES WEEK, SETS THE STAGE TO DETHRONE CBS

 In the final warm-up before the beginning of the so-called official season, 
ABC won the network sweepstakes last week and set the stage for its bid to 
unseat CBS as the prime-time ratings champion. Figures released by the A.C. 
Nielsen Co. on Tuesday showed ABC with five of the Top 10 programs, among them 
the premiere of its comedy "All-American Girl," starring Margaret Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, which has won the ratings crown for the past three years, also placed a 
new show in theTop 10: The medical drama "Chicago Hope" ranked sixth in its 
first outing Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, meanwhile, had "The Martin Short Show" and "Sweet Justice" finish among 
the Top 20 in their initial broadcasts last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of the new programs, however, were shown outside their regular time 
slots. 
</P>
<P>
 How other premieres fared: CBS' "Under Suspicion" placed 33rd among the week's 
84 prime-time programs, ABC's "McKenna" was 53rd, Fox's "Party of Five" was 
56th, ABC's "Blue Skies" was 59th and ABC's "On Our Own" was 23rd--but then 
fell to 68th in its regular time period Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are A. C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area 
during the same week. Each rating point equals 50,064 households.

 LANDING: Poor weather in Florida caused the Space Shuttle Discovery to land at 
Edwards Air Force Base near Lancaster on Tuesday (B1), creating a sonic boom 
heard throughout the Valley. . . . But Edwards faces an uncertain future. Once 
the showcase home for the U.S. rocket program, it now faces stiff competition 
for scarce defense dollars. One rival: the Navy's Patuxent River flight test 
center in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 SHAKEN: The sonic boom scared the heck out of some people, including one 
frightened woman who whispered to an Antelope Valley sheriff's deputy that 
someone was breaking into her house. She was chagrined when Deputy Charles 
Marritt told her the truth. . . . Yet she was not alone. Foothill Division 
officers received about 100 calls.

 SKATING TIPS: Gretzky may be the Great One. But Glantz could be the one the 
Los Angeles Kings need just as sorely. He's Rob Glantz (above), a Birmingham 
High grad who teaches a more efficient way to skate -- called power skating -- 
to the Kings at their Iceoplex camp in North Hills (C1). . . . "The little

 PUBLICITY HOUND: Ashley Whippet was a dog with a talent for catching Frisbees. 
Irv Lander, of Van Nuys, was a man with a talent for promotion. Twenty years 
ago, they started "canine Frisbee," and it's still going strong (B1). . . . 
Fame has its price, however: During a White House visit, Ashley had to ward off 
an attack by Billy Carter's mutt over the use of a water dish.

 SHOTS: It's that season again. No, not fall. . . . Flu. But you can do 
something about it. Today's Valley Briefing (B14) explains how to combat the 
common cold and influenza, and where seniors can get free shots. . . . Daniel 
W. Martin, of the Los Angeles County Immunization Program, says it's too early 
to determine whether this flu season will be mild or severe. Michael Arkush and

THE OUTER LIMITS OF PROSECUTION; HATE CRIME MUST BE COMBATTED AT ALL LEVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attacks against people because of their race, religion or sexual orientation 
occur with such appalling regularity they have their own designation: hate 
crimes. But hate-crime prosecution is more easily called for than done. 
</P>
<P>
 State law defines a hate crime as "the interference through force or threat 
with an individual's civil rights" on the basis of race, religion, nationality 
or ethnic background. Also included are attacks on gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors need to be vigorous in pressing hate-crime charges that they can 
make stick, but society cannot count on the legal system alone to create a 
climate of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LAYMAN'S VIEW: Consider last week's gun killing in Orange County of Vernon 
Windell Flournoy. Sure, it was a hate crime "from a layman's perspective," 
notes Huntington Beach Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg, because one of the 
accused was a reputed associate of white supremacists and Flournoy was African 
American. Accused in the killing are Jonathan Russell Kennedy, 19, a so-called 
skinhead, and a 17-year-old. In addition, Kennedy is charged with the attempted 
murder of two Latino men last month, also in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are considering filing hate-crime charges in both cases, but such 
cases can be difficult to prove. Establishing a hate crime as defined by state 
law requires prosecutors to prove that a suspect deliberately targeted a victim 
for racial or other specified characteristics. In another case, the district 
attorney filed hate-crime charges in the beating death of a black woman at a La 
Habra mall but dropped them when further evidence showed a dispute over a 
parking space was one cause of the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the district attorney upgraded charges in an attack on a black high 
school student to attempted murder but declined a hate-crime prosecution on the 
grounds there was insufficient evidence to prove race was a motivating factor. 
Although to a layman it certainly looked like a racial case, proving the case 
in court under the official standards is a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
 TEACHING OUR YOUNG: At the same time, fortunately, the Los Angeles and Orange 
County human relations commissions have done good work in documenting hate 
crimes, and private watchdog groups have been aggressive in spotlighting 
outrages and using civil laws where applicable to thwart hatemongers. This 
vigilance and good police work are necessary. But equally so is education, 
starting at home with instruction on diversity and the need for tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 School discussions, sermons from the pulpit, community meetings sponsored by 
service organizations, all can help steer young people away from hate and 
toward a reaffirmation of democratic values. These are not easy tasks, but they 
are the important work we all must do in striving to build and maintain a just 
society, supported by effective law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate-crime cases in Orange and Los Angeles counties are yet more reminders 
that bigotry is dangerous, and that multicultural California cannot afford to 
shrug off this corrosive and demoralizing evil.

EDUCATION WATCH; CLAS ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System, the innovative testing system for 
public school students, is in grave jeopardy of premature political death. It 
deserves better.More important, California schoolchildren deserve better. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, if he signs SB 1273, by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), 
will continue the CLAS tests and demonstrate that California is still committed 
to educational excellence. Already the academically demanding tests have been 
administered to more than 2 million students in the fourth, fifth, eighth and 
10th grades. SB 1273 would address legitimate criticisms of the test without 
killing what is good. And there is indeed a lot of good in the CLAS tests worth 
saving, because they help kids translate learning into thinking. Under Hart's 
bill, the familiar and traditional multiple choice questions would remain, but 
so would essay and performance-based questions that elicit more than 
cookie-cutter responses.  
</P>
<P>
 The heralded tests ran into trouble this year after there were controversies 
involving scoring and objections were sounded over reading selection content. 
Much of the criticism was driven by religious extremists; some of the protest 
pointed to legitimate questions about privacy and about the administration of 
the test. SB 1273 has addressed those shortcomings, and that's why it has won 
the support of educators throughout the state.  
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, Gov. Wilson's own appointed state Board of Education has 
urged him to sign the bill. Surely he trusts his own board's judgment; surely 
he will follow its advice.

COMMUNITY POLICING, HAITI STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's worries about Haiti: 
</P>
<P>
 1. HAITI'S MILITARY: Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, leader of the U.S. expeditionary 
force, reports excellent cooperation between the American and Haitian military 
commands. Fine, but let's hope they're not about to become blood brothers. Keep 
in mind that the reason we're there is the Haitian military. This is an army 
that has existed not to defend the country but to repress the Haitian people at 
the behest of the country's ruling economic elite. Raoul Cedras has not been 
running any Salvation Army. Haitian police and soldiers beat at least one 
person to death Tuesday. Any superficial commonalities between the Haitian and 
American forces should not blind the U.S. officials there to the profound 
differences between them. 
</P>
<P>
 2. POLICING HAITI: The dramatic agreement signed Sunday in Port-au-Prince 
permits the Haitian military and police forces to continue to police that 
troubled country. Good luck. Aren't the island nation's troubles only 
compounded by an arrangement in which the Haitian military continues to do its 
thing as the U.S. military force, climbing rapidly toward 15,000-strong, looks 
the other way? U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will be 
understandably reluctant to commit U.N. peacekeepers to the subsequent phases 
until the U.S. forces can create what a U.N. resolution calls "a secure and 
stable environment." How can that be done without U.S. troops taking over the 
policing role from the Haitian military? There is absolutely no reason to 
believe that police accustomed to bullying citizens (and far worse) will 
suddenly change from persecutor to protector. 
</P>
<P>
 3. ARISTIDE'S ICINESS: Exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is not happy 
that the Haitian military is still involved in running things and that Cedras 
is still around. OK, but maybe the ousted leader could be more pragmatic: After 
all, U.S. armed forces are there and the chemistry in his country is now quite 
different. No one thinks that the American deal with the junta is ideal, by any 
means; but U.S. policy, however flawed and bumbling, is committed. Aristide's 
coldness does not auger well for Aristide-Washington relations down the road.

DEBATE IS NEEDED, GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is the last chance fading for a direct confrontation in a debating forum 
between Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and his Democratic challenger, Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 The California Broadcasters Assn. and KGO-TV in San Francisco, which had hoped 
to sponsor an Oct. 16 meeting between the candidates, have found unacceptable 
the terms of debate demanded by the Wilson camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Any responsible sponsor would have been forced to the same conclusion, for 
what Wilson insisted on was nothing less than the right to choose the political 
reporters who would question the candidates. As if this transparent effort to 
make sure that Wilson was lobbed softballs wasn't enough, his negotiators added 
another condition: exclusion of all questions from the public, on the grounds, 
as Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur so felicitously put it, that they would 
be only "distractions." Heaven forbid that politicians should be distracted 
from meeting the heavy responsibilities of public service by such extraneous 
matters as hearing what voters have on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says she's ready to take part in as many as five televised debates and 
that she won't seek to set format conditions. As we have said before, there's 
no reason a politically neutral organization, like the League of Women Voters, 
shouldn't simply be asked by the two camps to set the rules for the encounter 
and to pick the questioners, with both candidates accepting the format in 
advance. Brown has repeatedly said she would. Wilson until now has chosen to 
set conditions that his opponent as well as any responsible sponsoring 
organization can only find unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The public, it can't be said too often, has the right to be as fully informed 
as possible about where those who seek public office stand. Canned speeches and 
30-second commercials are no substitute for freewheeling debate. There's still 
time for Wilson to agree to debate Brown under impartial rules. There's still 
time for voters to hear honest give and take on issues that might deeply affect 
their lives.

MEDIA TREATMENT OF RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The series "Living Scared" by David Shaw (Sept. 11-13) was well-researched 
and long overdue. While there is little evidence that exposure to low levels of 
Alar, caffeine and radiation cause health effects, there is considerable proof 
that fear and anxiety often result in sleeplessness, elevated blood pressure 
and increased alcohol and drug use. 
</P>

<P>
 * You seem to have set out on a crusade to clobber the environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Since when is accurate knowledge detrimental to the public? Is Shaw telling us 
ignorance is bliss? The tobacco industry is fighting tooth and nail, refusing 
to admit that their product causes cancer. The FDA refuses to require that milk 
be labeled when hormones are injected in cows. Our own government was quite 
secretive about experimenting with radioactive injections on pregnant women. 
Reagan insisted the "Star Wars umbrella" was our protection and Bush 
pooh-poohed the ozone hole, just to mention a few cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists may not be perfect, but they certainly are more on our 
side than greedy corporations, lying politicians and fawning journalists!

 * In the articles there no mention of the profit the "Chicken Littles" make 
from their activities. Reporters get bylines. Scientists get grants. 
Politicians get votes. Consultants get clients. It beats working hard for a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 In these days of belief in ESP, astrology, and other paranormal processes, 
combined with widespread ignorance of mathematical logic and scientific 
understanding, it should not be surprising that people get uptight about 
perceived risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two non-hazards that I did not see mentioned are low-frequency magnetic fields 
and radon exposure. Both are building up constituencies for fun and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM BUCHMAN

</P>
<P>
 * In his hyperbolic series on the alarmist ("cry wolf") trends in 
technological reporting, Shaw criticizes basic human instinct and intuition 
because they don't look at the numbers. After Chernobyl, Bhopal, Hiroshima, 
etc. I think some healthy skepticism is warranted. We can't seem to stop or 
even slow the race to progress anyway. Has any new technology ever been 
stopped? Oh, Da Vinci did suppress his own submarine when he realized its 
destructive potential! 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw's reading of the media's bias is simply wrong. I have never read an 
article introducing a new innovation that didn't first thoroughly exhibit its 
benefits. Later, when implementation is imminent, voices of protest may be 
raised, but our destiny has been set. Now he doubts the technologically 
enhanced media: technology's mental component. How interesting that we are now 
discovering that media does in fact sway public opinion. The bounds between us 
and technology blur. What we hold in our hands is technology! And though it can 
give us the truth, it can also lie like there is no tomorrow. 
</P>

 * Shaw's article was interesting and thought-provoking. While I agree that 
claims about the risk of AIDS within the heterosexual population have been 
presented by the media in an alarmist fashion, the information presented on 
AIDS and heterosexuals in Shaw's article was misleading. The statement "AIDS is 
not presently a serious threat to the non-promiscuous, non-intravenous 
drug-using, North American heterosexual" is inaccurate. It can take only one 
sexual encounter with an HIV-infected person to become infected with the virus, 
and many people who are HIV positive are unaware of their own HIV status. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, when the term "heterosexual AIDS cases" is applied, one must look at 
AIDS cases among men and women separately. In 1993, the Los Angeles County HIV 
Epidemiology Program reported that 1.1% of all AIDS cases among men were 
associated with heterosexual contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, 46% of all AIDS cases among women were associated with 
heterosexual contact and 19% with undetermined risk. This second group is 
believed to largely represent women who were infected heterosexually but who 
could not identify a sexual partner who was HIV-infected or at high risk for 
HIV infection. Many women find out after they are HIV-infected that their 
partner had sex with men or used needles in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 This information points out the need for the media to address men and women 
separately when discussing AIDS in the heterosexual community. More important, 
it speaks to the urgent need for better communication between partners about 
each other's sexual history and risk factors for HIV.

NEWT GINGRICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In "Life Under House Speaker Newt Gingrich" (Column Left, Sept. 13), Bruce 
F. Freed warns that if the GOP takes control of the House, committees will be 
eliminated, congressional staffs slashed, taxes lowered, special interest 
lobbyists restricted and administrative scandals investigated. Bruce, for those 
of us living outside the Beltway, what's the bad news?

<P>
 * After reading Freed's column on what changes would follow a Gingrich-led 
House of Representatives, I phoned the congressman's office to find out if he 
is in fact a term-limits supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was I told that he is but that he is a co-sponsor of a bill to limit 
terms in the House and Senate to 12 years. Then why, one might ask, is he 
running for reelection if he has already served 15 years? 
</P>
<P>
 One change that a Newt-led House will not bring is less hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 SAUL DAVIS

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I call for us to rise as one voice in stopping the nefarious Gingrich. How 
dare he seriously think we would support any effort to shrink the congressional 
budget and staff or put an end to absentee voting in committees! Where does he 
get off thinking we'd approve of anti-tax measures, restricted contributions 
from the lobbying firms, or (eek!) term limits? 
</P>
<P>
 But the crusher, as far as I'm concerned, would be in making grass-roots 
lobbying the "in" form. This could lead to an informed electorate or, even 
worse, responsible representation. We could no longer sit idly by while a 
handful of self-serving bureaucrats stuff their pockets while dealing away our 
future.

PROSTATE CANCER NEEDS EARLY DETECTION; MEDICINE: PRECIOUS TIME IS BEING WASTED 
ON THE DEBATE ON THE MERITS OF BROAD SCREENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU WRIGHT, Mary Lou Wright is president and CEO of the nonprofit 
Mathews Foundation for Prostate Cancer Research in Sacramento. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hospitals and clinics across the country are offering prostate-cancer 
screening this month for free or substantially reduced cost. At a time when 
health-care issues are uppermost in our national consciousness, this important 
service deserves special attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that as more Americans become aware of the benefits of early 
detection, widespread screening for breast and prostate cancer is 
controversial. At a time when it remains difficult to win appropriate funding 
for research into the cause and cure for these diseases, there are those who 
cling to another approach -- let's pretend we're doing enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Reducing the scope of screening will not reduce the incidence of any cancer. 
The object of screening is to identify cases that can benefit from early 
diagnosis. In 1993, breast cancer killed about 42,000 women, while prostate 
cancer killed about 36,000 men in this country. Many of them might have 
survived had their cancers been discovered in the earliest stages. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of breast-cancer screening, informed women are speaking out 
energetically. Ever since Betty Ford first spoke frankly about her disease, 
women have understood that open communication is a key element of treatment, 
that they play a vital role in their own healthy futures and that nothing can 
be taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 For men, unfortunately, there is little parallel experience.  
</P>
<P>
 Some prominent Americans have been lost to prostate cancer lately, among them 
musician Frank Zappa and actors Bill Bixby and Don Ameche. Bixby and Zappa, 
both only in their 50s when they died, were considerably younger than the 
"typical" prostate-cancer patient. Each acknowledged the nature of his illness 
-- not always the case with prostate cancer -- and each apparently was aware 
that earlier detection might have increased his longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments against broad screening focus on the assertion that it is 
difficult to demonstrate a relationship between early detection and increased 
longevity. In the past, studies have not documented such a correlation. But a 
more recent analysis shows a 3 1/2-year difference, according to Dr. Peter 
Scardino, chairman of urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other areas also are the focus of much discussion: the economics of 
screening and the impacts of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 On the economic front, there is concern that large-scale screening is a "cash 
cow" for some interests. One view is that as health-care structure is reshaped, 
reducing the scope of screening will be an important mechanism for reducing 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of that economic argument is the tremendous cost of waiting to 
treat this disease until it has reached advanced stages. Each year, the federal 
government spends almost $5 billion in prostate-cancer treatment. The cost of 
screening is, in fact, an important investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But a more sensitive issue is the most intimate one. Some treatment for 
prostate cancer may cause undesirable side effects, including incontinence and 
impotence. And in many cases, it's not at all clear when such treatments are 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostate cancer is a mysterious disease. It is present in most men over 60, to 
at least a minimal degree. In many cases, it grows very slowly over the years 
and causes no particular symptoms or ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
 When the disease occurs in younger men -- and 25% of all cases occur in men 
under the age of 60 -- it is often more virulent. It metastasizes quickly, 
leading inevitably to a difficult death. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all cases follow these patterns. Unfortunately, no one can predict which 
cancers will grow and spread and which may languish for years. This poses a 
dilemma for both doctors and patients: Is it better to suggest a treatment that 
may affect the most intimate aspects of a man's life, or to monitor the 
progress of the disease closely, taking action only if it becomes clearly 
necessary? Or is it easier to limit screening and reduce the number of times 
the difficult question arises? 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the third answer is no answer at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The real answer to prostate cancer, as with so many other diseases, is the 
assurance of an appropriate level of research funding. Only when the cause of 
this terrible disease is understood will the best possible answer be found. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shorter term, the arguments against screening are plainly without 
merit. It is true that, upon learning they have prostate cancer, some men will 
face difficult choices. But unless they know and understand their circumstances 
fully, they will have no choice whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 I can think of nothing less fair, or right, than that.

BRINGING CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS INTO THE 21ST CENTURY; THE TIMES INVITED 
GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES PETE WILSON, THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT, AND DEMOCRAT 
KATHLEEN BROWN TO DISCUSS KEY ISSUES IN THE 1994 ELECTION. TODAY THE FOCUS IS 
ON EDUCATION.

 Improving our schools will take fundamental change. Our schools must again 
become safe havens where we can teach our children the skills they'll need to 
compete in the workplace of the 21st Century. I've launched significant reforms 
to achieve this goal, but for these or any education reforms to work, they must 
include immigration reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The outrage in education today is that, despite already overcrowded classrooms 
and too tight budgets, there are 400,000 illegal immigrants enrolled in 
California's public schools. That's enough people to fill more than 650 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But President Clinton refuses to secure California's borders. And Kathleen 
Brown says that taxpayers should continue footing the bill for illegal 
immigrants in our schools. In fact, in a major speech on the subject, Brown 
said that "illegal immigration is wrongly seen as a cause" of problems in 
California. The truth is, we'll never completely fix our schools until we 
reform this absurd system of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 With the $1.5 billion California will spend on education for illegal 
immigrants this year, we could put a computer on the desk of every fifth-grader 
in the state, enroll 225,000 4-year-olds in preschool, expand by 1,500 sites 
our Healthy Start program for counseling troubled kids and pay for 20 million 
hours of training and mentoring for at-risk youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is already tight enough; even Treasurer Brown recognizes that. In fact, 
despite her partisan sniping, she didn't propose a single dollar more than I 
did for education this year. And while she doesn't recognize it, the key to 
freeing up more money for the education of legal residents is reducing the cost 
we're forced to bear for illegal immigration. That will allow our other reforms 
to make a real difference in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the reforms I'm working on: 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug-free, violence-free schools. Students can't learn and teachers can't 
teach in schools infested by drugs, gangs or guns. We just won a change in the 
law to try the worst juvenile criminals as adults, because vicious thugs 
deserve stiff sentences no matter how old they are. I also borrowed a 
successful idea from Long Beach to bring school uniforms to more public 
schools. Long Beach found that uniforms help limit gang violence and improve 
discipline.  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to violence in the classroom, we need a policy of zero 
tolerance. Someone who brings a gun to school should face just one thing -- 
mandatory expulsion. On the other hand, when Brown served on the Los Angeles 
school board, she joined the American Civil Liberties Union in trying to block 
police from using undercover officers to combat drug dealing in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computers in the classroom. In the age of computer chips, too many of our 
students are stuck in schools from the age of Mr. Chips. To fix that, the 
Public Utilities Commission, at my request, just allocated more than $40 
million as a down payment to start connecting every classroom in California to 
the information superhighway, beginning this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Freeing schools from red tape. I created charter schools two years ago to 
return greater control to parents and teachers, freeing them from stifling 
bureaucratic red tape. But I want to make it easier for communities to launch 
these break-the-mold schools by giving parents a bigger role in their creation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bringing parents back to school. For schools to succeed, parents must take 
an active role in their children's education. That's one reason I signed the 
nation's most ambitious school-choice plan last year. Thousands of Los Angeles 
parents are now choosing the public school they think is best for their child.  
</P>
<P>
 We also need a Parents Bill of Rights giving parents greater oversight over 
schools and the opportunity to monitor their children's classes. Education 
can't be left to teachers alone. Parents have an obligation to take an active 
role.  
</P>
<P>
 Our schools and our kids will have a greater future if we have the courage to 
make fundamental change -- including illegal immigration reform. Powerful 
special interests who back Brown oppose many of these reforms, but we can't 
afford to let our kids fall victim to partisan politics. I've reached across 
partisan lines to enact job reforms and tougher criminal laws. We must do the 
same to save California schools. It's the very least our children deserve.

FORSWEARING THE COMMONPLACE; EUPHEMISMS MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER, BUT HOW ABOUT A 
LITTLE IMAGINATION IN OUR VITUPERATION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JENIJOY La BELLE, Jenijoy La Belle is a professor of literature at Caltech 
and author of Herself Beheld: The Literature of the Looking Glass (Cornell 
University Press, 1988).

<P>
 I'm no good at swearing. My parents sorely neglected my education in 
profanity. My mother's strongest oaths were "phooey" and, when extremely vexed, 
"Oh, for heaven's sake." About once a year, my father would accidentally bang 
his thumb with a hammer and repeatedly take God's name in vain, but that was as 
bad as he got. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst cursing I heard in my childhood was from our dentist. He had been in 
the army for years, and the air turned blue while he worked on his patients' 
teeth. I didn't pick up any of his vocabulary, however, and thought that the 
invective was just part of the whole awful experience, like the shots and the 
drill and the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned early that language could be dangerous. A boy was kicked out of my 
kindergarten class for uttering a naughty word. Try as I might, I could never 
find out what the word was. I thus spent my preschool years in terror that it 
would one day drop randomly from my lips. I feared becoming the girl in the 
fairy tale whose mouth spewed vipers and toads and who finally crawled to a 
corner of the forest to die. 
</P>
<P>
 In grade school, foul language was forbidden. By then, I knew at least some of 
the words I wasn't supposed to say. Occasionally, boys caught swearing were 
hauled away by a male teacher to have their mouths washed out with soap. I 
didn't believe that scrubbing an offending tongue would cleanse the mind, but I 
kept my thoughts to myself. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, the seventh- and eighth-grade girls were assembled. Rumor had 
it that one of us had been overheard saying "damn" in the schoolyard. The 
principal lectured us for more than an hour, warning that we would never grow 
up to be ladies if we spoke such blasphemies. I asked if it was acceptable to 
say "darn" or "doggone" and was told that such words, although less offensive, 
were still unladylike. This answer troubled me. I didn't wish to "talk dirty," 
but I liked the idea of euphemistic remodeling. My mother had told me it was 
all right to say "H-E-double toothpicks" in place of "hell." If utterance and 
not thought was the issue, then substitutes provided a clever escape from 
censure. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I finished college, the '60s had started. In language, all 
you-know-what broke loose and has never frozen over. It was as if much of the 
country's population had suddenly been struck with Tourette's Syndrome, the 
rare affliction that forces its victims to cuss compulsively. And it was not 
just men who began punctuating every other sentence with expletives; women, 
too, began to swear like stevedores. Phrases once seen only on the walls of 
public bathrooms were heard everywhere. The world was made safe for linguistic 
democracy.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late for me. I couldn't bring myself to say aloud the classic 
Anglo-Saxon obscenities. I couldn't even mutter them under my breath or write 
them on the roof of my mouth with my tongue. To express intense feelings, I 
said things like "aw, shoot!" and "oh, fudge!" Why should a couple of vowels or 
consonants mark the boundary between propriety and impropriety? Sometimes, 
small things can make a big difference in how we create our social selves. 
</P>
<P>
 My inability to be a successful swearer may be a symptom of a larger cultural 
issue. All too frequently, profanity seems anti-female in its uses and 
intentions. I'm probably not the only woman who feels I'm borrowing a 
masculinist mode if I rail at someone. Profanity, as it is now practiced, 
cannot give me authority in my own voice as a woman. It's hard to imagine what 
a feminist way of swearing would be, but perhaps someday our own expletives of 
empowerment will evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not against the concept of swearing. As Mark Twain said, "Under certain 
circumstances, profanity provides a relief denied even to prayer." But I'm 
bored with the commonness of today's curses. Almost everyone shouts the same 
no-longer-shocking insults, slings the same spray-paint slurs. When you see 
someone lean out of a car and start yelling at another driver, you can fill in 
the blankety-blanks yourself. Vituperation has a role to play in our daily 
frustrations, but a little bleeping creativity couldn't hurt.

Shepard, offering help.

 "Turns out they were twin brothers from New Jersey. One of them (it was either 
Glen or Gary) had done a Mr. Goodwrench commercial. Is it reverse method-acting

the tire in two minutes flat, then sped away just as quickly as they'd

 * Re "Symbols of the Slaughter," Sept. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm confused. Do these people want to make a message about crime control or 
gun control? Ruthless murderers killed their loved ones, and they focus their 
hate on guns? 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals can buy their guns on the streets through the black market. All the 
gun legislation in the world won't stop them -- look at the drug problem. If 
you want to make a dent in crime and affect these murderers, insist they serve 
their full sentences and support legislation that focuses on them specifically. 
The average gun owner is sick of receivingthe hate that we don't deserve. Don't 
let the deviants and few irresponsible adults set the standard for judgment 
when it comes to gun ownership. They are a small minority, and can be handled 
appropriately.

 Re "Statewide Crime Rate Is Down in First Half of '94," Aug. 31: 
</P>
<P>
 Your article gives only percentages, but the raw data is very sobering indeed: 
statewide/countywide homicides down from 1,425 to 1,262, and 263 to 186; rape 
from 3,733 to 3,440 and 495 to 443; robbery from 45,536 to 40,313 and 9,196 to 
7,282; aggravated assault from 65,433 to 62,013 and 11,799 to 9,989; auto theft 
from 104,411 to 97,178 and 16,016 to 13,722; burglary from 125,366 to 115,213 
and 12,890 to 10,879. This is good news? 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that the overall crime rate is still three times what it was when 
we 40-somethings were growing up. Your article is a good example of how even 
horrifying statistics can be made to look pretty good. Please report the whole 
story in the future.

COMMENTARY; BRINGING CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS INTO THE 21ST CENTURY; THE TIMES 
INVITED GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES PETE WILSON, REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT, AND 
KATHLEEN BROWN, DEMOCRAT, TO DISCUSS ISSUES IN THE 1994 ELECTION. TODAY THE 
FOCUS IS ON EDUCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN BROWN, Kathleen Brown is the state Treasurer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time not long ago when California's schools were the envy of the 
nation, when businesses located here because we were the proving ground of the 
future, when families trusted the public schools with their dreams for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all that has changed. Every day, an estimated 10,000 California 
students bring weapons to school. Our classrooms are the most crowded in the 
nation. There are fewer computers per student in California than in any other 
state. Three-quarters of California's business leaders say job applicants 
aren't well-educated. 
</P>
<P>
 To compete in the 21st Century, California's 5.2 million school children need 
real intellectual and problem-solving tools. But because of Gov. Pete Wilson's 
failed leadership, too many of our children are not getting those tools. Four 
years ago, Wilson promised to be the "education governor." But just when 
California's kids needed Wilson most, the "education governor" broke his word. 
</P>
<P>
 After raising taxes $7 billion and giving tax breaks to the wealthy, Wilson 
tried to delay 110,000 children from starting kindergarten on time to balance 
his budget. Instead of taking immediate action for California's children, 
Wilson waited 1,029 days into his term to hire a Colorado-based consultant to 
study -- not to solve -- California's education problems. Instead of fighting 
for education dollars, Wilson tried to slash school funding by $2.3 billion. 
While Wilson claims that he increased K-12 spending, he doesn't add that he 
fought education increases every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 California's education decline could and should have been stopped -- if we had 
a governor with vision. As a mother and grandmother, education has always been 
important to me. As a member of the L.A. Board of Education, I fought for 
quality education, safer schools, increased parental involvement and cutting 
the bureaucratic fat. I led the campaign to eliminate taxpayer-financed, 
chauffeur-driven cars for school board members. I wrote a motion to cap 
administrative spending by the school district. And I worked to increase 
parental responsibility, writing and passing a measure encouraging parents and 
teachers to cooperate in promoting homework. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a plan to restore the promise of quality education for California's 
middle-class families. The following six steps are my road map to that goal: 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop a K-12 master plan. While California has 7,666 schools and spends 
more than $24 billion a year on education, we have no blueprint for the future. 
As governor, I will develop a comprehensive plan that sets meaningful goals and 
rigorous standards.  
</P>
<P>
 * Invest in education for a prosperous future. California's middle-class 
families supported Proposition 98 guaranteeing a base level of funding for 
education. Under Wilson, that floor level has become the ceiling. Schools and 
families have shouldered too much of the pain from Wilson's budgetary 
mismanagement. I will fight to protect K-12 funding. My economic strategy will 
bring job growth and recovery, creating additional tax revenues for our 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepare students for work. More than half of California's new job applicants 
lack adequate reading and math skills. I propose establishing a "JobReady" 
program in every high school to allow students to choose work-preparation 
classes, a traditional college-prep curriculum or a combination.  
</P>
<P>
 * Create "learning zones" of safe, drug-free schools. Students can't learn 
when they fear for their lives. Gang violence like the recent tragic shooting 
of 16-year-old Rolando Ruiz at Hollywood High School must be stopped. I propose 
sending students caught with guns to special boot-camp schools and increasing 
campus security equipment. We need to fully fund anti-drug education programs 
like DARE and SANE and provide after-school programs as alternatives to gangs, 
guns and graffiti. And it shouldn't have taken four years to pass tougher laws 
against carrying guns within 1,000 feet of a school.  
</P>
<P>
 * Cut administrative spending. Something is wrong when so many teachers pay 
for students' supplies out of their own pockets. I propose cutting the 
bureaucracy by 13% and redirecting $411 million into the classroom.  
</P>
<P>
 * Empower communities by restoring local control. California's schools must be 
put back in the hands of teachers, administrators, parents and communities. I 
support public-school choice, charter schools for excellence and creating 
voluntary education contracts to increase parental involvement.  
</P>
<P>
 We are headed into a new era being shaped by technology and global 
competition. Unless we radically change the way we educate our kids, they 
cannot hope to compete. California cannot afford to trade education for 
short-term budget tricks and political expediency. California cannot afford to 
break the promise of a bright future for our kids.

SOCCER; FRENCH UNVEIL '98 WORLD CUP LOGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two months after World Cup '94 ended in the Rose Bowl, French organizers 
unveiled the logo for soccer's 1998 World Cup to be held in their country. 
"It's our calling card . . . our trademark for four years," said Michel 
Platini, a former French national team captain and coach.

KARPOV EXCELS; DUCKS LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is more than one rookie on the Mighty Ducks who waited to sign until 
after playing in the Olympics at Lillehammer, but Valeri Karpov is not going to 
command as much attention as Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the right wing is having an outstanding exhibition season, and has 
stepped onto the first line with Kariya and Anatoli Semenov.Karpov, 23, the 
Ducks' third-round pick in the 1993 draft, kept it up, scoring his second goal 
in four exhibition games as the Ducks lost to Boston, 3-2, before 16,368 
Tuesday at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, who has four points in four exhibitions, assisted on Karpov's goal and 
created two late scoring chances as the Ducks tried to tie the score after John 
Gruden gave Boston the lead at 18:32 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, saying goodby to Boston Garden after this season, probably felt at 
home when the arena lights went out because of a power failure with 3:12 left 
in the first period, halting action in mid-play. The teams left the ice early 
for the first intermission, tacking the extra minutes onto the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 2-0, in the first after a goal by center Bob Corkum, assisted 
by Tim Sweeney. But Boston -- whose lineup didn't include Cam Neely, Adam Oates 
or Ray Bourque, who are on the trip but were scratched -- tied the score with a 
second-period goal by Jozef Stumpel and a third-period goal by Don Sweeney.

 The next time Ted Gluck plays at the South Course at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, 
he is going to give the cliff on the fourth hole a wide berth.  
</P>
<P>
 Gluck, 74, was playing there Friday when his electric pull cart got away from 
him. It teetered on the edge of a cliff, and Gluck rescued his golf bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the cart went over the cliff and Gluck followed, a drop of 20-30 feet. 
He was rescued by a helicopter with a stretcher and suffered only minor 
injuries.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The major college football championship should be decided by a playoff. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This is a recording. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But the need for such a tournament seldom has been as evident as this season. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than the usual number of legitimate national title candidates. 
I count seven. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In alphabetical order, they are Colorado, Florida, Florida State, Miami, 
Michigan, Nebraska and Penn State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 While compiling an 18-0 record, the Splendid Seven has outscored opponents, 
866-244. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The good thing is that there will be five regular-season games between 
Splendid Seven members. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, it will be Colorado at Michigan. Oct. 8: Florida State at Miami. 
Oct. 15: Penn State at Michigan. Oct. 29: Colorado at Nebraska. Nov. 26: 
Florida at Florida State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That will help to untangle the situation, but won't settle it. The bowls 
probably won't either. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I believe that Penn State, wearing its throwback uniforms, is the finest team 
in the land. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is a longshot that the Nittany Lions will be involved in a No. 1 
vs. 2 showdown at the Rose Bowl, where the Big Ten champion plays. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Arizona of the Pacific 10 Conference is unbeaten, but the Wildcats don't have 
the firepower to stay that way the rest of the season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The alliance bowl system that will put the two highest ranked teams outside 
the Big Ten and Pac-10 in the Fiesta Bowl doesn't begin until next season. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope ABC feeds us some highlights from one of its regional telecasts, Alcorn 
vs.Sam Houston State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn quarterback Steve (Air) McNair is putting up remarkable numbers, has 
caught the eyes of NFL scouts and will get some Heisman Trophy votes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't believe a Division I-AA performer should win the Heisman say 
that would be like giving the National League most valuable player award to 
Albuquerque Duke slugger Billy Ashley. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, McNair is more deserving of Heisman consideration than was the 
third-place finisher in 1987, Gordie Lockbaum of Holy Cross. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The pros and cons of a bye week are debatable, but USC should benefit from 
getting an extra week's rest between the beating it took at Penn State and the 
game against Baylor on Saturday night at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's opponent Saturday at the Rose Bowl, Washington State, is one of only 
two unbeaten and untied teams in the Pac-10. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Things have gone from mediocre to worse for former Notre Dame Coach Gerry 
Faust, whose Akron Zips have been outscored in three games, 109-23, and ended 
Kent's 17-game losing streak last Saturday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Scott Mitchell and Phil Mickelson. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I know you're very busy," said ESPN reporter Pam Oliver, cutting off an 
interview with owner Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys an hour before kickoff 
against the Detroit Lions on Monday. Oliver should have known that Jones is 
never too busy to be interviewed on TV. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Lions deserved to win, but nearly were deprived of the upset because of 
poor clock management in the final minute of regulation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is amazing how often pro and college coaches mishandle timeouts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The oldest living former NFL player is Arda Bowser, 93, who was a back for the 
Canton Bulldogs and Cleveland Indians in 1922-23. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 According to a Money magazine survey, a ticket to a Cowboy game at Texas 
Stadium is the best buy in the NFL, NBA or major league baseball and a ticket 
to a New York Knick game at Madison Square Garden the worst. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If first-round draft choice Jamie Storr isn't going to play goal for the Kings 
at least 20 times this season, they should send him to the minor leagues. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park officials believe the track's new casino helped to generate 
record handle and attendance figures for the track's telecasts of the Del Mar 
races. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Garza, the 34-year-old former World Boxing Council super-bantamweight 
champion from Tarzana, is scheduled to fight for the first time since 1989 
Saturday night at the Grand Olympic when he faces Antonio Hernandez on a card 
featuring unbeaten Oxnard featherweight Roberto Garcia against Bobby Brewer. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Newly crowned WBC junior-lightweight champion Gabriel Ruelas will conduct a 
question-and-answer session with fans and sign autographs before the show from 
6 to 6:30 p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Great timing: Two days after the rest of the baseball schedule was canceled, 
the Colorado Rockies announced that they were raising ticket prices for next 
season.

PACIFIC 10 FOOTBALL / DAN HAFNER; STANFORD SHOULD PROVIDE TEST FOR ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From day one, this has been a big year for Arizona football. Beginning with a 
resounding 29-0 victory over powerful Miami in the Fiesta Bowl, everything good 
has happened to the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 That surprisingly easy victory over a national power thrust Arizona football 
into prominence for about the first time. The only Pacific 10 Conference team 
that hasn't played in the Rose Bowl is now the favorite to win the conference 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hasn't just been something good for our football program, it has given a 
big lift to the entire state," Coach Dick Tomey said. "You can see the pride in 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the biggest problem Tomey had before the season was to get his 
players' minds on football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to keep reminding them that all we have accomplished won't mean a thing 
unless we again prove ourselves on the football field," Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if there was a problem, the Georgia Tech game took care of it. We played 
pretty well, but we kept making mistakes and made it difficult to win. It 
showed us everyone wanted to beat us. It turned out to be a good opener." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats followed the tough comeback victory over Georgia Tech with an 
impressive romp over New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 They figure to get their first real test Saturday when they go visit 
high-scoring Stanford. After a tie with Northwestern, Stanford was impressive 
last week against San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a matchup of the best offense, Stanford's, and the best defense, 
Arizona's, in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in a disappointing season for Coach Bill Walsh, the Cardinal had no 
defense, almost no running attack, and a tremendous quarterback in Steve 
Stenstrom. Stenstrom is back, better than ever, the running attack is much 
improved and the defense is coming along. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very promising young team," Walsh said. "I am excited about the 
future. I'm just not sure if we are ready for a team as good as Arizona yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Mike Mitchell is much improved over last year, the sophomore tailback 
has never seen anything like the Arizona defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford used the romp over San Jose State to build on the running game. In an 
unusual turn for Stanford, Stenstrom didn't throw his first pass until the 18th 
minute of the game. Mitchell carried 21 times for 179 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to run," Walsh said. "But we know if we have a chance to win, it 
will be Stenstrom's passing." 
</P>
<P>
 Until well into 1993, Arizona was known strictly for its defense. But Danny 
White began to improve and the Wildcats developed a strong running game. In 
their last six games, the Wildcats have averaged 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can no longer treat them as a defensive team," Walsh said. "White has 
improved and they have fine runners. This is a tough team." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomey says that Arizona, the only Pac-10 team ranked in the top 10, hasn't 
given a good effort yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think either of the teams we beat are in the class with Stanford," he 
said. "Last year Stanford was down, but it gave us a major scare. We know 
better than to underestimate Bill Walsh." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats are No. 8 in both national polls, but they made a big impression 
on New Mexico State Coach Jim Hess. His Aggies played No. 1 Florida and Arizona 
on successive Saturdays, losing to Florida, 70-21, and to Arizona, 44-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to compare the two teams, Hess said, "I really like the Arizona defense. 
Defensively, there's no question who's better. But both teams moved the ball so 
well, how could you tell on offense?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tomey acknowledges concern with one part of his defense. In recent years, the 
Wildcat defense caused many turnovers. In the first two games, the defense has 
caused none. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's quibbling," Tomey said. "I like this team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early season disappointments abound in the conference. When Arizona State and 
California play Saturday, one of them figures to be back on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears, boasting a top quarterback in Dave Barr, were stunned by San Diego 
State and Hawaii in their first two games after being touted as a candidate for 
the Rose Bowl. They need to open Pac-10 play with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils are 1-2. They opened with a victory over Oregon State. After 
the expected loss to Miami, they played host to Louisville last week. The 
Cardinals tried to give it away with five turnovers and penalties totaling 161 
yards. Yet, Louisville won, 25-22, on a late field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils should be primed for a major effort, because it will mark the 
return to Strawberry Canyon of Coach Bruce Snyder, who left the Bears to go to 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon Kaufman takes his Heisman Trophy run into Miami when Washington takes 
on the Hurricanes on Saturday. He needs another outstanding game to remain a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami is a solid favorite, having routed Arizona State two weeks ago. But the 
Huskies, who beat ranked Ohio State, could provide a tight game, especially if 
quarterback Damon Huard plays as he did against the Buckeyes. When Huard is 
passing well, it makes it much tougher to defend against Kaufman, who has 
gained 363 yards in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami and Washington shared the 1991 national championship, but this is their 
first meeting.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; FIEN MAKES THE MOST OF OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It had been a long time for Ryan Fien, who was plenty nervous Saturday when he 
came on the field to play quarterback at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 He acclimated quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were mixed feelings," he said of entering the game when starter Wayne 
Cook was shaken up. "I just wanted to hit my first pass to calm down." 
</P>
<P>
 And he did, finding Derek Ayers for nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fien played in two games two seasons ago as a freshman after Cook and Rob 
Walker were injured. He was in for only one play -- an incomplete pass against 
California -- last season after Cook came back to claim the starting job in 
competition with Walker and Fien. 
</P>
<P>
 Fien is listed as the No. 2 quarterback on the depth chart and that status has 
made him more cognizant of players with similar status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Brent Brennan, Derek Ayers and Avery Anderson -- my guys -- that I 
would take care of them," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fien completed six of seven passes for 85 yards and led the Bruins on their 
final touchdown drive. Two of his completions were to Ayers for 17 yards, one 
to Anderson -- who dropped another -- for 14 yards and one to Brennan for 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayers and Brennan had never caught a college pass and Anderson had caught only 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The defense of Washington State, which UCLA faces Saturday at the Rose Bowl, 
has not given up a touchdown in 10 quarters, dating to last season. . . . 
Reserve lineman Mike Rohme worked overtime Tuesday on pass blocking against 
nose guard George Kase. Rohme might get playing time Saturday at left guard 
because James Christensen has a knee injury suffered at Nebraska. Kase wanted 
the extra work after struggling -- as did most of his teammates -- in the 49-21 
loss at Nebraska. . . . UCLA will have played four games before school starts.

 USC starting wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson has practiced this week and seems 
recovered from a two-week-old quadriceps bruise that kept him out of the Penn 
State game. Coach John Robinson said Johnson should be available for the Baylor 
game Saturday night at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 However, another wide receiver, Ed Hervey, still is sidelined because of a 
knee injury and won't play Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Leonard Green, who seemed recovered last week from a hamstring pull, 
suffered re-injury last Thursday and hasn't practiced since. Freshman tailback 
Delon Washington has a groin pull and hasn't practiced at full speed this week. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The ankle sprain suffered in practice last Wednesday by senior starting 
defensive end Elic Mahone is more serious than first thought. The sprain is 
high on the right ankle, a type that often is slow to heal. He probably won't 
play against Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Rob Johnson, with a sore lower back, was held out of last week's 
workouts but seems fit this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Donn Cunnigan has a knee injury and won't play Saturday. Tight end 
John Allred has a sprained ankle and Robinson isn't sure if he will play 
against Baylor. 
</P>

 Kickoff for the Oct. 1 USC-Oregon game at the Coliseum has been set back from 
12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. to accommodate television. And kickoff for the 
USC-Baylor game Saturday at the Coliseum was changed last week, from 12:30 p.m. 
to 7 p.m.

 Little-used Terry Barnum will start at fullback for the Trojans on Saturday, 
Robinson said Tuesday. A junior from Chatsworth, Barnum was moved from the 
secondary to offense last spring. EARL GUSTKEY

 The NCAA will notify Alabama by Thursday of whether it plans to charge the 
school with rules violations, clear it of wrongdoing or continue a year-long 
investigation, the association's enforcement director said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Berst said all three options are open to the NCAA, which began 
investigating the Crimson Tide program after former football player Gene Jelks 
claimed he received money and other benefits.

 The University of Mississippi has acknowledged more than half of the 15 NCAA 
allegations against the Rebels' football program. In documents made public 
Tuesday, the NCAA dropped two of the allegations. Ole Miss officials will go 
before the NCAA's Committee on Infractions on Sept. 30.

 Pittsburgh tailback Curtis Martin's sprained right ankle isn't showing much 
improvement, and Coach Johnny Majors isn't optimistic he will play Saturday 
against Boston College. "He's very, very doubtful," Majors said. Martin was the 
leading rusher in NCAA Division I-A after gaining 251 yards in Pitt's opener 
against Texas. But he suffered the sprain in the second quarter against Ohio 
University the next week and hasn't played since. . . . A new award, the Eddie 
Robinson Trophy, will be given to the top football player from a black college 
each year. The trophy is named for the Grambling coach who has won more games 
than anyone else in college football history. "When I found out there would be 
an Eddie Robinson trophy, I cried," he said.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: CATCHING TWO-TON GREAT WHITE SHARK PRODUCES NET 
LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Joe Caruso's jaw dropped when he saw the size of the fish sticking out of his 
net last Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Entangled in the San Pedro fisherman's monofilament net was a great white 
shark measuring nearly 16 feet and weighing more than 4,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had a huge liver," said Jeff Seigel, collection manager of the fishes 
section for the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. "The part we 
could get out of him weighed 1,089 pounds and I would estimate its total weight 
at about 1,200 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Seigel studied the shark this week and said it had eaten at least one 
165-pound sea lion -- the remains of another were also found -- and a six-foot 
six-gill shark when it found its way into Caruso's gill-net, apparently going 
after Seigel's swordfish catch. The $16,000 net was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The shark was caught about 15 miles off the coast of Santa Monica late 
Saturday night and was towed into Los Angeles Harbor early Sunday morning. 
Experts say it was not unusual for the shark to be where it was and that there 
could be others of similar size in the same area, but they stressed that the 
sharks pose little or no threat to swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to be swimming out there in the channel to be in any danger," 
Seigel said. "And you'd be pretty stupid to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seigel said it was a shame that such a magnificent creature had to die, but 
not everyone was sad to see the shark go. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso was reportedly out fishing on Tuesday and couldn't be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Great whites are almost exclusively pinniped eaters and sea lions are their 
chief source of food. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the presence of a great white off the Southern California coast is 
not considered unusual, that of tiger sharks is. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the tiger sharks -- a tropical and sub-tropical species that grows 
to about 25 feet -- was caught Sunday afternoon at the end of the Manhattan 
Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Rosolino of Sunland reeled in a three-foot baby that inhaled a chunk of 
bonito -- and a museum biologist who happened to be taking a walk on the pier 
identified it as a tiger. Although a three-footer, despite Rosolino's claim 
that "you can definitely see all its teeth," is no man-eater, there might be 
some reason for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The shark could be as young as two weeks old and there is a chance that its 
mother is still swimming local waters. Unlike great whites, tiger sharks 
sometimes feed in shallow water and have been known to attack swimmers and 
surfers. Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- Among the top catches out of the Cabo San Lucas region was a 
228-pound yellowfin tuna landed by an angler aboard a panga . David Pinto, 46, 
of Ventura said the only reason he was able to land the fish was because it was 
choking on the huge lure he was trolling and unable to put up much of a fight. 
"It had the lure lodged in its throat," Pinto said. Still, the fight, on 
80-pound test line, lasted 1 hour 15 minutes and it took Pinto, his partner and 
the captain to haul the fish aboard the boat. Rick Ruddock of La Habra was able 
to land a 350-pound blue marlin aboard a panga and Dave McCoe of Long Beach 
boated a 456-pound black aboard the cruiser Karina.  
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- The best way to avoid becoming a shooting victim this season? Wear 
blaze orange. "That color is especially important in upland bird hunting, when 
in the excitement of a covey flush your partner gets disoriented and swings his 
shotgun your way," DFG Director Boyd Gibbons said. "Blaze orange reminds 
everyone where you are." Blaze orange was not worn in 86% of 13 reported 
two-party accidents in 1993. . . . The Newport Beach chapter of Ducks 
Unlimited, which has generated hundreds of thousands of dollars for 
conservation projects, will hold its 25th annual fund-raising dinner Sept. 29 
at the Balboa Bay Club. Donation is $75. Details: (714) 833-8084. . . . The 
1994 California Regulations for Hunting and Other Public Uses on State and 
Federal Areas, a booklet designed to provide hunters with detailed information 
on the state's various wildlife areas, is now available at DFG offices and 
sporting goods stores. 
</P>
<P>
 POACHING -- Two Huntington Beach men have been charged with illegally taking 
abalone and lobster aboard the private yacht Shamrock V. Department of Fish and 
Game wardens earlier this month confiscated 90 spiny lobster tails -- from 
animals taken illegally and out of season -- and 26 abalone, 14 of which were 
taken illegally after the divers had reportedly filled their limits. There were 
spear holes in several of the lobsters, which are catchable only by hand during 
the sport season, which opens Oct. 1. The arrest was made as the boat entered 
L.A. Harbor after a trip to San Clemente Island. Thomas E. Ferguson, 47, and 
Jeffrey Croswell, 32, face multiple counts for violating California's Fish and 
Game Code. All are misdemeanors punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine and six 
months in jail. . . . A Garden Grove man was ordered to pay $5,400 for poaching 
lobsters from commercial traps off Dana Point. Thanh Van Le, 22, was also 
banned from catching lobsters in California and put on three years' probation.

FISHING REPORT: IT'S A VERY COOL TIME TO GET TROUT IN SIERRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the most beautiful time of year in the Eastern Sierra, with trees in full 
bloom coloring the landscape in a various shades of yellow and red. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some, this is merely a bonus. After a fairly dormant summer, trout 
have responded to cooler temperatures throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Lake along the June Loop produced two of the best catches: a 4-pound 
8-ounce brown trout by Adam Vick of Fullerton and a 4-6 brown by John Johnson 
of Napa.

LOS ALAMITOS; AVISON LETS HALL LOOK TO THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Connie Hall, who has had many good horses in her career, is excited 
about her newest star, Avison, who ran a dead heat with Down With Debt for the 
victory in the $103,000 Vessels Maturity last Friday night at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hall, Avison is another in a long line of stakes winners, headed by the 
champions Chicks Beduino, Rambac and A Classic Dash, winner of the 1993 
All-American Futurity. But Hall says Avison is something special. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the most unique horse I've ever trained," she said. "He has so many 
quirks." 
</P>
<P>
 The gelding's favorite trick is trying to bite anyone who walks by his stall 
but on the racetrack, Avison is all business. Hall says that wasn't always the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 2-year-old, Avison was unruly and ill-mannered, and had the reputation of 
being a bad gate horse. Hall, however, seems to have found a way to calm him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dearly respect the horses," she said. "I think you need to give them all 
the opportunity to be a great horse, because some of them will surprise you." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and horses go way back. Growing up in Lakewood, she started riding when 
she was 6. After years of competing in the show ring and barrel racing, Hall 
was intrigued by racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You progress through things and explore different avenues," she said. "I was 
always drawn to the beauty of the racehorses. They're all muscle and desire." 
</P>
<P>
 Trading the politics of the show ring for the competition of racing, Hall 
started working for trainer Burt Montgomery in 1963. In racing, however, Hall 
was met with another attitude -- male chauvinism. When she applied for a 
groom's license, she was turned down on the basis of her sex. She finally was 
granted a license on her third try. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years later, Hall was ready to start training on her own. At the time, 
the trainer's test was given by fellow trainers. Hall, confident in her 
abilities, was surprised again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were more interested in what I didn't know than what I knew," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, she got her trainer's license, becoming one of the first 
women in the predominantly male field of quarter horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that has helped me in my career is that I have confidence 
in my ability with the horses," she said. "It isn't the acceptance of the other 
trainers that's important, it's your self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, her climb to the top hasn't been without consequences. Hall, who has 
two children, is three times divorced. Her long and often unusual working hours 
can easily undermine a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can do it all on my own," Hall said. "If (men) can't make my life more 
enjoyable, why do it? It takes a very liberal person to accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall seems to have found that person in Pat Ford. They have been engaged for 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Hall is often used as a role model for other women. She has been given 
a lifetime special-achievement award by the Women Behind Racing, and earned 
fame as the first woman trainer to win the All-American Futurity. A 
strong-willed individual, Hall never let gender become an issue in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it's all yours," she said of her success. "You just have to go get 
it, however you think you can." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Hall is going after the champion-aged-gelding award with Avison. 
The gelding, one of the first foals of the champion mare Florentine, has raced 
defending world champion and champion aged gelding Refrigerator twice this 
season, defeating him both times. 
</P>
<P>
 They first raced in the Go Man Go Handicap, when Avison finished a nose behind 
Down With Debt, with Refrigerator fourth. The contenders met again in the 
Vessels Maturity, when Down With Debt and Avison tied for first, Refrigerator 
running third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was saving him," Hall said of Avison. "In my mind, I always felt this horse 
was good enough to be in the Champion of Champions." 
</P>
<P>
 Avison will get his chance this year. Los Alamitos Note 
</P>
<P>
 Three-time distance champion Griswold won his first race of the year in the 
$20,000 Katella Handicap on Saturday night.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; OILER SAFETY MCDOWELL OUT SIX 
WEEKS

<P>
 Houston Oiler starting strong safety Bubba McDowell will have arthroscopic 
surgery on his left knee today and will be sidelined about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell was hurt in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 15-7 loss to the Buffalo 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be replaced in the Oilers' starting lineup by Blaine Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell became the Oiler starter during his rookie training camp in 1989 and 
has sat out only three games in his five-year career. He sat out the final two 
games last season because of a strained knee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Edgar Bennett, the Green Bay Packers' leading rusher and receiver, 
has a separated right shoulder that might sideline him for Sunday's game 
against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett was hurt in Sunday's loss to Philadelphia when he was slammed to the 
turf by Eagle linebacker Bryon Evans. He sat out the third quarter, but 
returned to action in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Cowboy special teams star Bill Bates, who also plays linebacker in pass 
defense coverages, suffered a broken left hand in Monday night's 20-17 overtime 
loss to the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates will wear a protective cast and is expected to play in two weeks against 
the Washington Redskins. The Cowboys are off Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Backup linebacker Eric Shaw was suspended by the Cincinnati Bengals for 
Sunday's game against the Oilers for conduct detrimental to the team, and it 
will cost him more than $10,000. Bengal General Manager Mike Brown said Shaw 
was stopped by Cincinnati police Saturday night or early Sunday morning for 
driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding. . . .The Redskins released 
backup fullback Cedric Smith and safety Sebastian Savage, and signed five-year 
veteran cornerback Alan Grant, waived by the Cincinnati Bengals. Wide receiver 
Leslie Shepherd, signed Sept. 5 and cut Sept. 16, was re-signed to the practice 
squad. The Redskins also promoted running back Tyrone Rush to the active roster 
from the practice squad. . . . San Diego Charger center Courtney Hall has a 
torn left biceps tendon, and his streak of 83 starts is in danger of being 
broken this Sunday.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON; WOMEN'S SOCCER MOVES TOWARD GREATER 
HEIGHTS

 Four pioneers stood on this barren land last season, dropped a ball on the 
untilled fields and began to play. 
</P>
<P>
 And slowly, as they stamped and clawed at the earth, they watched a sport 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's soccer has flowered in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, UCLA, Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount, each in its second season in NCAA 
Division I, have shouldered the weight that goes with cultivating new programs. 
It might take awhile for any of them to reach the level of perennial powerhouse 
North Carolina, but they are well on their way toward being competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fishery is a little bit fuller this year," said George Kuntz, 
Pepperdine's coach. "There are a lot more players in this program. A lot of the 
Los Angeles schools and women's programs, in general, have increased the level 
of play." 
</P>
<P>
 The four local teams are all operating on shoestrings, spreading four or five 
scholarships among many players. The best, fully-funded women's soccer programs 
offer 11 scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 And the local teams are young. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are overcoming these obstacles and improving quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (4-1-1) already has twice the number of victories it had last season, when 
it was 2-15-2. The Trojans have scored 16 goals, compared to 24 all of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This I consider our first year, because last year I was thrown in with a club 
program," USC Coach Karen Stanley said. "It's completely different. There's not 
even a comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley got 12 recruits to help fill out her roster this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the players who came here, I think one of their reasons for choosing 
it was because we were a new program and they knew they would play," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the reason most of the players have chosen to play at the local 
schools. It tends to make for eager, tenacious teams. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Pepperdine held ninth-ranked St. Mary's to a 2-2 tie last 
Sunday. Or, as Kuntz likes to say, "They tied us." 
</P>
<P>
 Making it all the more remarkable, Pepperdine (2-1-2) was without all three 
goalkeepers because of injury, so Kuntz used Sita Rampershad, a freshman 
defender, in goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, UCLA and Loyola Marymount also have challenged ranked opponents. 
UCLA (4-1-1) held No. 19 Washington State to a scoreless tie last Thursday in 
the first round of the New Mexico tournament, which the Bruins won. Loyola 
Marymount (1-3-1) defeated No. 14 Santa Clara this month, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, women's soccer has dug in its cleats in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a cultural melting pot? No need to go to New York, there's one 
right here, at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider part of the roster for the Trojan water polo team: Hrvoje Cizmic, 
Split, Croatia; Marko Zagar Zagreb, Croatia; Uzi Hadar, Kibbutz Giv'atayim, 
Israel; Ivan Hurtado, Madrid, Spain; Alfred Van Dorp, Leusden, the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the players took different routes to USC, which plays host to UCLA on 
Saturday at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't actually go out and recruit foreign players," said Coach John 
Williams. "(They) kind of came to us in an indirect manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Indirectly, via air mail. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Toring, one of two college water polo players who played with the U.S. 
national team at the World Championships in Rome this month, has returned to 
UCLA for his sophomore season. Toring had considerable playing time as a 
reserve at the World Championships, in which he scored eight goals in six games 
to help the United States to a sixth-place finish. Even without Toring, UCLA 
(7-2) is off to its best start since 1991 and finished fourth at the Southern 
California tournament. Toring attended his first UCLA practice of the season on 
Monday and played in his first game Tuesday, scoring twice in a 19-5 victory 
over Long Beach State. . . . Natalie Williams, a former UCLA two-sport star 
whose college career was cut short in March when she suffered a knee injury, 
had her first practice with the U.S. national women's volleyball team in San 
Diego on Monday. Williams was an All-American in volleyball and basketball. She 
was finishing her final season of eligibility when she tore her anterior 
cruciate ligament during a basketball game at Stanford. . . . The UCLA women's 
softball team suffered a loss when Kirk Walker, seven-year assistant, took a 
head coaching position at Oregon State this month. For Sue Enquist, UCLA 
co-coach, the parting is bittersweet: "Both (co-coach Sharron Backus) and I are 
really excited that he finally has the opportunity to prove to Division I 
softball what he is capable of doing," Enquist said. "Kirk has been such a 
great help to our program because he was such a hard worker."

 Declining issues crushed advancers 1,809 to 467 in a busy trading day on the 
New York Stock Exchange Tuesday after news of a surge in the nation's trade 
deficit triggered losses in all exchanges. Few stocks managed to buck the 
trend, with declining issues widely outnumbering advancers by about 15 to 4 on 
the New York Stock Exchange, where trading swelled to 325.89 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling intensified in the late afternoon and triggered restrictions on 
program trading by the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-chip stocks suffered their biggest setback in nearly six months as the 
news stirred up new inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average was off a steep 67.63 points to end at 
3,869.09. It was the largest one-day loss for the index since March 30, when it 
dropped 72.27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq index sank 9.98 points to 766.74. 
</P>
<P>
 News of a dramatic worsening in the country's merchandise trade deficit 
incited sell-offs in stocks and bonds right from the start of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 A related slump in the dollar against its foreign counterparts contributed to 
the jittery mood in the financial markets. The dollar neared its all-time low 
of 97.50 yen during trading, ending the day at 97.70. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 7.78% from 7.76% at Monday's 
close but at the height of the selling yields hit 7.79%, their highest level 
since June 24, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But while bonds and the dollar steadied after awhile, the retreat in stock 
prices persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Market analysts found it difficult to pinpoint a precise reason for Wall 
Street's gloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said the market was concerned that the strong domestic economy was 
drawing in costly imports due to the depressed dollar while exports were 
sagging, a situation that could provoke the inflation-fighting Federal Reserve 
Board to raise interest rates further. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chances of the Fed tightening sooner rather than later are growing, and I 
think that's bothering the market," said Thomas Kirkenmeier, vice president at 
Northern Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Johnson, chief market economist at First Albany Corp., said the 
widespread nature of the selloff was troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors may have begun to question whether the apparent slowdown in the 
economic expansion, as illustrated by the poor trade report, will make it 
harder for corporations to meet profit projections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The optimism about the economy and corporate earnings for the third quarter 
was shaken," Johnson said. "And, it was that optimism that had been driving the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Some said the market was ripe for a correction after climbing last week more 
than 58 points, partly on trading related to the expiration of options and 
futures. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had a lot of institutions with an itchy trigger finger," said Jay 
Ferguson, analyst at Ferguson, Andrews & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department report showed the deficit in goods and services rose 
21.6% to $10.99 billion in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpectedly large monthly trade gap raised long-simmering economic 
worries closer to the boiling point. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the dismal report was likely to keep the dollar under pressure 
could stoke inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising gold prices also fanned the inflation fears that surfaced last week 
after the government reported that American factories were operating at closer 
to full capacity. December gold gained $3.60 to $397.20 an ounce in heavy 
trading at the Commodity Exchange. The most-active contract peaked at $399.10, 
a three-month high and near the magical level of $400. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's setback had a negative impact on late European trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign markets also were coping with troubles of their own, which did 
nothing to improve the climate for U.S. stock traders. Shares lost ground in 
Frankfurt, London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the losers on the Dow were Du Pont Co., off 1 3/4 to 57 3/4, Sears, 
Roebuck, off 1 3/8 to 48 7/8, and American Express, down 1 3/8 to 29 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Buy Co., which retails consumer electronics and appliances, fell 3 5/8 to 
36 after its profits did not surpass analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse lost 7 1/2 to 15 3/4 after reporting a 
quarterly loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Musicland Stores issued a third-quarter profit warning and its shares sank 2 
1/8 to 15 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * One bright spot amid the market's gloom was Magma Power, which surged 7 1/4 
to 34 3/4 in active Nasdaq trading after the company said it would consider an 
unsolicited takeover offer from California Energy for $35 a share.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; STAR-CROSSED LOVERS FEED LINCOLN TRAGEDY; HENRY AND CLARA

 "Oh, my husband's blood!" cried Mary Todd Lincoln a moment after John Wilkes 
Booth fired his pistol into President Abraham Lincoln's skull. "My husband's 
blood!" 
</P>
<P>
 But the blood that Mrs. Lincoln beheld was not her husband's, as we learn in 
Thomas Mallon's novel, "Henry and Clara." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it belonged to Henry Rathbone, a handsome young Army officer who 
sustained a near-fatal knife wound as he grappled with Booth in the 
presidential box at Ford's Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 History has mostly overlooked the wounded officer, but Mallon rescues him from 
obscurity in a stately and elegant historical novel of classic proportions. As 
Mallon discovered -- and as he tells us in the pages of "Henry and Clara" -- 
the Lincolns shared the state box on that fateful night with Henry Rathbone and 
Clara Harris, a pair of step-siblings who turned out to be star-crossed lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry and Clara first encountered each other when Henry's mother and Clara's 
father, each newly widowed, married and brought together their adolescent 
children into an early 19th-Century version of the blended family. 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound like the familiar premise of more than a few TV sitcoms, but the 
secret courtship of the step-siblings in the Rathbone-Harris household more 
nearly resembles the story of "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 Clara is "streaked with some mischief," and Henry's darkly ironic wit "glows 
like foxfire in a forest," but their unlikely courtship forces them to contend 
with the disapproval of their families and the beau monde of power and 
privilege in which they have been raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, she would have her Lord Byron," Clara muses over Henry, "but might 
people now look at Henry as they had looked at the poet, whispering about what 
he'd done to his sister?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry and Clara" depicts a raw and roiling American aristocracy in which 
political connections were an important measure of social status. Indeed, 
"Henry and Clara" is rooted in both social and political history of the 
mid-19th Century, and politics seem to matter as much as sexual passion in the 
lives of these young lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians don't make anything," Henry complains to Clara about the lukewarm 
political ambitions of her father and the much hotter ones of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're wrong," Clara says. "They make history." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is history that animates "Henry and Clara" and everyone in the book. 
The looming shadow of the Civil War, the debate over slavery, the election of 
Lincoln and, finally, the war itself become a strange and deadly backdrop 
against which the more intimate encounters are played out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallon, for example, allows us to glimpse a sermon by the abolitionist 
preacher Henry Ward Beecher -- and we are invited to regard Beecher as both a 
pulpit vaudevillian and a moral huckster whose sermons were the equivalent of a 
movie date for Henry's and Clara's generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion was passion," Mallon writes, "and Beecher had it, a lust for drama 
and catastrophe and redemption that he might have satisfied equally as a stage 
tragedian." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Lincoln's presidential campaign turns into a vexing social problem for 
Clara's girlfriend Sybil, a belle whose Southern beau is a slaveholder. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that abolitionist wins, he's liable to spoil my whole wedding next May," 
pouts Sybil, only half in jest. "A lot of lovely slaves are even part of my 
dowry." 
</P>
<P>
 Mallon's book is smart and engaging, and he manages to bring his characters 
fully alive while never allowing us to forget that they are truly creatures of 
another era. He makes good use of letters written by the historical Henry and 
Clara, and he is so steeped in his source materials that his narrative 
sometimes takes on the grand and florid tones of 19th-Century prose. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incompleteness of the Capitol dome made the building feel like a crater," 
writes Mallon of the scene of the first Lincoln inaugural, "as if it were 
inviting the heavens to fling a lightning bolt at this rustic titan who dared 
to say he would hold together a continent so manifestly wanting to split 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln, of course, becomes the fateful figure in the lives of Henry and 
Clara. Thanks to Lincoln, the lightning bolt of history struck them too.  
</P>
<P>
 As Mallon eventually reveals, the wounds that Henry and Clara sustained went 
far deeper than the ones inflicted by Booth's knife -- and we watch as the 
story spirals downward into madness and much, much worse, as they are finally 
"crushed by all the hateful history (Henry) worshiped, and in which he'd been 
caught."

JURORS MAY NOT BE ANONYMOUS, JUDGE RULES; LAW: SUPERIOR COURT DECISION THROWS 
INTO DOUBT POLICIES IN DOWNEY AND BELLFLOWER THAT KEPT NAMES OF PANELISTS 
SECRET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that jurors' names must be made public in 
a lower-court case in Downey, throwing into question the controversial policies 
of judges who keep secret the names of jurors in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief order, Superior Court Judge Robert L. Roberson said that the 
presiding judge of Downey Municipal Court, John David Lord, must reveal the 
names of panelists in a trial set to begin Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County public defender's office had challenged the practice of 
keeping jurors' names secret -- adopted this year in municipal courts in Downey 
and Bellflower -- arguing that the practice could bias jurors against 
defendants by suggesting they are dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows judges to seal jurors' names at the end of a trial to 
minimize the possibility of harassment. In his order Tuesday, Roberson said 
that even if he assumed that law allowed such sealing of names at the beginning 
of trial, lawyers in the Downey case had not demonstrated a "compelling 
governmental interest" to justify such confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ruling applies only to the one case -- in which a man is accused 
of violating a court order -- it immediately prompted Lord and Philip K. 
Mautino, presiding judge of Los Cerritos Municipal Court, who oversees five 
courtrooms in Bellflower, to reconsider their use of anonymous juries in all 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "My procedure is exactly the same as the one used in Downey and now the court 
says the procedure is illegal," Mautino said. "If I continue to use it anyway, 
then we could find ourselves with every criminal conviction being reversed, and 
that would be an unconscionable result." 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino said he would study the decision to see if it might allow continued 
juror anonymity as long as a judge found a "compelling governmental interest" 
to justify it in each case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord said he will consult the county counsel's office, which defended both 
judges' right to use unidentified panels, to see whether a quick appeal can be 
made to the 2nd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Lord began keeping all jurors' names secret in his courtroom from 
the start of criminal trials, asserting that it was the only way to give jurors 
meaningful anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Mautino adopted the policy in all his courts in Bellflower. 
The use of anonymous juries there also sparked an appeal to Superior Court -- 
which acts as an appellate court for municipal court disputes -- but the 
Bellflower case that was appealed became moot when it was dismissed in the 
trial court for other reasons.

PROP. 187 COST TO L.A. SCHOOLS PUT AT $450 MILLION; EDUCATION: U.S. THREATENS 
TO WITHHOLD THE FUNDS, SAYING THE MEASURE WOULD VIOLATE PRIVACY LAWS. LOSS OF 
THE FUNDS WOULD PENALIZE ALL STUDENTS, BOARD PRESIDENT SAYS.

<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District could lose more than $450 million in 
federal funds -- almost 11% of its current budget -- if a controversial ballot 
measure barring undocumented students from attending public schools is approved 
in November, district officials and Board of Education members said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Proposition 187 could reduce the need for teachers and administrators 
by lowering enrollment, Board of Education President Mark Slavkin said the loss 
of federal funds would penalize all students and the district would be unable 
to provide many programs and classes now offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure on the Nov. 8 ballot would bar illegal immigrants from public 
schools in California and from non-emergency health care and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Education Secretary Richard W. Riley has said he will withhold federal 
funds to school districts if Proposition 187 is approved because the initiative 
would violate federal privacy regulations. Riley said the measure would require 
schools to disclose information from education records in violation of the 
federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles school district, the largest in the state, would lose more 
federal money than any other school system in California if Riley followed 
through on his edict. Of the district's $4.2-billion budget, $450.5 million 
comes from the federal government -- mainly for programs for disadvantaged 
students and bilingual education classes. Statewide, school districts could 
lose up to $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd lose a hell of a lot of money," said Bill Rivera, Los Angeles school 
district spokesman. "We'd lose a lot more revenue than we'd save." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Proposition 187 said Tuesday that courts would not allow the 
schools to ultimately lose federal funding and that the threats are being used 
to confuse the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no realistic chance that could happen," said Ron Prince, the Orange 
County-based campaign chairman. "We have to separate political rhetoric from 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funds that officials said they would lose are provided mainly for 
programs for disadvantaged students, nutrition programs and vocational 
education courses. Some of the federal money is in the form of grants for 
special programs at selected schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposition, districts next year would be required to verify 
students' legal residency or citizenship status. Students who are here 
illegally would be expelled from the school system. Within two years, schools 
also would be required to confirm the residency status of parents and 
guardians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be turning in students and their parents," Slavkin said. "In some 
areas of this district, this could have a very significant impact." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and Sheriff Sherman 
Block warned that Proposition 187, by barring thousands of students from the 
classroom, could spell trouble on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very obvious that youngsters not engaged in positive, constructive 
activity are prone to getting into mischief," Block said. "And youngsters who 
are on the street, unsupervised, are prone to victimization of various kinds." 
</P>
<P>
 "At a minimum, we will see a substantial increase in crime with those 
youngsters who are not permitted to go to school," Garcetti said. "The reason 
we work so hard at getting truants into school is we know that if they stay in 
school they are much, much less likely to be involved in crime and the criminal 
justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which contends it has no way of knowing how many students are 
undocumented, currently is barred from asking students to show proof of 
citizenship. Schools frequently check birth certificates to verify age but keep 
no records of students' birthplaces or immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 But some board members have estimated that the number of undocumented students 
could top 100,000. Total enrollment is about 640,000. A district survey taken 
last year found that 81,655 students are immigrants who have been in the United 
States for three years or less. Nearly 300,000 students in the district speak 
limited English, and school officials said American-born students -- and U.S. 
citizens -- are included in that group. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 5.2 million students statewide, the state Department of Education 
estimates that between 300,000 and 400,000 are undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin also predicted that the school board would join other groups in 
fighting the measure in court if it is approved, citing a 1982 U.S. Supreme 
Court decision that said illegal immigrant children are entitled to public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 While school board members said the absence of large numbers of undocumented 
children might save the district the cost of some teachers and classes, the 
savings would be more than offset by the cutoff of federal revenue. "It will be 
devastating," said board member Julie Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would cost the state $78 million to $104 million in the first year 
and $12 million to $19 million in future years to verify students' legal 
status, the state Department of Education said.

EXPRESSING OUTRAGE; ACTIVISTS CALL FOR TOUGH TREATMENT FOR YOUTHS ACCUSED OF 
TORTURING AND KILLING DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dorothy Davis was a lawyer for 40 years, but she seemed a little out of place 
in Compton Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The white-haired, soft-spoken Mission Viejo resident, who specialized in 
entertainment law, drove more than 35 miles to Compton's towering courthouse 
Tuesday to express outrage over the torture and fiery death of a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been able to sleep for a long time over this," Davis said outside a 
closed hearing for three teen-agers charged with torturing the Rottweiler mix 
for more than three hours on Aug. 31 in the Hyde Park area of South-Central Los 
Angeles, and eventually setting it on fire and killing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of abuse with children and animals," she said, "but this is 
the worst." Davis was joined by about 30 Southland animal rights activists, who 
milled quietly in the halls while a prosecutor argued that the two 16-year-olds 
charged with the dog's deathshould be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will continue Oct. 4, and the activists vowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animals don't have a voice that will get a response," said Claudia Ross of 
the Amanda Foundation, a Beverly Hills-based organization that rescues animals 
that are about to be euthanized. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the bureaucracy, there are groups looking out for children and battered 
human beings, and all those groups are important, but animals seem to come up 
pretty low on the scale," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the parents of the accused say police arrested the wrong youths. 
One woman said her son loves animals as much as the activists who call for his 
incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the youth has two dogs and grew up in a house full of cats and birds. 
"You teach them to love them," said the woman, who was incensed that the police 
had gone after her son. "I can't imagine who would do that," she said of the 
torture. "It's sick." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman and other parents said the true culprits are other teen-agers in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-olds, and a 15-year-old who is too young to be tried as an adult, 
were arrested after police got a call from a resident who said she saw six 
youths torturing a dog on a porch. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived, they saw a burning object hurtling toward their car, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Wright. Then they saw three teen-agers chase the 
burning dog, beating it to death with lead pipes. They pursued the youths and 
arrested them, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand the concern of the animal rights people," said attorney 
Elizabeth Wehrmeister, who represents the 16-year-old with the pet dogs. "I'm 
upset at what happened. I don't think I have run into anyone who isn't upset at 
what happened to this animal. The question is, do they have the right person?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wright says they do. "One of the officers smelled lighter fluid on one of (the 
youth's) hands," Wright said. "These are the right kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright added that police are trying to identify other suspects, and said he 
expects at least one more arrest. All face up to three years in either a 
juvenile hall or state penitentiary, and one of the 16-year-olds who Wright 
says is also facing unrelated robbery charges could serve up to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists hope the case will deter others from torturing animals, and say 
it is important to prosecute animal torturers because their next victims could 
be human. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you think these kids are going to be doing it to adults some day?" said 
Chris DeRose, president of Last Chance for Animals, a West Hollywood-based 
animal rights group. He and Wright noted that many serial killers, such as 
Jeffrey Dahmer and Richard Ramirez, tortured animals as youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your hard-core killers start by being cruel to animals," said Pat Peyovich, a 
member of Last Chance for Animals. "If a child has the right kind of 
environment, the right kind of training, their mind wouldn't let them do that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in a waiting area next to the courtroom where their children would 
soon appear, the grim-faced parents of the teen-agers repeated that they 
believed the police had knowingly arrested the wrong children.

DWP TO SETTLE HARASSMENT SUIT FOR $1.5 MILLION; WORKPLACE: PAYMENT TO WOMAN 
BECOMES EFFECTIVE TODAY UNLESS COUNCIL BLOCKS IT. AGENCY OFFICIALS ADMIT 
SERIOUS PROBLEM, SAYING FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEM FIRED AND 12 SUSPENDED.

<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has agreed to pay a Riverside 
County woman $1.5 million to settle a sexual harassment suit -- believed to be 
the largest settlement by a government agency in such a case in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, which will go into effect today unless the City Council blocks 
it, comes as a ranking DWP official acknowledged serious problems with sexual 
harassment in the ranks, with five employees fired for harassment in the last 
two years and 12 others suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is to be paid to Ruby P. Zilly, 32, who worked as a security 
officer for the DWP at its Downtown headquarters from 1989 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Superior Court suit she filed in November, Zilly alleged that she was 
physically and verbally harassed by men in the male-dominated, 96-member 
security unit and that DWP supervisors ignored her complaints and condoned 
odious acts by her co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more scared of the people I was working with than the people I was 
supposed to be protecting the city property from," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Zilly said she was pleased the suit had been 
resolved. But she said she felt the DWP had failed to take sufficient action to 
deal with a widespread problem of sexual harassment in the security unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly King, the DWP's director of human resources, acknowledged in an 
interview that sexual harassment is a significant problem at the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past two years, we had 98 incidents of sexual harassment that have 
come to our attention, from minor incidents that were resolved very quickly to 
major incidents that involved formal complaints," King said. "The results of 
those investigations are that five people have been terminated from employment 
with the DWP." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that 12 other DWP employees had received significant suspensions 
totaling 192 days stemming from sexual harassment in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 King said that among those who were fired for sexual harassment was one of 
Zilly's co-workers, Anthony (Tony) Carter. King said the firing stemmed from 
investigation of Zilly's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Zilly said in her suit that Carter initiated a series of assaults, batteries 
and other harassing acts against her, including "repeatedly grabbing Zilly, 
forcibly kissing her, forcing his tongue down her throat, throwing her against 
a wall, feeling her body and genital area with his hands, following her into 
the women's rest room and other conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times was unable to reach Carter for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 King also said that discipline "is under consideration" against other people 
whom Zilly complained about to DWP officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Zilly's suit described a number of other offensive actions directed toward 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in her employ, she said, one supervisor began to inquire about her 
drinking habits, invited her out on dates and insisted on questioning her 
regarding private sexual matters, "such as her sexual practices, sexual 
preferences and her choice of undergarments." This man, she said, also 
subjected her "to explicit descriptions of his own supposed sexual practices." 
</P>
<P>
 In her suit, filed by Brentwood attorneys Jeffrey S. Thomas and Samuel J. 
Wells, Zilly said she complained about this harassment to DWP security chief 
Thomas C. Gaines Sr. She said that Gaines, although acknowledging that he knew 
of the man's penchant for harassing female employees, failed to take any 
meaningful or effective action to stop the offensive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, who could not be reached for comment, is one of 10 DWP employees who 
was named as a defendant in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, another supervisor assigned Zilly, while pregnant, to 
surreptitiously monitor the activities of other supervisors who were suspected 
of failing to sign logs properly and "were not where they were supposed to be 
when they were supposed to be there, were coming and going as they pleased, 
etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Zilly viewed this assignment as an act of retaliation. "The assignment was a 
particularly high-risk undertaking, especially given her condition of being 
pregnant, as it required her to travel and work alone in an unmarked car 
without a radio in dangerous areas of South-Central Los Angeles," according to 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1990, Zilly gave birth to a son "after a difficult Cesarean birth, 
which temporarily left her incontinent," according to the suit. In addition, 
during her stay in the hospital, Zilly was sterilized without her consent. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned to work two months later, she met with three supervisors, 
including Gaines, and confided to them the facts of her incontinence and 
sterilization and asked that the information be treated confidentially. 
</P>
<P>
 But within two hours of that meeting, "male DWP security guards began taunting 
. . . Zilly with statements such as, 'Now we can get you because you can't get 
pregnant,' and further taunted her by calling her "pee-pee Zilly."  
</P>
<P>
 Zilly, who has three children, said she stayed on the job for almost 30 more 
months because she needed the money. Attorney Thomas said Zilly was "the 
primary breadwinner in her family," as her husband had only part-time work as 
an auto repairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept thinking of my children and how we needed the money" as she 
contemplated enduring nights of harassment on the graveyard shift, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the harassment did not stop and one incident in November, 1992, 
played a key role in Zilly's decision to leave the agency. DWP conducted a 
sexual harassment prevention class for some DWP employees, but "the instructors 
allowed the class to degenerate to a circus-like atmosphere, with many DWP 
employees loudly and openly making fun of the subject of sexual harassment and 
women in general," according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the class, Carter "folded up a piece of paper, put it over 
his thumb, pushed it upwards and looked at plaintiff Zilly, stating 'you're 
giving me a hard-on,' " according to the suit. Finally, in February, 1993, when 
it had become clear that DWP officials "would take no action to protect her, to 
stop the sexual harassment" or take any other action to stop the conduct of 
some of the male DWP security employees, she left the DWP, Zilly said.  
</P>
<P>
 She has been under a doctor's care since then for physical and emotional 
problems, according to the suit. In December, a Los Angeles Superior Court 
judge granted an injunction ordering Gaines and other DWP employees to cease 
threatening or harassing Zilly, her husband or her children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Water and Power Commissioners approved the settlement Sept. 8, 
according to Edward C. Farrell, the chief assistant city attorney for Water and 
Power. Abby Leibman, executive director of the California Women's Law Center, 
said this was the largest settlement she knew of in such a case against a 
governmental entity in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always wise to settle a case that can expose you to great damage," said 
Constance Rice, vice president of the DWP board. Rice said that the DWP had 
good policies on sexual harassment but did not have adequate mechanisms to 
enforce those policies. Rice said she and the other commissioners are 
determined to see that changes are made in DWP's work culture to eliminate the 
problems.

RECYCLED WATER FOR HOME LANDSCAPING OKD; CONSERVATION: L.A. CITY COUNCIL PASSES 
ORDINANCE TO ALLOW FILTRATION SYSTEMS. AIDE TO A DISSENTER PREDICTS 
'ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Angelenos will be permitted to use recycled water from their bathtubs, sinks 
and washing machines to water the family garden under an ordinance approved 
Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The residential "gray water" ordinance creates a strict set of guidelines for 
installing plumbing and filtration systems to process water for landscaping 
irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, the chief proponent of the measure, said that 
a test system installed at her Venice home has cut her water bills in half. 
"And now I don't even have to think about my trees," she added. "I just go out 
and pick the avocados." 
</P>
<P>
 Systems for home water recycling can cost from several hundred dollars to as 
much as $5,000. Proponents argue that the equipment quickly pays for itself in 
lower water bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter said the systems will also reduce water usage in the drought-prone 
city and help spur a new industry for designers and installers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in a desert, we cannot afford to use water only once," Galanter said, 
adding that water from Northern California and the Colorado River is becoming 
increasingly costly and scarce. "People who think we are going to be able to 
keep importing all our water are living in a time warp." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials have been trying to encourage water recycling for more 
than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Los Angeles pilot project, in which Galanter participated, that 
helped persuade the state that the systems could be operated without 
contaminating the soil or exposing people to germ-laden water. The project 
found that soil around the filtering systems was not contaminated. And people 
are not exposed to the reclaimed water, because it is typically distributed by 
underground drip irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The path for the city's legislation was cleared in the last year when the 
state Building Standards Commission added gray water systems to the Uniform 
Building Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday essentially agreed to impose the state code in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is convinced the gray water systems are a good idea. Councilman 
Hal Bernson cast the lone vote against the ordinance. Bernson deputy Francine 
Oschin said the law will lead to a proliferation of poorly installed and 
maintained filtration that will "send hair dye, bleach and detergents into our 
back yards." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the result will be an "environmental disaster."  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties all have ordinances 
permitting gray water systems. Santa Barbara County, where water shortages are 
the routine, even requires them for new homes on larger lots. The Los Angeles 
County law applies only in unincorporated areas. Many other communities, 
schools and other institutions use reclaimed water -- sewage that has been 
treated -- to water parks, golf courses and roadway landscaping.

COUNTY SYMPHONY MUSICIANS PROMISE NO STRIKE FOR 30 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Threatened with cancellation of their first concert, musicians with the 
Ventura County Symphony agreed on Tuesday not to strike for 30 days provided 
that contract talks with the orchestra's management continue in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Symphony President Felice Ginsberg called the announcement a breakthrough in 
what has been a virtual standoff since the two sides entered contract 
negotiations in mid-July. And she will recommend that the symphony's directors 
approve the 30-day agreement tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged," she said. "At least it gets us talking to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg also said the announcement means that the season's opening 
performance at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium will likely go on as planned. The 
symphony's directors last week threatened to cancel the Oct. 8 concert rather 
than risk a last-minute strike by players. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fate of the rest of the six-concert season remains in question, 
including the Oct. 26 performance during the opening of the Thousand Oaks Civic 
Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations had stalled in recent weeks and, after first threatening to hire 
strikebreakers, the symphony management gave musicians a Tuesday deadline to 
sign a no-strike agreement. Specifically, the symphony directors wanted the 
musicians to forgo any strike until after January, covering half of the season 
that runs through May. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the directors promised not to lock out any of its musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the musicians union countered with a proposal that would prohibit 
a strike only until Oct. 21, provided that the symphony hires the same 
musicians as last year and pays them the same wages. After that, either side 
could cancel the agreement with 24 hours notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we need to have that is that if the first concert comes and goes 
and we're in the same place where we are now . . . at some point we would have 
to re-evaluate the situation and decide how long we would continue to work 
under that agreement," said Lynn Johnson, a union negotiator for the American 
Federation of Musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg said she was uncomfortable with the 24-hour cancellation clause, but 
thinks enough progress can be made in the next month so that a strike will no 
longer be at issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thing it's very important to us to get our season going," Ginsberg said. "I 
don't think we're that far apart," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians are seeking a contract that would guarantee them tenure, the 
right to play in all symphony performances and a peer review system that would 
examine any dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians began seeking the contract -- the first in the community 
symphony's 30-year history -- last spring after complaints arose about how 
conductor Boris Brott hired and fired musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But symphony directors say they want the symphony to continue to improve. To 
do so, they believe it is important to preserve the conductor's artistic rights 
to assemble the best orchestra possible and introduce different kinds of music. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major difference centers on the symphony's "Music's Alive" series 
planned for the spring. Rather than using its own musicians, the symphony 
association plans to bring in outside groups, including the Kronos Quartet and 
the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Winds, for small performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the "Music's Alive" series should not be covered by the 
short-term agreement because it will not take place until the spring and 
because it remains an issue under dispute in the negotiations.

WETLANDS SAFE IN REVISED PLAN FOR ORMOND BEACH; DEVELOPMENT: ENVIRONMENTALISTS 
AND COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE IMPRESSED WITH THE SCALED-DOWN PROPOSAL. BUT PROPONENTS 
OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING ARE CONCERNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Architects unveiled a dramatically reduced plan for development at Oxnard's 
Ormond Beach on Tuesday that satisfied City Council members and disarmed 
environmental activists but worried proponents of low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's scaled-down development proposal for the 1,200-acre area includes 
high-rise beachfront condominiums, an aqua-farming parcel, a pier, marina and a 
theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new plan, requested by the City Council last year, would preserve -- 
possibly even expand -- a fragile wetlands area where several endangered 
species are flourishing, pleasing environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wonderful plan," said Jean Harris of the Ormond Beach Observers, an 
environmental watchdog group. "There are a lot of interesting ideas here." 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal, which would incorporate the wetlands by building a 27-hole 
golf course around them, even contains plans to restore once-pristine sections 
of the natural lagoon. It may also include a boardwalk where residents and 
scientists could examine the area's wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Two consultants helped Oxnard officials draw up their proposal, which also 
includes a school, park and hotel. Architect Norman Pfieffer of Hardy Holzman 
Pfieffer Associates, one of the two consulting firms, presented the project to 
the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're really talking about is a small community or village," Pfieffer 
said. "What this does is present a land use like the golf course . . . so that 
the wetlands can be protected as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan does not state how much housing would be built, but city officials 
are expected to allow 3,000 to 4,000 residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard leaders initially had grandiose ideas for Ormond Beach: a 7,000-seat 
amphitheater, an aquarium and even a 700-acre amusement park similar to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the Baldwin Co., a developer that owns a portion of the 1,200-acre plot, 
had a different idea early on: 10,000 residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have amended their plans in the past two years, with Baldwin seeking 
fewer residences and the city deciding on a less-extravagant entertainment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest proposal comes after the Oxnard City Council asked city staff 
members last year to devise a proposal for the beach that contained a major 
tourist draw and took into account the area's fragile wetlands, Oxnard 
Community Development Director Richard Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that while this is not what I consider an ideal plan, it is a large 
step forward," Councilman Michael Plisky said. "This sort of got out of control 
and became a large housing project, but now it looks like it is back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky said Oxnard lacks recreational projects and high-priced estates, and 
Ormond Beach is the perfect place in which to build them, because of its 
coastal access. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eileen McCarthy of California Rural Legal Assistance, a legal advocacy 
group, told the council that affordable housing for Oxnard's poor is what the 
city truly needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the largest, if not the largest, housing developments in Oxnard 
in the next 20 years, and there is no specific provision for affordable housing 
in this plan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy said the plan is not in compliance with state affordable housing 
mandates, though it meets the standards of Oxnard's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit by California Rural Legal Assistance and Channel Counties Legal 
Services Assn., which contends that the city's general plan does not include 
enough low-cost housing, is now in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Co. also unveiled a revised plan that includes 5,398 residences, 
along with a hotel, an 18-hole golf course and a shopping center. 
Representatives said they had not seen Oxnard's new plan and were taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little confused, frankly, about the whole process," said Louis 
Malone, president of the Baldwin Co.'s Los Angeles and Ventura County division, 
speaking before the council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Holden said he understands Malone's worries, but the City 
Council is more concerned with the environment than the Baldwin project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Malone is worried about the financial viability of the project," Holden said. 
"We have the responsibility of what is going to be the best for this community. 
. . . We're the ones who are going to have to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Projects to develop Ormond Beach have been kicking around Oxnard City Hall 
since 1987, when the Baldwin Co. proposed building thousands of residences in 
the area. From the beginning, environmentalists have complained bitterly that 
the beach's wetlands -- where the California least tern and several other 
endangered species live -- would be wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental impact report on development at Ormond Beach is under way and 
should be completed early next year. The City Council will then review the 
report -- which analyzes several proposals, including one that allows no 
development -- and choose a final plan for the area, Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky said the option to leave Ormond Beach the way it is should not be ruled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't do it right," he said, "we shouldn't do it at all."

SCHOOL BOARDS RELUCTANT TO TACKLE PROP. 187; EDUCATION: THE DISTRICTS ARE 
TRYING TO AVOID TAKING A POSITION ON THE INITIATIVE THAT WOULD BAR ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS FROM CAMPUSES. BUT A VENTURA COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE SEEKS A VOTE 
IN FAVOR OF IT. 
</P>

<P>
 Raising the ire of local Latino activists, a Ventura County Community College 
District trustee is proposing that the district board vote at its next meeting 
to support the "Save Our State" initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But most Ventura County school boards so far are dodging such controversy, 
refusing to take a stand on the measure that would deny public education and 
other social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Formally called Proposition 187, the initiative would require school officials 
not only to bar illegal immigrants from school, but also to report to the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service the immigration status of students and 
their parents -- even if the children are citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The California School Boards Assn., which represents school board members 
across the state, has come out strongly against the initiative, saying it would 
make the public schools an arm of the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Teachers Assn. and state Parent Teachers Assn. also oppose the 
measure. But polls show 62% of voters support Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Torn between their consciences and an awareness that any stand on the measure 
will alienate some voters, most Ventura County school board trustees have shied 
away from publicly taking a position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard School District board voted last week to oppose the initiative, but 
only after a rancorous debate between audience members and the sole trustee who 
supported the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura, Hueneme, Rio and Ventura County school boards will each vote on 
resolutions opposing the measure at their next meetings. And Simi Valley school 
officials said they are considering drawing up a similar resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 But school trustees in Thousand Oaks, Ojai, Santa Paula and some other 
districts said they have no intention at this time to bring the matter up for 
board debate. 
</P>
<P>
 And some school officials said they have just one plan for dealing with 
Proposition 187 -- don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very controversial thing," Oxnard Union High School District Trustee 
Steve Stocks said. "We get knocked around enough as it is without saying 'hit 
me again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Community College District Trustee Gregory P. Cole said he is 
not afraid of taking a few knocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, who is running for Thousand Oaks City Council, is bringing a resolution 
before the college district board Oct. 4 to support Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has direct effect with regard to our students," Cole said. "Why are the 
taxpayers subsidizing the education of people that are here illegally?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of Cole's fellow trustees, Karen Boone said she will probably support the 
resolution; Allan Jacobs and Timothy Hirschberg said they are undecided, and 
Pete Tafoya said he is opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that the college district could come out in support of the 
initiative troubles leaders of the county's Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned," said Marcos Vargas, executive director of the 
Oxnard-based advocacy group El Concilio. "Proposition 187 would be really 
detrimental to our community and particularly to the college district, which in 
the past has made a commitment to diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 opponents will pack the board meeting, trustee Tafoya said. 
But, he added, he regrets that Cole brought up the issue in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really does very little for the district and for the image of our district 
to make a political circus out of our board meetings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely because school officials dread the prospect of such a political 
circus, Proposition 187 has yet to come up for discussion among most county 
school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure is "a very hot issue" in Thousand Oaks, said Dolores Didio, 
a Conejo Valley Unified trustee who represents the board at California School 
Boards Assn. "I think people are kind of split on the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Didio has not brought the matter before her fellow trustees partly because she 
is unsure if they would support the state association's position against the 
measure, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it should come before the board if they're going to take a 
negative position on it," she said. "In that case, it might be better to just 
be neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Supt. Jerry Gross also doubts whether a board vote on the issue 
would give trustees anything more than a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 There are arguments on both sides about the initiative, Gross said. Public 
school employees have neither the time nor the inclination to act as INS 
agents, Gross said. "We're teachers. We're not policemen." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, he said, the public is very concerned about illegal 
immigration. And school officials need to show that they are willing to help. 
"It puts us in a tough spot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough spot or not, Pleasant Valley Elementary School District Trustee Val 
Rains said she will probably bring the issue to her board. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're an elected official with a job to do, you don't avoid political hot 
potatoes," said Rains, who serves as regional director for the California 
School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly the opinion of Simi Valley school board President Carla 
Kurachi, who said she is considering asking her board to approve a resolution 
against Proposition 187. "There are a lot of controversial issues in education 
today," Kurachi said. "You can't be afraid to tackle them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurachi's fellow trustee Doug Crosse is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosse said he has mixed views on the initiative and considers it 
inappropriate to bring it up for board debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Muriel Lavender, trustee with the Ojai Unified School District, agreed, saying 
that board members have no obligation to air their views on ballot measures: 
"Voting is a private matter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reluctance of many school board members to publicly debate the 
controversial initiative does not surprise California School Boards Assn. 
President Sherry Loofbourrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the emotions on both sides of the issue, Loofbourrow said her 
association is allowing school boards to decide for themselves whether to 
debate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not reacting thoughtfully to this issue," she said. "They're 
reacting emotionally. . . . Boards have an obligation to show leadership in 
their communities. But they also have responsibilities to move their 
communities forward for the sake of children and not increase dissension in 
their communities."

ELECTIONS / POLITICAL PARTIES; GOP INCREASES LEAD IN REGISTERING VOTERS; 
CAMPAIGN: COUNTY REPUBLICANS WOO MEMBERS, REVERSING A TREND OF DEMOCRATS 
SIGNING UP GREATER NUMBERS. 
</P>

<P>
 There's nothing like a Democrat in the White House to motivate Republicans in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing voter dissatisfaction with President Clinton, local Republican 
activists have been aggressively registering voters in the hope of boosting the 
chances of GOP legislative and congressional candidates in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lack of confidence with the Clinton Administration," said Bob 
Larkin, chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central Committee. "And in 
California, voters have figured out . . . it's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the June primary, Republicans have registered 2,663 new voters, widening 
the GOP's lead over Democrats to 7,848 voters, according to the county's latest 
registration figures. In contrast, Democrats had signed up only 147 new voters 
as of Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP's successful voter registration drive reverses a three-year trend of 
Democrats signing up more voters in Ventura County. Between 1991 and June of 
this year, Democrats cut the Republicans' registration advantage from more than 
21,000 voters to less than 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sept. 13, there were 149,747 registered Republican voters in the county, 
compared to 141,899 Democrats. Final registration figures will not be available 
until next month. 
</P>
<P>
 After the June primary, however, Larkin said the county central committee 
hired half a dozen independent contractors to register voters. The committee 
receives a $2.50 "bounty" from the state Republican Party for each voter 
registered, with that money in turn going to pay the contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing motivates like money to get people to work," Larkin said. "It's very 
Republican. So we're very proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also plan to hold a grand opening today of their campaign 
headquarters in Ventura, one of five offices that party officials plan to 
operate during the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura office will provide space for GOP campaign workers in Santa Paula 
and Fillmore. The Republican Party already operates offices in Oxnard and 
Camarillo and plans to open others soon in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really organized for the first time since 1984," said Republican 
Central Committee member Brian Fox. "To run an effective election, we need to 
have our people in every city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ventura County Democratic leaders chided Republican officials for 
hiring people to sign up voters, and expressed some jealousy too. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got money, it's amazing the things you can do," said Hank Starr, 
chairman of the Ventura County Democratic Central Committee. "Money talks -- 
loudly." 
</P>
<P>
 But Starr and others said Democrats recently launched their own voter 
registration drive throughout the county and that they are confident they will 
be able to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans have got a jump on us, but they're going to need more than a 
jump to beat us to the finish line," said Paul Chatman, chairman of Democrats 
United, a fund-raising arm of the local Democratic Party. "I think we can turn 
the numbers around pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman noted that Democrats had recently opened a Democratic headquarters in 
Ventura for the fall election campaigns of various legislative and 
congressional candidates. The office has a phone bank and a staff of volunteers 
to help canvass precincts and to get people to the voting booth on election 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Democrats and Republicans are concentrating a large part of their voter 
registration efforts on the western end of the county, where each party is 
hoping to pick up crossover votes in some key legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such race, Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) will square off 
against Republican Steve MacElvaine, a former San Luis Obispo County 
supervisor, for the seat being vacated by retiring state Sen. Gary Hart 
(D-Santa Barbara). Hart's 18th state Senate District covers Ventura, Santa 
Paula, Ojai and all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Republican Brooks Firestone, a Santa Barbara County winery owner, is 
competing against Democrat Mindy Lorenz, a college professor, for O'Connell's 
job. O'Connell's 35th Assembly District covers Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and 
most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats hold a slight voter registration advantage in both districts, but 
officials say the party needs a much larger registration edge in each district 
because Republicans have a history of turning out to vote in higher numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are also pushing hard to register voters in Thousand Oaks, where 
residents will cast ballots in a race that pits Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) against Republican Richard Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the 24th Congressional District, which extends from Thousand Oaks 
to Sherman Oaks, has been named one of the top five targeted races nationwide 
by the Republican National Committee. Ventura County Registered Voters 
03,12,11,13 Democrats Republicans Oct. 1991 121,540 142,693 Oct. 1992 147,680 
157,631 Oct. 1993 141,791 149,361 June 1994 141,752 147,084 Sept. 1994 *141,899 
*149,747 * These are the most recent figures, as of Sept. 13. Final figures 
will not be available until after Oct. 11.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SUN VALLEY; COMPANY'S 
OWNER HELD IN ALLEGED CYANIDE DUMPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The co-owner of a Sun Valley metal plating firm was being held in lieu of 
$555,000 bail Tuesday on felony charges that his company dumped potentially 
lethal amounts of cyanide and heavy metals into the Los Angeles sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Meltzer, 53, whose company, Quality Processing Inc., has contracts with 
large aerospace firms, faces 17 counts involving the discharge of waste from an 
illegal pipe connected directly to the sewer system, head Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Michael Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very serious case, in part because there was such a serious threat 
to the public," Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged discharge of high levels of cyanide, in particular, could have 
caused an explosion or a cloud of vapors that would have threatened employees 
of nearby businesses and residents of a trailer park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meltzer, who owns the company with his wife, became a suspect earlier this 
summer after city sanitation workers performing routine sewer monitoring found 
"extremely dangerous and hazardous levels of untreated cyanide and toxic levels 
of chrome and zinc solutions" in the sewer system near the company, said 
Delaney, who is prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven of the charges are felonies, each of which carries a minimum three-year 
prison sentence and $25,000 fine, authorities said. Meltzer is scheduled to be 
arraigned Friday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
ACTS TO EASE RULES FOR MOVIE LOCATION FILMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to make Los Angeles more hospitable to the entertainment 
industry, the City Council agreed Tuesday to cut back sharply on the use of 
fire safety inspectors for location filming. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's office estimated that production companies will save 
$2 million a year because they will be required to have fire safety officers on 
hand only when they are engaged in risky practices -- such as filming in 
public, with pyrotechnics or in brush areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire safety officers will still be posted routinely on riskier shoots, while 
random spot checks will be made at other filming locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Cluff, assistant deputy mayor for entertainment affairs, and Warner Bros. 
Vice President Lisa Rawlins said the new policy would help keep companies from 
moving filming to other cities.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WOMAN, 25, KILLED IN CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old woman died in a traffic accident early Tuesday when her husband 
veered in front of a pickup truck, which then hit the couple's vehicle 
broadside, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Isabel Martinez Lopez, a mother of three young children, was on her way 
to work in the fields of Oxnard when the accident happened about 5:35 a.m. at 
Rice and Sturgis roads. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the woman's husband, Martin Jesus Lopez, 29, made a left 
turn onto Sturgis Road in front of a pickup truck driven by 35-year-old 
Gilberto Lemos Ortiz of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz slammed on his brakes, but could not avoid the collision. His vehicle 
rammed into the passenger's side of Lopez's pickup truck, where Maria Lopez was 
sitting. She was pronounced dead at the scene. None of their children were in 
car at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said the Lopez family moved to Oxnard from Orange 
County last week and have relatives in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Lopez was treated for minor injuries at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center and released. A second passenger in Lopez's truck, Noa Avalos Orozco, 
32, was also taken to St. John's and was listed in serious condition with a 
lacerated liver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz was not injured in the crash. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 The Port Hueneme Police Officers Assn. has endorsed five of the 14 candidates 
running for three City Council seats in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying the candidates will work to maintain the Police Department, the 
association endorsed Valorie Morrison, Frank McElfish Jr., Tony Volante, David 
Goodman and Robert Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 McElfish, Morrison and Volante intensively campaigned for the June ballot 
initiative intended to keep the Police Department from being disbanded and law 
enforcement services contracted through the Sheriff's Department, association 
President Kenneth Dobbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two candidates, Goodman and Turner, were recommended to the 
association by the Friends of Our Port Hueneme Police Department Political 
Action Committee, which has endorsed all five candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are running for council seats that will be vacant as three 
incumbents step down. CHRISTINA LIMA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; COUNCIL 
AGREES TO APPLY FOR JOB TRAINING GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday agreed to apply for a $3-million federal youth job 
training grant on behalf of a private South-Central Los Angeles riot recovery 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, which has already been tentatively approved by the U.S. Department 
of Labor, would be used to set up a job training and placement center near 
Manchester and Vermont avenues by Community Build, a private nonprofit 
organization that was launched by U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 10 to 0 without discussion to pursue the federal funds. 
Council members Mark Ridley-Thomas and Rita Walters, both of whom had raised 
questions about whether Community Build should receive the grant, were not 
present for the council decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair had indicated last week that they did not want to vote in favor of 
the project but did not want to see it killed, either. Ridley-Thomas, in whose 
district the program would be centered, said Tuesday he had concerns about the 
lack of competitive bidding for the grant and about the limited track record of 
Community Build. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no good reason to get resources and not have the appropriate 
safeguards against those resources being squandered," said Ridley-Thomas, 
adding that he was attending a USC function at the time of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters was on vacation and could not be reached for comment.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; BONE MARROW DONORS SOUGHT TO SAVE LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Mastro can't shake your hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old Camarillo man's immune system is still weak because of a bone 
marrow transplant he underwent in June. As a result, Mastro's interactions with 
strangers -- and the germs they may harbor -- are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mastro sees a movie, it's at the drive-in. Restaurants are risky. His 
social circle is limited, by doctor's orders, to his family, his girlfriend and 
five other friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Mastro considers himself a lucky man, and his mother, Cindy, declared 
her son's story "a miracle." The bone marrow transplant, which has so far been 
successful, may have saved Mastro's life, curing his leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very fortunate," said Lynnette Chandler, regional coordinator for the 
National Marrow Donor Program. Mastro survived a December crash that totaled 
his new truck, with only minor injuries. While treating him, doctors discovered 
that Mastro had a high white blood-cell count, indicating leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The early discovery of the disease in Mastro's blood gave him and his family a 
head start on looking for a marrow donor. This is where Mastro really lucked 
out, finding a match in the nationwide computerized registry who was willing to 
help. His search only took four months. Chandler's daughter, now 14, looked for 
a suitable donor for seven years before medication she was taking made her 
ineligible for the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mastros scheduled an auction in April to raise money to test possible 
donors for Jim Mastro, but the nearly $13,000 they raised will now help pay for 
the $45 per person it takes to draw and analyze blood samples from new 
prospective donors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Chapter of the National Marrow Donor Program will hold a 
free concert and marrow donor registration from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday at 
Freedom Park in Camarillo. Volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 can take a 
simple blood test and have their names added to the 1.3 million people already 
on the national registry. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said there are at least 70 people in Ventura County who still need 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Mastro said she plans to volunteer all day at the registration, and Jim 
Mastro's girlfriend, Ginger Gibbs, said she plans to have her blood tested at 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Jim Mastro, he is busy recuperating, but he said he wants people to 
know that "you can just extract a little bit of this fluid from your hip and 
save someone's life." 
</P>
<P>
 When he recovers fully, he hopes to return to college and perhaps serve as a 
counselor at a camp for children with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is also looking forward to meeting the anonymous donor who saved 
his life. IRA E. STOLL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES; 
PROTESTERS CALL FOR LAPD REINSTATEMENT OF PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several dozen protesters demonstrated outside Los Angeles police headquarters 
Tuesday, calling for the reinstatement of Assistant Chief Bernard C. Parks to 
the No. 2 spot in the LAPD, a job that Chief Willie L. Williams has moved to 
strip from his top aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that management has done an injustice," said Herbert Andrew, one of 
those who gathered outside the headquarters carrying signs saying "Parks: We 
Support You." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the demonstrators angrily denounced Williams, who said last week he 
was demoting Parks and restructuring his management team to propel the 
department toward change. Since then, the demotion and the restructuring have 
stirred the most contentious political debate of Williams' tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators had hoped to address the Police Commission, but that group's 
weekly meeting was canceled because commissioners could not muster a quorum. 
Meanwhile, Parks was granted a 30-day extension of a deadline to decide whether 
to accept a demotion or a deal under which he would be allowed to retire at his 
current rank in February, when he will mark his 30th year with the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for being allowed to retire at his highest rank and pay, Parks would 
have to agree not to sue the city, the mayor or Chief Williams.

 A 24-year-old Palmdale man wanted for the July 5 slaying of a teen-ager at the 
Antelope Valley Mall has turned himself into authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolfo Real Jr., who has been charged with shooting Efrain Pablo Brito, 16, 
during an argument in the mall's parking lot, had been sought since July 18 
when a warrant was issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Real pleaded not guilty to the murder charge Monday in Antelope Municipal 
Court and said through his attorney that he was unaware until recently that the 
warrant had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ian R. Grant ordered Real held without bail pending a preliminary 
hearing Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not guilty of the crime," said Real's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender 
Manuel R. Martinez. After learning of the warrant, Martinez said, Real "decided 
the best thing to do was to turn himself in and clear up the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Tom Pigott said an anonymous caller agreed to have Real meet 
deputies outside a convenience market.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SAILOR, 27, WHO FELL FROM TOWER DIES

<P>
 A 27-year-old Port Hueneme sailor, who was critically injured last week when 
he and a colleague fell from a military communications radio tower, died early 
Tuesday at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Petty Officer 3rd Class Timothy MacTavish died about 12:30 a.m. in the 
hospital's intensive care unit, according to Rita Schumacher, a hospital 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 MacTavish and fellow Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard Terry, 22, fell from a 
60-foot-high military communications tower located on the sprawling Naval 
Construction Battalion Center on Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Tuesday, Terry, who suffered severe facial and head injuries from 
the fall, was upgraded from critical to serious condition, Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the accident, MacTavish and Terry were performing routine 
maintenance and repair work. MacTavish was in a safety harness about 
three-quarters up the tower and Terry was about 10 feet below him and still 
climbing into position when the structure collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy spokeswoman Linda Wadley said Navy safety officials have stepped up their 
investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadley said that two separate Navy investigations have been launched into the 
incident. One investigation will be headed by the base's safety office and the 
other by the Navy's judge advocate general's office. Wadley said the latter 
agency is brought in when multiple injuries or fatalities occur at a base work 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 MacTavish was decorated by the Navy for his service during the Persian Gulf 
War and was a seven-year Navy veteran. Terry is a four-year veteran of the 
service. Both men were assigned to the 31st Naval Construction Regiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Base commanders said Tuesday the base was saddened by MacTavish' death and 
expressed hopes for Terry's continued recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "MacTavish was an outstanding young man who personified the best in every 
sailor," said Navy Cmdr. William Rudich, the regiment's chief of staff. J. E.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY COUNCIL CREATES YOUTH COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday voted to create a city Youth Commission of 
21 youngsters from city schools, clubs and associations. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, modeled after similar bodies in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, 
will provide Oxnard leaders with advice on issues affecting youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the ideas proposed for the commission are preparing a year-round 
calendar of youth events, honoring outstanding youngsters for their civic 
contributions, starting a youth newspaper and television program and creating a 
youth month in which youngsters "assume control of city government" and install 
their own mayor, police chief and department heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say the commission's challenge will be to ensure the fledgling 
politicians understand the limits of their power. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials in the past few months have discussed the plan with young 
people in city programs such as the Youth and Work Newspaper Project, the 
Summer Youth Corps and the Police Athletic League. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members also sought opinions from El Concilio del Condado de 
Ventura, a Latino advocacy group; the Oxnard Union High School District and the 
Boys & Girls Club of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Most youngsters supported the idea, but some adults wanted to ensure that the 
commission would have power and responsibilities and asked for a set of bylaws 
and guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we start making decisions that affect young people, I think they should 
have a say in it," said Councilman Bedford Pinkard, who proposed the 
commission. "I think we need to listen to them, not have them listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The youth commission would cost $6,500 to start up. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; RV RESORT PROPOSAL TO GET ANOTHER LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme City Council will consider tonight whether to drop a plan to 
build a recreational vehicle resort on a city-owned beach, or redesign the 
proposal and resubmit it to the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission rejected the city's 144-space project last Wednesday 
because members considered the beachfront site an environmentally sensitive 
plant and wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Richard Velthoen said another option is to postpone action until 
a newly constituted council takes office in January. Three of the five council 
seats are on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Orvene Carpenter said he believes the council should proceed with 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a firm believer that we should try to continue to purse the RV resort so 
we can have a source of money," Carpenter said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI VALLEY; RAPE PREVENTION IS TOWN HALL TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives will meet tonight with Ojai Valley residents to discuss 
their investigation into a series of rapes and attempted rapes of women who 
live alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The town hall meeting begins at 7 p.m. in the auditorium of the Ojai Valley 
Unified School District offices at 414 E. Ojai Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of similarities in the attacks and descriptions given by the victims, 
sheriff's officials believe they are dealing with a serial rapist. No arrests 
have been made, but dozens of potential suspects have been interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. John Fitzgerald, the lead investigator, will present an overview of the 
case and answer questions from the public. Residents will also be given advice 
on how to help prevent rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince France, a retired sheriff's commander and former Ojai police chief, said 
he organized the meeting because of the impact the rapes have had on the small 
town. No rapes were reported in Ojai last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serial situation where we've got a guy we know has assaulted at 
least four women. It's just a whole different ball game than what we're used to 
in this community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 France also said the meeting should help set straight some of the rumors he 
has heard about the assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent attacks in the Ojai area occurred Sept. 2 when a 64-year-old 
woman was assaulted by a masked man about 6 a.m. That attack was followed by an 
attack on a 54-year-old woman in her home about four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two attacks occurred about 3 a.m. March 13 in Meiners Oaks and about 
1:30 a.m. April 16 in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials have distributed a flyer describing the suspect as a 
red-haired man in his mid-20s who wears a nylon-stocking mask and smells of 
cigarettes. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; TASK FORCE SUGGESTS CITY BUILD 900 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special affordable-housing task force on Tuesday recommended that Oxnard 
City Council build 600 low-cost dwellings in the next five years by reworking 
its finances.  
</P>
<P>
 But council members, who created the task force to develop an affordable 
housing plan, said most of the task force's recommendations will never be 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 The Affordable Housing Ad Hoc Committee, made up of local business and 
community leaders, concluded last month that the city needs to build more than 
900 affordable dwellings by 1996 to meet its own housing goals. The committee's 
report also suggested that the homes should cost much less than the city has 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 By redirecting federal and redevelopment funds, Oxnard could afford to build 
600 low-cost homes over the next five years, the report found. The city could 
also meet its housing objectives by giving developers more incentives to build 
affordable dwellings in the city, the task force concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very salient bits of information," Councilman Andres Herrera 
said. "Some are workable; some have already been implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said the report is a valuable source of information, 
but no substitute for the city's current affordable housing policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the value of the report will be that we can consult it in the 
future when we are discussing affordable housing," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was created by the City Council a year ago to draft a five-year 
affordable housing plan. Its members were asked to review the city funds 
available for housing, previous attempts to create low-cost homes, and possible 
sites for such projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the conclusions of the report was that Oxnard needs to hire a city 
staffer to work with the city manager on low-cost housing and steer projects 
through the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not be appropriate to hire an expediter," Councilman Tom Holden said, 
"but it may be a good idea to assign someone else in the city to take on that 
duty." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY OKS FUNDS FOR CAL STATE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County will pay more than $240,000 to supplement a $1.7-million 
federal grant for the final phase of a flood-control channel to protect land 
selected for a new Cal State University campus. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors authorized the expenditure Tuesday with the provision that 
the Public Works Department apply for reimbursement from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is particularly gratifying to me because it completes county flood 
control's commitment to the university," said Arthur E. Goulet, director of the 
Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials chose the 260-acre lemon grove west of Camarillo for the 
planned campus in 1991, following a five-year search for a site. 
</P>
<P>
 But progress has been stalled because of statewide budget cuts and legal 
delays while the university works through condemnation proceedings to acquire a 
portion of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus planners had hoped to have the site ready for classes by the turn of 
the century. They now acknowledge the opening may be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds from the U.S. Soil Conservation Service allow the county to complete 
a 1 1/2-mile-long concrete drainage ditch that will cut diagonally across the 
property. The property, bordered by Santa Clara and Central avenues, is subject 
to flooding during heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will apply to the California Department of Water Resources to be 
reimbursed for its share, Goulet said. JOANNA M. MILLER

SIMPSON TEAM SUBPOENAS PROSECUTORS FOR PRETRIAL HEARING; COURT: DEFENSE HOPES 
TO SOLICIT TESTIMONY ABOUT POLICE SEARCHES. CLARK, HODGMAN ARE EXPECTED TO 
FIGHT THE MOVE.

<P>
 Prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson double-murder case could find themselves on 
the witness stand if his lawyers win a bid to solicit testimony at a pretrial 
hearing scheduled to begin today.  
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers have subpoenaed Deputy Dist. Attys. Marcia Clark and Bill 
Hodgman in an attempt to force them to testify about what went on during police 
searches conducted in their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 David Conn, a third prosecutor who worked on the case early on but who has 
since been reassigned, also has been subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty in the June 12 slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole 
Brown Simpson, and a friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. Jury selection in his trial 
is scheduled to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys hope to use the prosecutors' testimony to prove that 
evidence taken from Simpson's home, vehicles and business office should be 
thrown out because of alleged police improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark and Hodgman are expected to vehemently argue that no witnesses should be 
called at the hearing because much of the issue was covered during Simpson's 
preliminary hearing. They also will oppose the motion to suppress the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Among about 20 witnesses the defense wants to call are Los Angeles Police 
Detective Mark Fuhrman, who testified in an earlier proceeding that he found 
one of the key pieces of evidence against Simpson at the former football star's 
estate -- a bloodied glove similar to one found near the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has called the glove part of a "bloody trail" Simpson left behind after 
the slayings, a trail that she contends also included droplets of blood found 
at the murder scene, on a Ford Bronco owned by Simpson and at his estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers have attacked the integrity of the evidence, contending that 
it was either illegally obtained or tainted by sloppy handling. They have 
suggested that Fuhrman planted the glove on Simpson's property, though no 
evidence of that has been offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's lawyers have scheduled a news conference today, where they are 
expected to try to discredit a woman who has given the defense a sworn 
affidavit questioning the detective's character and objectivity toward Simpson.

SYMBOLIC SIEGE; ACTIVISTS URGE CLINTON TO 'INVADE' SOUTH-CENTRAL ONCE PEACE IS 
ESTABLISHED IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea seems to be working in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 So a group of community activists urged President Clinton on Tuesday to 
"invade South-Central Los Angeles" and attack problems that are causing 
suffering for residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all of the horrible things happening in Haiti happening right here -- 
murders, homelessness, unemployment -- and what is seen by some an an 
oppressive police force," said Dr. James Mays, a leader of a coalition called 
Unity Survival Action (USA) for South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as former President Carter has a shower and a shave, he should bring 
Colin Powell out here and talk to gangbangers and criminals and tell them 
they're coming to reinforce the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays, a 51-year-old physician who operates three South-Central medical 
clinics, acknowledged that the invasion call is largely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 But he says he believes that things are out of hand in South-Central and that 
National Guard troops may be required to "get things under control." Mays said 
the federal crime bill money for additional police officers "isn't going to 
change anything. The police are too far behind -- L.A. is already such a snake 
pit." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Los Angeles and Washington were surprised by the "invasion" call. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokesman said late Tuesday that Clinton had not received the 
request. "It sounds like they're demanding help from local officials," the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents a portion of the 
South-Central area, applauded Mays for drawing attention to the problem but 
added: "I don't think a military solution is appropriate for an urban crisis, 
nor do I think that's Dr. Mays' intention." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Riordan said the issues raised by the 
coalition are serious. But added, "We certainly don't agree with the Haiti 
analogy. We don't think invading South-Central is a constructive idea," Noelia 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, whose 
2nd District includes South-Central, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some problems in South-Central, but it may be a little bit of a 
leap to jump to Haiti-type references. We don't have a dictator here, for 
example," aide Fred MacFarlane said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mays and others in his coalition charged that their neighborhoods are 
often dominated by outsiders who do not always have the best interest of locals 
at heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like the powers do dictate to us here in South-Central," said the 
Rev. Phillip Miles, 41, pastor of Lively Hope Community Church where Unity 
Survival Action members met Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We constantly call upon City Hall and the Board of Supervisors for more money 
for homeless shelters," Miles said. "They tell us, 'We can't help you.' Then we 
read that the supervisors have $1.2 million in discretionary funds they're 
sitting on." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays -- whose community work has ranged from creation of a walk of fame called 
the Watts Promenade of Prominence to formation of a mentor group called 
Adopt-a-Family -- said the nation's humanitarian efforts should be focused at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to clean up our community of crime and violence and let older 
people out of the prisons they have to live in after dusk. They cannot drive 
nice cars for fear of being 'jacked. They can't withdraw money from the ATM. 
You can't jog with your Rolex watch on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays suggested that Carter, who negotiated an agreement with Haiti's military 
leaders over the weekend, could also "use some of his Southern gentleman's 
diplomacy" to improve relations between blacks and Latinos "to make them 
realize it's in their best interest to work together to avoid a possible future 
clash." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, he said, Clinton should initiate a kind of Marshall Plan to help 
finance the long-term turnaround of South-Central -- similar to efforts that 
"rehabilitated Germany and Japan" after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need help," he said.

L.A. COUNTY WILL LEASE 'SUPER SCOOPER' PLANE TO HELP FIGHT BRUSH FIRES; SAFETY: 
CRAFT WILL COST UP TO $719,000, PLUS AN HOURLY CHARGE. BUT ITS ABILITY TO TAKE 
ON WATER WHILE AIRBORNE COULD BE INVALUABLE, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 Los Angeles County on Tuesday became the first California jurisdiction to 
acquire a long-coveted Canadian tanker plane that fights brush fires by bombing 
them with up to seven tons of water scooped from lakes or the ocean on the fly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to lease the Canadair CL-215T, or 
"super scooper," from the Quebec government for up to three months, beginning 
in early October. Leasing the plane, including the services of two Canadian 
flight crews and a mechanic, will cost up to $719,000, plus $515 for every hour 
it is in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 As costly as leasing the plane may be, the expense pales in comparison to the 
$1 billion in damage Southern California sustained in last autumn's devastating 
fires, said county Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman. Twenty-six fires struck six 
Southern California counties last fall, including the Calabasas-Malibu fire, 
which killed three people. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said the plane could prove invaluable in improving the chances of 
quickly controlling or dousing a fire because, unlike other tanker planes and 
retardant-dropping helicopters, it does not need to be loaded by ground crews. 
The "super scooper" can swoop down on a body of water and take on 1,400 gallons 
in less than 12 seconds, simply scooping it up as the plane roars along the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Fire Department will tap its $5-million contingency fund to pay for 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'super scooper" is not a panacea, but it will help us make a heavy, 
decisive hit from the air during the crucial initial stages of a fire," Freeman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane will based at Van Nuys Airport and used throughout the county, not 
just in the unincorporated areas that are the responsibility of county 
firefighters. The city of Los Angeles has tentatively agreed to allow the 
county to store the plane for free and let the crew use a vacant fire station 
at the old Air National Guard base in the northwest corner of Van Nuys Airport, 
Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, officials rejected the "super scooper" for several reasons, 
including its purchase price of $16.5 million and the fact that it cannot fly 
at night or in extremely gusty winds and cannot get refills from the ocean in 
choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Local homeowner groups whose longstanding campaign to acquire the plane had 
gotten a boost from last year's devastating fires praised the lease agreement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need this tool in our toolbox," said Alan Kishbaugh, president of the Los 
Angeles Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., which represents 55 homeowner 
groups from Westlake Village to Mt. Washington. "It might even lead to lower 
(fire) insurance premiums." The performance of the 65-foot-long plane will be 
evaluated by county fire officials, who will report the results to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is going to prove essential to protect life and property," said 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who co-sponsored with Supervisor Ed Edelman the 
motion to bring the plane to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the plane proves useful, the county would explore forming a joint powers 
agency with other local governments, the state and the federal government to 
purchase one, Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the state also moved to lease and test the "super scooper." 
Reversing a position he took two years ago when he vetoed a similar program, 
Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood) allowing the leasing and testing of two "super 
scoopers." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, scheduled to begin next spring, would be administered by the 
state Department of Forestry, which would have the final say on where the 
airplanes are deployed. But the state did not appropriate funds for the 
program, and legislators are still seeking at least $1.8 million from the 
federal government.

JUDGE REFUSES TO LIFT BAN ON MTA FARE INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge refused Tuesday to lift his preliminary injunction forbidding 
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to raise bus and Blue Line trolley 
fares on the grounds that higher fares discriminate against the poor and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. let stand his decision last week to 
extend a court order blocking the MTA from abolishing its general monthly bus 
pass and increasing fares for the first time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the agency's contention that it is losing $110,000 daily without the 
fare increase, Hatter declined to stay his injunction or to agree to a 
compromise solution allowing the MTA to retain passes but raise the basic cash 
fare from $1.10 to $1.35. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials immediately filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court, although that panel previously refused to consider a similar appeal 
after Hatter rolled back the fare increase Sept. 1, just hours after the new 
prices went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter agreed with a coalition of grass-roots organizations that the revamped 
fare structure might unfairly discriminate against minorities and the poor, who 
make up the bulk of the MTA's bus ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 A full hearing on the coalition's lawsuit against the MTA is scheduled for 
Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful for us," Martin Hernandez, a spokesman for one of the 
plaintiff groups, said of Hatter's decision Tuesday. "The MTA has failed to 
show" why it should be allowed to raise fares, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency contends that the fare increase is necessary to help eliminate a 
$126-million operating shortfall in its $2.9-billion budget this year. Hatter 
has said he will lift the injunction against the MTA at the Oct. 17 hearing if 
the agency can prove that its costly rail projects do not benefit affluent 
white residents at the expense of indigent bus riders.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY: MOORPARK; TEACHERS, DISTRICT PLAN CONTRACT TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark's teachers and school district officials plan to sit down for formal 
negotiations on a new contract by the first week of October, both sides said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the Moorpark Educators Assn. asked for a 4% pay increase.A 
counteroffer made Friday by the district includes no pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're putting no money on the table because there is no money," said board 
member Tom Baldwin.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we're saying that any new funds that come our way will go to salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said the district's offer includes a section that would set up a 
committee -- of both union members and district officials -- to find money for 
future raises. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in the Moorpark Unified School District have not had a raise in four 
years and have been without a contract for two years, according to union 
President Richard Gillis. While Gillis said he welcomes the chance to sit down 
with the district to negotiate, he would not comment on the district's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big step that they've finally agreed to a time when we can sit down 
and meet face to face," he said. "We're very anxious to start the negotiations, 
but it would be premature to comment on their proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin and board member Clint Harper both said that several measures could be 
used to find money to increase salaries, including using lottery revenue or 
cutting back on the district's non-teaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the alternatives are very attractive," Harper said.  
</P>
<P>
 But he said he hoped the two sides could discuss the alternatives and work out 
an agreement acceptable to both sides. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WATER DISTRICTS MAY LEASE ALLOCATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western Ventura County's three largest water distributors may be able to 
collectively save more than $1 million per year by leasing their state water 
allocations for short terms while retaining their long-term rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the city of Ventura, Casitas Municipal Water District and United 
Water Conservation District met informally in Ventura on Tuesday to discuss 
temporarily leasing some of their entitlements of 15,000 acre-feet per year to 
other California water districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Casitas and United each pay about $400,000 per year to reserve their annual 
rights to 5,000 acre-feet of state water apiece. Ventura, which holds 
entitlements to 10,000 acre-feet of water per year, pays more than $800,000 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 326,000 gallons in one acre-foot, enough to supply two average-size 
families for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to have the water available to sell, the agencies would have to 
notify the state Department of Water Resources by Oct. 1 that they want their 
entitlements next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are folks out there who are looking to buy water," said John Johnson, 
general manager of Casitas. Selling Casitas' allotted water for the year could 
offset annual fees from the state Department of Water Resources, Johnson said. 
He believes those fees will soon increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he will ask his board of directors for approval to order its 
allocation at the next board meeting Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three agencies, only United has been able to take delivery of its state 
water. United draws the water from a state reservoir at Lake Pyramid and into 
Lake Piru, which is operated by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 United may participate in the leasing program, but only on a year-to-year 
basis after tests to determine the condition of the ground-water basins, said 
United General Manger Frederick J. Gientke. 
</P>
<P>
 As a conservation district, United is in charge of replenishing underground 
water basins and aquifers on the Oxnard Plain, from which water has been 
overdrawn for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura will wait until next year to decide whether to participate 
in the leasing plan after the city has had time to decide on long-term policy 
decisions included in an upcoming water management plan, said Ronald Calkins, 
the city's public works director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council has thought long and hard about water policy," he said, referring 
to recent debates on whether to build a pipeline to receive state water or 
build a plant to desalinate seawater. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he did not want to take the matter to the council when 
there would only be a few weeks to decide whether to order the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to get into another debate in town about state water versus 
desal," he said. JOANNA M. MILLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMARILLO; GOLETA MAN CHARGED IN ROBBERIES, RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors charged a Goleta man Tuesday with 18 felonies in 
connection with two separate robberies, including an Aug. 29 holdup at a 
Camarillo yogurt shop in which two teen-agers were raped and terrorized. 
</P>
<P>
 "These girls were violated," said Deputy Dist. Atty.Maeve Fox, who filed the 
charges against 21-year-old Christopher Bass. "They were scared out of their 
wits. It was a pretty horrendous crime." 
</P>
<P>
 A Municipal Court arraignment for Bass, who could receive up to 85 years in 
prison if convicted of all the charges, was continued until Oct. 4 to allow his 
attorneys time to review police reports in the case against him. 
</P>
<P>
 A burly man, Bass held his head down during his brief courtroom appearance. 
Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III ordered bail set at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Bass sexually assaulted the 17- and 19-year-old victims at 
gunpoint during the robbery of a yogurt shop on Carmen Drive in Camarillo. 
After taking cash from the register, the masked gunman forced the two store 
employees into a back room, where he sexually assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass was arrested about 7:15 p.m. Friday as he was leaving work at Just Bagels 
in Agoura Hills. One of the victims identified a picture of Bass, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass is also accused of robbing an Agoura Hills Domino's Pizza on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
 He is charged with five counts of robbery, two counts of false imprisonment, 
two counts of rape, two counts of penetration with a foreign object, two counts 
of forcible oral copulation, two counts of making terrorist threats, two counts 
of sexual battery and one count of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Joseph Villasana, who represented Bass during Monday's 
hearing, said he had not read the police reports in the case and declined 
comment. DWAYNE BRAY

RESIDENTS PUSH FOR CLEANUP OF SITE; SIMI VALLEY: TWO VACANT, QUAKE-RAVAGED 
BUSINESSES HAVE STIRRED NEIGHBORS' ANGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight months after the Jan. 21 earthquake, two caved-in Simi Valley stores are 
attracting trash, transients and the anger of neighbors who want the ruins 
repaired or replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords of the vacant Pic 'N' Save and Sears Outlet on Tapo Street said 
Tuesday they still have not firmed up plans for their adjoining buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pic 'N' Save officials said they will announce their plans within six weeks, 
while a Beverly Hills accountant said his partnership is searching for a new 
tenant and seeking federal emergency loans to rebuild the uninsured Sears 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the delay, members of Simi Valley Neighborhood Council 3 say 
they will meet Thursday evening at 7:30 at City Hall to decide how to lobby the 
city to force reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Kieffer, a neighboring homeowner who has gathered 17 signatures on the 
petition, calls the buildings "the two thorns in my side." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exactly how the earthquake left them," Kieffer said Tuesday, walking 
past the steel braces, 6-foot-high cyclone fence and 5-foot-high weeds that 
have sprung up since the store roofs fell in. "It's like they're frozen in 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Youths jump the fence regularly to spray graffiti inside the Sears store, 
while transients often camp out behind the Pic 'N' Save, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really sad," Kieffer said. "All the businesses around here have rebuilt 
except for these two, and -- please -- they're big companies. They're not a 
mom-and-pop business." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they are trying to be as patient with the store owners as 
they are with homeowners and other landlords struggling to pay for earthquake 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to work with them to assist them," Assistant City Manager Mike 
Sedell said. "But we're also trying to put gentle pressure on them to have that 
building reconstructed as quick as it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under city orders, the landlords fenced off the stores and cleaned up trash 
dumped there, Sedell said, but the city has not threatened any other 
enforcement action -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is walking a tightrope between the rights of an individual property 
owner and the needs for a positive aesthetic environment in the community," he 
said. "In terms of health, safety and welfare, the city has a legal ability to 
go in and correct deficiencies. In terms of telling someone they have to go in 
and fix some damage . . . that's not a detriment to health and public welfare, 
it's very problematic." 
</P>
<P>
 The 250-store Pic 'N' Save chain is on the verge of announcing its plans for 
the damaged Simi Valley store, said Patricia Wehner, the chain's senior vice 
president of real estate construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not ready to make an announcement yet, since everything is not 
finalized," Wehner said Tuesday. "We've been looking at our alternatives as far 
as repairing it, demolishing and starting over again or moving on to a 
different property." 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of the 29 Pic 'N' Saves damaged by the quake have reopened, except 
for stores in Simi Valley and Chatsworth, she said. And the chain has sent 
someone out regularly to remove trash and abandoned appliances and furniture 
dumped beside the building, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sears building is not so close to being repaired, said part-owner Lawrence 
Morse, a Beverly Hills CPA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to be able to rebuild at some point in time," said Morse, a 
member of the Morse-Valley and Nogales partnership that owns the Sears store 
and most of the neighboring buildings in the shopping center. "Right now, we 
don't have a tenant." 
</P>
<P>
 Selling the vacant 30,000-square-foot hulk presents a chicken-and-egg dilemma, 
Morse said. Should the owners find a tenant first and rebuild to suit, or 
replace the store and hope for a tenant who likes the layout? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing about $15,000 a month" on the Sears store and a vacant, roofless 
3,000-square-foot deli next door, Morse said. "It's a very difficult 
situation."

PREPARING AVID FANS OF HIGHER EDUCATION; SCHOOLS: PROGRAM TO BOOST COLLEGE 
ENROLLMENT OF MINORITY AND LOWER-INCOME STUDENTS IS LAUNCHED AT FIVE SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirteen-year-old Jessica Perez represents the underrepresented. Despite the 
fact that relatively few Latino females attend the state's four-year 
universities, Jessica passionately wants to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time starting this school year, the ambitious Newbury Park 
eighth-grader is receiving special assistance to meet that goal, as part of a 
new program aimed at sending more minorities and low-income students to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called Advancement via Individual Determination or AVID, is being 
launched at five intermediate and high schools in Thousand Oaks and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in the Ventura Unified, Fillmore Unified and Oxnard Union High school 
districts plan to implement the program sometime this year as well, Ventura 
County school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if we keep up this program, in the long run it is going to help 
us and prepare us for college," said Jessica, one of 13 students in the program 
at Sequoia Intermediate School in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The select group of youngsters enrolled in Jessica's class, all average 
students with 2.0 to 3.0 grade-point averages, were identified by teachers as 
good candidates for the voluntary program. Under the program, they spend one 
period a day learning study skills from college tutors and are given more 
individualized attention in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very structured program, working with time management (and) 
note-taking," said Susan Freeman, the program's instructor at Sequoia. "We talk 
about career and college opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Started in San Diego in 1980, the program has been recognized by the state 
Department of Education for substantially increasing the number of high school 
graduates meeting University of California requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 30 students in the first AVID class in San Diego, 28 went to four-year 
colleges. Since then, the program has spread to schools throughout California, 
Kentucky, Virginia, and as far away as England and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has also been heralded for increasing the number of nonwhite 
students attending four-year colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in both districts said their minority populations are growing. 
Developing AVID is a way to help many of those students overcome cultural and 
economic barriers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have groups of kids starting out hearing, 'You aren't going to make 
it because you're poor or you're black or you're brown,' that message is 
enforced," said Leslie Crunelle, Simi Valley's director of secondary education. 
"What AVID does is break that cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 State statistics paint a grim picture of minority college-bound students. Of 
16,473 freshman entering UC schools in 1993, 1,314 were Latino women, or about 
8%, and only 897 were Latino men, or about 5%, according to a report by the 
California Postsecondary Education Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on figures from the report, the percentages improve to about 13% for the 
number of Latino women at the Cal State University and community college 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of underrepresented groups, (Latinos) are a small percentage of 
students entering into the universities and that is what AVID is aimed at," 
said Joe Mendoza, director of migrant education for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this year, the program is being launched in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District in the eighth grade at Sequoia and Redwood Intermediate 
Schools, and in the ninth grade at Thousand Oaks and Westlake high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs at Los Cerritos Intermediate and Newbury Park High will begin in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Sequoia Junior High School enrolled 31 students in its new 
program. "We are very interested in watching the program," Crunelle said. "The 
track record is phenomenal."

 What's wrong with kids today? 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight is the new season's evening for parental heartache, whether it's the 
obsessive mother on ABC's "All-American Girl" or the neurotic father on CBS' 
"Daddy's Girls," which follows the already premiered "The Boys Are Back," where 
both parents appear traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out tonight's premieres are NBC's "The Cosby Mysteries," which was 
not available for review, and the CBS hour "Touched by an Angel," which 
provides the funniest comedy of the new season. Even though the comedy is 
unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 It's appropriate that television represent all segments of U.S. society. In 
that regard, the comedy series "All-American Girl" proves that prime time is an 
equal opportunity maligner. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everyone in a typical sitcom is deeply flawed in some way, to say 
nothing of being severely demented. Long omitted from this prized arena, it's 
now Korean Americans' turn to take their lumps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's unreviewed, unfunny premiere of "All-American Girl" found Korean 
American Margaret Kim (stand-up comic Margaret Cho) offending her caricaturish 
old-world mother by stubbornly dating a white guy, and a real boob at that. 
Ultimately, Margaret caved in and gave him up, pleasing her entire family. 
</P>
<P>
 A thoroughly Americanized 22-year-old college student, Margaret lives at home 
-- above her family's bookstore in San Francisco -- with her immigrant parents, 
grandmother and two brothers, the oldest of whom is a submissive toady despite 
being a brilliant cardiology resident. 
</P>
<P>
 At times sounding like a blabbing fortune cookie ("Go out with garbage, expect 
to be dumped"), Margaret's controlling mother (Jodi Long) is a relentless 
matchmaker to childish extremes, desperately seeking to fix up her daughter 
with a traditional Korean guy. Although last week's attempt to do so backfired, 
tonight she tries again, fishing another male name from her "son-in-law" 
computer file. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode's rare humor comes when the independent Margaret tries to bridge 
this culture gap by cramming Korean lore and feigning giggly demureness and 
subservience ("whatever you say, Raymond") in the presence of her "traditional" 
date and his own family. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this material is supposedly based on the autobiographical stand-up act 
of the likable Cho, who is much longer on energy than laughs in this venue, 
bringing to mind an old television proverb: Present unfunny comedy, expect to 
be dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least the Kims have only one rebellious daughter. Compare that with the 
terrible crises facing a woeful parent who is making his debut on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you spell aggravation? D-u-d-l-e-y M-o-o-r-e. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley Walker, Moore's sleep-around, model-dating playboy character in 
"Daddy's Girls," has mounting miseries. He's a fumbling dress manufacturer 
whose wife has run off with his partner and best friend, Phil. His youngest 
daughter, 16-year-old Phoebe (Keri Russell), is wild about a long-haired slug 
named Scar. His pushy middle daughter, Samantha (Meredith Scott Lynn), wants to 
be his new partner. His multi-wed eldest daughter, Amy (Stacy Galina), is about 
to marry again, this time to a dull (is there any other kind?) ophthalmologist. 
</P>
<P>
 And, worst of all, Dudley is about to learn that his wife is attending the 
wedding with -- oh nooooo -- Phil. Just how does he get himself into such 
fixes? 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger question is how the comedically gifted Moore got himself into such 
a series, whose opening is pretty much a witless mess centering on the wedding 
and a search for hot new silk jersey to make dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing with Moore in it can be all unfunny. Every time he says "Scar" in that 
nasal whine, for example -- pausing a millisecond afterward to let the 
absurdity penetrate -- you want to laugh. And his man/child character here is a 
variation of the kind he has previously played so adeptly in feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, though, Walker's immaturity is grating and the premiere's attempts at 
humor are clumsy, as is Harvey Fierstein's effeminate designer character, a 
walking cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 Silk jersey or no silk jersey, "Daddy's Girls" looks to be a bad fit for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you're seeking a real campy hoot, though, "Touched by an Angel" may be the 
answer to your prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Roma Downey, best known to U.S. audiences as Jackie Kennedy in the miniseries 
"A Woman Called Jackie," is an angel called Monica in this feminized version of 
Michael Landon's old NBC series, "Highway to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 A sort of novice angel who is getting her first shot at the big time, Monica's 
assignment from God is to hang around Earth and help mortals in need. Tonight 
that turns out to be a sad little boy who lives with his police officer father, 
his guilt-ridden mother having run off after being involved in a car crash that 
killed her daughter. Somehow, Monica must find a way to reunite this family. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monica is the kind of looker a lot of people would like to be touched 
by, the premiere's only life form is Della Reese as Monica's acerbic mentor 
angel, Tess. At least when Tess is around, your eyelids lighten somewhat. 
Otherwise, things get pretty clunky, including when the screen turns all chalky 
each time Monica performs an angelic act of epic proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more basically, if you were the Almighty and wanted to send an angel to 
help earthlings without attracting the notice of "Hard Copy" or "A Current 
Affair," would you put her in a see-through dress and have her look like the 
sexy Monica? 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the most memorable straight-faced scenes of the new season, the 
thinly clad Monica shows up at the little kid's house, where she shoots the 
father one of her flirty looks and applies for the job as nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it is," the father says stonily, as if shaking the cobwebs 
from his hormones, "but I got a good feeling about you." Consequently, he hires 
Monica without even checking her references. Obviously, he hasn't seen "The 
Hand That Rocks the Cradle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Touched by an Angel" is excruciatingly slow, putting Monica through a period 
of disillusionment and sassy reproach from Tess before grinding to its 
inevitable wondrous ending. With "Roseanne" and "Grace Under Fire" looming 
opposite them on ABC, here are a couple of angels who themselves may need a 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 * "All-American Girl" airs Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 
and 42). "Daddy's Girls" premieres at 8:30 tonight, followed at 9 p.m. by the 
premiere of "Touched by an Angel," on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). "The Cosby 
Mysteries" premieres at 8 p.m. on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

A GLAMOROUS HOTHOUSE VIOLET; COMMENTARY: JESSICA LANGE'S STRIKING PERFORMANCE 
IN "BLUE SKY" IS BELATEDLY RELEASED. HOW COME THIS SUPERB ACTRESS ISN'T WORKING 
MORE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jessica Lange's acting in "Blue Sky" leaves you awe-struck. It's a great 
performance. Because the film, which was shot in 1990, is just now being 
released -- it's yet another foundling from the pre-bankrupt Orion Pictures era 
-- its appearance is like a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an especially welcome gift because Lange hasn't been acting much in the 
movies lately. (She'll appear in "Losing Isaiah" in November.) She starred on 
TV in 1992 in "O Pioneers!" and, later that year, on Broadway as Blanche DuBois 
in "A Streetcar Named Desire." But her two most recent movies are "Cape Fear" 
(1991) and "Night and the City" (1992). 
</P>
<P>
 You have to wonder how it is that Lange could give the performance she gave in 
"Blue Sky" -- it's probably her best, even better than her Frances Farmer in 
"Frances" or her Patsy Cline in "Sweet Dreams" -- and keep away from the 
cameras for so long. The lack of good roles for actresses is no excuse. Lange 
is the kind of actress film artists write great roles for . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lange's role in "Blue Sky" as Carly, a manic-depressive Army wife, is, at 
least superficially, one of those life-force sexpot vamps who periodically turn 
up in the movies in order to reduce stalwart men to foaming fumblers. She's 
conceived as a sort of cross between a Tennessee Williams hothouse violet -- a 
deranged, damaged maiden -- and a late '50s/early '60s glamorpuss in the 
Marilyn Monroe style. (The action is set in 1962.) 
</P>
<P>
 Part of what Lange accomplishes with Carly is to demonstrate how close in 
neurotic temperament these two female incarnations really are. They both rise 
and fall on the fragilities of beauty. The loss of beauty -- or at least its 
illusion -- becomes the loss of self. 
</P>
<P>
 Carly knows she is still beautiful, and she exults in her own good fortune. 
She sashays with the humor of a woman who believes herself blessed -- the gods 
must want her to entertain them too. Carly models her look on the reigning 
movie queens: Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Bardot. She has seized on movie-star 
glamour for its power to transpose her life into a swoony, scandalous fantasy. 
The irony is that Carly is an original -- the more she mimics her fanzine idols 
the more she emerges in all her ravaged singularity. When she's manic she's too 
much for herself -- too ferociously pent-up and passionate -- and that's 
exactly the state she craves. She needs the fix of delirium. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a trial to her two daughters, who indulge her episodes with a mixture of 
horror and annoyance. (They're like abused seraphim.) She's a trial to her 
husband, Hank, an Army radiation scientist, played by Tommy Lee Jones, who 
decided a long time ago just to love her unconditionally. (The felt, 
underplayed graciousness of his performance helps make Lange's possible. And, 
of course, few directors could work more wonders with actors than Tony 
Richardson -- this was his last film.) 
</P>
<P>
 But, on some essential level, Carly's deliriums have so much more romantic 
feeling, so much more danger, than anything else in her family's life that she 
has become indispensable to their will. She's a maddening creature in full 
swoon but, when she's in a generous mood, she transforms their dullsville life 
into a high-spirited casbah. (The black comedy of the piece is that Carly makes 
her husband and children miserable so she can commiserate with them in their 
misery and make them whole.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carly's high spirits lift her way off the ground, but she can't stay up there 
forever. It's when she comes down with a crash that she terrifies. When Hank -- 
partly because of Carly's take-it-all-off high jinks -- is transferred at the 
start of the film from Hawaii to a military base in Alabama, Carly's sensual, 
dolled-up funniness inflames to a full-scale rage. Her baby talk and sweet 
smiles, so transparently protective, burn away, and she flees her run-down new 
home until Hank tracks her down in a supply store like a cornered animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see that radiation just coming off you," she wails at Hank, who talks 
her down with an infinitely comforting patience. He rescues her again, and, yet 
again, she will betray him. But as she approaches her in this scene, Carly's 
eyes shine in admiration for her rescuer. The harridan has turned into a 
supplicant. 
</P>
<P>
 Carly's rages are scary because they don't have the self-dramatizing play-act 
quality of her swoony, rapt episodes. When she's dancing her flamenco for a 
bunch of wide-eyed soldiers at the base in Hawaii, or even when she's just 
dancing sinuously by herself, she has a dreamy, comic quality that lets us know 
she's in on her own self-delusion. She plays to an audience even if that 
audience is herself. (In a sense, the role is all about the illusionary, 
crazy-making art of acting.) 
</P>
<P>
 But, when she feels trapped and cornered, her voice drops from a hushed 
Southern breathiness to a hard, low-slung rasp. (The vocal shifts are 
reminiscent of Vivien Leigh's Blanche in the movie version of "Streetcar.") Her 
movements becomes jagged. She's not self-dramatizing in these moments; there's 
no bravura, no studied self-awareness, nothing to distance her (or us) from her 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see why she avoids the pain -- it strips away her camouflage and 
leaves her ragged and illusionless. When she's high, she's hellbent to stay 
that way. She has a split-second sensuality; she can turn it on in an instant 
-- before the despair crowds in. When she thinks Hank is losing his love for 
her, she sits up at night while he sleeps; when he wakes up and sees her, she 
asks him if he still loves her and then, before he can answer, advances upon 
him like an uncoiled dream walker. 
</P>
<P>
 As the distressed Frances Farmer in "Frances," Lange sometimes had the lurid, 
scary, powder-burned look of a figure in a Weegee photograph. In "Blue Sky," 
Lange's Carly, at low ebb, sometimes has the bereft, denuded look of a woman in 
an Edward Hopper painting. Carly can appear so languorously sad -- it's not the 
way we want to see her. (Sadness doesn't make her soulful; it saps her.) 
</P>
<P>
 You can almost forgive her hurtful sprees -- like the way she carries on with 
the base commander in full view of everybody -- because it's her way of 
murdering despair. Carly's seductions hurt everyone around her, but, for her, 
they're not quite real. She doesn't want to be "real." She wants to retreat 
into her own movie-glamour authenticity, and the men she seduces are just 
play-actors in her pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 Carly ends up a heroine by rescuing Hank from a nasty military double-cross. 
After saving her so many times, she saves him. It's a supreme act of love, and 
Lange has prepared us for Carly's strength by already showing us, in flashes, 
the depth of that love and the mettle in her mania. Without this last-inning 
righteousness, Carly might seem too overpoweringly deluded, too neurotically 
"womanly" for modern audiences. But she'd be a great character even without 
this final triumph. Her greatness is in not holding anything back. 
</P>
<P>
 The real heroism in "Blue Sky" is the way Jessica Lange doesn't hold anything 
back. She has so much to give. It's a fierce display.

RICE'S ABOUT-FACE: CRUISE IS LESTAT; AFTER SCREENING 'INTERVIEW WITH THE 
VAMPIRE,' AUTHOR LAUDS HIS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anne Rice fans, listen up. The author who once slammed the makers of 
"Interview With the Vampire" for casting Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the movie 
version of her best-seller has reversed her opinion after seeing a pre-release 
screening. In fact, she "loved" the picture, which opens in early November, and 
has decided to publicly endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice's assistant, Suzie Quiroz, who's been an officer of the author's 
3,500-member fan club since 1985, said her boss even "loved (the actors') 
performances" after seeing the film last Friday. These are the same actors Rice 
once slung arrows at, comparing their casting to putting "Huck Finn and Tom 
Sawyer" in the roles of French-speaking 19th-Century vampires. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer, who lives in her native New Orleans, once publicly zinged the 
young actors, particularly Cruise, telling The Times that the star's "mom and 
apple pie" persona didn't mesh with the European, impish, proud, 
semi-androgynous Lestat she created on the page. Rice said she was "stunned by 
the casting of Cruise, who is no more my vampire Lestat than Edward G. Robinson 
is Rhett Butler," noting she envisioned someone more like Daniel Day-Lewis, 
Jeremy Irons or Peter Weller in the role. 
</P>
<P>
 One of "Vampire's" producers, David Geffen, said that after the screening, 
Rice told him she thought the film "went way beyond her expectations" and that 
Cruise in particular was "wonderful." He noted, "She even phoned (Tom) up and 
told him she was wrong. It's a great thing when someone who had been critical 
of a movie saw it, loved it and admitted she was wrong . . . a very classy 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise confirmed that he did speak to Rice last Friday and said simply: "We 
had a fantastic conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's director, Neil Jordan ("The Crying Game"), reached in Dublin late 
Monday, said he hadn't spoken to Rice, who had also written three versions of 
the screenplay. But he said he was "very glad she's finally happy. This has 
always been her book and that's important. I loved her book and I really wanted 
to be true to it," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 So true that those involved with the $50-million Geffen Pictures' production 
for Warner Bros. say Jordan even added more scenes from the book than Rice 
herself included in her versions of the screenplay. Nobody associated with the 
picture, including Jordan, would address those scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Warners executives were naturally pleased to get Rice's stamp of approval. 
Studio spokesman Robert Friedman downplayed the jeering of some audience 
reaction to the film's trailer, attributing the negative reaction to Rice 
loyalists. "Now with her support that should stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the film was first screened for test audiences, Geffen said many felt 
there was "a little too much blood and violence." A Warner's source said Geffen 
insisted that all of the footage initially be shown, despite what the producer 
said were some objections by Jordan to excise some scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Geffen wanted to get a feel for what the audience wanted. Eventually, 
Warners said about 20 minutes of footage was moved around or cut and the final 
version that will hit theaters Nov. 11 is 1 hour and 58 minutes long. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, originally scheduled to be released Nov. 18, was moved up so that 
Warners could have a longer stretch to push the film during the Thanksgiving 
holiday period, one of the biggest box-office periods of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new release date could hinder another big horror film coming out the 
week before on Nov. 4: Kenneth Branagh's version of "Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein," with Robert DeNiro and Helena Bonham Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitor sources said they are a bit worried about the TriStar Pictures' 
release since it will only have a week to gather steam before "Vampire" 
competes for audience dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 A TriStar spokesman said the studio had no plans to push the release date up 
to Halloween weekend, beginning Oct. 29, as speculated. Studios are 
increasingly releasing movies weeks in advance of the popular moviegoing 
Thanksgiving holiday to take advantage of longer playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year is no different," said one exhibitor. "They want to get as much 
box-office blood out of this holiday period as they can." Perhaps that too, he 
quipped, will please Anne Rice.

ROSEANNE'S CHANGES DON'T SPILL OVER INTO 'ROSEANNE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Roseanne is a Roseanne is a Roseanne. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorce action is proceeding. The estranged husband and business partner 
is on to other things. And "Roseanne," starring Roseanne, is back on track for 
its seventh season. Producers say the show remains very much the same -- only 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since fans of the popular ABC comedy last saw the struggling 
Conner family in a first-run episode, the star, Roseanne Arnold, filed for 
divorce, withdrew the filing, filed again and announced she was dropping her 
last name. Ex-husband Tom Arnold, who had been an executive producer on 
"Roseanne," struck out with his CBS show, "Tom," but struck gold with his role 
in the summer movie "True Lies." Both acquired new, younger love interests. And 
"Roseanne" was given a new time slot, flip-flopping with "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Although viewers might expect that so much change would result in dramatic 
alterations in the tone and direction of "Roseanne," executive producer and 
head writer Rob Ulin indicated that the more things change, the more they 
remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show itself will not change," Ulin said. "Yes, Tom is no longer with us, 
but we're not trying to reinvent the show. We're just trying to keep it 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 With Tom Arnold out of the picture, Roseanne, who is also an executive 
producer, is taking a more active role behind the scenes, Ulin said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Conner family will have more than its share of difficulties this season, 
as always. All the family members, including the boyfriend of daughter Darlene 
and the husband of daughter Becky are now living under one roof. Roseanne will 
cope with the fact that there are more boys than girls in her house. The 
biggest change of all: Roseanne gets pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 But viewers can count on one tradition staying true to form, said Ulin: "Yes, 
we will have a big Halloween show." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Roseanne" starts its new season at 9 tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42).

FACED WITH $100,000 SHORTFALL, KPCC IS FORCED TO TRIM STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public radio station KPCC-FM (89.3) is facing its worst financial crisis ever 
as a result of what is being described as a $100,000 "accounting error." 
</P>
<P>
 The station, which is operated by Pasadena City College on an annual budget of 
about $1 million, was recently found to have less money in its coffers than was 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the shortfall, KPCC executives fired a promotions employee, 
reduced the hours of some other employees and reduced the number of days for 
the popular music hall-style show hosted by Ian Whitcomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had more money than we did," program director Larry Mantle said 
Tuesday. "I've never had to lay people off before and it's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Mantle stressed that the station is "not in danger of going under." 
</P>
<P>
 Station officials decided that cutting back personnel was preferable to 
cutting out costly -- but popular -- NPR programs such as "All Things 
Considered." (That program costs an estimated $60,000 yearly.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do things that won't affect as much the sound of what's on 
the air," Mantle said. "That's going to be the last thing we touch." 
</P>
<P>
 He said KPCC may hold an emergency fund-raising drive to help offset the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have to let more people go yet," Mantle said. "The hard part is what 
it's going to mean to the lives of people who work at the station. Needless to 
say, our staff is on pins and needles right now."

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; IS HAVING GUN 
AROUND HOUSE WORTH UPSHOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To arm or not to arm. 
</P>
<P>
 For many law-abiding people, that has increasingly become the question, as 
crime has become pervasive, and public fear has risen correspondingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad guys have guns, people reason, so why shouldn't they? 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, a gun around the house can have tragic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Thomas Alford, Johnny Sanchez, Susan Kaleta, Pablo Martinez, Victor 
Tamayo and a 12-year-old who apparently believed he was plenty old enough to 
handle a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is a San Fernando Valley resident, who, during the past few weeks either 
used a gun or had a gun used against him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 One allegedly shot his business partner in a fit of anger. Another shot an 
intruder allegedly breaking into her home. A third shot his best friend by 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was killed, but all had extremely close calls. And for better or worse, 
each incident occurred because there was a gun in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The first happened about midnight Sept. 2. Fourteen-year-old Victor Tamayo was 
at the Van Nuys home of his 12-year-old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger boy's father was sleeping in the bedroom. Police said the boys 
were in the living room, sitting on the coach, watching a video -- and playing 
with a revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old later told police he had found the gun in a park near his home 
after Little League practice. He said he didn't think it was loaded. He had 
pulled the trigger, spun the chamber, and taken the gun apart, all with no 
indication it contained any cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after finding the revolver, and countless hours playing with it, the 
boy told police that the first indication he had that it was loaded was when he 
pointed it at Victor that night, and at close range, shot him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor survived. And the shooting was ruled an accident, so no charges were 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's sorry, very sorry," the shooter's stepfather said afterward. "He doesn't 
want to play with guns anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, and several miles away on a hot, sunny afternoon in Reseda, 
Alford and Sanchez were arguing outside Alford's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were partners in a trash-hauling business that was started to clear 
away earthquake debris left on streets, and had recently bought a 
garbage-hauling truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, they couldn't decide which of them was supposed to make the 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of resolving their problem over a beer, or consulting a mutual 
friend or even a lawyer, police say, Alford ran back into his house, retrieved 
his pistol and shot his friend, once in the abdomen and once in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the 63-year-old Alford faces an attempted murder charge, and Sanchez, 41, 
faces months, maybe years, of physical pain, and the haunting memory that he 
was allegedly nearly killed in a dispute over a garbage truck with a man he was 
supposed to trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of pain," a relative who asked to remain unidentified said. "In 
his body and in his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, even when a handgun that is bought for protection serves its 
intended function -- to frighten, to maim, or to kill an intruder -- there may 
be little cause for celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of Sept. 9, Kaleta, 47, heard a noise at the front window of 
her house in Winnetka. A man -- police say it was 28-year-old Pablo Martinez -- 
was removing a screen, trying to get inside. 
</P>
<P>
 During the previous nine months, Kaleta, who lives alone, had twice reported 
burglary attempts to police, but she had apparently been able to scare the 
burglar off both times. 
</P>
<P>
 This time though, the secretary had only enough time to retrieve her gun and 
dial 911 before the man had climbed through the window and into the house. 
Despite a blaring burglar alarm and Kaleta's warning for him to stop, the 
unarmed man kept coming toward her, Kaleta told police. 
</P>
<P>
 While she was on the telephone with a 911 operator, she fired, striking him in 
the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to file charges against Kaleta. It is unknown how she feels 
about having fired her gun, because neighbors say she has for the most part 
stayed inside her house since the shooting, a change from her previous 
gregariousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Martinez faces a burglary charge -- in addition to possibly 
permanent paralysis, police said.

STANLEY'S DREAMS HAVE BECOME REALITY; SOCCER: USC WOMEN'S COACH THINKS 
POSSIBILITIES ARE UNLIMITED FOR PROGRAM IN BURGEONING SPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the first things Karen Stanley did when she moved into her office at 
USC's Heritage Hall was to hang the poster on the wall behind her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just any poster. This one had been carefully guarded on its journey across 
the Pacific. This one, lilac-colored and covered in Chinese characters, is both 
a reminder and an inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 It reminds Stanley of the highlight of her career -- not as a soccer player or 
soccer coach, but as a soccer spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 She was there, in Guangzhou, China, on the night of Nov. 30, 1991, when U.S. 
soccer history was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the stands at Tianhe Stadium, surrounded by a small group of 
Americans and 60,000 Chinese, she watched in disbelief and delight as the U.S. 
team defeated Norway, 2-1, for the first FIFA Women's World Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley remembers the winning goal almost in slow motion, frame by frame, as 
U.S. striker Michelle Akers-Stahl stole the ball, drew the Norwegian goalkeeper 
out of position, eluded her, then stabbed the shot into the empty net. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," Stanley said. "I can't believe I was there for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone else who was there that night was Joy Fawcett, one of the key 
defenders on the world championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the two are together again, not as spectator and player, but as 
cross-town rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett, still a vital part of the U.S. team that will defend its title in 
Sweden next summer, is the women's soccer coach at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley, who will travel to Sweden to support the U.S. squad, is USC's women's 
soccer coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule calls for the Bruins and Trojans to meet twice this season, the 
first time at USC next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's going to be difficult," Stanley said. "(Fawcett) is a great coach 
and a great recruiter. They're going to be tough. Every year it's going to be a 
great rivalry, just like in the other sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley, 32, has come a long way in soccer and her rise parallels the rapid 
growth of the women's game over the last quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970 her father, who is from the former Yugoslavia, began volunteering his 
time as an American Youth Soccer Assn. (AYSO) referee in Claremont and 
encouraged his 8-year-old daughter to discover the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Why don't you try it?' " Stanley recalls. "I got into it and found 
out the real love of life, no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley's passion for soccer developed further at Claremont High, but in those 
days competitive girls' soccer was still something of a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went there, they didn't have a girls' team, they had a boys' team," 
Stanley said. "So starting in my junior year, I played on the boys' team. It 
was not controversial, but it was an issue. It was very new, and people 
couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great time, a lot of great experiences. I learned a lot. The year 
after I graduated, they got a girls' team, so I missed out a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing was true at the next step in her career. Again, women's soccer 
on the college level was just beginning to find its feet and Chico State, 
Stanley's school, was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone had a club team," Stanley said. "We played Cal, Stanford, Santa 
Clara, San Diego -- all the teams that are now top Division I teams. But at 
that point, 1980 through '84, no one was divisional, no one was varsity, we 
were all club status. 
</P>
<P>
 "My last year up there, everyone started going varsity. That was in '84. The 
first (U.S. women's) national team was (founded in) 1985." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, girls and women play high school and college soccer all over the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures compiled by the National Federation of State High School 
Assns., 5,463 high schools field girls' soccer teams, involving 166,173 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, figures from the NCAA reveal that 387 affiliated universities have 
teams, including 103 Division I schools. Total participation, the NCAA said, is 
8,226 players. The numbers have tripled in the last 10 years and doubled in the 
last five. 
</P>
<P>
 Add in the more than 150 NAIA and NJCAA colleges that field women's soccer 
teams and the level of participant interest in the sport is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Stanley graduated from Chico State with a bachelor's degree in 
physical education and a master's in wellness, there were not many soccer jobs 
to be had. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what I was going to do or where I was going to go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting with Seattle Pacific soccer Coach Cliff McGrath changed that. 
McGrath talked Stanley into heading north to begin a women's club program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got me started in coaching," she said. "He employed me full-time at his 
(soccer) camp and I directed international tours for him and did his club 
program at Seattle Pacific. It was great. I had a thousand part-time soccer 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun but it was frustrating because we were a club and we were playing 
against varsity teams. There were nine NAIA schools and then us. There was no 
money. I spent all my own money on recruiting. It was going nowhere, then Notre 
Dame showed up out of the blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley had met the two Notre Dame soccer coaches, Mike Bertucelli and Chris 
Petrucelli, and got along well with both. Offered an assistant coaching 
position, she jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 That lasted two years, or until USC expressed interest in starting a women's 
program. In April, 1993, Stanley came on board as head coach of the fledgling 
Trojan soccer team, with instructions to build it from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew from the second that I got back on the plane to fly back to South Bend 
after my (USC) interview that if they offered me the job, I'd take it," Stanley 
said. "There was no doubt in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a combination of things. It's very diverse here, in terms of 
ethnicity and culture, and (school officials) really try to work within the 
city with a lot of different people. I really like that attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing is that in the athletic department here, it seems to me that 
everybody helps everybody else. Soccer is a relatively small sport at a big 
football school, but I never feel that way. I can tell just by the way people 
react. Everyone is there to support you." 
</P>
<P>
 The first year was anything but easy, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got here in April and I was trying to recruit for the following fall," 
Stanley said. "But all the players who were signing letters of intent had 
already signed. And I had one scholarship. And I didn't know the players out 
here because I was educated on the players back East and in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely just a scramble. I didn't have an assistant coach. It was 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wonderful challenge, but I felt like I was swimming in the ocean and 
getting hit by waves. I'd come up again and get hit in the face by another one. 
It was never ending. It was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder, then, that USC finished that first season 2-15-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a great group, but they just weren't Division I caliber," Stanley 
said. "The schedule was really demanding, especially for a new program. It was 
almost like a club trying to compete against varsity. We just weren't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other thing is, we weren't (at USC), we were out at Cal Tech in Pasadena. 
We didn't have a soccer field. So every day we had to drive vans out there. In 
preseason, twice a day. It was probably an hour out of the kids' study time and 
going out there in smoggy Pasadena was a toll on the kids and the program. In 
addition to losing, it was hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're on campus, thanks to (USC Athletic Director) Mike Garrett and 
(football Coach) John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like in awe. I know at a major football school like this they certainly 
don't have to do that. (Robinson) and his entire staff are just so supportive. 
I feel like they're big brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other huge thing that happened is that Mike Garrett gave us four more 
scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
 USC is playing as an independent this year for the last time. Next season, 
women's soccer will be a Pac-10 sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to do most of my recruiting in Southern California because I think 
there's great talent here," she said. "At all the big California tournaments I 
go to, I see all the college coaches from back East out here. So it's exciting 
to be at a school like this and to track that kind of talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm where I want to be for the rest of my life. I believe that we have the 
chance to be very successful here." 
</P>
<P>
 And next year, the poster from Sweden '95 will go up alogside the one from 
China '91.

GAP WIDENING IN NHL TALKS; ANALYSIS: EACH SIDE STICKING TO ITS PLAN FOR HELPING 
SMALL-MARKET CLUBS, STABILIZING COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly seven hours of talks Tuesday between the NHL Players Assn. and the 
league produced an agreement to meet again today in New York. That accord -- 
and where to order out for lunch -- were the only common ground they reached in 
their longest bargaining session to date. 
</P>
<P>
 No areas of potential compromise have emerged from the 12 hours of discussion 
in the last two meetings. If anything, the gap has widened, as each side 
adheres to its approach to stabilizing costs and helping small-market clubs 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some serious philosophical differences have to be resolved if we're going to 
have a deal," said Bob Goodenow, executive director of the players association. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring sudden and major concessions from either side, it's unlikely a new 
agreement will be in place by Oct. 1, when the season is scheduled to open. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, who went all of last season without a contract, have said they 
are willing to do so again if necessary. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has 
already gotten authorization from owners to invoke a lockout, although he has 
repeatedly refused to say how seriously he is considering that option. 
</P>
<P>
 The league on Tuesday rejected a proposal by the players in which a 5% levy 
would be imposed on clubs' revenues and the proceeds disbursed to clubs in 
small markets. Owners remain fixed on salary controls, as embodied in their 
plan to set a payroll limit and penalize clubs that exceed that figure. The 
money would go to small-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're hell-bent for leather on having a salary cap," a source among the 
players said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said owners scoffed at the union's claim that its levy on revenues 
would raise $35 million. Their estimate was $20 million, which they deemed 
insufficient to help clubs such as Winnipeg and Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' last proposal, rejected last week by players, would also abolish 
arbitration -- which the players want to retain -- and relax restrictions on 
free agency. However, according to that plan, clubs would retain the right to 
match offers made to free agents. Players want unfettered free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the hard-bargaining Bettman, owners clearly maintain the upper hand. By 
unilaterally imposing 19 conditions -- including the reduction of game rosters 
from 18 skaters to 17, forcing players to pay their own way to training camp 
and obligating those who earn more than $350,000 to pay their own medical 
insurance -- Bettman cleverly gave himself a handful of bargaining chips to 
play later, when he needs to pressure players into making significant 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 He can now, in the customary give-and-take of negotiations, relent on some of 
those points and appear to be giving something up while actually coming out 
even. For example, he will probably agree to restore rosters to 18 skaters. He 
appears magnanimous, when all that will do is give players exactly what they 
had before -- yet it will make them feel they avoided losing jobs. He can also 
give back the training-camp expense money, with the same effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Players have no intention of striking. It would do them no good economically 
or in a public relations sense. If Bettman locks them out, he and the owners 
would be cast as the bad guys, and that's how the players want it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman will use the implied threat of a lockout to weaken the players' 
resolve. And there are some cracks in their unity on the point of a salary cap 
for rookies, and he will probably exploit that opening. He's a tough 
negotiator. Ask the league's on-ice officials. He called their bluff when they 
threatened a walkout a year ago, and in the end, he got the four-year agreement 
he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman will want a long agreement with the players too, in order to avoid 
this mess again for several years and to help clubs project their expenses. 
Players, who have seen the salary average rise from $201,000 in the 1988-89 
season to $520,000 last season, will probably want a shorter deal so they can 
cash in if salaries and league revenues continue their strong growth.

KINGS SIMPLY WANT TO FORGET; HOCKEY: THE CLUB HOPES THINGS WORK OUT FOR MCNALL, 
BUT FOCUS IS ON GETTING READY FOR SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The post-McNall era is under way for the Kings, and not a moment too soon for 
a hockey franchise trying to conduct business as usual while its most visible 
figure not named Wayne is on such thin ice that a fleet of Zambonis couldn't 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 What was Bruce McNall doing at that Kings' exhibition in San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
 "Signing autographs constantly," said Joe Cohen, the new chairman of the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall continues to cast a large shadow over the team he owned until financial 
difficulties forced him to sell 72% of the operation last May. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Kings play the New York Rangers tonight at the Forum in the first of 
their three home exhibitions, McNall will be there, probably signing autographs 
as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Kings move on, especially in the front office. Since May 16, 
when Cohen and business partner Jeffrey Sudikoff bought the majority interest 
in the Kings, 15 front-office employees have left. Ten were fired right away, 
among them General Manager Nick Beverley, and five more have left since. 
</P>
<P>
 In the marketing department, the nine-person staff lost four. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Salata, the publications director, said he has been too busy to be 
worried. "Our staff is so small, we all thought, 'Well, OK, let's get going,' " 
he said. "I haven't really had time to come in here and be down about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the Kings have made no plans involving staff reductions in the 
event of an owners' lockout, a possibility as the NHL and the players' union 
continue negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Salata: "As a working stiff, I'm at the mercy of many elements. I go full 
bore until somebody tells me to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 No one is telling anyone to stop anything right now. In fact, the new King 
bosses are aggressively operating the franchise, pushing season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings sold 11,959 season tickets last season, coming off their unexpected 
drive into the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite last season's disappointment -- they failed to make the playoffs 
-- the Kings still had sold 10,954 season tickets by Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a few high-priced seats, about 5% of the Forum, the Kings did not 
increase season-ticket prices. The average price is $37. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings also offered a payment plan for season tickets for the first time 
and initiated a 12-game mini-season ticket plan beginning at the start of the 
season. Previously, the mini-plan wasn't offered until January. 
</P>
<P>
 There is hope that the attention the Kings get will soon shift to the ice and 
away from McNall's legal and financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Burkholder of Hawthorne, a season-ticket holder for 20 years, said when he 
thinks about the Kings, he doesn't think about McNall. "I personally don't even 
care," he said. "I'm more concerned about them starting Kelly Hrudey in the net 
more than anything now." 
</P>
<P>
 Season-ticket holder Jack Kates of Cypress is a member of the Forum's Section 
12 club, which has its own newsletter. Kates is known in those parts by his 
nickname, "Pull the Goalie." 
</P>
<P>
 Kates, who runs an automotive advertising agency, said McNall should be held 
up to scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone (cheats) me for something-million dollars, I don't like it too 
much," Kates said. "I do not like dishonesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Bruce McNall does not affect the way I feel about the Kings. The only 
thing that irritates me is the trade with Pittsburgh that gave away (Luc) 
Robitaille, the greatest left wing in the history of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are banking on that kind of reaction in the face of McNall's 
continuing problems, believing that hockey will be the topic of concern and 
that the Kings will be allowed to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the Kings continue to stand behind McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kings are stable," he said. "We are happy to have Bruce's help. We care 
about him and we hope that everything will work out well for him." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, who bought the Kings from Laker owner Jerry Buss in 1988, faces 
criminal charges stemming from a federal grand jury investigation into his 
financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall sold 72% of the Kings largely to pay off $90 million in loans and 
credit from Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 28% share of the team he retained, McNall also kept 100% ownership 
of four Slap Shops, which sell King merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said it is up to the Kings to make sure the focus is on them, not their 
former owner. "When the Kings win, that's the story," he said. "When the Kings 
don't win, there are all sorts of stories." 
</P>
<P>
 One story Cohen would like to see written is about an agreement to build a new 
hockey arena. It hasn't happened yet, although he said the Kings have 
investigated potential sites downtown, near the Forum, in El Segundo, Hawthorne 
and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, Sudikoff and Lester Wintz, the new executive vice president, make up 
the Kings' stadium task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen emphasized that he has a genial working relationship with Buss, who owns 
the Forum and holds the Kings' lease until July of 2018. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate the goodwill, Cohen said Buss had made "lease adjustments." The 
Kings pay Buss about $10 million a year under terms of the lease, which calls 
for 12% of the gross revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports in March said that Buss had offered to reduce the rent by $2 million 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Kings are tying the laces of their skates for the first 
time this season. There will be hockey on the ice. Unless there's a lockout, of 
course.

MIKE DOWNEY: FROM TOP, AGASSI EYES A CLIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Agassi kept yawning Tuesday when he telephoned an old sportswriter 
acquaintance in California (where we are so much nicer than those wackos in New 
York). He sounded like someone who had been up all night, or maybe had not come 
down yet from jumping over the U.S. Open's net. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of the final, the winner and new champ had dinner with his brother 
and his manager and his inspiration, Brooke Shields, and his benefactor, Nike 
grand master Phil Knight, and together they lifted a glass to Agassi's success. 
Around 2 o'clock in the morning, Andre, still tossing and turning, got out of 
bed, made himself a sandwich and sat up thinking for the next few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York was a zoo," said Agassi, who will play Michael Chang in an 
exhibition Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Forum. "It was a wild experience and I had 
trouble coming down. Between thinking and feeling the pain in my legs from two 
weeks of pounding, I couldn't get back to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking about . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Thinking about life and how weird it can be. Here I am, I've never felt 
better about my tennis or my life. This is the best I've ever played, the best 
I've ever trained, the most focused I've ever been and the happiest I've ever 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 "And to think that it wasn't so long ago that my wrist injury hurt so much, it 
was definitely a possibility that I might never play tennis again. I had to 
deal with that reality. I had to totally recommit myself to the game, or else 
find something else to do with my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, don't ask!" Andre said. "It's way, way too premature for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi, sports announcer? Andre Agassi, tennis instructor? Andre Agassi, 
uh, mayor of Palm Springs? 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi, actor, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 A Broadway producer recently wondered aloud if Agassi could sing or dance. The 
gentleman happens to be producing "Grease" on the New York stage, where Andre's 
girlfriend Brooke is in the process of joining the cast. How about Agassi in 
the Travolta role, black leather jacket, duck-tail hairdo . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, not only can I not sing or dance, I can't even hold a note," 
Agassi said. "You could put a piece of sheet music in front of me and I 
wouldn't know which side was upside down." 
</P>
<P>
 No Hollywood ambitions, then . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, well, that's something else. I wouldn't use the word ambition, exactly, 
but eventually that's something I wouldn't mind looking into. I did a 'Mad 
About You' for TV, but so far that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Hunt was mad about him, in a dream sequence about a fantasy romance. 
Nice work, having Helen Hunt fantasize about you. 
</P>
<P>
 "True," Agassi agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe do a movie now where you get to be an action hero and carry a 
weapon and team up Andre with Arnold and Sylvester and . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't think so," Andre said, yawning. "This is not how I see me." 
</P>
<P>
 Last time he and an L.A. guy got together, they sat in a Las Vegas coffee shop 
and Andre was about the sweetest kid he had ever met, not including the 
astounding number of Equal packs that the tennis player dumped into his coffee. 
That breakfast with Andre was before his Wimbledon success and before he had 
matured into the man he is today. At that time, Andre was still sleeping on his 
parents' couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down and out and back he has been ever since. Wimbledon put him on top 
of the world. The wrist thing pushed him off. In the rankings, Agassi sank. 
Pete Sampras, Jim Courier and Chang became the American tennis men of the hour. 
It could have been the end of Andre, had he let it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days ago, though, two hours of precision tennis took care of Germany's 
Michael Stich in straight sets, Agassi became champion of the U.S. Open for the 
first time and even Howard J. (Bumpy) Frazier, the unctuous president of the 
U.S. Tennis Assn., was currying favor by proclaiming Agassi to be "the most 
popular tennis player in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 To which Andre responds . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't listen to Bumpy too often. And you be sure to quote me on the 
record." 
</P>
<P>
 Assorted tennis big shots are trying to persuade Agassi to change his mind 
about ducking Davis Cup play, about representing our country along with 
Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I've given Davis Cup five years of my career. I've given it plenty of 
time and effort. Now my priorities have definitely changed. All I want to do 
right now is prepare myself for the fall, for Vienna and Stockholm and Paris. I 
didn't play at all last fall and look what happened to me. Now I could wind up 
back among the top five, if everything goes the way I hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is, you look at what happened to Vitas Gerulaitis and you realize 
how precious life is. You better enjoy it while you're still here, before 
something crazy happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Such as who knows?" Andre said.

FIGHTING DIRTY; EL BAJO, A SEAMOUNT IN THE SEA OF CORTEZ, LURES TUNA THAT KNOW 
HOW TO WIN UGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Cody Butler sat at the bow of the boat, exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 His legs dangling overboard, his chin and arms resting on the aluminum rail, 
he watched a man on a nearby panga struggling with a powerful tuna that had him 
red-faced and flustered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misery," Butler said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 Misery indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The man in the small boat, Bob Mead, 45, from Anaheim, had been playing tug of 
war with the giant fish for nearly an hour, and the stalemate was nowhere near 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at the stern of the Mexican skiff, drenched in sweat under a 
relentless Baja sun, Mead pumped with all his might, but every time he gained a 
little line, the fish took it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, only 14, was recovering from a similar battle, losing when the 
monstrous fish shook its head and snapped the line only a few feet from the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler sighed then, too, but it was as much a sigh of relief as 
disappointment. He had been fighting his fish for about 50 minutes, and things 
had gone anything but smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 The tuna had darted beneath the panga in a last sprint for freedom, tangling 
Butler's line with that of Capt. Juan Romero, 35, who was struggling with a 
tuna of his own on the other side of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero then tried to loosen his drag to let his fish run and possibly untangle 
the line, but his plan backfired. The fish spun line from his reel so fast it 
created a massive backlash and Romero's reel became useless. He tried to 
hand-line the fish, but didn't have a chance.  
</P>
<P>
 Romero's line snapped and he fell back. And then Butler's line broke. 
</P>
<P>
 The tuna, each about four feet long and three feet around, packed with about 
80 pounds of muscle, circled the boat for several minutes as if taunting the 
frustrated anglers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead's fish, an estimated 100-pounder, eventually won its freedom as well, the 
line breaking when the captain grabbed the fish and tried to pull it closer to 
the boat and within range of his gaff.  
</P>
<P>
 Mead looked at his partner, Russell Guidry, in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "He dragged that line right over its teeth," an irritated Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 But off in the distance, another school of tuna surfaced, leaping and lunging 
after small bait fish with such ferocity, an acre of ocean was whipped into a 
froth. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boats sped to the scene and the adrenaline again began to flow through 
the fishermen, who despite their complaining, were eager to relive this chaos 
on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast on the scene, Butler, Mead and Guidry, and others nearby, cast more 
sardines into the heart of activity, and it wasn't long before they were hooked 
up again, rocking and reeling at a remote offshore bank called El Bajo, a 
seamount in the Sea of Cortez about 30 miles from La Paz, east of Espiritu 
Santo Island. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 El Bajo has long been a popular scuba-diving location and is famous for 
hammerhead sharks that circle the underwater peaks by the hundreds, for some 
reason leaving the divers alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin, wahoo, whales and a variety of reef fish and smaller sharks can also 
be seen swimming around the offshore bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent months the seamount has become a refuge of sorts for huge 
schools of giant yellowfin tuna, an elusive species that generally covers a 
great deal of ocean in its search for food. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen generally find tuna where they find porpoises, as the mammals are 
more adept at finding food. A few tuna are caught and then the mammals and fish 
disappear. And if the tuna do stick around in a given area, they usually fall 
victim to commercial net fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 But at El Bajo, the fish are targeted only by sport fishermen, who generally 
fish with line testing 30-60 pounds -- the fish tend to stay away from the 
heavier stuff -- and lose as many as, or more than, they catch. The banks are 
too high -- about 55 feet beneath the surface -- for commercial fishermen, 
whose nets would probably be destroyed by the jagged reefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they put a net down they better say bye-bye, because they are not going to 
get the net back," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, whose panga Tilly Willy is run cooperatively through Hotel Los Arcos, 
and Butler's grandfather, Bob, who manages a fleet from his house next door, 
said the tuna have been at El Bajo for at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Butler provided proof that the tuna are what he terms "residents" of El 
Bajo the other day: a big rusty hook that once belonged to Romero's homemade 
gaff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gaff broke off one day when Romero tried to lift one of those big tunas I 
caught," Butler said. "A month later, he comes to me and brings me this hook -- 
it was sticking out of the head of the tuna I caught in the same place. 
Somebody else caught that tuna a month later." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 El Bajo's newest residents are mostly in the 50- to 100-pound class, but 
Romero has seen them up to 150 pounds. The fish are so strong that many of the 
regulars don't even fish for them, or if they do, they only want one to fill 
the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellowfin tuna -- unlike the more glamorous game fish such as dorado, sailfish 
and marlin, which usually put on acrobatic displays during the fight -- could 
be called the blue-collar fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 They will take a live sardine in a gulp, then usually head straight down, 
bending the stoutest of fiberglass rods with apparent ease. A large tuna will 
stay deep for an hour or more until the pressure becomes too much, then come up 
little by little, saving its strength to make another run. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the fish will rise and change tactics, circling the boat or 
swimming beneath it, sending the arm-weary angler stumbling up and down the 
deck. Those who are not hooked up usually reel in and wait, seemingly getting a 
bigger kick out of watching their shipmates suffer than fighting a fish of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Mead's battle with his monster, Guidry wore a sneaky smile. "I was 
cheering on the tuna," he acknowledged later. 
</P>
<P>
 When the day was over, the two went back to La Paz and told another friend, 
Steve Richards, that he didn't know what he was missing. But what they really 
wanted was to watch their friend get worked over. 
</P>
<P>
 They brought him out the next day and Richards got a first-hand taste of tuna 
toughness. In the middle of the fight a dehydrated Richards cried out, "Beer! 
Beer!" and one of his smiling companions held the bottle to Richards' mouth 
while he guzzled and gasped. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards tried sitting on an ice chest to rest, but the tuna promptly dragged 
him to the bow. Mead and Guidry followed him with the cooler, laughing as 
Richard agonized, eventually landing a four-footer weighing about 70 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards, rarely at a loss for words, was this time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A trip to the tuna grounds begins at dawn on the beach in the bay at La Paz. 
Customers are picked up and taken to the coast, usually a small bay, where the 
captain uses a net to catch sardines. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a course is set for El Bajo, through the channel separating Baja from 
picturesque Espiritu Santo Island, around the south end of the island and out 
into the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip with Romero, he stopped at a small buoy and tossed a few 
sardines. Neon-green dorado sped through the water and inhaled the tiny bait 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero trolled a bare hook and promptly hooked one of the dolphinfish, which 
leaped and shook until finally shaking Romero's hook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hooked a dorado on a bare hook!" an excited Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero then told Butler, who lives in La Paz and sometimes acts as Romero's 
deckhand, to sing "La Cucaracha." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we sing 'La Cucaracha,' the tuna go crazy," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler declined. But Romero began to sing. Surprisingly, after his first 
chorus the water on the horizon began to churn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see? I told you," he said, opening his throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one panga was on the scene. Mead was standing at the stern, grimacing and 
holding on as the 100-pound tuna used its powerful tail to stay down and out of 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler and Romero cast sardines and both hooked up almost immediately. 
Butler's back began to ache after about 20 minutes and he asked for help. 
Romero had his hands full, though, and Butler fought on. 
</P>
<P>
 Then their lines tangled and the fish were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead was still on his fish, though, the tuna holding its own in the dark 
depths of a glassy blue sea. Guidry watched, smiling every time the tuna took 
the line Mead had gained. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler watched, too. But he didn't crack a smile, instead putting himself in 
Mead's shoes and shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misery," he said.

FORMER MCNALL ACCOUNTANT WILL PLEAD GUILTY; JURISPRUDENCE: HOUSTON ADMITS TO 
HAVING ROLE IN PREPARING FALSE TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO HELP 
OBTAIN MILLIONS IN BANK LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert J. Houston, a former accountant for King president Bruce McNall, has 
agreed to plead guilty to three criminal counts for his role in preparing false 
tax returns and financial statements so that McNall could get more than $150 
million in loans to shore up his deteriorating business and financial 
situation, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea is expected to be entered within two weeks. Federal officials on 
Tuesday charged Houston with bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston was accused in court papers of being part of a group of McNall 
officials who for the last eight years fraudulently obtained loans by inflating 
McNall's income, overstating his assets and understating or omitting previous 
loans. Houston's lawyer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials allege that the fraudulent documents, as well as a group of 
"sham companies," enabled McNall officials to get money for horse and coin 
operations as well as a $60-million business loan and a $20-million personal 
loan from Bank of America. Among the financial institutions prosecutors named 
as victims were Bank of America, Bank of California, First Los Angeles Bank, 
Union Bank and Credit Lyonnais, a French bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, whom sources said has been cooperating with the government 
investigation, is the second McNall executive to agree to plead guilty within 
the last month and one of about a dozen former McNall business associates known 
to have been negotiating pleas. Previously, Joanna Orehek, former vice 
president and controller, pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have confirmed that McNall, who was sole owner of the Kings before 
selling 72% of the team this year to pay off a bank loan, has agreed to plead 
guilty to four criminal counts in connection with the bank-fraud investigation. 
He is expected to enter the plea in October. McNall's lawyer, Tom Pollack, said 
Houston's plea was expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the allegations made in the complaint is that Houston and other McNall 
officials participated in a scheme to allow an officer with New York-based 
European American Bank to wipe clean a loan to McNall's troubled movie 
production operation so the officer could get a substantial bonus. Federal 
officials did not identify the official, but sources confirmed it is former 
Chairman Raymond J. Dempsey, who left the bank in 1990. He could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 It also describes how McNall officials orchestrated a phony $20-million 
"circular loan" to two sham companies to get McNall off the hook in personally 
guaranteeing film production loans. Prosecutors allege the $20-million loan was 
represented as an investment by a European consortium in Gladden Entertainment, 
a film production company McNall owned with longtime Hollywood executive David 
Begelman. They further allege McNall officials said the phony investors refused 
to allow McNall to continue to personally guarantee the film loans made by 
Credit Lyonnais, resulting in his release from that obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's legal problems extend beyond his banking practices. The government's 
case has expanded into an investigation of 399 ancient coins worth $3.3 million 
that had been reported missing from securities giant Merrill Lynch's World Coin 
Fund. Sources said McNall was paying installments of $100,000 a month to Zurich 
coin dealer Hans Schram, who reclaimed them when McNall's payment stopped. 
Investigators are looking at whether McNall charged the fund $4 million for the 
coins and wired the money to a Swiss company he owned.

LAKERS GET OK FROM SUNS TO NEGOTIATE WITH CEBALLOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Phoenix Suns have given the Lakers permission to talk to the agent of 
Cedric Ceballos and negotiate a new contract, an important hurdle that might 
indicate a deal is near to return the former Ventura College and Cal State 
Fullerton standout to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The development is significant because Ceballos will need to restructure the 
five-year, $11-million deal he signed in 1993 before the teams can make a trade 
that almost certainly will send a first-round draft pick to the Suns. He is due 
to make $2.1 million this season, but the Lakers' best salary slot is $1.75 
million, so the 25-year-old small forward would have to forgo $350,000 for 
1994-95 and be reimbursed in future years.

<P>
 Agent Fred Slaughter, who has said repeatedly the last few weeks as trade 
rumors swirled that he and Ceballos would be willing to talk about a new 
package, is expected to meet with Laker officials today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to people on both sides of the Colorado," Slaughter said Tuesday, 
"and I expect I will again tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should know something by (Wednesday). I have some meetings with Cedric to 
talk about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry West, Laker executive vice president, declined comment. A Phoenix 
official, feeling confident about his team's depth at forward after the NBA on 
Tuesday gave verbal approval to the contract recently signed by Wayman Tisdale, 
said the Suns are working on a deal, but would not discuss the parties 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns have only one true center, Joe Kleine, after deciding against 
matching the four-year, $10-million contract the Detroit Pistons gave to Oliver 
Miller, and would like to add a backup point guard. But getting a player of any 
quality is almost impossible because of a salary cap technicality. That makes 
an exchange for a No. 1 pick almost an automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, veteran center James Edwards, who spent the last two seasons 
with the Lakers and the year before that with the Clippers, signed with the 
Portland Trail Blazers as a free agent.

HIS REWARD FOR BIG RETURN: BIG PROMOTION; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: USC'S HARRISON 
JOINS STARTING LINEUP AFTER RETURNING AN INTERCEPTION FOR A TOUCHDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For Quincy Harrison, the transition from offense to defense was moving along 
briskly.  
</P>
<P>
 In USC's season-opening victory over Washington, the new cornerback was in for 
six plays.  
</P>
<P>
 No major foul-ups, no muffed assignments. Promising start. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, two Saturdays ago at Penn State, Harrison was in for 16 plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how one of them went: 
</P>
<P>
 USC is on its way to being shut out early in the third quarter. It's 35-0 when 
Penn State quarterback Kerry Collins calls a pass play to his left -- against 
the cornerback the Nittany Lion coaches knew was new to the position.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw his eyes," Harrison said. "He looked right at me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just before the snap, I heard Scott Fields, our free safety, yell at me, 
'It's comin' to our side! It's comin' to our side!'  
</P>
<P>
 "Then Collins looked at me and I knew he was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, behind perfect pass protection, threw a soft pass to Chris Campbell. 
At its apex, the ball looked like a beach ball to Harrison. He closed rapidly 
on the intended receiver, caught the ball with both hands in front of the Penn 
State bench and kept on going, 68 yards, to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way, Harrison ran so fast, the official trying to keep up with the play 
suffered a pulled hamstring and had to leave the game. 
</P>
<P>
 And that one play clinched a promotion. Shortly afterward, Coach John Robinson 
announced that Harrison was USC's new starting right cornerback.  
</P>
<P>
 In one 68-yard play, he had gone from an invisible wide receiver to a starter 
on the other side of the ball. A 5-foot-11, 185-pound redshirt sophomore, 
Harrison was one of the last players recruited by the pre-Robinson USC coaching 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide receiver and sprinter at Eldorado High in Las Vegas, Harrison was on 
his way to Washington when USC assistant Wayne Nunnely intervened.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was planning on going to Washington, but when USC came in late and showed a 
lot of interest in me, well, I really wanted to play at USC. And it's closer to 
home than Washington," Harrison said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Harrison was somewhat adrift in the USC football program. Last season he 
played in a wide receiver corps led by Johnnie Morton, appearing in only one 
game, against Oregon State, and catching no passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clear to me Quincy didn't figure in the offense's plans and I wanted 
to see how he'd play as a cornerback," said Dennis Thurman, who coaches the 
Trojans' cornerbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition began last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches had been hinting around about me moving to defense, so before 
spring practice, I talked to (offensive coordinator) Don Lindsey and Dennis 
Thurman," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he showed the right stuff last spring.  
</P>
<P>
 "For a defensive player, Quincy does some things very naturally," Thurman 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "For one thing, he's a natural tackler. He wraps a guy up immediately. He got 
a lot of good work done last spring on his backpedal and shuffle. He's a quick 
learner."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Harrison: "Coach Thurman is pretty tough on us in practice when we're not 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very big on consistency -- learning how to do something right, and then 
to keep doing it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's made me feel welcome on defense, and I appreciate that. The way I feel 
now, I wouldn't go back to wide receiver. It didn't take me long to figure out 
it's more fun to hit than to get hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most excited TV viewers of Harrison's interception return at Penn 
State were his old coaches at Eldorado High, where Harrison is remembered as a 
big-play wide receiver.  
</P>
<P>
 In his senior season, he caught five passes for more than 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone on campus was talking about it the next day," said Jimmy May, 
Eldorado's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the best athlete in the school and a great kid. His senior year, he 
played on the only state championship team we've had in 23 years. Quincy and 
three other players from that team got four-year scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant coach at Eldorado, Tom Farnsworth, remembers Harrison as an 
athlete with a high level of motivation.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very good basketball player here, but when he decided his future was 
in football, he dropped out of basketball after his sophomore season and spent 
the next two basketball seasons in the weight room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what's it like to make a big defensive play before 96,000? 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wasn't conscious of the crowd or anything," he said. "I was just 
making sure I stayed in bounds. It would've been nicer if we'd won too."

<P>
 Kelly Ford has been hired to assist Cal State Northridge softball Coach Janet 
Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who played for Oklahoma in 1990 and '92, returns to the Matador program 
after a one-year absence.Ford was a graduate assistant in 1993 to former Coach 
Gary Torgeson. She was an assistant at Oklahoma last season.

 Antelope Valley High's Caleb Smith did not suffer a broken right foot as 
originally thought after last week's victory over West Bakersfield. However, 
the senior defensive lineman was unable to practice Monday, and his status for 
this weekend's game against Bakersfield is uncertain, Antelope Valley Coach 
Brent Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who was an All-Golden League selection last year, may benefit from an 
extra day. The game has been moved to Saturday night at Bakersfield College to 
accommodate a bigger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Genevieve quarterback Randy Iaccino will be sidelined six to eight weeks 
because of a broken ankle suffered when he tried to make a cut during the first 
half of last week's 24-0 loss to Paraclete. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Pisano will replace Iaccino this week. The Valiants also will play 
without fullback Vinny Tannous (knee injury) this week. Volleyball

<P>
 Rene Goth, a freshman outside hitter at Cal State Northridge, might play in 
tonight's match at Pepperdine after missing the Northern Arizona tournament 
Friday and Saturday because of an ankle injury suffered against Idaho.

ROYAL STARTS OFF WITH A VICTORY; VOLLEYBALL: HIGHLANDERS DEFEAT THOUSAND OAKS 
IN FOUR GAMES IN MARMONTE OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With dramatic momentum shifts and long emotional rallies, Tuesday night's 
match between the Royal and Thousand Oaks High girls' volleyball teams had the 
atmosphere of a championship event. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks from now it might make a difference, but this was the opening night 
of Marmonte League play for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal defeated Thousand Oaks, 15-13, 15-17, 15-13, 15-12, at Royal in a 
contest that won't change the perception that each league matchup will be a 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a tough league season," Royal Coach Bob Ferguson said. "But 
for the first league game, it's a win and we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal (2-1) was led by a pair of senior outside hitters. Kelly Ahern had 17 
kills, 13 in the final two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Torst had 13 kills and 18 service points for Royal, including a 
school-record seven aces. Royal is ranked 19th in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were fired up to play but we weren't really up until the third 
game," Ahern said. "We weren't talking a lot to each other before then, then we 
stepped up." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitter Michelle Lampkin had four aces for Royal, including one that 
clinched the first game and another on match point. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks (1-2) was led by sophomore middle blocker Jenn Detmer, who had 
12 kills and four blocks. The 6-foot-2 Detmer didn't start but provided a lift 
with four kills in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Detmer had six kills in the third game to help Thousand Oaks rebound from a 
12-7 deficit and pull even, 13-13, before an Ahern serve and Torst kill gave 
Royal a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal opened the match by taking an 11-5 lead. But the Lancers regained their 
composure to score eight consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitter Christy Stueve had two kills and an ace during the run.

MAKING SURE KINGS STAY TRUE TO FORM; HOCKEY: VALLEY NATIVE ROB GLANTZ IS 
POWER-SKATING INSTRUCTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marty McSorley had been on the ice for more than three hours and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivulets of sweat coursed through the stubble on McSorley's face and ran 
downward to drench his gray practice jersey. Similarly soaked, his trademark 
blond curls hung lank and close to his bare head, even as the National Hockey 
League veteran continued to churn his way through another Kings training 
session at the Iceoplex in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating with McSorley were four other defensemen, all of whom had remained 
after practice to seek the advice and criticism of Rob Glantz, a visiting 
power-skating instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz, 30, who grew up in Encino and graduated from Birmingham High in 1982, 
tours the United States and Europe honing the skating form of players from the 
novice to professional levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was because Glantz was unsatisfied with his own blade-running 
that he became affiliated with Laura Stamm, one of power-skating's pioneers. 
Stamm, a former figure skater, was one of the first to teach hockey players how 
to maximize power from each stride by improving their form. 
</P>
<P>
 By applying concepts such as full-length strides, center of gravity and 
correct angles for bending the knees, many players can increase their speed and 
agility. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz knows of few other NHL teams that employ a skating coach, though many 
summer hockey camps and high schools and college teams use them. Undaunted by 
the lack of power-skaters dispersing advice at the pro level, Glantz contacted 
the Kings last season and was an immediate hit once the coaches brought him in. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his schedule, Glantz has limited his time with the Kings to the 
last two training camps. But even with limited exposure, his impact has been 
considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz's broad focus for Thursday afternoon's session was backward skating 
form and pivoting technique. For close to 45 minutes his charges worked their 
way up and down the ice and through footwork drills as Glantz analyzed their 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 "He listens first, takes it all in and explains exactly what's needed," said 
Rob Blake, a 1993-94 NHL all-star. "Everyone skates differently and he's not 
trying to change your style. What's gotten you here has worked and he works 
with the style you already have." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the players Glantz instructs grew up in locations where hockey is the 
highlighted winter sport and many children learn to skate soon after taking 
their first steps. Glantz, however, rose to the level of teaching professional 
while based in the Valley, long before the arrival of Wayne Gretzky and the 
success of the Kings increased area interest in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to skate at 5 years old and I was so bad they put me in goal," 
Glantz recalled with a laugh while sitting in the Kings' narrow locker room at 
the Iceoplex. "The ice surface we played on was no bigger than this room. The 
sport wasn't booming but there were quite a few kids playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Following his older brother, John, up the youth hockey ladder, Rob made 
several regional All-Star teams and was leading scorer on Cal State 
Northridge's club team in the mid-1980's. Despite his performance, Glantz was 
unsatisfied with his skating and sought out Stamm, who earned attention in the 
California hockey community for improving the skating of former King Luc 
Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamm took Glantz under her wing, immersing him both in her philosophies and 
her business. After teaching part-time for several years and increasing his 
contacts in the hockey world, Glantz began training players and teams in 
Western Europe and made power-skating his vocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little things Robbie says make sense right off the bat," McSorley said. 
"I know I'm missing something in my skating and the differences between gaining 
a half and a whole stride are so much of what he is saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Although adjectives such as "lumbering" and "plodding" have been used to 
describe McSorley's skating, he has lasted 11 years in the NHL on grit and a 
determination to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take me longer (to improve) than a 19- or 20-year old because I 
have some pretty defined habits, but I skate every day so why can't I learn 
every day to be a better player?" McSorley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz said he loves working with professional players and finds them 
accepting of his instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys aren't as skeptical as they used to be," Glantz said. "I realize why 
they're professionals because they take nothing for granted, they'll do 
anything to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz also conducts public clinics in the United States and abroad. He will 
oversee one such session Thanksgiving weekend at the Pickwick Arena in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few times I've been in a game and something he taught me suddenly comes 
naturally and it's a great, positive experience," said forward John Druce of 
the Kings. "I think 'I'm really glad he taught me that.' "

HAWKING IN MIX AT CS FULLERTON; BASKETBALL: FORMER SIMI VALLEY HIGH COACH IS 
CANDIDATE FOR JOB IF FILLED ON AN INTERIM BASIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 John Easterbrook began his career as Cal State Fullerton's athletic director 
in whirlwind fashion Tuesday, facing the challenge of replacing Brad Holland as 
basketball coach with the start of workouts only 25 days away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of telephone calls about the position, from people strongly 
interested in it, as well as other people making recommendations," Easterbrook 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It tells me there is a lot of interest in this position, and in Fullerton 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Easterbrook's scheduled meetings on his first day on the job was one 
with Bob Hawking, former Simi Valley High coach who is most likely to be named 
interim coach if the university decides to move in that direction.  
</P>
<P>
 The university normally requires a 30-day posting before a position can be 
filled on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking, who was Holland's top assistant for his two seasons at Fullerton, 
said he is interested in the position. Hawking, 45, has been recommended for 
the job by Holland, a former Crescenta Valley High and UCLA standout who 
resigned to become head coach at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I have good support, and I'm pleased about that," Hawking said. "I've 
been told that some boosters have expressed that, and I know that a group of 
players have done the same thing with the new athletic director. I feel people 
around here have gotten to know me and feel good about what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking has been involved in recruiting every player on the roster except 
senior guard James French. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good opportunity for Brad to move on, and I think it would be a 
great opportunity for me to pick up what he started and keep things going in 
the right direction," Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking was an assistant for two years at Pepperdine after 14 years at Simi 
Valley, where his teams reached the Southern Section playoffs nine times and 
won five Marmonte League championships. His 1988 team, led by Don MacLean, won 
a Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Also mentioned as a possibility for the job is Utah assistant coach Donny 
Daniels, who is a former assistant at Fullerton under George McQuarn. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, who has been at Utah since 1989, said he would be interested in the 
position, but has no plans to apply at this point out of deference to Hawking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Bob and I know he's interested, so I won't contact them about it," he 
said. "If they contact me, that's another matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, who played for Fullerton from 1974-76 and graduated in 1977, believes 
Fullerton will need to move quickly to hire a replacement because of 
recruiting. "But if they name someone on an interim basis, the other recruiters 
will attack that like you wouldn't believe," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Fullerton graduate, Mater Dei High Coach Gary McKnight, also has been 
mentioned as a possibility and has indicated his interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Schermerhorn, coach at Riverside Community College, said he has telephoned 
to make his interest known.

When you're running behind a line that has two 320-pounders. . . . and a 
(6-foot, 190-pound) fullback like Marcel Decir, you get some holes to run

FUNDING MEASURE ON BALLOT 
</P>

 The Cal State Northridge athletic department on Tuesday succeeded in placing 
on next month's student election ballot a measure that could mean the 
difference between financial feast or famine. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 18-19, Northridge students will vote on a referendum in which 
registration fees would be hiked $49 each semester. The funds would underwrite 
the majority of the athletic department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Students Senate on Tuesday voted to place the referendum on the 
fall ballot by a 15-4 margin. The Senate also authorized a plan in which voting 
will take place by touch-tone telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of work ahead of us," Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said. "It 
is primarily going to be educating the students as far as the consequences if 
it doesn't pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the referendum is critical to maintaining the school's NCAA 
Division I status, department officials claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge athletics program stands to lose as much as $700,000 in 1995-96 
because of budget cuts and earthquake-related expenses on campus, officials 
said. The referendum would generate approximately $2.25 million if the current 
enrollment of 24,000 remains steady. The school's current athletics budget is 
$3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The department, which had a similar fee proposal shot down in the spring, 
doesn't plan a reprise. 
</P>
<P>
 A publicity blitz is planned leading up to the election and Hiegert already 
has met with Matador athletes to outline the positives associated with the 
referendum's passage. Hiegert said a meeting to plan campaign strategies has 
been planned for today. A rally has been planned for the eve of the election. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal is defeated, Northridge might be forced to make drastic cuts, 
which could result in the elimination of football and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge could revert to Division II unless 14 teams can be fielded, the 
requisite number for membership in Division I, Hiegert said. The school has 
played in Division I since 1990.

SIDELINES; AT LEAST DI-ONTE DOESN'T NEED AN ASTERISK BESIDE HIS NAME 
</P>

<P>
 He spells his first name Di-Onte. His coach spells it Di'Onte. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it ought to be spelled Di?Onte. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's D, i, then, you know, one of those little marks," said Bill Foster, 
football coach at Grant High. 
</P>
<P>
 Any little mark will do, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
 Di!Onte rushed for 352 yards against Marshall on Friday and has 495 in two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Di+Onte is a real plus, having scored all five Grant touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Di%Onte has contributed 92% of the team's offense, 511 of 557 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Di nte is a money player on defense as well, forcing a fumble with one minute 
to play to preserve Grant's 20-15 victory over Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Di*Onte clearly has emerged as a rising star in the City Section. 
</P>
<P>
 His last name is Smith, that much is clear. And by any spelling, Grant's 
senior tailback can dash with the football. 
</P>
<P>
 Period. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As luck would have it: With a defender draped over him, Littlerock High 
quarterback Bruce Johnson lobbed a desperation pass that was pulled in by Hoa 
Le for a touchdown with 19 seconds left, giving the Lobos a 12-10 victory over 
Oxnard on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hail Mary? Nope. More like a Happy Birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlerock Coach Jim Bauer celebrated his 44th birthday the following day.

<P>
 The right connections: When Ricky Rauth took an elbow in an eye Saturday 
during the semifinals of the Millikan High water polo tournament, he knew where 
to go. To dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauth's father, a physician, closed a gash that required four stitches right 
there at poolside. Four hours later, Rauth, a Harvard-Westlake junior, played 
in the tournament title game, which Harvard won, 13-10, over Villa Park.

 Ratings game: L.A. Baptist was unranked in preseason girls' volleyball polls 
despite outside hitter Darcie Frazier and setter Tunde Hrotko, who played on a 
team that advanced to the Southern Section Division V quarterfinals last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, a perfectly reasonable explanation. "I was sent a 
questionnaire but I totally forgot to fill it out," Coach Sue Newcomb said. "I 
never sent it back." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 3-0 start, including a victory over Notre Dame, L.A. Baptist 
undoubtedly will receive mention when new polls are released at the end of the 
week.

 Bring on the 'Huskers: Care to underscore the idiocy of comparing the scores 
of common football opponents? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's some tongue-in-cheek reasoning, courtesy of Bob Burt, Cal State 
Northridge's football coach: First, Northern Iowa defeated Iowa State, a member 
of the Big Eight Conference. Second, Southwest Texas State, which plays host to 
Northridge this week, defeated Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Which means? Said Burt: "If we beat Southwest Texas, we should take Iowa 
State's place in the Big Eight and play Nebraska, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, wrong.

<P>
 Chuck Arrobio, who coaches offensive linemen at St. Francis High, is a 
prominent Pasadena dentist. He also was quite a football player. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrobio played tackle for USC from 1963-65, paving the way for tailback Mike 
Garrett in his Heisman Trophy-winning campaign of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 His professional career with the Minnesota Vikings cut short after two years 
because of a knee injury, Arrobio enrolled at USC dental school. His part-time 
job tutoring the St. Francis line marks his coaching debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Arrobio said. "It's giving to the kids. And I'm giving back to 
all the coaches who gave to me." 
</P>
<P>
 As a dentist, Arrobio counts several former teammates and other former Trojans 
among his patients, including Ron Yary, Rod Sherman and Anthony Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Redell, St. Francis' head coach, is another customer. "He's a big baby," 
Arrobio said. Stats  
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of its 52-13 blowout of UC Davis, Northridge this week leaped 
37 places up the USA Today NCAA Division I and I-A national computer rankings. 
Northridge is ranked 137th among 224 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is ranked 157th by the computer -- even though the Aggies play in 
Division II . 
</P>
<P>
 The American West Conference, of which Northridge is a member, is ranked 16th 
among the 25 Division I-A and I-AA conferences nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 For openers: The Northridge football team has won 12 consecutive home openers 
and has lost six consecutive season openers. 
</P>
<P>
 Block party: With 22 blocks in the Northern Arizona women's volleyball 
tournament, Northridge's Heather Anderson moved into fourth place on the 
school's career list. The 6-foot-2 senior has 293 blocks, trailing only 
Kathleen Dixon (449 from 1987-90), Nancy Nicholls (398 from 1989-92) and senior 
teammate Ana Kristich (343). Honors  
</P>
<P>
 With two interceptions and a fumble recovery against UC Davis, Northridge 
safety Joseph Vaughn was named American West Conference defensive player of the 
week. Matt Ornelaz, Northridge's kicker, was the conference's special-teams 
player of the week after converting seven of seven point-after attempts and 
adding a 37-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Top defender: Ventura College nose guard Shawn Popkin was among three Western 
State Conference players honored for their defensive efforts last week. The 
freshman from Buena High had 10 solo tackles, six assists, two sacks and an 
interception in a 20-12 nonconference win over Antelope Valley.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; MILLER'S AVAILABILITY QUESTIONABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram quarterback Chris Miller, who has a sore shoulder and ribs, will not throw 
in practice today, raising more questions about his status for Sunday's game at 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Backup quarterback Chris) Chandler will get the work that Miller usually 
gets," Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-string quarterback Tommy Maddox, who has run the scout squad and was 
inactive for the first three games, will work with the top offensive units as a 
backup for the first time. The Rams traded a fourth-round draft pick to the 
Denver Broncos Aug. 27 to get Maddox, a former UCLA standout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy has a live arm and is an accurate thrower," Knox said. "He has picked 
up the knowledge of the offense very, very well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, seeking a receiver to replace an injured Richard Buchanan, are 
expected to re-sign Todd Kinchen today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams cut Kinchen, a third-year pro, on Sept. 6 to make room for cornerback 
Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches worked Kinchen out Tuesday at Rams Park in hopes he can replace 
Buchanan, sidelined two to three weeks because of a pulled hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinchen, who recently had a tryout in Miami, had suffered a pulled hamstring 
before the start of the season but was cleared to practice the day he was cut. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kinchen signs, the Rams probably will free a roster spot by placing left 
guard Keith Loneker, who suffered a fallen left arch against Atlanta, on the 
injured-reserve list. MIKE REILLEY

NME SEEKS TO BUY CHAINS IN BID TO BECOME HOSPITAL GIANT; HEALTH CARE: A 
SUCCESSFUL MERGER WOULD ALLOW NATIONAL MEDICAL ENTERPRISES TO OVERCOME A MAJOR 
SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based National Medical Enterprises is negotiating to buy two 
regional hospital chains in an effort to become the nation's second-largest 
hospital operator, sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If NME succeeds in acquiring Nashville-based HealthTrust Inc. and American 
Medical Holdings of Dallas, it would increase its hospital properties more than 
five-fold -- gaining strong operations in the key states of Florida and Texas 
-- and cap a dramatic recovery from the scandal that plagued the firm for most 
of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, NME made headlines when it agreed to pay $380 million to 
settle federal criminal charges in the largest health care fraud payment in U.S 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger of NME with HealthTrust and American Medical would create a giant 
health care company with $10 billion in annual revenue and about 200 hospitals 
in the United States and several foreign countries. It would be second in size 
to Columbia-HCA Healthcare Corp., in terms of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of the three companies declined to confirm or deny the 
negotiations, which were first reported Tuesday in the Wall Street Journal. The 
Journal article was based on different drafts of a speech being prepared for 
NME Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow in preparation for the firm's annual shareholders 
meeting on Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 An NME spokeswoman read a statement that said the firm "has had conversation 
with many companies related to a variety of possible corporation transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. O'Leary, chairman and chief executive of American Medical, said in a 
statement that his firm "has not reached agreement to acquire, merge with or be 
acquired by any other organization." 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the companies said negotiations between NME and American 
Medical had not yet reached their final stage and that the deal could still 
unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rumors of this kind are very prevalent at this time," said a spokeswoman for 
HealthTrust. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York Stock Exchange trading, NME shares on Tuesday fell $1 to $17.75, 
while American Medical added 25 cents to $23.25 and HealthTrust rose 87.5 cents 
to $30.875. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Tuesday's closing prices, HealthTrust's total market value is $2.59 
billion and the total capitalization for American Medical is $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the deal makes sense for the hospital companies, which, 
like the rest of the industry, are facing increasing pressure from employers 
and insurers to reduce costs. The hospital industry has seen a flurry of 
mergers and other deals in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Harris, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York, said 
the NME acquisitions look like "a smart deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of talent at the three companies," he said. "AMI management is 
terrific as cost-cutters; HealthTrust is a good system integrator; NME is a 
good hospital operator and Barbakow is skilled at deal making and the financial 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 By combining operations, Harris said, the three companies should be able to 
cut administrative costs and achieve other efficiencies, particularly in local 
markets where they operate several health care facilities. Also, many insurers 
prefer dealing with a smaller number of providers in a particular market. 
</P>
<P>
 HealthTrust and American Medical already have experience working together 
through a joint venture formed in 1992 when the AMI-owned Tarzana Medical 
Center united with HealthTrust's Encino Hospital to form Encino-Tarzana 
Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow has said previously that mergers or acquisitions were one of several 
strategies the company might pursue to prosper in the fast-changing health care 
environment. Analysts have speculated that NME was a likely takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
 In an employee newsletter earlier this month, Barbakow said NME has received 
no serious offers from companies interested in acquiring the firm. He also told 
employees that buying back its own stock was not the best way for NME to 
enhance investors' returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow wrote that acquiring other acute-care hospitals seemed like the 
firm's best strategy. "Given the scope and rapidity of consolidations in the 
industry, acquiring single facilities is probably too slow a process to be a 
successful long-term strategy. It would be preferable to make larger 
acquisitions of multifacility providers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 HealthTrust is by far the largest of the three companies, with 118 hospitals, 
including five in California. About 60% of its hospitals are in small 
communities with only one or two acute-care hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical operates 33 acute-care hospitals in six states and 13 others 
in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Spain.

UCLA FORECAST FOR STATE IS SURPRISINGLY ROSY; ECONOMY: REPORT SAYS CALIFORNIA 
WILL SEE A 1% NET GAIN IN NEW JOBS IN 1994 AS RECOVERY MOVES FASTER THAN 
EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California will see an increase of 111,000 net new jobs in 1994 -- a better 
performance than the flat job growth predicted earlier -- as the state's 
fledgling recovery proceeds faster than expected, according to a report 
expected to be released today by the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 While that 1% rate of job growth is less than the long-term state average of 
3%, it is nevertheless another sign that the economy is getting better, UCLA 
said in its most optimistic forecast since the recession began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 And while structural changes in the economy will continue to roil the state's 
job market for several years, UCLA predicted that an upturn in normal economic 
cycles will generate a net gain of more than 770,000 new jobs in the next three 
years. That would make for a compound annual growth rate of 2.1% in non-farm 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although suffering from continuing job losses in defense-related aerospace, 
due to budget cuts and consolidation elsewhere, we believe this recovery will 
last," the report says. The report, issued every three months, is more 
optimistic than the June forecast, which predicted a 0.1% drop in employment 
for 1994. The optimism is all the more striking because the UCLA group had come 
under fire from business during the recession for being unduly pessimistic in 
its forecasts -- predictions that turned out to be largely accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with continuing aerospace layoffs such as those from the recently 
announced Martin Marietta-Lockheed merger and the virtual shutdown of Hughes 
Aircraft's Fullerton complex, California will "not go back into recession," 
according to the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate, meanwhile, will fall from about 9% -- or nearly three 
percentage points above the national rate -- to 7% in 1997, due to more jobs 
and population shrinkage as people look elsewhere for work. The state rate will 
remain about a percentage point above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast is in keeping with other recent predictions that the state's 
economy will continue to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California 
Economy predicted that the state could add 310,000 jobs a year by 2005, a rate 
of growth that would outpace the nation's. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Hahn, an economist with Kenneth Leventhal & Co. in Newport Beach, 
agreed with the UCLA projections. But he added that Los Angeles County will 
continue to lag the rest of the state, saying job growth will not occur here 
until 1995 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that L.A. County had 84% of the state's total job losses in 
1991 through 1993," he said. Orange County, by contrast, will probably break 
even in job growth this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA predicted that most of the state's new jobs will be in the service 
sector, excluding wholesale and retail trade. Non-financial services will 
generate 96,000 of the 111,000 new non-farm jobs created in 1994. The most 
robust growth will occur in the movie industry, already one of the 
faster-growing industries in the state, with an average annual growth rate of 
11% through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 But even heretofore ailing industries should hold their own, the forecast 
says. Wholesale and retail trade will begin to add jobs in 1994, accelerating 
in 1995 and 1996 as retail spending picks up. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction, which got an overnight boost after the Northridge earthquake, 
will also grow. The building trades will add 94,000 jobs from 1995 through 
1997, bringing that sector's employment back to 1990 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 And employment in non-aerospace manufacturing is likely to remain stable 
through 1997, the forecast says -- an improvement over its June prediction that 
manufacturing would continue to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast notes that despite evidence that a California recovery is under 
way, consumers continue to feel pessimistic.

TRADE DEFICIT UP 22% IN JULY; DOW PLUNGES 67, DOLLAR NEAR ITS LOW; ECONOMY: 
SOME ANALYSTS AND THE WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAY THE REPORT, BUT OTHERS SAY GROWTH IS 
THREATENED.

 The U.S. trade deficit soared in July, the government said Tuesday in a report 
that pushed the dollar toward its record low against the Japanese yen and 
triggered a broad slide in stock prices, with the Dow Jones industrials posting 
their worst loss in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall trade imbalance, including goods and services, jumped 22% from the 
previous month to $11 billion, the Commerce Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit was the second-worst monthly U.S. merchandise deficit on record -- 
$15.7 billion -- which was exceeded only by the record $15.9-billion shortfall 
in December, 1985, the agency said. U.S. trade in services showed a 
$4.7-billion surplus in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists and the Clinton Administration cautioned against reading too 
much bad news into one month's report. But other analysts, noting that the U.S. 
trade deficit is a chronic problem, said the latest figures do not bode well 
for continued U.S. economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets, already worried about the economy's staying power and 
fading hopes for a U.S.-Japan agreement to fix the trade imbalance, were 
rattled by the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market took the data particularly hard amid fears that the trade gap 
will prompt the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates yet again later 
this month to protect the dollar's value, analysts said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There already was a bearish sentiment that was building" in the markets, 
which the trade report exacerbated, said Charlie Okada, executive vice 
president and currency trading manager at Sanwa Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was quoted at 97.65 yen in late New York trading, down from 98.53 
on Monday and its lowest U.S. close since hitting a post-World War II nadir of 
97.50 on July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks -- which Thursday climbed to 
within 50 points of the 4,000 level -- plunged 67.63 to 3,869.09, its worst 
daily decline since losing 72.27 on March 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The average's slide also triggered the New York Stock Exchange's "circuit 
breakers," or trading restrictions designed to curb the market's volatility, 
late in the session. Losers swamped gainers on the Big Board by nearly 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices also fell and their yields rose, but the damage wasn't nearly as 
severe as in stocks. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond lost less than 0.25 
point, or $2.50 for every $1,000 in face value, and its yield edged up to 7.77% 
from 7.75% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the United States' biggest trade gap came with Japan, a deficit of 
$5.7 billion -- the worst showing since March. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortfall with Japan came at a sensitive time, because negotiators for 
both nations are meeting this week in a bid to resolve trade disputes before a 
Sept. 30 deadline, after which the Clinton Administration could impose trade 
sanctions against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, U.S. exporters used Tuesday's report to press Japan to further open 
its doors to U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The July figures "are a clear signal" that Japan "must take action to open its 
market to imports," Andrew H. Card, president of the American Automobile 
Manufacturers Assn., a trade group for the Big Three car makers, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the July report was "not indicative of 
the economy's long-term trend," because it included a sharp drop in exports of 
U.S. commercial aircraft, whose sales tend to vary widely from month to month, 
and because July's imports reflected oil prices that have since declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists agree that U.S. trade is suffering because the nation's 
growing economy is lifting Americans' demand for imports, while many of its 
major trading partners are still struggling to emerge from recession -- 
limiting their purchases of U.S. goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. trade deficit should be helped in the months ahead as the economies 
of Japan and Europe grow stronger, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Feinman, a global markets economist at Bankers Trust New York Corp., said 
the July trade figures were "consistent" with other recent reports indicating 
that the American economic expansion is slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wider trade deficit does suggest that the international sector is going 
to be a drag" on the U.S. economy, Feinman said. That might actually preclude 
the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first seven months of 1994, the U.S. trade deficit is running at an 
annual rate of $145.8 billion. That puts the nation on track to achieve its 
worst merchandise deficit since a record $152.1 billion imbalance in 1987. U.S.

STATE TO SLASH BASE RATE FOR WORKERS' COMP BY A RECORD 16%; INSURANCE: THE MOVE 
IS AN ATTEMPT TO HEAT UP PRICE COMPETITION AS DATE FOR DEREGULATION APPROACHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Department of Insurance plans to announce today its biggest 
reduction ever in workers' compensation rates, cutting by 16% the base charge 
that businesses pay to insure their employees against on-the-job injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 State insurance officials optimistically predict that the action will 
translate into a one-time savings approaching $800 million for the 530,000 
California employers buying workers' compensation coverage. That would come out 
to roughly $1,500 per employer, although the real impact would vary 
dramatically from firm to firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, in an interview, said he is taking the 
action to heat up price competition among workers' compensation insurers in 
advance of next year's deregulation of the state's rate system. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, whose four-year term expires in January, said he wants the 
deregulated market to begin at a "starting point" where premiums are "as low as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The 16% reduction marks the third cut in the so-called minimum rate for 
workers' compensation insurance in 15 months. The series of cutbacks stems from 
a big drop in worker injury claims since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, employers blamed workers' compensation costs for driving businesses 
from California, creating an explosive issue that prompted a succession of 
legislative reforms, including a major package last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the insurance industry, the rate cut was larger than expected. Garamendi 
said previously he was considering lowering the rate in the range of 10% to 
15%, and an advisory agency representing the industry recommended a 9.2% 
cutback. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not clear, however, how the rate cut will play out in the insurance 
market once it takes effect on Oct. 1 or, for that matter, what next year's 
deregulation will do. While insurers will be free to lower rates, they will not 
be required to do so, and no one is sure how sharp the price competition will 
become. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, employers judged to be poor insurance risks because of safety 
problems would be likely to continue paying high insurance rates and enjoy 
little, if any, benefit from price competition. In fact, critics have argued 
that deregulation will lead to higher premiums for many small employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Garamendi, an unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial candidate this year 
now believed to be in line for a Clinton Administration post, said state 
legislative reforms and a related crackdown on fraud by his department, other 
agencies and insurance companies have yielded savings warranting lower 
insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 After peaking at $7 billion in 1991, the amount paid out by insurers to cover 
injured workers' medical and rehabilitation expenses and to replace lost wages 
fell to an estimated $4.6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts attribute much of the decline in claims to the stagnant state 
economy, arguing that workers often defer workers' compensation claims during a 
recession because they are afraid of losing their jobs. They note that workers' 
compensation claims began to rise again in the second quarter of this year, 
when the economy apparently improved, but Garamendi brushed off the increase as 
an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 The current minimum rate system, established before 1920 when officials were 
worried about predatory pricing, sets a floor on how low premiums can be set. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, employers -- particularly those with good safety records -- often 
pay more for workers' compensation coverage than they would in a more 
competitive market. To lower rates, the state Legislature voted last year to 
scrap the minimum rate and spur price competition among insurers.

WESTERN OIL FIRMS SIGN DEAL FOR DRILLING IN CASPIAN SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite Russian objections, a consortium of Western oil companies signed an 
agreement Tuesday with Azerbaijan to invest up to $8 billion to develop vast 
offshore oil deposits in the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year contract, signed in Baku by Los-Angeles based Unocal Corp., Amoco, 
British Petroleum and other U.S., Russian, Turkish and Norwegian oil companies, 
envisions that the first barrels of high-quality oil could begin flowing within 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a huge boon to war-weary Azerbaijan, where the deal was being 
billed as "the contract of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 But while dignitaries -- including U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary William H. 
White and Azerbaijani President Heydar A. Aliyev -- were signing the contract 
amid much fanfare, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced in Moscow that it was 
categorically opposed to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has long opposed dividing up the Caspian Sea among the five nations 
that surround it. Citing the Soviet-Iranian treaty of 1940, Russia claims that 
no one country has the unilateral right to exploit Caspian reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil fields covered under this deal are about 120 miles off Azerbaijan and 
are expected to yield up to 4 billion barrels of light, sweet crude. The Baku 
government, which began offshore drilling in the Caspian in 1901, insists the 
fields belong to Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opposition leaders see Russia's territorial claims as a thinly disguised 
bid to extract oil tribute from a former vassal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, after Russia sent a formal note to the British Embassy this 
spring staking its claim to the reserves, Azerbaijan invited the Russian 
state-owned oil company Lukoil to take a 10% share in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin announced that 
Russian objections had not been satisfied. He said the oil exploration deal 
contradicts international law and poses an ecological threat to the Caspian.  
</P>
<P>
 "For this reason, Russia . . . formally, officially will not recognize the 
signed agreement, with all the ensuing consequences," Karasin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not elaborate on what those consequences might be, and it was not 
immediately clear whether Russia can or will take concrete steps to block the 
impending oil bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a symbolic snub, Russian Energy Minister Yuri K. Shafranik did not show 
up at the signing ceremony as planned, though lower-ranking officials did 
attend, the Khabar News Service reported from Baku. Lukoil's president was also 
absent, and the contract was signed by the company's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex deal has taken three years to negotiate. Western companies have 
persisted despite a coup d'etat that ousted Azerbaijan's first democratically 
elected president last year and despite years of fighting with the 
Armenian-populated enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh that ended in a cease-fire last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal spokesman Mike Thacher said the joint venture is the company's first in 
the former Soviet Union. He noted that the draft contract must still be 
ratified by the Azerbaijani Parliament, as well as the boards of the consortium 
countries. But he said Unocal will proceed and hope the territorial claims are 
settled quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Also still to be resolved is how to ship the oil out of the Caspian basin. A 
pipeline is desirable. But the question is what route to take out of the 
unstable region and who would finance construction.

 Robert Haft Wins $34.1-Million Award: Haft, 41, filed the suit against Dart 
Group Corp. and its operating companies, Crown Books Corp. and Trak Auto Corp., 
charging that he had been fired without cause as president of Dart last year by 
his father, Dart Chairman and founder Herbert Haft, in a struggle for 
succession. A U.S. District Court jury, after deliberating less than three 
hours, awarded Robert Haft damages of $18.8 million from Dart, $12.8 million 
from Crown and 100,000 shares of Crown worth $2.4 million when he was fired in 
June, 1993. Dart and Crown said in a statement that they will study 
alternatives, "including a motion to overturn the verdict or an appeal in the 
coming week."

CONGRESS OKS BILL TO CUT RED TAPE FOR COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that would slash red tape for 
companies bidding on U.S. contracts worth $100,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The House voted 425 to 0 in favor of the measure -- already passed by the 
Senate -- that would streamline the cumbersome government system for buying 
goods and services in order to give small businesses a better chance at 
competing for federal work. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would repeal or simplify more than 225 provisions of federal 
law and require greater public disclosure at key points in the contracting 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that the $200 billion spent by the federal government each 
year is done in an inefficient and Byzantine way," said Rep. William F. Clinger 
Jr. (R-Pa.), ranking GOP member of the panel and a co-sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 This legislation "is a direct attack on a procurement system that's gone 
haywire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We effectively are revolutionizing how the federal government does business 
in order to avoid buying the $600 hammers and toilet seats which have properly 
outraged everyone," said Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the House 
Government Operations committee and a co-sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by complaints from business executives, Congress decided to lower 
paperwork requirements and nonessential specifications for government buying 
that add to the cost of items but do little to improve quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would also create a computer network within the next five years to 
speed up government contracting procedures by using the latest information 
technology to publicize bidding opportunities.

 Shares of two companies that make carbon monoxide detectors rose Tuesday after 
medical authorities found that tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis died from the 
poisonous gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in the shares of First Alert Inc. and American Sensors Inc. was 
unusually heavy after examiners in Southampton, N.Y., reported that Gerulaitis' 
death Sunday was caused by fumes from a broken propane heater.Gerulaitis, 40, 
died at a friend's beach home in the Long Island resort town. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of First Alert, based in Aurora, Ill., rose $2 to $27 in Nasdaq Stock 
Market trading of 227,300 shares, swamping the daily average of 47,600 shares 
in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 American Sensors, headquartered in Markham, Canada, jumped $1.375 to $20.25 on 
trading of 141,800 shares, almost nine times the daily average of 16,200 shares 
in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this unfortunate, untimely death serves to do is draw awareness to the 
risks associated with carbon monoxide poisoning," said Michael Rohl, First 
Alert's corporate controller and director of investor relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers of detectors were quick to call attention to the hazards of carbon 
monoxide. First Alert and one of its Canadian distributors, BRK Brand Canada, 
each issued press releases describing the threat of carbon monoxide poisoning 
and First Alert's carbon monoxide detector. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the first time investors connected tragedy with potential profits. 
Basketball great Magic Johnson said on Nov. 7, 1991, that he was infected with 
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The next day, shares 
of Carter-Wallace Inc., maker of Trojan condoms, rose sharply.

FIRST INTERSTATE TO KEEP FOCUS ON THE WEST; BANKING: L.A. FINANCIAL GIANT SAYS 
IT WILL BECOME A 'SUPER-REGIONAL' RATHER THAN EXPAND NATIONALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 First Interstate Bank gave securities analysts a glimpse of the company's 
expansion strategy Tuesday, declaring that it will focus on saturating markets 
in the West during the 1990s rather than seeking to use new federal laws to 
build a nationwide banking empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Carson, chief executive of the Los Angeles-based financial giant, told 
analysts meeting in New York -- some of whom had suspected grander designs -- 
that the nation's 14th-largest bank will concentrate instead on becoming a 
"super-regional bank." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also confirmed previously reported plans to lay off at least 1,200 
workers, but it said the impact on the Southern California economy will be 
softened by moving some of its out-of-state jobs to local facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the employees who will lose their jobs work for banks in Washington, 
Texas and other states where First Interstate has been on an acquisition binge 
over the past 18 months, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company doesn't know how many of the 9,300 First Interstate 
employees in California will lose their jobs. The total, including about 1,800 
early retirements, will amount to more than 10% of its 28,000-member work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate will take a third-quarter charge of $139 million to cover its 
current restructuring costs, and it will take another $26 million in 
restructuring charges over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said the impact of the layoffs on Southern California will be largely 
offset by the relocation of some operations into the region. For example, a 
spokesman said, "a few hundred" jobs in the bank's trust department, now 
scattered across several states, will be moved to Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Such consolidations will be done more easily under the interstate banking 
legislation recently enacted by Congress. Previously, banks that wanted to 
operate in more than one state were, in effect, required to set up a separate 
entity in each state. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate's aggressive campaign to purchase out-of-state banks over the 
past few years has led some analysts to believe that the bank would try to 
become a nationwide concern after the barriers to interstate banking fell. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carson said in a phone conversation Tuesday, "My guess is that we'll be a 
. . . super-regional bank" five years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining a regional bank will also allow First Interstate to keep a close eye 
on its operating costs. Carson said First Interstate's expenses will go from 
62.7 cents out of every dollar today to about 58 cents by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a reduction would push the bank's costs below those at Bank of America, 
the only California-based bank bigger than First Interstate.

 Iger Named President of Cap Cities: Robert A. Iger, as expected, was named 
president and chief operating officer of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. at the 
company's regularly scheduled board meeting in New York. Iger, 43, who 
previously had been president of ABC Television Network Group, will now oversee 
all operating divisions of Capital Cities/ABC, encompassing the network, 
broadcast and publishing groups.Iger was also elected to Capital Cities/ABC's 
board. He continues to report to Thomas S. Murphy, chairman and chief 
executive. Iger's promotion makes him the leading inside candidate to succeed 
Murphy, who is expected to retire within a couple of years. Capital Cities/ABC 
also named David Westin to succeed Iger as president of ABC Television Network 
Group, which encompasses ABC's entertainment, news and sports divisions. Westin 
most recently was president of production at ABC Television Network Group, 
where he was responsible for the network's in-house production activities.

 New Balance Faces False-Advertising Charges: The Federal Trade Commission said 
in an administrative complaint that commercials boasting that New Balance 
athletic shoes are made in America are misleading because a substantial number 
of shoes are made in foreign countries. New Balance is disputing the 
allegations.The company said some shoes are produced in the United States while 
others are made in foreign countries. The company said the country of origin is 
clearly stated on each product. Separately, Hyde Athletic Shoes Inc., makers of 
shoes under the Saucony, Playskool and Barbie brand names, settled charges that 
advertisements claiming its products are made in America mislead consumers. 
Hyde neither confirmed nor denied the allegations and said it settled to avoid 
expensive litigation.

 Mortgage Delinquency Rates Rise: Property owners had a tougher time paying 
mortgages for a second straight quarter, a banking group said, signaling a halt 
to a recent trend that brought delinquency rates to 20-year lows. The Mortgage 
Bankers Assn. of America said the percentage of property owners late on 
mortgage payments is likely to rise further.It cited slower economic growth, 
rising interest rates and more homeowners taking on adjustable-rate mortgages. 
Delinquent mortgages increased to 4.21% at the end of June from 4.12% at the 
end of the first quarter. The delinquency rate fell to a nearly 21-year low at 
the end of the fourth quarter of 1993, when it was 4.09%. Delinquent loans are 
those for which payment is at least 30 days late.

 Browning-Ferris Seeks to Pick Up Rival: The $573.5-million takeover bid by 
waste management firm Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. of Houston is the largest 
in the waste industry in a decade.Struggling British waste group Attwoods 
slammed the hostile bid as "opportunistic." Announcement of the offer was 
swiftly followed by word that Attwoods' largest shareholder, Canada's Laidlaw 
Inc., accepted Browning's bid of $208 million for its holding of Attwoods 
ordinary and preferred shares. Laidlaw owns more than 30% of Attwoods' total 
capital. Industry analysts said the takeover bid represents a consolidation 
wave at a time when the industry is crawling out of the financial dumps.

 America West Announces New Fare Cuts: America West Airlines has launched 
another round of leisure travel fare reductions that could cut the price of 
some tickets by nearly half, but customers have to act fast.The airline is 
offering the reduced fares through Dec. 20, but travelers have only until 
Friday to buy tickets. The reductions require a 14-day advance purchase and a 
Friday night stay. The deepest discounts are available on Mondays through 
Thursdays. The discounts could cut the round-trip fare from Los Angeles to 
Chicago by 11% to $338, or from Las Vegas to Atlanta by 48% to $198. Rival 
airlines have usually matched the America West reductions in cities where they 
compete.

 Blockbuster Leadership Clarified: Viacom Inc. said Blockbuster Vice Chairman 
Steven R. Berrard will head the video rental giant after its proposed 
$8-billion acquisition of Blockbuster is completed, in another signal that 
Chief Executive H. Wayne Huizenga doesn't plan to stick around for long. The 
company said Berrard reached a long-term agreement to serve as president and 
chief executive of Blockbuster Entertainment Group, a new unit Viacom will form 
assuming shareholders approve the merger next week.The company added that it 
had reached employment agreements with 40 senior Blockbuster executives that 
will be triggered when the acquisition is completed. Many analysts have doubted 
that Huizenga would work for long under Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone because 
both are independent, strong-willed executives. In a proxy statement, Viacom 
said Huizenga plans to serve as a Viacom vice chairman and as chairman of 
Blockbuster Entertainment Group "for an appropriate transition period." 
Separately, Viacom announced that Robert M. Gutkowski resigned as president of 
Madison Square Garden and will be replaced on an interim basis by New York 
Knicks President David W. Checketts.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: 1ST SIGN OF AUTUMN ON WALL STREET: RUMORS OF A CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With Tuesday's 67-point plunge in the Dow industrials, the chant of "Remember 
1987!" is likely to be joined by more panicky voices on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For die-hard stock market bears, the comparisons between today's market and 
that of October, 1987 -- host to the greatest stock crash of the modern era -- 
are piling up at a frightening pace: 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest rates continue to rise, just as they did in the summer and early 
autumn of 1987. On Tuesday, the 30-year Treasury bond yield closed at 7.77%, 
its highest in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * The nation's merchandise trade deficit is ballooning at a pace last seen in 
1987, thanks to Americans' ravenous appetite for imports. The deficit for July, 
reported Tuesday, was the second-worst monthly figure ever and was the catalyst 
for the stock market's dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors' fear is that an unchecked deficit will further devalue the dollar 
(because we're sending too many of them abroad), in turn spurring the Federal 
Reserve to drive interest rates even higher in an attempt to defend the buck. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold is surging again, suggesting that savvy investors are running for 
cover. Gold futures for October jumped $3.60 to $394.10 an ounce on the Comex 
on Tuesday, the highest price in 13 months. In 1987, gold rocketed from $400 to 
about $480 ahead of the October stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Traders are increasingly being accused of manipulating the market for 
short-term gain. Today, the culprits are using stock options to create brief 
but tradable market "waves." In 1987, investors using "portfolio insurance" 
tactics sparked wild volatility with stock index futures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bears' case today is that the stock market -- or at least the Dow 
industrial average -- has wrongly chosen to quickly overcome most of the bad 
news that has come down the pike this year, just as stocks drove higher for 
most of 1987 in the face of withering fundamentals. And as in 1987, the bears 
say, when investors today finally wake up to reality, the result will be 
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the healthy economy and its bullish implications for corporate 
profits? What about the boom in takeover activity? Both of those elements were 
present in 1987 as well, the bears note. But that didn't stop the Dow from 
plummeting from 2,641.00 in early-October of that year to 1,738.74 at the crash 
bottom on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most worrisome today is that one of the main ingredients of the poison 
brew that killed the market in 1987 -- rising German interest rates -- could be 
this year's October surprise. With Europe's economic recovery in full swing, 
and central banks in Italy, Sweden and Britain having recently boosted 
short-term rates, the German Bundesbank probably won't be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with predicting another market crash, however, is that so many 
people are already steeled for one. Yet rarely do crashes arrive by 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Nurock, a veteran analyst in Santa Fe, N.M., notes that many big stock 
investors have already raised their cash reserves this year, expecting the 
worst. What's more, most market newsletter writers polled by Investors 
Intelligence are already either outright bearish or expect a market 
"correction." In contrast, bullishness was rampant nearly up to Crash Day in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 A.C. Moore, money manager at SBCM/Argus in Santa Barbara, points out what may 
be the most important difference between 1987 and today: While interest rates 
are rising, they still are far below what investors had to contend with in '87. 
Then, rates got high enough to threaten recession. That's not yet the case 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interest rates aren't near levels that produce strain on the financial 
system," Moore contends, while stocks' valuations are below 1987 levels. Thus, 
most investors (big and small) can't find a good reason to abandon the market 
wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that doesn't preclude another short-term slump in stocks, as investors 
turn jumpy. The market took a 10% hit in winter as interest rates began to 
rise, bounced back, dove again in June, then rallied back in August. The upshot 
is that buying on pullbacks, which has worked well since 1987, has again been a 
winning formula in '94. 
</P>
<P>
 The bear case, of course, is that at some point buying into relatively modest 
declines won't work, because a full-fledged bear market will be upon us -- 
taking prices down 25% or more in a hurry. Bernard Schaeffer, money manager at 
the Investment Research Institute in Cincinnati, doesn't doubt that the bears 
will be right eventually. But before that can happen, the similarities between 
today's backdrop and that of '87 will have to grow much more intense, Schaeffer 
says. It's still too early in the game, he argues. Deja Vu? 
</P>
<P>
 Though stock prices are much higher today than before the October, 1987, 
market crash, interest rates and other influencing factors are much less 
onerous. 03,28,10,10 Oct. '87 Index/investment peak Now 3-month T-bill yield

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS' LOSS IS BIGGEST IN 6 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks suffered their biggest decline in six months Tuesday, as fears of 
higher interest rates again gripped Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a day of wild market crosscurrents, bond yields closed only slightly 
above Monday's levels, and the dollar strengthened against many European 
currencies even as it dove against the Japanese yen. Gold prices, meanwhile, 
surged to 13-month highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparked by the government's report of a soaring U.S. trade deficit in July, 
the Dow Jones industrial average slumped 67.63 points, or 1.7%, to 3,869.09. It 
was the biggest one-day decline since the 72.27-point loss March 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, losers swamped winners by 18 to 5 on the Big Board. 
Volume was heavy at 326 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's tumble began early in the day, as bond yields shot up on word of 
the July trade deficit. Because the trade report showed a widening of the U.S. 
deficit with Japan, the dollar sank against the yen to a three-month low of 
97.65, down from 98.53 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, prompted fears that the Federal Reserve Board will again raise 
short-term interest rates, this time to help the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the stock market had been counting on the Fed to lie low at least 
until November, the trade report resurrected investors' latent concern about 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chances of the Fed tightening sooner rather than later are growing," said 
Tom Kirkenmeier, analyst at Northern Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also noted that the market was vulnerable to a selloff because share 
prices have rallied strongly since mid-August. The Dow, 3,755 on Aug. 19, 
jumped as high as 3,953 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ripe for some profit taking," said Joe Loftus, trader at Lehman Bros. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the breadth of Tuesday's decline took some Wall Streeters aback. 
While computerized program trading as usual was blamed for worsening the 
market's fall -- the Dow's loss ballooned 30 points in the final hour -- 
analysts said many stocks unaffected by programs also were dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks plunged 9.98 points, or 
1.3%, to 766.74. 
</P>
<P>
 "That negative breadth does have us worried a bit," said Alan Shaw, analyst at 
Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders also were puzzled because stocks failed to rebound late in the day, as 
the bond market's tone improved. The 30-year Treasury bond yield, which jumped 
from 7.75% on Monday to 7.82% early Tuesday, closed at 7.77% as buyers 
returned. Shorter-term yields also were up only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the dollar dropped versus the yen, it strengthened against the 
German mark and other key currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said stock investors may be fearful that the trade report's news 
of strong imports but lower exports could be signaling that U.S. companies' 
profits will be disappointing in the months ahead. Expectations of strong 
profit growth has helped support the stock market all year, in the face of 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Wall Street is getting mixed signals from key stock indexes. While the 
Dow industrials have been hovering near all-time highs, the Dow transportation 
stock index on Tuesday plunged to a new 1994 low of 1,516.66, down 35.87 
points. Because the transport business is sensitive to the economy's swings, 
that index appears to be heralding economic weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The plunge in transport stocks was led by Federal Express, down 4 1/2 to 60; 
CSX, down 1 5/8 to 68 1/4; UAL, down 1 7/8 to 93 3/8, and Consolidated 
Freightways, off 1 to 23 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks falling included DuPont, down 1 3/4 to 57 3/4; 3M, down 1 
1/4 to 55 1/2; GE, off 1 to 49 1/2, and Scott Paper, off 1 7/8 to 62 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks reacted badly to higher interest rates. American Express 
dove 1 3/8 to 29 7/8, Federal National Mortgage sank 2 3/4 to 81 3/4, Morgan 
Stanley lost 2 to 63 1/4 and BankAmerica was off 1 1/8 to 46 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit takers targeted retail issues. Sears tumbled 1 3/8 to 48 7/8, 
Nordstrom lost 2 1/2 to 42 3/4 and Dayton Hudson lost 2 5/8 to 76 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the retail group, Burlington Coat Factory plunged 7 1/2 to 15 3/4 
after reporting a quarterly loss, and Musicland Stores slumped 2 1/8 to 15 3/4 
after warning about disappointing quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the few bright spots in the market, Magma Power rocketed 7 1/4 to 34 
3/4 after getting a takeover bid from California Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Digital Equipment surged 1 5/8 to 27 7/8 after Cowen & Co. recommended 
the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, October gold futures zoomed $3.60 to $394.10 on the Comex, a 
13-month high, as some investors sought a safe haven. October silver leaped 
20.3 cents to $5.63 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index fell 41.8 points to 3,037.3, in tandem with 
Wall Street. Frankfurt's DAX index lost 17.80 points to 2,078.96, while Tokyo's 
Nikkei rose 283.16 points to 19,837.27. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index added 6.45 points to 2,810.07.

PLOWSHARES; THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; IN SEARCH OF 
A 'SUPERCAR': XCORP HAS A CLEANER IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Ford and General Motors race to build prototypes for the earth-friendly 
automobile of tomorrow, a fledgling private company that is designing its own 
"supercar" with the help of NASA has gone a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of former aerospace engineers at Beverly Hills-based XCorp has 
developed a manufacturing system that may itself become a prototype for future 
auto makers. Based on a production process that defense contractors use to 
build cruise missiles, XCorp's "clean manufacturing" system -- meaning it 
produces little or no byproducts that are hazardous to the environment -- 
relies largely on polymers, or complex plastic materials, Chief Executive Chris 
Catlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the auto industry's standard manufacturing process, various body parts such 
as doors and side panels are stamped out of large sheets of reinforced steel. 
XCorp's process is simpler: The body is molded from heated polymers, and the 
chassis is a composite of the polymers and 100% recyclable aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 Catlin said the molding process creates a single integrated unit that is 
literally glued together with a fully recyclable adhesive, rather than the 
typical assemblage of automobile components that are welded, bolted or screwed 
together. Because XCorp's system renders obsolete much of the heavy, 
energy-intensive equipment used in the auto industry, it consumes about half 
the energy. It also eliminates the messy byproducts that come from drilling, 
spot welding, metal finishing and painting. 
</P>
<P>
 XCorp's production system evolved from a more ambitious goal: to create a 
cost-competitive car with a fuel efficiency of 90 miles per gallon and superior 
crashworthiness. The vehicle design had to be lightweight, with about a third 
fewer parts than the average car. To accomplish this, it was necessary to 
redesign the manufacturing process itself. 
</P>
<P>
 XCorp engineers even found an unusual way to cut down the emissions that 
usually occur when plastics are heated and molded. By working with lower 
pressures and maintaining strict control over the heating and cooling of the 
polymers, they were able to reduce the vapor emissions. Rather than escaping, 
the emissions are contained within the polymers. 
</P>
<P>
 XCorp has formed a consortium of suppliers and defense labs to develop a 
prototype of the car, with the help of NASA's Far West Regional Technology 
Center. Harriette Reid, a spokeswoman for the space agency, said the center is 
seeking both private and public funding for the project. CATHERINE JORDAN

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; WALLS YOU COULD WARM UP TO

 Since most homes have only one thermostat, some rooms get too cold while 
others are too hot. But in the home of the future, tiny sensors may signal when 
a room is too cold and, in response, tiny heat pumps embedded in the walls will 
immediately circulate warmer air. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the vision of researchers at the Department of Energy's 
Pacific Northwest Laboratory. They're developing a heat pump smaller than a 
dime -- small enough that they could be fabricated on a single sheet and 
incorporated into the walls of homes and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing conventional heat pumps would also save energy. That's because micro 
pumps don't need the ducts used to carry heat from room to room, and 20% to 30% 
of the energy produced by a regular heat pump is lost in such ducts. Another 
10% to 15% of energy is lost when the pump cycles off and on. 
</P>
<P>
 A working model of the micro pumps, which are made by the same photo-etching 
process used to make computer chips, is expected to be ready in about three 
years. Large-scale commercial development will depend on the efficiency of the 
pump and its manufacturing costs.

 X-Rays From Hollow Atoms: Hollow atoms may provide the breakthrough physicists 
at the University of Illinois, Chicago have been looking for in their 10-year 
effort to build an X-ray laser microscope powerful enough to reveal how viruses 
attack cells and how cancer cells grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking pictures of living cells at a microscopic scale requires an extremely 
bright light source because the size of the object visible through a microscope 
is limited by the wavelength of the light source: The shorter the wavelength, 
the higher the possible magnification. X-rays lie at the short-wavelength end 
of the light spectrum, but generally they're still not able to bring 
molecular-sized objects into view. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution may lie in a procedure in which xenon atoms are bombarded with 
intense ultraviolet radiation, causing the inner shells of the atoms to be 
ripped away, creating a "hollow" atom. When electrons rush in from the outer 
shells to fill the hollow space, X-rays are released. Researchers hope to have 
an operable X-ray laser by the end of the year. 
</P>

 Satellite Golf: Global positioning systems, which use a special network of 
satellites and miniature satellite receivers to determine exact geographical 
locations, are used to track truck fleets and airplanes. But Leading Edge 
Technologies Inc., based near Phoenix, wants to use GPS technology to keep 
track of golf carts. 
</P>
<P>
 The company equips its Prolink golf carts with an on-board GPS system, 
including a 7.5-inch color monitor, a Rockwell satellite receiver and an 
individual information-processing system. Not only do the carts provide duffers 
with a full-color display of hole layouts and yardage, but they can also get 
tips from the course's golf pro before playing a hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the clubhouse, an additional receiving unit helps the course manager 
keep track of all players and the speed of play of each cart. Leading Edge 
provides Prolink to courses on a per-round fee basis.  
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Agents: Some people who have wrestled with the IRS might agree that 
what the service needs is more smart agents. In lieu of hiring a bunch of 
doctorates, the IRS has begun using the services of "smart" software agents 
from Comshare Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich. The company's Commander Exception 
Monitor "detect and alert" software, co-developed with Anderson Consulting, is 
being used to help managers with their strategic planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 These secret software agents will hide out in the IRS database and monitor 
whether regional offices are paying their bills on time, tracking non-filers 
and processing returns in a timely and accurate manner. When the agent finds 
data that fits the parameters defined by the IRS, it assembles the information 
in a report that is downloaded to a manager's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 An office that has fallen below acceptable levels will be immediately visible. 
Eventually, the IRS hopes to have software agents track other functions such as 
accounts receivable and accounts in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun to 'Syngas': One of the problems with solar energy is how to deliver the 
power to users hundreds of miles away. The Weizmann Institute of Science in 
Rehovot, Israel, recently inaugurated a novel system for storing and 
transporting solar energy in liquid-chemical form. 
</P>
<P>
 The key element of the system is a solar reformer. Solar radiation is first 
concentrated and then directed into the reformer through a domed quartz window. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The concentrated sunlight produces a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide 
and methane, which in turn produces hydrogen and carbon monoxide as a mixture 
known as "syngas." This mixture can be stored until needed and transported 
through a pipeline to any destination.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; REPORT URGES EXPANDED 
GOVERNMENT ROLE IN VIRTUAL REALITY RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virtual reality was born in military research labs, but now that the Cold War 
is over, scientists are looking for new reasons to keep the dollars flowing for 
a technology whose development has largely been taken over by private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released this week -- sponsored by a consortium of federal 
agencies -- the National Research Council recommends that the government get 
into virtual reality research in a big way. The goal is to foster a fledgling 
technology that could lead to such futuristic wonders as endoscopic surgery by 
remote, and cheap exploration of outer space via telerobotics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recommendations raise questions about what the role of the government 
should be in a new industry that has already spawned dozens of start-up 
companies and fierce competition for yet-to-materialize markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that the government should stay way out of the whole thing," said 
Stan Kinsey, chief executive of Iwerks, a Burbank-based entertainment start-up 
that has invested heavily in creating virtual reality attractions for theme 
parks. "The free market works great. The consumer judges and people make 
free-market decisions, and the respective disciplines put resources in the 
right, applicable industries." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtual reality -- the ephemeral subset of computer technology that makes it 
possible to feel, really feel, like you're someplace that you're not -- has 
lately been driven largely by the entertainment industry's efforts to create 
more and more sophisticated illusions for consumers in search of leisure-time 
escape from the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 VR props include goggles, gloves, vests and other computer-driven tracking 
devices that connect to a display and a 3-D database to create a sense of 
immersion in a virtual world. But today's equipment has been known to make 
users drowsy, nauseated and disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
 And the committee of scientists and academics that put together the Research 
Council report said that entertainment industry uses of virtual reality for 
video games and rides requires lower image quality and slower response time 
than would be necessary for medical applications such as surgery or industrial 
uses such as automobile design. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt the government needed to push in the development of the kinds of 
equipment that the person has to wear, because that would probably not be 
addressed by the entertainment industry," said Anne Mavor of the NRC, co-editor 
of the study. "Our charge was to point out where we felt the major gaps in the 
technology were that are not being addressed by the private sector."  
</P>
<P>
 The main area in which the committee recommended a "major unified research 
program" was in virtual reality software, where the studies' authors perceived 
a lack of research in technologies that would provide sensory experiences for 
sound and touch, as well as imaging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computer hardware probably will be developed through commercial market forces 
if current trends continue; however, should serious lags in development occur, 
the government might then consider strategies for leveraging private-sector 
development efforts," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 That possibility -- and the report's allusion to federally set compatibility 
standards -- does not sit too well with Linden Rhoads, co-founder of 
Seattle-based Virtual I/O, a start-up backed by Logitech and cable operator 
Tele-Communications Inc. The firm plans to release its first product -- a set 
of light glasses that plug into a television or personal computer and create a 
large floating picture that "tracks" with the user's movements -- this 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would the public have been served if the government had stepped in and set 
standards for the operating systems of personal computers? I don't think so," 
said Rhoads, whose firm's core technology, in a typical pattern, grew out of a 
grant from the Army. "The market naturally produces higher- and higher-quality 
products. If I go ahead with this, there'll be someone else saying they can do 
it better. So I'm inspired to do the best I possibly can."

A COMMUNITY OF JOY; AT THE JEFFREY FOUNDATION FOR DISABLED KIDS, THE SOUNDS YOU 
HEAR ARE SINGING, LAUGHING AND SQUEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey was 2 weeks old when he was adopted, 2 years old when he was found to 
have muscular dystrophy and other disabilities, 7 when he went into a 
wheelchair and 16 when he died, in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers tell nothing of the joy and fulfillment Jeffrey brought into his 
adoptive mother's life -- or the love and sense of worth she brought to his. 
The richness of their time together survives in the Jeffrey Foundation, a 
day-care center founded and named by Alyce Morris to honor her son. 
</P>
<P>
 The beaming kids, from toddlers to teens, who are helped out of vans at the 
Los Angeles facility each morning have varying degrees of multiple disabilities 
-- autism, Down's syndrome, mental retardation, muscular dystrophy and cerebral 
palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 They enter the West Washington Boulevard center, where the drab gray exterior, 
high chain-link fence and bleak industrial neighborhood give no hint to what's 
inside. But Morris has little patience for those who judge the surface before 
examining the depths. "Come inside," she tells a visitor, "and see how it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris and guest sail from room to sun-filled room, absorbing the almost 
palpable aura of joy. Small groups of closely monitored children sing, act, 
dance, play with blocks and puzzles, do arts and crafts. In one room, kids 
squeal delightedly as they jump rope, watched by a smiling girl in a wheelchair 
-- one arm raised in a speechless version of a cheer. "She can't move her 
arms," a counselor says with a wink, observing the allegedly immobile child. 
</P>
<P>
 Down a hall, the open door of a large, sky-blue bathroom reveals a 3-year-old 
smiling smugly as a counselor applauds his mastery of the potty. 
</P>
<P>
 The ratio of counselors to children is 1 to 4. The building, purchased by 
Morris and opened four years ago, is not yet fully furnished (she depends on 
donations for much of that) -- but even the unused corners are spotless. And 
not a child among the 60 present on this particular afternoon is sitting sadly 
alone or disengaged from the activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had four job offers, but after I saw what happens here, none of the others 
could compare," says Kirsten Ives, assistant director since September, 1993. A 
specialist in education for the developmentally disabled, Ives says the center 
is "not a school, but it is run like one. These children are helped to live up 
to their potential. I leave here every night knowing I accomplished something 
wonderful by just being part of it. This place is built on a rock of love." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, whose handsome son Jeffrey appears in photos on many of the center's 
walls, is seasoned enough by now to know that love does not conquer all. 
</P>
<P>
 "One goal is to bring the higher functioning children to a level where they 
can be included in mainstream facilities in the community," she says. "But no 
matter how we try, that's not always possible for kids with very severe 
problems. Our feeling is that those kids deserve to be happy, too, to live 
their lives fully and not just watch others from the sidelines. We do that for 
them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Things have improved since the 1960s, when Jeffrey was found to be slightly 
retarded and to have muscular dystrophy. Morris and her husband were told that 
they should institutionalize him. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," she said as she began the rounds of doctors to find a treatment or 
cure. The depressing results made her even more determined to give her son a 
full life -- a commitment so total that her marriage fell apart. She divorced 
and moved with 5-year-old Jeffrey from Chicago to Los Angeles, where she'd been 
an actress and model before her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 She needed to work full-time, but there was no day care for children like 
Jeffrey. Whenever she tried to leave him somewhere, she says, he came home 
depressed, physically hurt or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris says the people who offered day care may have meant well, but they 
didn't have the energy, knowledge or desire to care for a multiple-handicapped 
child. They didn't care that Jeffrey was a kind, loving, sensitive child with a 
great sense of humor and compassion for others. They ignored him, even left him 
by himself. Worse yet, they did not meet his most basic needs or learn to 
interpret his simple requests. And so-called normal children were often cruel 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris says she went on welfare so she could take care of Jeffrey herself and 
seek out parents of similarly challenged children near Santa Monica, where she 
then lived. 
</P>
<P>
 She soon organized a group so that Jeffrey would have friends with whom to do 
arts and crafts, play games and take trips. She wanted him and others like him 
to experience the beach, amusement parks, concerts and playgrounds -- in other 
words, the joys of childhood she knew they so richly deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris' organization, begun more than two decades ago, has been expanded and 
transformed many times in attempts to provide help for children like Jeffrey, 
who became progressively weaker and who learned at age 8, while watching a 
Jerry Lewis telethon on TV, that he might soon die of his illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him we're all going to die," she recalls, "and we have to live as 
fully as we can each day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is Morris' dream come true. Staffed by about 35 teachers and 
aides, it offers full-day camp in summer and specially designed year-round 
programs for different age groups, from 18 months to 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 There are morning and afternoon programs for babies and preschoolers, and 
after-school programs for older children. Soon to come: infant care that 
stresses early intervention techniques to help minimize the effects of 
disabling conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Year-round care would total about $20,000 per child, Morris says, but there is 
no charge to the parents of children who attend the day-care programs. The 
private, not-for-profit foundation relies on a variety of sources for funds, 
including individual and corporate donations, charitable trusts and 
foundations, the California Department of Developmental Services, the 
California Department of Education and the Los Angeles City Community 
Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 400,000 disabled children in the state's public schools, 
according to the California Department of Education. Of those, about 6,715 have 
multiple handicaps -- defined as having two or more disabling conditions, such 
as mental retardation and muscular dystrophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these students, ages 5 to 22, live in Los Angeles County, and the 
Jeffrey Foundation cares for about 80 of them, with room for expansion. Most 
others are "mainstreamed" into day care with non-handicapped children, or 
privately cared for in their own or other people's homes, Morris says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who attend the Jeffrey Foundation are from low-income families, referred 
through one of the regional centers of the California Department of 
Developmental Services. Regional Center officials, for the most part, believe 
that even multiply handicapped children can be included in regular after-school 
programs at public schools, the YMCA and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 " Inclusion is the big word these days. We try as much as possible" to include 
the disabled child with non-handicapped kids, says Valerie Lattanza, intake 
counselor at Westside Regional Center. "To be honest, there aren't many options 
other than that.  
</P>
<P>
 "But sometimes," she adds, "there's just nowhere for a child to be included." 
</P>
<P>
 Sakina Nawab, 14, and her brother Ali, 10, fell into that category. For them, 
the Jeffrey Foundation has meant friends and fun. For their mother, Shahina, it 
has meant salvation of a sort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both my kids were born normal," Nawab says. "One fine morning, when Sakina 
was 3, she awoke with a limp." 
</P>
<P>
 The limp got worse, the weakness spread, and over the next dozen years of 
running to doctors on three continents, she says, her daughter deteriorated to 
the point where she is now in a wheelchair and must be fed, dressed and taken 
to the bathroom. She no longer speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when our son was 5, he, too, awoke with a limp," Nawab continues in her 
even tone. "And the same thing is happening to him." 
</P>
<P>
 No diagnosis has been made for either child. And Nawab says that by now, even 
if doctors could figure out what is wrong, there would be little hope of 
reversing the physical damage done. 
</P>
<P>
 She has stayed at home -- loving and caring for them and watching them become 
more disabled -- without a significant break or a chance to go to work. Both 
children are now in special education programs at Los Angeles public schools, 
she says, but she could find no after-school care to which she would entrust 
"two of the world's most precious kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "God has gifted me with the Jeffrey Foundation," says Nawab, who was referred 
there by the Westside Regional Center. "My kids are safe, happy and cared for 
by people who understand. And I have taken a job at a bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Most families with multiply handicapped children aren't as fortunate. 
"Programs designed to meet their special needs and to enhance their enjoyment 
of life are very scarce," says an official at one of the city's regional 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 So Morris keeps at it. Last month, she went to Chicago to open a branch of the 
Jeffrey Foundation. Jeffrey's adoptive father, whom she divorced long ago, will 
be on its board of directors. "He understands what has to be done for these 
kids," she says, "and I think he's proud of me."

ANTIOXIDANTS: CANCER PREVENTION OR A WASTE OF TIME?; HEALTH: TWO STUDIES 
DISPUTE THE NUTRIENTS' EFFECTIVENESS. SOME SAY ALL THE FINDINGS REALLY REVEAL 
IS A NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not too long ago, as many as 30% of Americans were consuming antioxidant 
supplements -- vitamins E and C and beta carotene -- to prevent disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Americans may not be so gung-ho. 
</P>
<P>
 After a decade of excitement, many antioxidant enthusiasts were crushed this 
year when two studies found the nutrients useless in protecting against lung 
cancer and colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The two studies also tested the faith of scientists and the vitamin industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies point up the need for continuing research on antioxidants and 
"should be viewed as a wake-up call," said John Cordaro, president of the 
Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group representing vitamin 
supplement makers and distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "These studies were very surprising, perhaps because we had become accustomed 
to an almost never-ending onslaught of positive results," Cordaro told members 
of the council Monday at its annual meeting in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 But adults should continue to take vitamins E and C and beta carotene, even 
while the research unfolds, conference attendees were told. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not suggest that anyone discontinue taking antioxidants on the basis 
of any one (study)," said Julie Buring, an antioxidants researcher at Harvard 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still plausible reasons to believe antioxidants work against cancer 
and heart disease, she said. Scientists propose that antioxidants deactivate 
free radicals, molecules that cause severe genetic damage to cells and lead to 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Antioxidants) act like a vacuum cleaner. They go in and get the oxygenated 
cells that attack DNA," Buring said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The studies that turned the most promising preventive health research of the 
era into a controversy were published this year in the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the Finnish and American researchers announced that a six-year study 
of 29,000 male smokers in Finland found no evidence that beta carotene 
supplements could prevent lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the most perplexing twist, the study found that the smokers taking 
beta carotene had an increased risk of stroke and a slightly elevated risk of 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in July, researchers at Dartmouth Medical School reported that beta 
carotene and vitamins C and E did nothing to lower the risk of colorectal 
cancer in 751 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies were exceptional in that they ran counter to most previous 
studies. For that reason, many scientists say they remain convinced that 
antioxidants really do work, said Dr. Kenneth Cooper, the aerobics guru. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much data out there that show the protective effects of 
antioxidants. Don't be led astray by the studies," Cooper advised the 
conference participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Supportive evidence had been building for more than two decades. For example, 
one study of 87,000 women during the 1980s showed that those who reported a 
diet very high in antioxidants from fruits and vegetables had a 46% lower risk 
of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies looking at the effects of antioxidants on cancer have not been as 
conclusive, Buring said, but they too indicate a positive effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with most of the previous studies, however, is that they simply 
compare people's diets with their health. To be accurate, the study 
participants have to correctly report what they eat over a period of several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers were eager for the results of the Finnish study because it was 
different. In that study, one group of people were given vitamin E and beta 
carotene supplements while a comparison group was given a placebo. It is this 
kind of randomized, controlled study that is considered most scientifically 
valid, Buring said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the results were especially distressing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buring and others say the study was flawed because the smokers were 
followed for only six years, too short a time to see the effects of a fairly 
low dose of beta carotene. Moreover, since the men were heavy smokers, it could 
be that beta carotene only works to prevent disease and cannot halt lung cancer 
after it has started. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the increased risk of stroke found in the men who took beta carotene, 
that is much harder to explain, Buring said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot exclude that this is just chance," she said of the finding. "I do 
not believe the results disprove the benefits of antioxidants. But it suggests 
that the benefits we've seen (in other studies) may have been overestimated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Research on whether antioxidants prevent certain types of cancer have been 
mixed, which is why the Dartmouth study on colorectal cancer was less 
upsetting, says Dr. Roberd Bostick, a antioxidants researcher at Wake Forest 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question of whether or not antioxidants have a role in preventing cancer 
is still a wide-open and very exciting question. The Finnish and Dartmouth 
studies have not derailed that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who should take antioxidants? Which ones? In what dosages? No one is eager 
to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting of cardiologists, two-thirds of the doctors said they took 
antioxidants but few admitted to recommending them to their patients, Cooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really not quite sure of the potential for harm from taking 
antioxidants. For that reason, I think physicians are a little bit scared about 
recommending them. But there is still enough evidence to convince them to take 
antioxidants themselves," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new book, "Antioxidant Revolution" (Nelson), Cooper recommends a daily 
"cocktail" of 400 international units of vitamin E, 1,000 milligrams of vitamin 
C and 25,000 IU of beta carotene. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buring urged patience. The next big randomized, controlled study on 
antioxidants -- the massive, 12-year Physicians' Health Study -- will be 
completed next year, with results available in 1996, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that study comes out positive, I think a lot of people will believe it."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: WHOSE VALUES ARE THESE, ANYWAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill offering a symbolic victory to the 
head of an ultraconservative organization whose name I can't say without 
smiling just a little: the Traditional Values Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional , I guess, refers to the group's rabid anti-homosexual, 
anti-abortion positions. I always smile to think of that particular definition 
of traditional , since homosexuality and abortion are not recent phenomena. I 
get a kick out of people who use traditional as shorthand for bemoaning the 
passing of the "good old days." Good for whom? I wonder. Was life so perfect a 
few decades ago? Were there no deaths from illegal abortions? No racial 
discrimination? No innocent lives ruined by red-baiting zealots? No angry 
housewives hitting the bottle out of boredom? What do they mean , exactly, by 
traditional? 
</P>
<P>
 But I digress. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill Wilson signed into law on Aug. 31 doubles the amount of time -- from 
six months to one year -- to which a person convicted of disrupting a religious 
service may be sentenced. It's still a misdemeanor, although the "traditional 
values" folks had hoped to attach an even harsher sentence. The bill -- clearly 
aimed at the gay community -- was inspired by a rowdy gay rights demonstration 
last year at a San Francisco church where the head of the Traditional Values 
Coalition was scheduled to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that activists who oppose abortion have screamed rather loudly 
about the trampling of their First Amendment rights after recent court 
decisions have imposed restrictions on demonstrations near medical clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 So why would they wrap themselves in the First Amendment, then turn around and 
try to limit the rights of others to protest? 
</P>
<P>
 As a "traditional values" leader explained it to a reporter last week: "If the 
pro-lifers can't block the abortion clinic, then homosexuals can't block the 
church. It's now a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. If you live on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a specious tactic, trying to equate anti-abortion demonstrations with 
pro-gay ones. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a fundamental flaw in the logic: While anti-abortion 
demonstrators are trying to shut down abortion clinics, trying to prevent women 
from ever exercising their legal, hard-won right to opt for abortion, gay 
demonstrators are not trying to shut down the churches where they have gathered 
to protest anti-gay leaders. They are not out to criminalize religious worship, 
nor are they out to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay activists are, in the best American tradition, making their points of view 
known. They are fighting for the civil rights they richly deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 And, on the whole, they are doing it rather peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 To my knowledge, no gay activist has killed a cleric, no gay activist has 
firebombed a church, nor sprayed acid in its halls. No gay activist has called 
for the death of any member of the clergy as an act of justifiable homicide, 
even though gay activists have accused the Catholic Church of "killing us," as 
in a famous ACT-UP demonstration in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true, however, that some demonstrations have gotten out of hand. And 
people who destroy church property should be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why I have no compelling objection to the newly amended law, even 
though it is of dubious necessity, except as a political tool to aid the 
reelection of the increasingly cynical Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What made the law a symbolic victory, instead of a practical one, for the 
"traditional values" people is that they had originally pressed for a law that 
would make disrupting religious services a felony , punishable by several years 
in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But in politics, as nearly nowhere else, symbols reign supreme. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wilson's pen stroke on this legislation -- just like his mean-spirited and 
anti-family veto last week of a measure that would have allowed domestic 
partners to register with the state in order to obtain limited benefits now 
reserved for married couples -- symbolizes a willingness to deny civil rights 
to people who are not heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 It symbolizes a willingness to use the civil rights of gays as chits to 
placate voters on the extreme right. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need stiffer penalties for church disruptions. And we shouldn't deny 
unmarried partners (of any sexual orientation) the ability to visit each other 
in the hospital or to easily will property to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's an election year, remember, a time when "traditional values" and 
hypocrisy go hand in hand.

'90S FAMILY; 52 WAYS TO KEEP BOREDOM AT BAY ON A RAINY DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco author Lynn Gordon grew up in a family of six kids in Brussels, 
Belgium, where it rained so much her clever mother had to use all her resources 
to invent things to do to forestall whining. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born the idea for "52 Rainy Day Activities," one of a series of six 
playing card-sized decks packed with bright ideas and lively illustrations to 
inspire fun on a wet afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Other decks in the series produced by Chronicle Books suggest "52 Adventures 
in New York City" and "52 Fun Things to Do in the Car." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a compulsive information pack rat and I keep track of all sorts of 
information," says Gordon, a product development expert and author of 
children's books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to put my Rolodex on cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Her rainy day activity suggestions include using odds and ends found in the 
kitchen junk drawer to create a collage (which also gets an oft-forgotten 
drawer tidied up) and making a small volcano at home using vinegar and baking 
soda. 
</P>
<P>
 Her little decks of ideas are destined to turn up near the cash registers in 
many bookstores marketed as what's called an "impulse item." 
</P>
<P>
 They cost $5.95 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I resent being a total novelty gift inventor?" says Gordon, who is working 
on other ideas for adults and kids -- such as 52 things to do in Washington and 
52 ways to mend a broken heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I do have a serious academic background as well as a terribly deep 
whimsical streak. But do I wish I was writing serious fiction and this was NPR? 
The answer is yes."

FIRST PERSON: '90S FAMILY; WHEN YOUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS ON 'SNOOZE'; HERS IS. 
SHE HAS NO YEARNING TO BE CALLED MON, TO STAY UP 'ROUND THE CLOCK, TO GIVE UP

<TEXT>
<P>
 I keep checking my vital signs, straining for the sound that everyone says 
must be right around the corner. But there's only gaping silence. No ticktock, 
ticktock. No warm fuzzy feelings when I see pictures of plump, smiling babies. 
</P>
<P>
 At 35, my biological clock has not kicked in, and that has me worried. 
</P>
<P>
 My condition -- if you will -- flies in the face of common expectations. 
Subtle but persistent messages inform us that motherhood is still one of the 
most fulfilling experiences a woman can have. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers are full of women who juggle marriage, a rewarding career and 
children. Friends talk about waking up one day and knowing the hour had come: 
They were ready to assume the mantle of motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The future looms ominous. Didn't a famous, fortysomething TV anchorwoman 
announce a much-ballyhooed hiatus from her high-paying job to devote more time 
to trying to have a baby? Will I ruefully be doing the same in seven years, 
cursing the fact that I didn't take advantage of my supple ovaries when I had 
the chance? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. But all I know is, I'm not ready to have children right now, and the 
sands in the hourglass of my fertility trickle lower with each year that I 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I will never feel that fierce yearning to be a mother but will become 
one anyway and be happy that I did. Maybe my husband and I will remain 
childless -- he is ambivalent anyway. Maybe we will adopt -- there are too many 
unwanted babies in this world already. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I know. I'm selfish. Ungrateful to relatives who want to hear the 
pitter-patter of little feet. Some kind of a freak to acquaintances who long 
ago birthed three kids and moved to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and so First World. In many parts of the world, babies aren't always 
planned meticulously. If you wait until you're financially ready, that day may 
never arrive. Sometimes babies just come and everyone adjusts a little bit and 
goes on living. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have traveled know what I mean. When I was in Albania last year, 
women would crowd around and ask how many kids my husband and I had. 
</P>
<P>
 "None," I responded, reaching into my pocket to make sure I hadn't forgotten 
to pack my contraceptive pills. "We've only been married two years." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, don't be too sad," they would cluck. "If you keep trying, you're bound 
to have luck sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 My mother, 74, is surprisingly sagacious about the whole thing. She never put 
any pressure on me to get married and she's never put any pressure on me to 
have a child. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the woman who told me to stop kidding when I showed her my engagement 
ring and told her I was getting married. "C'mon, Denise, tell us the truth, 
where did you get that ring?" she wheedled. 
</P>
<P>
 And now that she is tied up with baby-sitting my 1-year-old niece, Laurence, 
my mother has other things on her mind besides my womb. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you intend me to help with your kids, you'd better hurry up and have some, 
because I'm not getting any younger" is the most she'll say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I know," I mutter darkly. 
</P>
<P>
 This is on my mind a lot already; I don't need to be reminded. We are both 
getting older, but age does not bring any clear answer to my dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 I draw some consolation from the fact that my mother, a retired OB-GYN nurse, 
had me, her first child, at 39. My little sister came when she was 44. I come 
from rugged Franco-Slavic gynecological stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong, I'm no W.C. Fields. I love my nieces and nephew and marvel 
at their beauty and intelligence. But am I ready to change diapers and stay up 
all night? Not since I stopped baby-sitting as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but Henry Jaglom's film "Babyfever" does not speak to me. I like babies 
on principle, can even imagine having them one day, in an abstract kind of way. 
But I was very conscious of our unencumbered state when we booked a two-week 
trip to Crete and Santorini recently. 
</P>
<P>
 How could we manage such a vacation with children? How will I ever be able to 
devote enough attention to my career and a baby? I have this sneaking suspicion 
I would find it hard to leave an infant in day care. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, I didn't even get a dog until age 33 because I didn't feel I could offer 
it enough quality time. 
</P>
<P>
 I stand in awe of working friends who struggle to juggle kids and cooking and 
piano lessons and PTA and husbands while caring for their aging parents. Rare 
is the time they have to read a book or go to the gym. Or have money to burn on 
silly personal things like that eight-volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy we 
purchased last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the other hand, do I envision myself with children at age 50? Do I 
picture us with a family gathered to eat Thanksgiving dinner in the year 2005? 
If so, I'd better get serious soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The other evening, I came home from work late. Exhausted, I ate chips for 
dinner and slid between the sheets to read Susan Straight's great novel, 
"Aquaboogie." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a luxurious feeling, and a somewhat guilty pleasure. Across Los 
Angeles, harried mothers were coaxing spoonfuls of creamed spinach into their 
babies' mouths, giving baths and helping with homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to get it out of my system," I explained to my husband, holding up the 
book. "One day, I'll be ready for children." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe.

'90S FAMILY; PARENTS, TEACHERS SHOULD BE FRIENDS; EDUCATION: FREQUENT, 
OPEN-MINDED CONFERENCES WILL HELP KEEP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN ABOUT 
THE CHILD'S CLASSROOM PROGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN O. RYAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many parents approach parent-teacher conferences with the doomed reluctance of 
a trip to the principal's office. But such dread is misplaced, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for parents to remember that this is a meeting with their 
child's teacher, not some intimidating teacher they remember from their own 
childhood," said Barbara Wahlquist, vice president of parenting education for 
the California State PTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and teachers share a responsibility in nurturing a child's education. 
Conferences provide the ideal setting for maintaining open lines of 
communication between you and the school about your child's academic and social 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents should think of the teacher as a team member, like an extension of 
the family," said Diane Watanabe, consultant for the Learning and Thinking 
Skills Institute of the Los Angeles County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all working toward the same goal in helping that particular child 
achieve his or her best," she said. "Parents should approach the teacher as a 
friend. Conferences should be beneficial to everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe said studies find a direct relationship between a child's emotions 
and how well he learns. So parents need to ask not only about academics, but 
how happy the child is at school. Does he associate well with his peers? 
</P>
<P>
 Most Southern California school districts schedule at least two conferences 
each school year, but educators and parental advocates alike encourage parents 
to meet with teachers as many times as necessary to track a student's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many parents think they can only go to the school when they are called," 
Wahlquist said. "That's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Want to make the most of your meetings with the teacher? Here are some 
suggestions from parents and educators: 
</P>
<P>
 * Get to know your child's teacher early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss the conference ahead of time with your child and take a written list 
of concerns you both have. 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, both parents should attend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Go to the conference open-minded regarding suggestions and observations made 
by the teacher. Try to understand, not react. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be an advocate for your child. You know your child better than anyone else. 
Take time to think about your child's strengths and weaknesses and share these 
thoughts with the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Report to the teacher any significant news from the home front that may 
affect your child's schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let your child attend the conference with you. This avoids conflicting 
viewpoints between teachers and students and keeps things open and honest. It 
also lets your child play a role in problem-solving. If your child cannot 
attend, discuss the conference when you get home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out the teacher's attitudes about homework and share your own beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you need an interpreter, ask the school to provide one for you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be afraid to ask the teacher to explain terms you don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your child experiences difficulties in school, ask the teacher for a 
weekly report and agree to a follow-up conference within six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be a good listener and stay calm.

IN PRAISE OF NANCY, THE HARDYS; CONVENTION: THE APPEAL OF THE KID-SLEUTH BOOKS 
AND OTHER SERIES IS NO SECRET TO FANS, WHO TOAST THEIR HEROES THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a child in the 1950s, Vicki Broadhurst of Newport Beach first discovered 
Nancy Drew. She and her girlfriends devoured every volume in the series 
starring the resourceful teen-age sleuth who tooled around River Heights in a 
sporty blue roadster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between all of us we had just about the whole set," recalls Broadhurst, 46. 
Like most girls who grew up reading Nancy Drew, she viewed the loyal, 
trustworthy and self-sufficient, all-American girl as a role model: "I would 
have been very happy in real life to have Nancy Drew as my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dan Josslin of Foothill Ranch, it was the Hardy Boys. You remember sleuths 
Frank and Joe Hardy of Bayport, the teen-age sons of "internationally famous 
detective" Fenton Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did everything kids would really like to do and couldn't," says Josslin, 
48. "They had motorcycles, motorboats and cars -- and their parents didn't 
interfere with them. They were smart, attractive, popular and talented. Both 
the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew were just wonder kids." 
</P>
<P>
 If you read Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys as a child -- or you're a child 
reading Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys in the '90s -- Buena Park is the place to 
be this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadhurst and Josslin -- two of Orange County's biggest collectors of 
children's series books -- have joined three other Southern California 
collectors in organizing the Series Book Collectors Convention at the Buena 
Park Hotel from Thursday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Drew and the Hardys are just a few of the fictional heroes who will be 
discussed, probed and appreciated at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of series-book characters is a big one. There's everything from teen 
sleuths to sports-series characters to Josslin's favorite, Freddy the Pig (the 
lead character in a series about anthropomorphic barnyard animals). There have 
been hundreds of children's-book characters over the years and each, it seems, 
has someone who collects them. 
</P>
<P>
 Josslin is not sure how many series-book fans will go to Buena Park, but a 
Nancy Drew convention at the University of Iowa last year gathered about 400 
Drew fanatics from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make really good connections at these things -- you meet other people you 
can trade books with from around the country," says Josslin, regional services 
manager for the Orange County Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most series-book fans who stopped buying the books as teen-agers and 
began collecting later in life, Josslin has never stopped accumulating the 
books since reading his first Hardy Boys volume, "The Tower Treasure," when he 
was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 He now has more than 4,000 books representing more than 100 vintage series. 
They're impressively displayed in floor-to-ceiling oak bookcases in an upstairs 
room devoted solely to his series-book-collecting passion.  
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia is a primary incentive for an adult to start collecting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're in their 60s now, they remember fondly the books from the 1930s 
and '40s," Josslin says. "My age group -- the baby boomers -- remember the 
books from the '50s. And, of course, once you get hooked as a collector, you 
branch out and collect books from different eras too." 
</P>
<P>
 Series books are relatively affordable collectibles. A Hardy Boys book that 
sold for a buck in the '50s can be had for $10 to $20; Broadhurst, who began 
collecting in earnest 15 years ago and now owns about 2,000 series books, 
recently paid "under $500" for a "very scarce" 1904 first-edition Bobbsey 
Twins.  
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of series books to children is no mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were real accessible to young readers because there was a lot of 
action," Josslin says. "After you read the first one or two, you became real 
familiar with the characters and the formula. If it was a formula that 
appealed, like mystery or adventure or school stories or sports stories, you 
could count on that formula being repeated time after time." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a winning formula for nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Stratemeyer, a writer of boys stories who became a phenomenally 
successful literary entrepreneur, is credited with founding the 20th-Century 
series book. As Fortune magazine put it in 1934: Stratemeyer did "the first of 
it, the best of it, the worst of it, and with rare justice made the most money 
from it." 
</P>
<P>
 The key? He reduced the price of the books from as much as $1.25 to 50 cents. 
The books were dubbed "fifty-centers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the combination of dropping the price so children could afford to buy 
them and shifting the focus from 19th-Century sensibilities to a more 
contemporary approach," says Deidre Johnson, author of two books on the 
Stratemeyer Syndicate, which created the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and nearly 100 
other series books for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who teaches children's literature at West Chester University in West 
Chester, Pa., and who will lead a panel discussion on series-book history at 
the convention, says series books for children started in the United States 
around 1830. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, "Stratemeyer was the one who introduced a lot of things we 
consider standard now, such as modern technology or current events and 
characters who don't age."  
</P>
<P>
 In previous series books, Johnson says, the characters would have tremendous 
success and thus move themselves out of the series. "Most of Stratemeyer's 
heroes helped others and had smaller success so you could continue a series 
indefinitely. Before, many series would end after six volumes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratemeyer's first big hit, which he wrote early in the century, was the 
Rover Boys. In writing the series, which followed three brothers through 
adolescence, Stratemeyer tried to be "more playful, entertaining and more 
varied than previous series about schoolboys," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 1906, Stratemeyer continued to write books published under his 
name and two pseudonyms, but for almost everything else coming out of his 
syndicate he would come up with the plots and others would write the books 
under pen names. They were, says Johnson, "mostly journalists who were able to 
write rapidly and smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 Another early Stratemeyer Syndicate series success, begun in 1904, was the 
Bobbsey Twins. Then came Tom Swift, the boy inventor, in 1910. But the heyday 
of the syndicate was between 1910 and 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 At the highest point between 1915 and 1925, Johnson says, "Stratemeyer had 
more than 30 different series going simultaneously and they covered everything: 
fantasy series, series aimed at little girls, series aimed at little boys -- at 
boys interested in technology, boys interested in war, girls who wanted 
careers, girls who just wanted to imagine they had the leisure to travel around 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The two most successful Stratemeyer Syndicate series books are the Hardy Boys 
(begun in 1927) and Nancy Drew (1930).  
</P>
<P>
 In Johnson's view, the series books are less significant as children's 
literature than as a window on children's culture of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're invaluable for showing ideas that adults wanted to pass on to 
children and for looking at the importance of trends, like technology," Johnson 
says. "You could see America's amazement at the kind of technology coming out 
of that period. Airplanes started showing up in series books as early as 1909." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says the older series books have been criticized for racist language, 
but even then "what they're doing, even though we don't like to admit it, is 
they're mirroring attitudes of the times." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says many of the Stratemeyer series books began to fade out by the 
early '40s, due, in part, to paper shortages during the war. The popularity of 
the movies and later comic books and television, she says, also had an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Although series books for children have continued over the years, she says, 
"their popularity has gone up and down. Right now they're in an up period." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, although Johnson doesn't have current statistics for boys series 
books, an updated bibliography of girls series shows that there were 230 new 
series for girls between 1975 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson guesses that "it was the girls series that really pushed the new 
series renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most popular series today, she says, is the Babysitter's Club and 
its spinoff, the Babysitter's Little Sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is not sure why series books faded, then came back strongly over the 
past decade, but she thinks there are a number of reasons for their popularity. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "One is, they're predictable: Readers know they can get more of the same kind 
of story, which is very reassuring in an increasingly uncertain world. Another 
is just the fun of finding a familiar friend in books," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the series books into less-expensive paperback format in the late '70s 
and early '80s, she says, also had an effect on their increased popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another reason for their appeal, Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe wish-fulfillment is the other reason. . . . Series characters usually 
seem to lead more successful, more glamorous lives than children in mainstream 
children's literature, or the readers themselves." What's on the Agenda 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day Series Book Collectors Convention is the third-ever general 
series book convention in the nation and the first in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 On the agenda are talks by William Gillies and Rudy Nappi, cover illustrators 
for Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books; Nancy Axelrad, who wrote for Nancy Drew 
and several other series; Joyce Brotman, co-producer of the Nancy Drew/Hardy 
Boys 1970s television series, and actor Frank Thomas, who played Nancy Drew's 
boyfriend opposite Bonita Granville's Nancy in four movies in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention also will offer nuts-and-bolts information on how to grade the 
condition of old books as well as a discussion of reference books. A dealer and 
exhibit room will have displays of original book-cover artwork, movie posters, 
board games and other collectibles, author contracts and rare series books from 
the end of the 19th Century through the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is $85. For further details, call Dan Josslin at (714) 581-0435.

JACK DODSON; STAGE ACTOR, 'ANDY GRIFFITH' REGULAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Dodson, whose facile talents permitted him to portray both the comic 
intellectual snob on "The Andy Griffith Show" and the depressed and angry night 
clerk in Eugene O'Neill's demanding "Hughie," has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A daughter, Cristina, said Tuesday her father died Friday in a Los Angeles 
hospital of heart failure.He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Although best known as the stuffy egghead county clerk Howard Sprague on the 
Griffith show and a series offshoot, "Mayberry R.F.D.," Dodson's earliest 
credits were on the New York stage. 
</P>
<P>
 From the late 1950s through the mid-1970s, he was seen in such classics as 
"Our Town" and such contemporary offerings as "Six Characters in Search of an 
Author." He and Jason Robards were in "Hughie" in New York's Royale Theatre in 
1964 and again in 1975 at the Westwood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968 and 1972 he was seen at the Mark Taper Forum in "Chemin de Fer" and 
"Who's Happy Now," respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 His character on the Griffith show liked to try and impress his country 
neighbors with large words and curious logic that sometimes betrayed him. He 
often came down with foot-in-mouth disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But oddly, it was when Griffith saw him in the depressing talking jag that 
comprises "Hughie" that he was hired for the rural comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 He began appearing on "Andy Griffith" in 1967, the year before the star left 
the show. He continued on "Mayberry R.F.D." until it ended in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 He made more than 150 guest appearances on other TV shows including "The 
Fugitive," "Hawaii Five-O," "Newhart," "Barney Miller," "Cagney & Lacey," "St. 
Elsewhere," "Matlock" and "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
 In films he was seen in "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid," "Thunderbolt and 
Lightfoot" and "Something Wicked This Way Comes." 
</P>
<P>
 His other survivors include his wife, Mary, and another daughter, Amy.

DON SILVERMAN; PRODUCER ALSO WROTE, DIRECTED FOR TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emmy-award winning producer Don Silverman, who also wrote and directed dozens 
of episodic and special TV programs, has died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Richard Silverman, said the Boston-born television executive was 
60 when he died Thursday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman worked in the industry for more than 40 years, first in radio and 
later in TV, rising from production assistant to producer-director of such 
varied programming as the CBS and NBC network news shows to the Miss Universe 
pageants. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman was involved with the "Today" show in its formative years and 
produced "The Dick Cavett Show," for which he won an Emmy for daytime 
programming in the 1968-69 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Other award-winning programs or TV movies he wrote or helped produce and 
direct included "Act of Love: The Patricia Neal Story," "The Diary of Anne 
Frank," "The Winds of War," "Mork and Mindy," "Mark Twain Tonight" and "NBC 
White Paper: Organized Crime in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his brother, Silverman is survived by two children, Nicholas and 
Michelle Earl.

FRANCO MOSCHINO; CREATOR OF IRREVERENT FASHION DESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Franco Moschino, the irreverent designer who once created a ball gown from 
garbage bags, has died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for his firm said Monday the enfant terrible of Italian fashion 
died Sunday of an abdominal tumor at his lakeside villa in Brianza, near Milan. 
He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Lida Castelli said Moschino had been ill since surgery for the 
tumor two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The designer, one of the top names in Italian fashion, was known for his 
outrageous ensembles and penchant for poking fun at the fashion world as he 
melded playful details into classic styling. 
</P>
<P>
 At his last show, a 10-year retrospective in October, he brought back some of 
his favorites: a jacket embroidered at the waist with the words "Waist of 
Money," a teddy bear hat, an unfinished blazer and an evening gown made of 
brassieres. 
</P>
<P>
 Posters advertising his ready-to-wear creations proclaimed "Ready to Where?" 
</P>
<P>
 He also introduced a ball gown of gray plastic garbage bags. After the show, 
he said the gown's message was "fashion is trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Moschino preferred showroom appointments to the ostentatious runway, but never 
held back during his exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 He presented clothing with labels and price tags prominently displayed, a 
jacket with lettering that read, "This is very expensive," tape-measure belts, 
dinner jackets decorated with real cutlery, and a sweater with yarn and 
knitting needles attached to the collar. 
</P>
<P>
 He also teased other designers, spoofing the famed Chanel suit by trimming it 
with colorful plastic ruffles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fashion reflects the confusion, the mess we have in our brains," he once 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, Moschino had been raising funds for a hospice for 
children with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Moschino was first drawn to fashion when he attended evening classes at 
Milan's Brera Academy of Fine Arts from 1967 to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to work as a free-lance illustrator with Italian Gianni Versace 
from 1974 to 1977 and then as a designer of numerous fashion collections for 
other houses. 
</P>
<P>
 He launched his own collection in 1983 and produced economically priced "Cheap 
and Chic" lines for men and women.

SACRAMENTO FILE: WILSON SIGNS BILL TO PAY FOR METAL DETECTORS IN L.A. SCHOOLS

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed a bill authorizing the spending of $1 million in 
federal funds to buy walk-through metal detectors to prevent students in Los

 The governor said the presence and use of guns in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District has reached "alarming proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 "A safe school environment is a primary component to learning," Wilson said. 
"It's simply impossible for students to focus on reading, writing and 
arithmetic when they worry about muggings, shootings and dope dealing."

effectively immediately. GOVERNOR

reduce the number of days from 120 to 90 during which the mother of an adopted

<P>
 * Teen-Age Vandalism: AB 308 by Assemblyman Dean Andal (R-Stockton) to

 The son of former Michigan Gov. George Romney was ahead in early primary 
returns Tuesday for the GOP Senate nomination to challenge Massachusetts 
Democrat Edward M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 In another race, three little-known Democrats were seeking the right to run 
against popular GOP Gov. William F. Weld. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma, voters were settling a runoff between Rep. Mike Synar and a 
little-known challenger, picking a Democratic candidate for governor, and were 
deciding on a term limit plan. In Washington, voters chose candidates to 
challenge GOP Sen. Slade Gorton and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Massachusetts Senate primary, W. Mitt Romney had 1,641 votes, or 85%, 
to 294 votes, or 15%, for John Lakian. Both are wealthy venture capitalists. 
Kennedy had no primary opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic gubernatorial primary, state Rep. Mark Roosevelt had 1,671 
votes, or 51%; former state Sen. George Bachrach had 907 votes, or 28%, and 
state Sen. Michael Barrett had 701 votes, or 21%, in very early returns. 
Roosevelt is a great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt and a distant

 In Washington, nine Democrats vied for the right to challenge Gorton, who once 
was defeated for reelection and whose poll standings have never topped 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The front-runners were veteran King County lawmaker Ron Sims and retired 
television anchorman Mike James, both from the Seattle area. Gorton had token 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Washington's 5th District, Foley was the only Democrat on a ballot 
with four Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma, Synar was forced into a runoff with retired school principal 
Virgil Cooper after failing to get a majority of the vote in the Aug. 23 
primary. The winner will face Republican Tom Coburn, a Muskogee doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gov. Jack Mildren, a former star quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners, 
took a strong lead in his runoff race with state Sen. Bernice Shedrick for the 
Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Mildren had 61% of the vote to 39% for 
Shedrick in very early returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face Republican Frank Keating, a former Justice Department 
official, and independent Wes Watkins, a former congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are seeking to succeed Democrat Gov. David Walters, who chose 
not to run for reelection after pleading guilty to a campaign law violation. 
</P>
<P>
 The term limit plan would hold Oklahoma congressmen to three two-year terms 
and senators to two six-year terms. In 1990, Oklahoma became the first state to 
adopt term limits on state legislators. That law took effect in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Two polls released Tuesday found overwhelming support for term limits for 
members of Congress: 80% in a survey of 4,809 people conducted by the 
nonpartisan Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press, and 74% in a poll 
of 743 people, sponsored by the advocacy group U.S. Term Limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The term limit group also found 8 in 10 people prefer a limit of three terms 
on the lawmakers, rather than a six-term limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits are generally more popular with Republicans, who have fewer 
incumbents, than with Democrats, who have more seats to lose. The Clinton 
Administration has weighed in against term limits in a case pending before the 
Supreme Court. The White House is arguing that states have no constitutional 
right to regulate membership in Congress.

BOXING PROGRAM IS SHUT DOWN BY CITY OFFICIALS; RECREATION: COUNCIL QUESTIONS 
DIRECTOR'S HANDLING OF DISPUTES AND FEARED POSSIBLE VIOLENCE AT LAS PALMAS 
PARK. A REPLACEMENT EFFORT IS ORDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A popular boxing program has been closed down by the City Council, because 
city officials believed its director handled conflicts between his boxers 
improperly and officials feared the program might spark violence at Las Palmas 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the City Council Monday ordered Ed Montan, the new director of 
Recreation and Community Services, to draw up a replacement boxing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Campa, who started the Community Youth Boxing Program 18 months ago, said 
the council's decision was unwarranted and that replacing the program won't be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to work like that," said Campa of the council's plan. A former 
gang member, ex-convict and recovered drug addict, Campa is known in the 
community for his talent in reaching youngsters. "I've got a lifetime of 
experiences. It's hard work (to set up a boxing program) and you have to know 
what you are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the program had presented the City Council a petition with 800 
names of people who back Campa's boxing program. The program serves about 30 
boys and girls, from elementary to high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Campa had said his boxing program -- started with the blessing of former Parks 
and Recreation Director Jess Margarito -- was the best way to keep the peace at 
Las Palmas Park by giving youths an alternative to violence and drugs. 
Conditions at the park deteriorated in 1991 when a gang shootout wounded a 
mother and her three children. The city then banned gang members from the park 
for a year, and the atmosphere there has steadily improved. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems over Campa's efforts started three weeks ago when Montan saw 
Campa handle a disagreement between two of his boxers that started when one 
insulted the other's sister. Campa stepped in and had the boys put on boxing 
gloves to settle the dispute. But they did not use mouth-pieces or protective 
head gear, which worried Montan. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, after a baseball game between Campa's boxers and a visiting team 
from Blythe Street in Van Nuys, a fight broke out at the park. Recreation staff 
members claim they saw a gun during the scuffle. But Campa and Augie Maldonado, 
the executive director of Salud, an agency that sponsors the program, deny that 
their kids were involved in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Montan said he was worried that the program could leave the city open for a 
lawsuit if anyone had been hurt. Campa defends his program, saying he had never 
had an injury in the 18 months he had the program, and that head protection and 
mouth guards are used whenever the boxers spar, except in a case when they were 
resolving an argument. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sept. 12, the boxing program has been banned from using the park. The 
city had also banned another Salud program -- the Starting at Home Youth Club 
-- from using the park as well. On Monday night, the City Council unanimously 
restored the permit for the youth club but asked that a new boxing program be 
created. 
</P>
<P>
 Montan said he wanted to provide more supervision in his new program, 
establishing rules that would require youths to stay in school, take physicals 
and sign releases. He also would like to see Campa work with the new program in 
some capacity. "He was obviously reaching some of these kids," Montan said 
Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Montan said he would like to find a better site for the boxing program because 
another group has also applied to start a tennis program on the courts that 
Campa had been using. He said he hoped the owner of a warehouse might donate 
space for them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campa said he blames Montan for shutting down the boxing program and said 
he will not deal with the city anymore. The city has donated a small amount 
money to the program but has not charged it to use city facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one that destroyed it," Campa said. Instead, he will try to find a 
facility off city property to continue the program. Monday night, when San 
Fernando Mayor Raymond Ojeda refused to let Campa speak during a council 
debate, saying his remarks were out of order, Campa stormed out of the room 
followed by about a dozen of his boxers who had shown up in support. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxers told the City Council that since the program was closed down, they 
have been left with nothing to do on their afternoons but hang out at the park. 
They said police now harass them just for being at Las Palmas Park.

EASTERN STORMS FORCE SHUTTLE TO LAND AT EDWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diverted across the continent because of Florida thunderstorms, space shuttle 
Discovery touched down safely at its alternative landing site here Tuesday 
afternoon beneath clear blue skies. 
</P>
<P>
 The landing ended an 11-day voyage highlighted by the first untethered space 
walk by U.S. astronauts in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials said that no significant technical problems marred the flight 
or the landing of the space vessel that carried five men and one woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discovery turned in an almost flawless performance," said Loren Shriver, NASA 
launch integration manager during a post-mission briefing in Houston that was 
seen by closed-circuit television at Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle stayed aloft two days longer than planned because of stormy 
weather near the orbiter's primary landing site at Cape Canaveral. Shriver said 
NASA opted to keep the shuttle in space past its scheduled landing in hopes 
that the Florida weather would clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edwards landing boosted the cost of this mission by about $1 million, NASA 
officials said, because of additional personnel expenses and the cost of 
ferrying the spacecraft back to its Florida launching site atop a modified 
Boeing 747 jet. 
</P>
<P>
 A California landing also means the spacecraft won't get back to its home base 
for at least five or six days. 
</P>
<P>
 After two opportunities for a Florida landing went by Tuesday morning, Shriver 
said, NASA officials decided it "just wasn't in the cards this time," and they 
opted for California. 
</P>
<P>
 By about 2 p.m., about 1,000 NASA workers and 500 visitors were gathered on 
the ground and on rooftops at the base to listen for the descending shuttle's 
distinctive double sonic booms (which were clearly heard in the San Fernando 
Valley) and to scan the skies for a glimpse of the craft. 
</P>
<P>
 As Discovery touched down at 2:14 p.m., a recording of the "Star Spangled 
Banner" burst out of loudspeakers at the NASA complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Discovery astronauts were whisked inside to undergo medical tests. They 
are scheduled to fly back to Houston early today. 
</P>
<P>
 The untethered space walk on Friday, 150 miles above Earth, was to test a new 
type of personal jet pack. The device, tested in turns by astronauts Mark Lee 
and Carl Meade, was designed to propel the wearer through space during an 
emergency. Crews working outside future space stations might be equipped with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scientific highlight of the mission was the firing of laser pulses 
toward Earth. NASA officials said data gathered from this test will lead to a 
better understanding of Earth's climate and help scientists learn how human 
activity is affecting the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 During the mission, the astronauts also turned loose a $14-million satellite 
that studied the sun's corona for two days. Then the crew retrieved the 
satellite so that it could be returned to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission was Discovery's 19th trip into space and NASA's 64th shuttle 
mission, including the tragic Challenger launch in 1986.

COUNTY LEASES CANADIAN FIREFIGHTING PLANE; SAFETY: 'SUPER SCOOPER' CAN DUMP 
SEVEN TONS OF WATER ON BLAZES, THEN REFILL FROM OCEAN OR LAKES. AGREEMENT 
COVERS THREE MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles County on Tuesday became the first California jurisdiction to 
acquire a long-coveted Canadian tanker plane that fights brush fires by bombing 
them with up to seven tons of water scooped on the fly from lakes or the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to lease the Canadair CL-215T, or 
"super scooper," from the Quebec government for a maximum of three months, 
beginning in early October. Leasing the plane, including the services of two 
Canadian flight crews and a mechanic, will cost up to $719,000, plus $515 for 
every hour it is in the air.  
</P>
<P>
 Costly as leasing the plane may appear, the expense pales in comparison to the 
$1 billion in damage Southern California sustained in last autumn's devastating 
fires, said County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman. Twenty-six fires struck six 
Southern California counties last fall, including the Calabasas-Malibu fire, 
which killed three people. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said the plane could prove invaluable in improving the chances of 
quickly controlling or dousing a fire because, unlike other tanker planes and 
retardant-dropping helicopters which must be loaded by ground crews, the super 
scooper can swoop down on a body of water and take on 1,400 gallons in less 
than 12 seconds, simply scooping it up as the plane roars along the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Fire Department will tap its $5-million contingency fund to pay for 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "The super scooper is not a panacea, but it will help us make a heavy, 
decisive hit from the air during the crucial initial stages of a fire," Freeman 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Based at Van Nuys Airport, the plane will be used throughout the county, not 
just in the unincorporated areas that are the responsibility of county 
firefighters. The city of Los Angeles has tentatively agreed to allow the 
county to store the plane for free and let the crew use a vacant fire station 
at the old Air National Guard base in the northwest corner of Van Nuys Airport, 
Freeman said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past, officials had rejected the super scooper for several reasons, 
including its purchase price -- $16.5 million -- and the fact that it cannot 
fly at night or in extremely gusty winds and cannot get refills from the ocean 
in choppy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 Local homeowner groups whose longstanding campaign to acquire the plane had 
received a boost from last year's devastating fires praised the lease agreement 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need this tool in our toolbox," said Alan Kishbaugh, president of the Los 
Angeles Federation of Hillside and Canyon Associations, which represents 55 
homeowner groups between Westlake Village and Mt. Washington. "It might even 
lead to lower (fire) insurance premiums."  
</P>
<P>
 The performance of the 65-foot-long plane will be evaluated by county fire 
officials, who will report the results to the board.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it is going to prove essential to protect life and property," said 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who, with Supervisor Ed Edelman, co-sponsored the 
motion to bring the plane to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plane indeed proves useful, the county would explore forming a joint 
powers agency with other local governments, the state and the federal 
government to purchase one, Antonovich said.  
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, the state also moved to lease and test the super scooper. 
Reversing a position he took two years ago when he vetoed a similar program, 
Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Terry Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) allowing the leasing and testing of two super scoopers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, scheduled to begin next spring, would be administered by the 
state Department of Forestry, which would have the final say over where the 
airplanes would be deployed. But the state did not appropriate any funds for 
the program, and legislators are still seeking at least $1.8 million in funding 
from the federal government.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; YEAR-OLD PAPER GIVES PROJECTS OWN FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugo Garcia, editor in chief of the Resident's Voice, held up a photo 
scheduled to run in the newspaper with an article about job training programs 
offered through the Los Angeles Housing Authority.  
</P>
<P>
 The photo was of two public housing residents installing a toilet that they 
had just fixed. "The major media would never cover this," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the goals of increasing communication between the housing authority and 
the residents of public housing and letting those residents' accomplishments 
and concerns be heard, the Resident's Voice is a unique experiment in community 
journalism.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the newspaper was recognized by the National Assn. of Housing and 
Redevelopment Officials for its work in direct resident services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Voice, with a circulation of 12,000, was established in August of last 
year and is published about every three months. The paper, written in both 
English and Spanish and also partly translated to Vietnamese and Cambodian, is 
distributed to public housing residents in Pacoima, South-Central and East Los 
Angeles, Culver City and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
HUD has given the Los Angeles Housing Authority $400,000 over a three- to 
five-year period to develop the Voice into a self-sufficient newspaper, Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Voice's reporters and photographers are public housing residents and 
work on a volunteer basis, although they are sometimes provided with a stipend. 
They range in age from 11 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 None has any journalism experience, Garcia said. But he said he is happy to 
train his recruits, giving them new skills that could be used in a journalism 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 One such aspiring journalist is Luz Elana Tafolla, a single mother of two who 
lives at San Fernando Gardens, a federal housing project in Pacoima.  
</P>
<P>
 "Through this newspaper, we have the opportunity to express ourselves and 
really talk about the issues that really happen in our community," Tafolla 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafolla acts as a liaison between the residents and management of San Fernando 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the media comes, they only cover the bad things, like when somebody is 
arrested," Tafolla said. "A lot of people think we are bad people because we 
live in the developments. But a lot of good people who want to be successful 
are living there; we don't have another choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Aguilera, who has five years experience at other Los Angeles community 
newspapers, volunteers as a press consultant one day a week at the Voice, where 
he teaches the residents how to lay out the newspaper using a computer desk-top 
publishing program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to teach them to develop an eye to make sure they have a good-looking 
paper," Aguilera said. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; ALARCON, RESIDENTS TO STUDY ECONOMIC PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon has scheduled two information 
sessions this week for Sun Valley residents on the Los Angeles Neighborhood 
Initiative (LANI), a nonprofit organization assembled through Mayor Richard 
Riordan's office that explores economic development opportunities in blighted 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with members of the Sun Valley Recognized Community Organization, a 
division of LANI made up of business people and community leaders, Alarcon will 
field questions and solicit suggestions from residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings are scheduled today at 7 p.m. and Sunday at noon in the Sun 
Valley Recreation Center, 8133 Vineland Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective of LANI is to benefit economically disadvantaged 
transit-dependent communities by revitalizing public spaces and promoting 
business along major city streets and transportation corridors. LANI is funded 
by the U.S. Department of Transportation through the Los Angeles Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. ANTONIO OLIVO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; TRIBUTE PLANNED FOR SILENT FILM PIONEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Historians and film buffs will pay tribute next month to a female pioneer of 
the silent cinema who was known for adventurous epics in which women often 
saved the day -- and they'll use the filmmaker's turn-of-the-century Glendale 
home for the site of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1912 to 1924 Nell Shipman starred in, wrote, directed and independently 
produced a series of silent movies noted for their strong-willed heroines, 
outdoor scenes and the use of trained wild animals. With interest in Shipman's 
career growing, the Glendale Historical Society will pay tribute to the 
filmmaker at the Doctor's House, a Queen Anne home where Shipman lived from 
1917 to 1920. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been looking back recently and admiring her work," said Terry 
Richman, an organizer of the event. "She was very progressive. The lead 
character was usually a woman. She also loved the wilderness, and scenery was a 
big part of her films, whereas most people were filming in studios." 
</P>
<P>
 The Doctor's House, which got its moniker because a succession of Glendale 
doctors lived there during the early 1900s, was located on Wilson Avenue when 
Shipman and her family called it home. It was moved to Brand Park in the 1980s 
for preservation by the historical society as a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shipman tribute, which will run four consecutive Sundays beginning Oct. 2, 
will feature docent-guided tours of the house, publicity and family 
photographs, movie stills, posters, magazine articles and the showing of a 
video of one of her movies. Much of the background information the historical 
society has compiled on Shipman's life came from interviews with Shipman's son 
Barry, also a prolific screenwriter, who recently died.  
</P>
<P>
 Shipman, who died in 1970 at age 78, has also been researched by film scholars 
in recent years, and her autobiography has been published. 
</P>
<P>
 Her biggest film was "Back to God's Country," which was filmed in Canada and 
released in 1919. Shown internationally, the film made a 300% profit. Shipman 
also founded her own production company, opening a film studio in Idaho that 
was large enough to house the animals that appeared in her movies. She stopped 
making films in 1925 but continued to write novels and magazine articles for 
years, Richman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Doctor's House is at 1601 Mountain St., Glendale. The exhibit will be open 
from 1 to 4 p.m. Oct. 2, and from 2 to 4 p.m. the following three Sundays.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; 1991 SLAYING SUSPECT PLEADS NO CONTEST 
</P>

<P>
 Rather than face a trial at which his mother and brother would be the key 
witnesses against him, a former Canoga Park man pleaded no contest to voluntary 
manslaughter Monday in the June, 1991, stabbing death of his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of his plea agreement, David Joseph Goodman faces the maximum term 
-- 12 years in state prison -- when San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. 
Coen sentences him Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Goodman, a Jaguar mechanic who was born in 
Liverpool, England, and has lived in the United States since 1981, had 
violently abused victim Beth Hollander, 32, during a stormy, eight-year 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Before her death, Goodman had attempted to reconcile with Hollander and gave 
her an $800 engagement ring. But Hollander told a friend the night before she 
died that she planned to give back the ring, court records say. The friend 
described her demeanor during an earlier hearing as "really bummed" about the 
failed relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollander's body was found early the morning of June 20, 1991, behind a 
dumpster in the 21500 block of Prairie Street. She had been beaten, strangled 
and stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police received a break in the case 16 months later when they received a tip 
from Hilda Goodman, the defendant's mother. She said Goodman admitted the 
killing to her, and that she had tried to persuade him to surrender to police.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; COUNCIL FORMALLY OPPOSES PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando City Council has voted to oppose Proposition 187, the ballot 
initiative that would deny health care, public schooling and other state 
benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad legislation," said Councilman Doude Wysbeek, who amended the motion 
approved by the council Monday night by adding that "the legislation should be 
handled in a more humane and compassionate way." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's motion urges voters to defeat the measure, 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's slightly racist," Councilman Raul Godinez II said, pointing out 
that the legislation would encourage school officials and medical professionals 
to report suspected illegal immigrants based on looks or accents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Joanne Baltierrez saw the issue as more complex than that, 
saying that much of the opposition comes from a fear of how the legislation 
will hurt communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased so many are seeing this as a community issue, not just a racial 
issue," Baltierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution approved unanimously by the five-member council specifies that 
the proposition would deny prenatal care to pregnant women, ban undocumented 
children from school and require the reporting of suspected undocumented 
people. The resolution also noted that immigrants contribute twice as much in 
taxes to the state than they get in services, as some sources indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 residents on hand for the meeting broke into applause after the 
resolution was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council voted 3 to 2 not to impose a moratorium on 
rebuilding properties damaged by the Northridge earthquake that do not meet 
current zoning codes. Godinez, who had recommended the moratorium as a way of 
improving San Fernando neighborhoods, voted against the action along with 
Councilwoman Rosa Chacon. ED BOND

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CLOCK REPAIRS BIG BUSINESS SINCE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dusty and sprawling warehouse redolent of centuries-old hardwood and lit 
with the reflections of tarnished brass, Father Time stands still. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of the 25 craftsmen is to get the rickety old man moving again. 
</P>
<P>
 They are clockmakers, and not one of the 1,040 grandfather clocks that fill 
the 10,000-square-foot shed ticks or tocks or chimes. Not a pendulum swings. 
And not a hand moves from its position marking that fateful hour: 4:31 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd pick a clock off the floor and it would read 4:36, and I'd say, 'Hey, 
your clock was fast,' " master clockmaker Mark Katz said with a chuckle, 
recalling the morning of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal West Clock Emporium in Van Nuys, a business almost exclusive to 
Southern California is booming: grandfather clock repair. After all, store 
co-owner Tony Vitale said, where else are the massive timepieces rocked off 
their bases, sent hurling down a flight of stairs, through a living room window 
and into the front yard? 
</P>
<P>
 The shop's former home was in Northridge, near the quake's epicenter, and many 
of its own clocks were shattered by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Working 12 or 15 hours a day, six days a week for the last eight months, the 
artisans have repaired and sent home about 300 grandfathers -- as well as 500 
mantle and wall clocks at another nearby shop. More than 1,300 still stand 
silent in their quake-induced comas. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an almost eerie sight, the warehouse: part hospital, part workshop, part 
morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a stately Colonial made of curly oak, split almost in two. Another of 
black mahogany stands gutless, its movement, or mechanism, in a box on the 
ground. A hand-painted, 150-year-old dial lies motionless on a workbench. 
</P>
<P>
 If some are so close to clock death, Vitale thought right after the temblor, 
why not euthanasia? After 30 years in the clock business, he had begun to 
believe that "a clock's a clock. It's just a timepiece," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then owners began scurrying nervously about as workers came to pick up 
their clocks, asking for the prognosis and literally saying goodby, aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out just how important they are," Vitale said. "I felt like an 
undertaker." For most, cost was no issue -- $500, $1,000, $2,000. Just fix it, 
they said. Even the woman with the 250-year-old clock-organ that plays nine 
German classics didn't balk at the $7,000 estimate. Of course, the antique is 
valued at $45,000, but that is only half the concern, Vitale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once carted off, owners would call to check on their clocks. "How's my buddy?" 
one inquired. "Is he almost done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, turnaround time for major repair was four to six weeks. It 
quickly became four to six months, and owners began asking if they could stop 
by and see their clocks. After enough requests, Vitale accommodated: Visiting 
hours are 2 to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman found another way to bear the extended absence of her prized 
grandfather: She built a cardboard replica, complete with movable hands. ERIC

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CITY COUNCILWOMAN BACKS SUBWAY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick, entering an already fractious 
debate over a planned railway across the San Fernando Valley, said Tuesday that 
she favors a subway system over an elevated line above the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In an open letter to her West Valley constituents outlining her position on 
the volatile issue for the first time, Chick wrote that a subway along Burbank 
and Chandler boulevards was preferable for several reasons, including its 
proximity to key destination points such as Valley and Pierce colleges, Warner 
Center and the Van Nuys civic center. 
</P>
<P>
 The subway, as a direct extension of the Metro Rail Red Line, would also 
provide a seamless commute into Downtown, without the connection and transfer 
that would be required of riders along a monorail-type system, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to longstanding contentions that the Ventura Freeway option would 
cost far less than an underground system, Chick noted that a recent independent 
cost comparison narrowed the price gap to within $19 million, "less than a 1% 
difference in a $2-billion project," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Chick said she would not support a cost-cutting plan entailing the 
construction of open-air stations in the West Valley, as the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority has suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said the same savings could be achieved by eliminating two of five West 
Valley stations, at Tampa and White Oak avenues, which she said would serve 
"low-density, single-family neighborhoods that truly do not warrant transit 
stops." 
</P>
<P>
 Before last November's elections, then-incumbent Councilwoman Joy Picus 
criticized Chick for not taking a position on which rail line to support. Picus 
backed the subway option. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board of directors is scheduled to decide on an alignment next month.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; NO CONTEST PLEA BY CONDO MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A property manager used at least part of the $1.4 million he embezzled from a 
Calabasas condominium association to repay money he had previously stolen from 
a group of Santa Clarita condo owners, a prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer John Gobus, 46, pleaded no contest to felony charges of forgery and 
stealing more than $1 million from the Oak Park Calabasas condominiums between 
Feb. 1, 1985, and July 31, 1993, and will probably be sentenced to six years in 
prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Allan C. Fork said. Gobus' Westwood company had 
apparently been hired by the condo association to manage the 268-unit complex 
on Park Granada in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Gobus could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to entering his plea in court, Gobus also admitted to violating 
his 1992 probation stemming from a theft conviction in connection with an Old 
Orchard condo association in Newhall, Fork said. Gobus had been ordered to pay 
$45,000 in restitution to the homeowners association in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns out now we can see he used money from the Oak Park association to 
make restitution to the Santa Clarita association," Fork said. "The two cases 
tied together." 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the Calabasas condo association grew suspicious after Gobus 
failed to give satisfactory answers to questions about the association's 
financial matters, authorities said. They subsequently hired an accountant who 
examined the association's finances and found that Gobus had not filed tax 
returns for the association for 10 years and that he had opened several 
checking accounts without the association's knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by Los Angeles police has failed to turn up any of the 
missing $1.4 million, authorities said. Under terms of the plea agreement, 
Gobus is likely to receive a six-year prison term when he is sentenced Oct. 19, 
Fork said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Reinglass, a homeowner and resident, said she was thrilled by Tuesday's 
developments, but said she hopes Gobus receives a stiffer sentence than six 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "He deserves everything he gets and more," Reinglass said. "He's hurt a lot of 
people in this community, but we are going to recover." JULIE TAMAKI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; PONY EXPRESS DAYS RETURN THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pony Express rides again! 
</P>
<P>
 The horse-driven mail service galloped into the pages of history 133 years 
ago, but its legacy lives on in Agoura Hills during Pony Express Days, a 
four-day fair from Thursday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The area that is now Agoura Hills used to be one of the stops on the Pony 
Express, which had 157 relay stations from St. Joseph, Mo., to Sacramento, 
according to information compiled by the Las Virgenes Historical Society. Over 
a period from April, 1860, to October, 1861, the riders traveled 650,000 miles 
and delivered 34,753 pieces of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pony Express' most famous ride was in March, 1861, when it delivered 
Abraham Lincoln's inaugural address. That ride was completed in seven days and 
17 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization had a relay station in what is now either Westlake Village or 
Agoura Hills, according to Sandy Sandoval, president of the historical society 
from 1981 through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fair's original features, including a re-enactment of a Pony 
Express ride, have fallen by the wayside during the 28 years of the fair's 
existence as it became more modern, according to this year's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just honor the tradition with the name Pony Express Days," said Susan 
Mason Hill, vice president of Wipeout Productions, an event-planning firm that 
produced the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit fair is designed to provide a boost to the local economy and to 
provide publicity for various businesses in the city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On tap, she said, is entertainment, including the Sleepwalkers, a rockabilly 
band, Conejo Valley Cloggers, a folk-dancing group, and several country-Western 
bands, including Show Down and Sweet Country. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a variety of foods for sale, including Thai, Mexican, Indian and 
American. Carnival rides, games and pony rides also will be featured. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair kicks off with a Children's Night on Thursday from 6 to 9 p.m. with 
puppet shows and tap dancers. Children 12 and under will be admitted to the 
carnival free and for $10 will receive unlimited one-day rides for that night 
only. 
</P>
<P>
 Also for the kids will be a pog tournament and a "Wheel of Fortune" game, both 
of which run all four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the fair is $1. Children under 3 will be admitted free. Admission 
includes the Happytime One Ring Circus, which will have several shows Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ride-goers can purchase special wristbands for $12 that allow them on any ride 
all day. If purchased in advance at Majesty Cleaners, Gary's Auto Parts, 
Connie's Mail Boxes or the Agoura Chamber of Commerce, the wristbands are $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pony Express Days carnival is located off the Ventura Freeway near Kanan 
Road on Canwood Street. Parking is available for $1. For information, call the 
Agoura Chamber of Commerce at (818) 889-3150. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; HOUSE FIRE CAUSES $300,000 IN DAMAGE

<P>
 Fire gutted a two-story house surrounded by dry brush Tuesday morning, causing 
$300,000 in damage, the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 People from as far away as two miles saw the flames at the house in the 3500 
block of Poppy Drive near Mulholland Highway and thought it was a brush fire, 
said Fire Inspector Bob Brandelli. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters arrived about 10 a.m., the house was fully engulfed in 
flames. It took an hour for 30 firefighters to put out the fire, Brandelli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officials were also called to the scene when a dead dog was 
found amid the ashes, he said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CSUN RALLY MARKS 'ZERO DEFICIT DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When most college students think about debt, it is usually when the credit 
card bill comes in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a brief time Tuesday, a rally at Cal State Northridge reminded 
students that Uncle Sam is running up a tab that can cost them as much as 
$80,000 by the time they finish paying off their student loans in the year 
2015. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you took out your student loan, you signed up for your student debt," 
Alan B. Ungar, who heads the San Fernando Valley Chapter of the Concord 
Coalition, told a group of about two dozen students. "But a debt you didn't 
sign up for is the government debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1992 by former presidential candidate Paul Tsongas and Warren 
Rudman, the Concord Coalition has been staging nationwide rallies to educate 
young people about the importance of reducing the federal deficit, which is 
nearing $5 billion, Ungar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's rally, marking "Zero Deficit Day," was also attended by CSUN 
President Blenda Wilson and Bonny Matheson, president of the Valley Industry 
and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally's highlight was a massive electronic clock loaded on a trailer that 
showed the federal deficit rising $9,657 per second, bringing the average 
person's share to about $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before the clock, Ungar encouraged students to form their own 
coalition to reduce the deficit to zero by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, such as Joshua Stone, legislative analyst for the CSUN 
Associated Student Organization, responded to the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Stone jump up on the podium to help Ungar cut up a mock credit 
card issued to the U.S. government, he said he pledged to continue trying to 
raise awareness on campus about the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most students have credit cards and know what debt is," said Stone, 21. "The 
way the U.S. is spending money faster than it is taking it in, it's like a 
credit card without any limit. And, in time, there are going to be 
ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
 But many students simply didn't hear the clock ticking. Most drifted off when 
Ungar began spouting off numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a serious concern," said Tengiz Borisoff, 29, a computer science 
student. "But it's not an immediate concern. It's not something you feel in 
your pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 But Borisoff, who emigrated from the former Soviet Union 14 years ago, felt 
good that, at least in the United States, the next generation is being educated 
about the country's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the country is closed, like in the Soviet Union, nobody knew about the 
problem," he said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

TRAIL OF DEAD TURTLES LEADS TO CRUELTY CASE; ANIMALS: OPERATOR OF A CANOGA PARK 
SEAFOOD FIRM FACES CHARGES AFTER HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES ARE FOUND DEAD OR 
DYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The case began with a malodorous van, and by the time investigators tracked 
the evidence across two counties, the body count had risen above 700. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven hundred dead red-eared turtles, sliders, coolers, diamond-backed 
terrapins and eastern painted turtles, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 They died in horrible ways -- baked, crushed, drowned, starved and dehydrated, 
with cracks in their shells and gaping wounds on their limbs, authorities said. 
Live turtles spent days squeezed next to dead ones. Some became infested with 
maggots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the worst case of animal cruelty that I've seen," said Deputy 
City Atty. Don Cocek, who filed misdemeanor animal cruelty and neglect charges 
Tuesday against Mark Rommel Osterholt, the 28-year-old operator of a Canoga 
Park seafood company. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were inside burlap bags, thrown on top of each other," the prosecutor 
added. "We have a photograph of a turtle, and it's still alive, with its head 
crushed and its brains coming out." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the animal cruelty charges, the 12-count complaint filed in Van 
Nuys Municipal Court accuses Osterholt of illegally possessing and bringing 
snapping turtles into California. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they believe Osterholt got the turtles from a business 
associate in Arkansas and sold them to restaurants and seafood outlets in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of the maltreated turtles began to unfold May 13, when West Hills 
residents, fearful of finding a human body, asked construction workers to check 
inside a foul-smelling van that had been parked outside their condominium 
complex for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a human corpse, the van contained 1,112 dead and dying turtles, 
Cocek said. Police called animal rescue workers, who removed the corpses of 121 
turtles, and recovered 979 severely dehydrated ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail next led investigators with Los Angeles Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals and Southern California Humane Society from West Hills to 
Westminster. There, the owner of a wholesale seafood warehouse saw news reports 
of the turtle carnage, and told authorities he was worried there might also be 
hundreds of dead and dying turtles in a rented storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 9, SPCA representatives inspected the refrigerator, which had been 
rented by Osterholt under an agreement with the previous owner, city officials 
said. They found even more turtles -- 1,367 of them -- inside five large 
plastic containers, each about four feet square and three feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those turtles, 643 already had died, but 724 were still alive. The living 
turtles were taken to a shelter where their body temperatures were brought back 
to normal, and they were force-fed and given antibiotics, said Cocek. Species 
found at the warehouse included mud turtles, sliders, map turtles, red-eared 
turtles and snapping turtles, Cocek said.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the dead turtles, he added, had drowned beneath the corpses of other 
turtles that had been crushed or starved. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation also uncovered an incident Nov. 3, linking Osterholt to a 
California Department of Fish and Game warden's discovery of illegally imported 
snapping turtles at a market in the 600 block of North Spring Street. The 
market owner told inspectors he had purchased the turtles from Osterholt and 
Sons in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said it is illegal to possess snapping turtles in California 
because they are aggressive and carnivorous, and therefore threaten native 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Osterholt could not be reached Tuesday. He is scheduled to surrender in Van 
Nuys Municipal Court for arraignment on Oct. 25. The charges carry maximum 
penalties of six months in county jail and $20,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the surviving turtles were brought back to health and released to 
the wild, many of them outside California. SPCA spokesman Madeline Bernstein 
declined to be more specific, saying, "They're in my turtle witness relocation 
program."

CITY LOAN FUND TO AID REPAIR OF MOBILE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of quake-damaged mobile homes and mobile home parks can now apply 
for zero-interest city loans to make repairs and anchor their dwellings against 
future quakes if nobody else will help them, the Los Angeles City Council 
decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By a unanimous vote, the council agreed to set aside about $7 million in 
housing repair funds to help restore the thousands of mobile homes that were 
rocked off their foundations or otherwise damaged by the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which will be managed by the city's Housing Department, will also 
offer loans to mobile home park owners who suffered infrastructure damage, such 
as broken sewage pipes and collapsed walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans are considered a funding source of last resort because to be 
eligible, applicants must have been rejected by other federal and state 
emergency loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the tail end of it to fill in what other programs can't cover," 
said Ralph Esparza, director of the Housing Department's rent stabilization 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 Although apartment buildings and single-family homes suffered most from the 
quake, mobile homes sustained dramatic damage. Thousands were flung from their 
foundations. Another 184 burned to the ground in fires fueled by ruptured gas 
lines, one of which killed a 92-year-old Chatsworth woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 quake rendered about 5,600 mobile homes in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties uninhabitable. As of last week, that number had dropped to 1,650, 
according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development, 
the agency responsible for safety inspections of mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Department spokesman John Frith said that based on the number of repair 
permits issued by the state, he expects that number to drop by another 1,000 or 
so in the next couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing Department put together the mobile home loan program at the 
request of City Councilman Hal Bernson, whose northwest San Fernando Valley 
district contains about two-thirds of the city's mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's chief of staff, Greig Smith, said the councilman witnessed severe 
damage to mobile homes as he toured his district with Mayor Richard Riordan 
soon after the quake. He said Bernson realized that many mobile home owners 
would not be able to afford repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are a lot of retired people who don't have the funding to do this," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza said the most common damage involved mobile homes knocked off their 
foundations, sometimes crashing down on gas and water lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a law requiring mobile home owners to bolt 
them to foundations for safety. The cost of anchoring them to cement moorings 
ranges from $1,700 to $3,300, Esparza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's program offers a maximum loan of $35,000 per mobile home owner, 
with no payments due for the first six years. For park owners, the Housing 
Department can administratively approve loans of up to $525,000 per owner, with 
larger loans requiring the approval of the City Council.

MAN ARRESTED, ACCUSED OF DUMPING CHEMICALS INTO SEWER; ENVIRONMENT: CO-OWNER OF 
SUN VALLEY METAL-PLATING FIRM FACES CHARGES THAT HIS COMPANY PUT CYANIDE AND 
OTHER POSSIBLY LETHAL WASTE MATERIALS INTO PUBLIC SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The co-owner of a Sun Valley metal-plating firm that has contracts with large 
aerospace companies was being held in lieu of $555,000 bail Tuesday on felony 
charges that his company dumped potentially lethal amounts of cyanide and heavy 
metals into the Los Angeles sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Meltzer, 53, and his company, Quality Processing Inc., face 17 counts 
involving discharging waste from an illegal pipe connected directly to the 
sewer system, said Head Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Delaney. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very serious case, in part because there was such a serious threat 
to the public," Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged discharge of extremely high levels of cyanide, in particular, 
could have caused an explosion or a cloud of vapors that would have threatened 
employees of nearby businesses and residents of a trailer park, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meltzer's lawyer, James E. Black, said the company takes responsibility for 
the illegal discharge, but claims it was human error. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the employees, who was unauthorized to do so, occasionally was 
disposing (the chemicals) into the sewer line," Black said Tuesday evening. 
"That is no longer happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Black said the employee has been reprimanded and has been instructed on how to 
properly dispose of the waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Meltzer became a suspect earlier this summer after city Department of 
Sanitation workers performing routine sewer monitoring found "extremely 
dangerous and hazardous levels of untreated cyanide and toxic levels of chrome 
and zinc solutions" in the sewer system near the company, said Delaney, who is 
prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven of the charges are felonies, each of which carries a minimum three-year 
prison sentence and $25,000 fine, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meltzer and his wife, Myra, both of Canoga Park, own the company together, but 
only Meltzer was arrested Monday because he is the on-site manager. Meltzer is 
scheduled to be arraigned Friday, when he will ask to be released on his own 
recognizance, said Black, adding that Meltzer has no criminal record and is a 
reputable businessman with roots in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality Processing performs large-scale metal electroplating and etching of 
commercial and aerospace parts for companies, including Lockheed Corp., Litton 
Guidance and Control Systems, Hughes Aircraft Co. and General Dynamics, Delaney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense firms are not expected to be held liable for the Sun Valley 
discharge, but Lockheed itself received a $460,000 federal fine last week for 
discharging untreated waste water into the sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Plating firms use cyanide in various ways during the electroplating process, 
said Deputy City Atty. Vince Sato. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality Processing's trouble started last fall when Meltzer informed the 
Department of Sanitation that he was shutting off the company's connection to 
the sewer system. The arrangement had allowed the business to legally dispose 
of potentially hazardous waste through a heavy-regulated industrial sewer 
system, Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Meltzer's business partners, who declined to be identified, said 
Meltzer had purchased $750,000 worth of equipment to dispose of the toxics 
himself. Authorities confirmed the presence of the equipment at the Sun Valley 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 But in May, three days after the city began monitoring sewer discharges in the 
industrial area where the company is located, Department of Sanitation 
investigators discovered an illegal emission, Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other toxic discharges were detected in the early morning hours between May 9 
and June 1, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 When a city-county task force raided Quality Processing on June 14, 
authorities said, the company -- which has 35 employees -- was discharging 
cyanide into the sewer from the illegal pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was kind of the smoking gun," Delaney said. "(Meltzer) had directed 
this. This was not a case of negligence. This was willful. There was every 
indication that this was a conscious choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators estimated that about 1,000 gallons of waste water with a cyanide 
level of 2,500 parts per million had entered the sewer from the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular concern to investigators was the possibility that the zinc 
cyanide being released could change into extremely hazardous hydrogen cyanide 
if it came into contact with acids, which were also being released by the 
company at about the same time, Sato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrogen cyanide is considered hazardous at the level of five parts per 
million, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Meltzer and his company allege six felony counts of 
illegal disposal of hazardous waste, five felony counts of water pollution and 
six misdemeanor counts of illegally disposing of waste water. 
</P>
<P>
 Each felony count of illegal disposal carries a maximum sentence of three 
years in prison and a $100,000 fine. Each felony water pollution count carries 
a possible term of three years in prison and a $25,000 fine. And each 
misdemeanor count carries a possible sentence of six months in jail and a 
$1,000 fine.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CLASS PUTS THOUGHTS ON FUME SCARE INTO WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cassandra Mattei labeled it "A Horrible Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old Lincoln Elementary School student wrote a paragraph in class 
Tuesday about how it felt to be evacuated the day before during a fume scare 
that sent more than 60 pupils to local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The writing assignment in teacher Anna Ortega's fourth-grade class was 
intended to help students get back to a normal routine. Cassandra, like many 
students, found herself trying to spell unfamiliar words to describe an 
unfamiliar situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day we were working on math when suddenly our class herd from our speaker 
'Please evaporate the building,' " she wrote. "I was scared because I didn't 
know what was going on. We went outside to line up when suddenly fire trucks 
were coming into our school." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives said they presume the fumes spread through 
air-conditioning vents from a device -- fireworks, a stink bomb or something 
similar -- detonated in the boys' bathroom. A student turned in an unexploded 
firework he said he had found nearby but no fireworks debris or other evidence 
of an explosion was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said many of the children appeared to be suffering from 
psychosomatic hysteria, made sick because they were frightened to see other 
children acting sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Students taken to local hospitals, complaining of nausea and burning 
sensations in their mouths and chests, were released after treatment. Some were 
given oxygen. Authorities said no lasting effects are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega said her students were "a little more talkative and hyperactive" than 
normal Tuesday, what with the strangers with television cameras and notebooks 
still lurking around the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Blakestad, 9, was taken to a hospital complaining of nausea after using a 
drinking fountain next to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like being sick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Alyce Ellis visited all of the classrooms Tuesday, talking about the 
incident with students and warning that the student or students responsible for 
creating the fumes will be expelled from the Lancaster School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have that kind of behavior at Lincoln, can we, because we spent five 
years trying to get a good school," she told Ortega's class. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis also asked students in Ortega's class to share their thoughts about the 
evacuation. Most of the students' comments were similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared because I thought I would get it," said Katie Montana, 9. 
Another 9-year-old student said she was "scared because no one would tell me 
what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 An all-school assembly was planned, but Ellis said she believed that meeting 
with smaller groups of students would be more productive. 
</P>
<P>
 "With smaller groups you get more of a feeling for the children's feelings," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Tom Pigott, commander of the detective bureau at the Antelope Valley 
Sheriff's Station, said deputies are looking for a culprit, but if it was a 
student prank, "the likelihood we're going to prosecute anybody is pretty 
slim."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN GETS 10 YEARS FOR '93 BANK ROBBERY; 
COURTS: JUDGE CALLS ACTIONS OF CHAD PELCH 'VICIOUS' IN HOLDING OFFICER'S FAMILY 
HOSTAGE AND THEN FORCING HER TO OPEN VAULT IN MORNING. 
</P>

<P>
 A federal judge in Los Angeles sentenced a Canyon Country bank robber to 10 
years and a month in prison Tuesday for holding a bank officer and her family 
hostage overnight and then forcing her to open her bank's vault, a prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the actions of Chad Pelch, 24, as "reprehensible" and "vicious," 
U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin E. Waters imposed the sentence on Pelch, who 
pleaded guilty in July to a single count of armed bank robbery with forced 
accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelch was also ordered by the judge to pay about $27,000 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased with the court's sentence and I think it's a just result," 
Assistant U.S. Atty. David R. Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for Pelch could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelch was one of four men sought in connection with the June 11, 1993, 
robbery, in which bank officer Toula Demosthenous and eight others were held 
overnight by gunmen at her Canyon Country home. The next morning, the gunmen 
accompanied Demosthenous to a TransWorld Bank in Canyon Country where they 
forced her to open the bank's vault and then stole $107,689. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suspect, Alex Yepes, 25, is scheduled to stand trial Oct. 11 in 
connection with the bank robbery, Fields said. Yepes has been charged with 
conspiracy, armed bank robbery with forced accompaniment and the use of a 
firearm during a crime of violence, 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Yepes faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelch's older brother Brett, 26, has also been charged in connection with the 
case and is currently a fugitive at large, Fields said. A fourth suspect, 
Darren Patrick Towers of Saugus, pleaded guilty in December to the same charges 
now facing Yepes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yepes, Brett Pelch and Donald Sallee, 26, of Santa Clarita also face charges 
in connection with the Sept. 17, 1993, robbery of a Coast Federal branch in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that robbery, a group of gunmen invaded the Canoga Park home of bank 
officer Terry Duranso and held her and four others, including twin baby boys, 
hostage. The next morning, the gunmen accompanied Duranso to her bank and 
forced her to open the vault, from which they stole $107,449.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SUSPECT IN BOY'S SLAYING AT PALMDALE MALL 
SURRENDERS; HOMICIDE: ADOLFO REAL JR., 24, PLEADS NOT GUILTY. HE SAYS HE WAS 
ONLY RECENTLY AWARE OF THE JULY 18 ARREST WARRANT.

<P>
 A 24-year-old Palmdale man wanted in connection with the July 5 slaying of a 
teen-ager at the Antelope Valley Mall has turned himself in to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolfo Real Jr., who has been charged with shooting Efrain Pablo Brito, 16, 
during an argument in the mall's parking lot, had been sought by authorities 
since July 18 when a warrant was issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Real pleaded not guilty Monday in Antelope Municipal Court to the murder 
charge and said through his attorney that he was unaware until recently a 
warrant had been issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ian R. Grant ordered Real held without bail pending a preliminary 
hearing Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Real's lawyer, deputy public defender Manuel R. Martinez, said his client was 
out of the state when he learned about the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not guilty of the crime," Martinez said. "He didn't know about the 
warrant until just recently." 
</P>
<P>
 After learning of the warrant, Martinez said, Real returned to the Antelope 
Valley and discussed the allegations with his family. "Then he decided the best 
thing to do was to turn himself in and clear up the matter," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Tom Pigott said deputies learned that Real wanted to surrender 
through an anonymous call on Saturday. The caller agreed to have Real meet 
deputies outside a convenience market at 60th Street West and Avenue L-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Real was arrested at that location Sunday without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the motivation was, whether he was tired of running or it was his 
conscience, I don't know," Pigott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators have alleged that on July 5, Real was in a car in the 
parking lot when he and the other passengers got involved in an argument with 
the occupants of another car. 
</P>
<P>
 During this dispute, Real, who uses the nickname "Fo Fo," allegedly drew a 
handgun and fired at Brito, hitting the Littlerock High School student in the 
chest. Brito's friends drove him to a Palmdale hospital, where he later died. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was the first slaying to occur at the mall, which opened four 
years ago.

VALLEY BRIEFING: A SHOT IN THE ARM; MINIMIZING THE RISK OF FLU EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Influenza season is coming and that means plenty of people will be rolling up 
their sleeves. A total of 880,000 flu vaccine doses -- including 165,000 
earmarked for Los Angeles County -- will be injected into the arms of residents 
of California this year under a state program. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three main types of influenza viruses: A, B and C. The highly 
unstable Type A can infect humans and other animals, such as swine. Types B and 
C seem to infect only humans. 
</P>
<P>
 A new vaccine is developed at the end of the each influenza season through the 
tracking of previous outbreaks. Making its debut this season is a vaccine that 
targets three influenza strains: A-Texas, A-Shangdong and B-Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors reccommend that people whose health could be seriously endangered by 
influenza get get annual vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're over 65 and have any substantial illness, it's good inexpensive 
insurance," said Dr. Steven Kamajian, an osteopath who practices in Glendale 
and Montrose.

</P>
<P>
 Influenza 
</P>
<P>
 Bed rest in a warm, well-ventilated room for those with a fever. Analgesics 
for aches and pain and to reduce fever. Antibiotics and other drugs for the 
secondary infections that are responsible for most of the deaths associated 
with influenza. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cold 
</P>
<P>
 No cure available, but analgesics, decongestants, nasal sprays and vaporizers 
may relieve discomfort. Those with fever should stay in bed to rest and avoid 
infecting others. Eat nourishing foods, drink plenty of water. Doctors can 
prescribe antibiotics to control bacterial complications. 
</P>
<P>
 * An ounce of prevention... 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccines containing killed strains of virus are available but are believed to 
have only a 60% to 70% success rate in preventing infection. Flu shots must be 
gotten annually-just before the onset of the flu season-if they are to have a 
chance at being effective. Doctors recommend that senior citizens, diabetics 
and those with chronic pulmonary, heart or kidney diseases be vaccinated. 
Healthy adults may also want to get injected, but should check first with their 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaccination should be administered by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's some of the free flu shot clinics where injections are being offered on 
a first come, first served basis. Although the clinics are set up primarily for 
seniors, some will take others who are at risk of developing serious influenza 
complications.

to pneumonia and influenza in Los Angeles County was below that of the United 
States for nearly the entire flu season of 1992-93. But in mid-February, the 
ratio in the county exceeded that of the entire country and the "epidemic 
threshold" established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

U.S. PRESSES SKEPTICAL ARISTIDE TO BACK ACCORD; LEADERSHIP: AIDES CLAIM EXILED 
PRESIDENT FINDS PACT TOO VAGUE. AMERICANS SAY HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT 
DEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 A high-level delegation of U.S. officials Tuesday pressed exiled Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to embrace the terms of the weekend agreement 
that allows Haiti's military leadership to remain in power until Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aristide so far has resisted the Clinton Administration's requests, 
instead releasing a frosty six-sentence statement that pointedly avoided any 
mention of the agreement and indicated that he remained embittered by the 
accord, which was negotiated without his approval. The accord leaves his sworn 
enemies in power for several weeks and allows them to stay in Haiti even after 
they step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide broke his silence with the Tuesday statement, which decries the 
murder of 5,000 Haitians, allegedly by the forces of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the 
leader of the bloody military coup that ousted Aristide three years ago. The 
statement makes no mention of the landings of thousands of U.S. troops now in 
Haiti to ensure Aristide's peaceful return to power next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's spokesman and political allies, who are potential members of his 
Cabinet, said the populist Roman Catholic priest rejects a number of provisions 
of the accord. The exiled leader wants concrete assurances from the U.S. 
government that his enemies will be purged from the army, that international 
sanctions will not be lifted until he returns and that Cedras and his cronies 
will leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Marine Corps Lt. Gen. John Sheehan, 
director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to Aristide's 
apartment Tuesday evening to brief him on U.S. military operations in Haiti and 
to plead for his public endorsement of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, the White House said Lake "stressed (President Clinton's) 
commitment to work closely with Haiti's legitimate authorities led by President 
Aristide as we achieve the departure of Haiti's military leaders from power by 
Oct. 15." 
</P>
<P>
 An official familiar with the meeting described the atmosphere as cordial and 
productive but would not say whether Aristide expressed more confidence in the 
agreement than he had up till then. 
</P>
<P>
 An Aristide spokeswoman, Leila McDowell, said the Haitian president had no 
comment Tuesday night on the meeting but will make a statement after a meeting 
at the Pentagon today with Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John M. Shalikashvili and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said that Lake and Sheehan tried to convince 
Aristide that the agreement "achieves the basic objective that he has sought" 
-- the removal of Cedras followed by Aristide's prompt return to power. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the talks focused on "the big picture here and what will 
happen in 25 days" -- after which Aristide is to be restored to office in 
Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official acknowledged that there are aspects of the deal brokered by 
former President Jimmy Carter that are unacceptable to Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide aides and Administration officials indicated, however, that the 
exiled president has little choice but to accept the conditions of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we would like him to support us on this issue," a top White House 
official said. He and other officials said that it may take some days for 
Aristide to get over his bitterness at the accord and his lack of involvement 
in its crafting. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was worked out by Carter, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and retired Gen. 
Colin L. Powell in marathon negotiations last weekend. It was signed by acting 
Haitian President Emile Jonassaint and Carter and ratified by Clinton. Aristide 
was not consulted on its terms but was briefed after the deal had been struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-point agreement does not mention Aristide by name, nor does it 
guarantee a deadline for his return. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide worries that the accord is so vague that it could give Cedras a 
chance to delay stepping down from power, Aristide's aides say. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Claude Martineau, Aristide's spokesman, stressed, however, that Aristide 
does not reject the accord completely and will work with the Administration to 
try to iron out an effective policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that President Aristide will return and put Haiti back on the road to 
democracy," Martineau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Aristide aides said, however, that he may stall his return. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the conditions for his return are not right, he will not go back," said 
Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, a member of Aristide's Cabinet-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the current leaders might attempt to retain power and the U.S. 
forces would be compelled to force them out to fulfill the Port-au-Prince 
agreement, said Aristide aides. The de facto ruler of the tiny island nation 
would then be the U.S. military, a situation, said Jean-Baptiste, that "the 
Haitian people will resist." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide aides said that Aristide believes that by approving an agreement 
signed by Jonassaint, the man installed as president by the military junta, 
Clinton was recognizing him as the legitimate head of government, a notion 
Aristide angrily rejects. 
</P>
<P>
 Convincing Aristide that the United States had no intention of propping up 
Jonassaint was one of the goals of Tuesday's meeting, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are some reassurances that we can provide -- for example, that 
we have not, will not and do not recognize the Jonassaint government," a senior 
Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief statement, Aristide said: "We must remain committed to the 
agreements that we have signed," specifically the Governors Island agreement 
reached more than a year ago and under which Cedras was to cede power last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will respect everything he says and everything he signs. He did not sign 
this (Carter) accord," Martineau said, adding that Aristide had "a lot of 
questions" about the Carter deal and was seeking "clarification" on the 
implications of several aspects of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide fears that the agreement will make it very difficult to establish a 
law-based democracy because it allows the military troika that has ruthlessly 
ruled the country for the past three years to remain in Haiti and to organize 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
 "These three guys are richer than the whole nation," Martineau said, speaking 
of Cedras, Haitian army chief of staff Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and Lt. Col. 
Michel-Joseph Francois, the Port-au-Prince chief of police. "They can disrupt 
everything. They can finance terrorism. For us it would be the same as if all 
the Nazi generals were allowed to stay in Germany, recover all their assets and 
form a political party." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to leave the country," he added. "They are murderers, drug 
traffickers and rapists." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton used similar language last week in describing the regime, but now the 
U.S. military is working hand in hand with Cedras and his forces as a part of 
the deal signed over the weekend.

COLUMN ONE; THE SORRY EXILE OF BABY DOC; HAITI'S PREVIOUS DICTATOR, JEAN-CLAUDE 
DUVALIER, FLED TO FRANCE IN 1986, SUPPOSEDLY WITH $120 MILLION. NOW HE LIVES IN 
NEAR-POVERTY -- A CAUTIONARY FIGURE FOR HIS NATION'S MILITARY LEADERS. 
</P>

<P>
 When Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier was driven from power in Haiti eight 
years ago, he and his family slid into luxurious exile here on the sunny Cote 
d'Azur, the sort of place where an out-of-work dictator could spend a lifetime 
of accumulated wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a hillside villa with gated privacy and sumptuous views of the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 They ate at the best restaurants, where Duvalier's "passion for the table," as 
one chef put it, was appreciated almost as much as his ability to pick up the 
$1,000 checks for his entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there also were private tennis lessons, drives through the Alps in 
the family Ferrari Testarossa or BMW and expensive visits to the toniest shops 
in Paris and nearby Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the free-spending days are gone now. Duvalier is, by all accounts, 
strapped for cash. His life is a shambles. And his spectacular fall is a 
warning to any of Haiti's outgoing leaders pondering a life of deluxe exile in 
France. No matter how strong their cultural ties with France, they won't be 
welcome here. And no matter how vast their cash reserve, it may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Duvalier, the round-faced president who ran Haiti for 15 bloody years after 
the death of his notorious father, had managed to spirit more than $120 million 
out of the impoverished nation by the time he fled, lawyers say. Yet, these 
days, Duvalier runs from creditors, his assets frittered away, stolen by 
friends or entangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicked out of two Riviera villas in recent years for not paying his rent, 
Duvalier has landed in a crumbling stone house, sans sea view, in the hills 
above Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone has been cut off because of unpaid bills. Even though the former 
strongman reportedly does the gardening in lieu of rent, the yard grows wild, a 
blight on the otherwise well-manicured neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Duvalier's two ragged Pekingese terriers crawled through a hole in 
the wooden gate to yap at a rare visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the house, a small Haitian woman paused from doing dishes to answer the 
doorbell. Describing herself as "a friend of Monsieur Duvalier," she said he 
was visiting Paris, though reporters have seen him on the grounds in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Duvalier's wife, Michele, who once spent $600,000 in a single year on jewelry 
and Givenchy dresses in Paris, has divorced him. Now married to a Frenchman, 
she has taken the Duvaliers' two children, Nicolas, 10, and Anya, 8, to live in 
a seafront apartment in Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
 Duvalier now lives with his 82-year-old mother, widow of the former dictator 
Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Jean-Claude Duvalier, 43, whom headline writers on the Riviera call 
"Bebe Doc," remains an embarrassment for the French and, to a large extent, a 
prisoner of his need for cash and his uncertain immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was driven from power on Feb. 7, 1986 -- after hosting a champagne 
farewell for his friends at the Presidential Palace in the capital, 
Port-au-Prince -- Duvalier arrived in France aboard a U.S. Air Force jet, with 
American assurances that he would stay no more than eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 It had taken the promise of exile in France to get Duvalier to agree to leave. 
France accepted him in hopes of preventing a blood bath in Haiti, but only on 
the condition that his stay be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding no country willing to take him, the French government ordered his 
expulsion and even tried to put the Duvalier family on a plane for New York. 
But France backed down when the United States said it would refuse to accept 
Duvalier but would continue searching for a more permanent place of exile. 
</P>
<P>
 A long list of countries refused. When Liberia, despite pressure from the 
United States, declined, the French gave up hope of getting rid of Duvalier. A 
French court eventually overturned the expulsion order, giving him temporary 
residence in this region. His request for refugee status was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, facing two large lawsuits for unpaid rent, Duvalier was said to be 
contemplating a return to Haiti. He ran up a huge telephone bill -- still 
unpaid -- in pursuit of that goal, according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, he decided against a return and moved into his current villa, 
L'Hamadryade, owned by an English businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 The French Interior Ministry refuses to comment on Duvalier, whose situation 
differs little from that of the African despots who stole millions from former 
French colonies and were welcomed here in the past. France's association with 
Haiti dates to 1697, when the territory became a French possession. Haiti won 
independence in 1804. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duvalier family controlled Haiti for almost 30 years. When Francois 
Duvalier took control of the country in 1957, succeeding a military strongman, 
Jean-Claude was 6 years old. The elder Duvalier established a dictatorship and 
ran a notorious secret police force known as the Tontons Macoutes, who gunned 
down opponents of his regime; he turned the country into the poorest in the 
Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Claude, meantime, went to law school in Haiti and upon the death of his 
father in 1971 became "president-for-life" at the age of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, "Baby Doc," as he was derisively dubbed, made moves to ease 
repression in the country, releasing some political prisoners and receiving new 
American aid as a reward. But repression and corruption eventually returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Duvalier and his wife, Michele, who came from a prominent family, lived a 
lavish lifestyle that stood in sharp contrast to the rest of the country. His 
taste for pornographic videos, fast cars and French champagne, and her penchant 
for French dresses and expensive jewelry, bred broad resentment among Haiti's 6 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, anti-government riots in the streets marked the beginning of 
the end of the Duvalier reign. At age 35, Duvalier fled to France. 
</P>
<P>
 France's failure to get rid of him, and the anger many French felt at being 
made the dumping ground for the despot, is one reason that few in the 
conservative government are eager to play host to any of Haiti's current 
rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 To the French, Haiti has become an American problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather we didn't accept any of them," said Charles Pasqua, the French 
minister of the Interior. "That's not our job. Why won't the Americans accept 
them? It is the Americans who wanted to intervene in Haiti. Why don't they pay 
the price? Their country is larger than ours." 
</P>
<P>
 During Duvalier's early years on the Cote d'Azur, the Haitian government hired 
lawyers and investigators to search for his fortune, much of which was taken 
out of the country by friends and associates in suitcases stuffed with cash, 
then deposited in England, Switzerland and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear that Duvalier had plenty of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he tried to stay out of the limelight, he and his wife were known 
around Cannes and Paris for their shopping excursions -- and their penchant for 
cash purchases. Court records list dozens of large purchases in the late 1980s, 
including a $200,000 pair of earrings. Duvalier spent much of his time at 
sports car auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Duvalier's rare interviews, he has portrayed himself as a victim of his 
ungrateful homeland and of French anger over his presence. But, in a 1988 
interview with Le Figaro magazine in Paris, he admitted, "I ruined myself with 
the people of Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, two years after Duvalier arrived in France, lawyers for Haiti won a 
key victory against him. A British court ordered the seizure of Duvalier's 
account in one London bank. But a week before, the money -- $21,325,615 -- had 
been transferred to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, that money, along with $400,000 in four other 
London banks, was transferred on orders from Michele Duvalier's brother. 
Members of her family were accused of massive corruption during their years in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will always have our suspicions that someone tipped them off," said 
Jacques Sales, a Haitian-born attorney in Paris who led the fight for 
Duvalier's millions. 
</P>
<P>
 After that disappointment, Sales said the Haitian government "gave up. They 
had hoped that everything would be over in a matter of weeks. And when they 
realized it would take years and that they might not even be in power when it 
was found, they kind of lost interest." 
</P>
<P>
 So, with Duvalier now apparently broke, what happened to all his money? 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys involved in the case say some of it probably was taken by Duvalier's 
associates, who served as middlemen between European banks and Duvalier's 
French villa. Other money may have been taken by Michele Duvalier, whose 
relatives controlled some of the accounts. Some, undoubtedly, still sits in 
foreign accounts, waiting for Duvalier to collect it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not even Duvalier could spend more than $20 million like that, overnight," 
Sales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who remember Duvalier's brutal style of rule, and his denials that he 
stole money from the Haitian people, think Duvalier just wants to appear poor 
now, in hopes of winning sympathy for a return to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how much money Duvalier has, though his days of 
conspicuous consumption have ended. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being sued by one lawyer for non-payment of fees. His staff has dwindled 
to one Pakistani servant, who reportedly has been reduced to begging neighbors 
for extra work. Duvalier's attempt to buy a Mercedes recently was turned down 
by a car dealer who demanded cash. 
</P>
<P>
 He could be living on the $1.2-million proceeds from the 1992 sale of his 
20-room chateau near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought the chateau, on 25 wooded acres, during his rule in Haiti in the 
hope that he would live there one day. But when he arrived in France in 1986, 
regional authorities refused to allow him to move in, citing his human rights 
record; the government blocked the chateau's sale. 
</P>
<P>
 After a protracted court battle and huge legal fees, the sale was allowed. The 
regional government bought the property, paying about half what Duvalier had 
paid, to turn it into a nature preserve. The Haitian government, in disarray, 
declined to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys figure there could be as much as $10 million, and perhaps a good 
deal more, in other countries. But Duvalier can't leave France, for fear he 
will not be allowed to return. In any case, no other country is likely to grant 
him entry. 
</P>
<P>
 With Haiti in disarray, though, the search for that money has ended -- for the 
moment, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to try to get hold of that money for the people of Haiti," said 
Sales, who has represented the Haitian government in France. "But when we saw 
that year after year the governments in Haiti changed, one bad government being 
succeeded by a worse government, we finally realized that, even if we found the 
money, it would have just been returned to the thugs who were running Haiti. 
The Haitian people will never see it."

D.A.S REPORTEDLY DECIDE NOT TO CHARGE JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors have decided not to file child molestation charges against 
superstar entertainer Michael Jackson and are expected to announce that 
decision today, sources close to the case said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's offices in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties have 
been weighing criminal charges against Jackson for more than a year, but have 
been stymied in part by the reluctance of the boy who made the initial 
allegations to testify against Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 When the announcement is made, prosecutors from the two counties are not 
expected to clear Jackson of wrongdoing. Rather, they are likely to say they 
considered the boy a credible witness, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to prosecutors, is that the boy has declined to 
testify. Under California law, victims of sex crimes cannot be held in contempt 
for refusing to take the witness stand, so prosecutors have no way of forcing 
him to talk if he decides against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Jackson and for the boy, who turned 14 earlier this year, declined 
to comment in detail. The boy's attorney, Larry Feldman, said he met with top 
prosecutors about the case Monday, but he would not disclose what was said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met with the district attorneys of both Santa Barbara and Los Angeles 
counties," Feldman said. "I believe a statement will be made shortly outlining 
the district attorneys' position. I don't want to comment any further." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman, one of Jackson's attorneys, said he had not been notified by 
authorities about any imminent decision but had been told in recent weeks that 
an announcement would be made soon. Jackson, who was recently married to Lisa 
Marie Presley, has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence and has maintained that 
he was the victim of a failed extortion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been telling me for over a month that it would be sooner rather than 
later," Weitzman said. "It's my opinion that when they announce a decision, the 
decision will be not to file." 
</P>
<P>
 If prosecutors decline to file charges against Jackson, that does not clear 
him of possible future criminal prosecution. Should the boy later decide that 
he is willing to testify, prosecutors could reconsider their decision at that 
time, as long as it is within the six-year statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the decision not to file charges against the internationally 
renowned celebrity ends 13 months in which he has been the subject of an 
intense criminal investigation waged by authorities in the two counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began Aug. 17, 1993, when a 13-year-old boy complained to a therapist 
that he had been fondled and sexually molested by Jackson over a period of 
several months. The therapist reported the allegations to authorities, who 
interviewed the boy the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 In his interview with social workers, the boy provided a graphic description 
of alleged contacts that he said began with Jackson buying him gifts and 
progressed to cuddling, masturbation and oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report of the interview noted that the boy had difficulty 
remembering some times and dates, the investigator said the boy "was consistent 
in his story." 
</P>
<P>
 Confronting an international media onslaught and a sweeping police inquiry, 
Jackson's representatives furiously denied the allegations from the outset. 
Anthony Pellicano, a private investigator hired by Jackson, said the boy's 
father had tried to extort money from the singer and had only gone public with 
the allegations after the extortion attempt was rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigated the extortion allegations, but prosecutors declined to 
file charges, saying there was insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities pressed ahead with their criminal investigation last fall, the 
boy filed a lawsuit against Jackson. Feldman moved for an early trial in that 
case and began taking depositions from people close to Jackson. Jackson, who 
was out of the country on his "Dangerous" world tour when the case began, 
refused to give a deposition because his lawyers worried that his statements in 
the civil case might compromise his ability to fight criminal charges if any 
were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Jackson abandoned the world tour and dropped out of sight for a 
time. His representatives said he was suffering from an addiction to 
painkillers and needed treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Action in the civil case continued, but before it could come to trial, 
attorneys for the two sides agreed to a settlement. Its exact terms have never 
been disclosed, but sources say Jackson agreed to pay between $15 million and 
$24 million to the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides insisted that there was no agreement that the boy would refuse to 
testify in return for accepting the settlement. Such a deal would almost 
certainly violate laws against obstruction of justice, and the lawyers in the 
Jackson case are among Los Angeles' most highly regarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Feldman emphasized from the start that his client was interested in 
putting the case behind him as quickly as possible. The settlement allowed the 
boy and his family to move out of Los Angeles, and as prosecutors continued to 
delay a decision on whether to file, it prolonged the case month after month. 
</P>
<P>
 According to law enforcement sources, prosecutors talked to the boy and his 
family about testifying, but they expressed concern about the crush of 
publicity that would involve a criminal trial and worried about prolonging a 
case that they wanted to be finished. Late this summer, the boy finally told 
prosecutors that he would not take the stand, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined to 
comment Tuesday about the Jackson case, saying only that a decision was likely 
to be announced soon.

 As combat-ready American troops looked on, Haitian police and soldiers beat at 
least one person to death Tuesday and wounded several others in breaking up 
crowds that gathered by the tens of thousands here to cheer the arrival of U.S. 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four hours after the Americans began landing in an effort to end brutal 
military rule as part of "Operation Uphold Democracy," the confrontations 
highlighted both local tensions and the delicacy of the U.S. position here. 
</P>
<P>
 The police were operating under an American policy that leaves the 
responsibility for maintaining civil order to the Haitian army, among the most 
brutal in the world and until recently labeled "thugs" by U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst of the violence came at this capital's seaport in front of heavily 
armed American troops from the 10th Mountain Division, at the entrance to an 
industrial park used by the Americans as a supply depot and in view of the 
office of Haitian army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, one Haitian was confirmed beaten to death by police, with 
dozens of others hurt. There were reports of at least two other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-uniformed police and brown-suited army riot units, long accustomed to 
using violence against even peaceful demonstrators, were under orders "to stay 
away from Americans but defend your dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 6,000 American troops had landed in Haiti by the end of Tuesday, 
including between 1,600 and 1,800 Marines who took the northern town of Cap 
Haitien, the country's second-largest city and a major port. There were no 
reports of any incidents there. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man in Port-au-Prince, so far unidentified, was standing with several 
hundred other men on a corner about 50 yards away from the seaport's main gate. 
Witnesses said about five or six police suddenly ran at them, swinging their 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a coconut vendor standing against a wall, fell to the ground, 
where he was kicked, clubbed with a wooden baton and battered with a 
five-foot-long leather thong. He died, the witnesses said, after about five 
minutes of continuous clubbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's ugliness might have been even worse if not for the Americans, who 
rarely interfered but whose presence nearby seemed to restrain somewhat the 
Haitian police and army troops. There were no reports of shootings other than 
the firing of some tear-gas canisters, and the Haitian forces staged only 
sporadic raids and left quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 According to eyewitness accounts, the police were reacting only to the crowds' 
existence and not to any provocation, although some in the crowd, which had 
been shouting pro-American slogans, threw rocks to slow the pursuing troops. 
</P>
<P>
 As the gatherings grew large, "the police would come and start beating us," 
said Jean-Louis Ednar, who answered questions through broken teeth and bloody 
lips. "I came to the port to watch the Americans come. I thought they would 
stop all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Army Col. Barry Willey, spokesman for the U.S. forces in Haiti, said 
Tuesday there "had been no disturbances or civil disorders . . . requiring our 
involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Willey said the troops' job "is to establish a secure environment for the 
return of the legitimate government," but he emphasized that the maintaining of 
order in the near future is being left to the Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the colonel said, U.S. soldiers will not use force except to defend 
themselves or other American personnel and facilities. U.S. personnel on 
Tuesday were largely restricted to their camps at the airports, ports and the 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 Willey did say that American forces "will be moving out into the countryside 
to carry out their security mission." He spoke of "joint patrols" by U.S. 
troops and Haitian police, but said "there will not be patrolling immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 His statement about joint patrols stood in contrast to those by Pentagon 
officials in Tuesday morning briefings indicating that civil disorders may be 
left to Haitian forces in the long run. Army Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Washington: "The task 
of keeping law and order in Haiti is the responsibility of the Haitian police 
force and the Haitian military. We are not in a business of doing the 
day-to-day law and order, for that matter resolving or quelling any 
demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
 As dawn on Tuesday illuminated the sites where American troops were 
disembarking from helicopters at the city's airport and unloading tons of 
equipment at the downtown port, thousands of Haitians had begun to gather. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to be the start of a good day. The people were in a good mood and 
seemed motivated as much by curiosity as political purpose. Brightening the day 
was the reopening of stores and markets, closed for the last three days as the 
population went into hiding in anticipation of an American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 By midmorning, the seven-mile stretch of streets and roads connecting the port 
to the airport was seething with people walking or standing, all nearly 
ecstatic as they watched what one bystander called "our coming of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the day progressed and the crowds grew, the police began patrolling 
aggressively, first in trucks and cars and then on foot. About noon the police 
began wading into the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 This went on sporadically for about two hours. At one point, a yellow school 
bus loaded with about 60 army troops arrived. They wore gas masks and carried 
clubs, whips and gas-grenade launchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Without provocation, they began running in the streets, first going one way 
and beating people, then turning in a mass and heading in the other direction, 
swinging clubs all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 U.S. soldiers guarding the port saw the violence but did nothing. 
One man was saved from a severe clubbing when a National Public Radio reporter 
and another journalist stood next to the soldier and recorded what he was 
doing. The Haitian soldier held back and walked away, muttering. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. sergeant standing inside the port gate said, "If I had my way, I 
would send patrols out and stop this, but it's not my call." 
</P>
<P>
 A different American soldier, a private from Atlanta, did stop a police 
officer from beating a boy in front of the industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 As a group of six police officers randomly attacked a large stream of people 
walking toward the airport, a dozen or so Haitians started running toward the 
industrial park. In front of the gate, two police officers caught up with two 
boys, one on a bicycle, and shoved them to the ground as two American soldiers 
watched. As one officer beat the boys, the other stood guard with a submachine 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta trooper shouted at the police, cursing and ordering them to move 
away from the boys while pointing his M-16 rifle at the Haitian officer with 
the gun. The two police officers backed off with the American tracking them in 
the sights of his rifle, and the boys ran away, leaving the little red bike 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first time I saw anything like this," the U.S. soldier said. 
"It's been nice all day until now." More on Haiti

ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT STRUGGLING AS CLOUT FADES; ACTIVISM: MEMBERSHIP AND 
MONEY WANE, INFIGHTING ERUPTS. SIERRA CLUB AND OTHERS PAINFULLY SEEK A NEW 
VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With prominent groups like the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and the Wilderness 
Society facing sharp declines in membership and revenue as well as waning 
political influence, the environmental movement is struggling to recapture the 
momentum that made it one of the strongest forces in the nation over the past 
quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Few in the movement agree on a strategy for resuscitation. As they grope for 
solutions, some fear that their cause may have become so much a part of the 
American mainstream that many people no longer believe that it merits special 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook is gloomy despite some smaller success stories. Several regional 
groups who have built nationwide constituencies on behalf of specific forests 
or canyons continue to hold their own. And at least one innovative national 
organization has grown as it looks for ways to curb pollution that minimize 
costs and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a time when the movement was expected to prosper -- just two years 
after the election of its first White House ally in more than a decade -- most 
major organizations are groping for a vision that will replenish revenue, 
reunify members and inspire the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A deficit of several million dollars has put the Sierra Club, the nation's 
oldest environmental organization, in its worst financial shape in 20 years, 
said Carl Pope, the club's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to do all we can, and that will mean some cutting back, some 
restructuring, to avoid a crisis," Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Greenpeace, a group that got its start in the early 1970s trying 
to block nuclear weapons tests, say membership is down nearly 1 million from 
its 1990 high of 2.5 million, and its revenues are off by a third. A 30% 
decline in membership during the same period has forced the Wilderness Society 
to close offices and lay off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that many of these groups are hobbled by layoffs and reduced 
budgets, they are trying to rebound from a dismal performance in Washington. Up 
against well-organized opponents, the environmental movement has not been able 
to pass a single piece of major legislation in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostile forces in Congress have succeeded in bottling up bills that would 
grant Cabinet status to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, strengthen 
the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Endangered Species Act 
and put more teeth in mining regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain of downsizing is aggravated by fierce infighting within the movement 
over the cause of its problems. Fund-raisers cite the recession and the 
public's preoccupation with crime and financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Craver, an executive of a firm that raises money for several major 
environmental organizations, said the movement has lost support because "it has 
failed to demonstrate convincingly that its goals are compatible with the 
economic needs of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 With a friendly Administration in Washington, environmentalists are having to 
learn an age-old lesson of reform politics. Social movements often have more 
energy when they are out of power than when they are in. The environmental 
movement was never bigger or better funded than during the 1980s when it was on 
the outs, doing battle with two conservative Republican administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 For old hands in the movement, the turnabout in fortunes has been 
breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my years I have never before seen such apathy," said Liz Frenkel, a 
Sierra Club official in Oregon who has been an activist with the club since 
1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups, such as the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources 
Defense Council and the Audubon Society are hoping to compensate for declining 
membership by relying more heavily on foundation support, wealthy donors, 
celebrity performances and novel marketing schemes. This year, for instance, 
singer James Taylor is giving a portion of his concert receipts to the NRDC. In 
a joint venture with a stuffed animal manufacturer, the Audubon Society is 
offering free memberships to anyone who buys a teddy bear named Nature Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, public opinion polls have routinely found that fewer than 
5% of Americans think that the environment is one of the nation's pressing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 And although most Americans still think of themselves as environmentalists, 
said Washington-based pollster Celinda Lake, "not so many are inclined to 
identify with the environmental movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the changes in attitude, some analysts argue that the movement 
has become a victim of its past success. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have brought the environment into their lives to such an extent 
through recycling or buying green products, many no doubt feel they are doing 
their bit and don't need to do any more," said Jack Murray of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us got into this movement fighting faceless bureaucrats . . . who 
were hellbent on destroying some beautiful place," said Dennis Hayes, one of 
the architects of the first Earth Day 24 years ago, who now runs a foundation 
that gives $500,000 annually to environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, if you ask a typical American to name a bureaucrat, he'll point to 
someone in some environmental agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Among environmental groups, the Sierra Club may be the best example of 
bureaucratic heft. 
</P>
<P>
 With its $40-million annual budget, its Washington lobby and legal arm, its 
$6-million book business and $3-million worldwide eco-tourism operation, the 
Sierra Club looks more like a holding company than a society of nature lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you want to ask: Will the real Sierra Club stand up?" said 
Priscilla Feral, an animal rights advocate who tangled with the organization 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Feral said she felt betrayed when the club refused to join a boycott of 
Alaskan tourism spearheaded by her group, Friends of Animals, to protest the 
state's decision to allow the trapping of wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of joining the boycott, the Sierra Club took out a full-page ad in the 
New York Times, encouraging people to travel to Alaska and learn about the wolf 
issue first-hand. Club officials argued that exposing people to the wilds 
tended to make them wilderness advocates. But Feral accused club officials of 
allowing business interests to dictate environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's decision also reflected the complicated task of trying to satisfy a 
huge membership with widely varying views. Although many members favored the 
boycott, the club deferred to its Anchorage chapter, which opposed the boycott 
because it did not want to penalize local outfitters and guides who opposed the 
wolf kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy highlighted a developing rift within the movement over the 
impact that environmental policies have on the lives of working people -- from 
farmers and ranchers to wilderness guides and outfitters. 
</P>
<P>
 James Connor, a former head of the Montana chapter of the Sierra Club, quit 
the organization after it endorsed one of the most sweeping wilderness bills 
ever proposed in Congress. The bill, unsuccessful so far, would put a 
35-million-acre, five-state swath of wilderness off limits to any economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got involved in the environmental movement because I thought it was in the 
enlightened self-interest of humankind," Connor said. "But I'm not in tune with 
what is going on now. Something snapped. People in the movement have lost faith 
in humankind. They have retreated into utopian fantasies, become 100% 
environmentally correct and 100% politically impotent." 
</P>
<P>
 Connor argued that environmental extremism has played into the hands of 
political opponents who repeatedly depict groups such as the Sierra Club as 
enemies of working people. A broad alliance of rural landowners, suburban real 
estate developers and big-city industrial interests, the opposition has 
combined populist rhetoric with corporate contributions to repeatedly beat back 
environmental initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Craver, the movement's fund-raiser, agreed. "The groups have not been good at 
responding to the jobs-versus-nature rhetoric that you hear in so many rural 
areas, and it has hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not every environmental organization is suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Defense Fund, which searches for market-based solutions to 
environmental problems, has grown from 100,000 members in 1990 to about 250,000 
today, while its budget has increased just over 20%, to $22 million, said Joel 
Plagenz, its director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The EDF helped draft provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act that reward 
companies that comply with clean air standards by allowing them to sell 
pollution "credits" to firms not meeting the requirements. The group is working 
on a proposal to offer financial incentives to property owners to set aside 
land that is home to endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some environmental hard-liners have made gains, particularly in places 
where ecological degradation has been the most conspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1,500 members scattered across the country and a $2-million budget, 
Oregon's Native Forest Council broke ranks with the mainstream movement when it 
called for prohibiting all commercial logging in the Northwest's ancient 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cut through the fog of rhetoric with a simple solution that appealed to a 
lot of people," said Victor Rozek, one of two ex-Sierra Club members who 
founded the group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hard-liners also are contributing to the rural backlash, and the 
voices of dispossessed loggers and ranchers are the ones being heard in 
Washington these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion that rural people are under siege by a bunch of yuppies is taken 
quite seriously in a lot of small towns in this country," said Andy Kerr, an 
early leader of the campaign to protect old-growth forests in the Northwest. "A 
lot of environmental groups are learning that these places have a surprising 
amount of political influence, but they don't know what to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr thinks he does. Last winter, he moved his family from Portland to Joseph, 
Ore., a small logging town where residents blamed a recent sawmill closure on 
environmentalists such as Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we start knocking on doors and getting involved in local issues, 
showing people their concerns are our concerns, we're not going to get very 
far," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington and in the offices of the nation's largest environmental 
groups, some people are more concerned about making peace within the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sierra Club, officials are so concerned about internal hostilities that 
they have threatened to cut off computer access to members who uses electronic 
mail to vilify their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to wake up in the morning knowing who the enemy was and how to face 
him," said Pope. "All too often lately, we seem to be treating each other like 
the enemy."

JULE STYNE DIES; PROLIFIC COMPOSER OF BROADWAY HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jule Styne, who was not born in this country but became one of the most 
prolific contributors to its singular offering to the arts -- the Broadway 
musical -- died Tuesday in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Styne, who won an Oscar and a Tony, had at his death composed more than 1,500 
tunes, many from such widely heralded shows as "Gypsy," "Funny Girl" and 
"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been hospitalized for the last six weeks after undergoing open-heart 
surgery at Mt. Sinai Hospital, said his publicist, Shirley Herz. 
</P>
<P>
 Styne's was a late contribution to the elevation of Tin Pan Alley from a 
tawdry New York district into a national melodic highway. As a result, his 
music generally reflected the sophistication of the later 20th Century and a 
topicality that was absent from the turn-of-the-century tunes of earlier 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have written that Styne's glowing melodies were overshadowed by the 
glitter of those who performed them -- Ethel Merman, Carol Channing, Barbra 
Streisand, Mary Martin and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Styne never expressed concern about those statements, saying often that 
"without the rendition there is no song." 
</P>
<P>
 He also created music for Judy Holliday in "Bells Are Ringing"; Phil Silvers 
and Nancy Walker in "Do Re Mi"; Silvers and Nanette Fabray in "High Button 
Shoes"; Bert Lahr and Dolores Gray in "Two on the Aisle"; Carol Burnett in 
"Fade Out-Fade In"; Robert Morse in "Sugar"; and Martin, for whom he wrote 
several songs for "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me the divine gift of 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,' and anyone 
who ever worked with him would say Jule Styne is a star's best friend," said 
Channing, who starred in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." 
</P>
<P>
 Styne once recalled that songwriter Vincent Youmans told him to keep songs 
"simple but harmonically attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the two most marvelous words anybody ever told me," he said. "When 
you hear just a melody played, you won't remember it if it hasn't got a 
harmonic structure." 
</P>
<P>
 He pursued that advice not only on Broadway stages but in films and through 
recordings of his music that sold in the millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 of his tunes were at the top of the Hit Parade during the World War 
II era and later. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were "I Don't Want to Walk Without You, Baby," "Make Someone 
Happy," "I'll Walk Alone," "It's Been a Long, Long Time," "I Guess I'll Hang My 
Tears Out to Dry," "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," "I Fall in Love Too 
Easily," "It's Magic," "The Party's Over," "I Still Get Jealous" and 
"Everything's Coming Up Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 His "People" in 1964 and "It Seems to Me I've Heard That Song Before" in 1942 
contributed greatly to the respective careers of Streisand and a young crooner 
named Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinatra once gave Styne a gold bracelet engraved with the words "To Jule Who 
Knew Me When." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Styne hits that Sinatra popularized included "Saturday Night Is the 
Loneliest Night in the Week," "I Fall in Love Too Easily" and "Guess I'll Hang 
My Tears Out to Dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Styne's life itself had all the trappings of a theatrical production. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born to Ukrainian-Jewish parents in London's East End. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 5 or 7 (depending on the source) his wealthy uncle took him to see Sir 
Harry Lauder, the Scots balladeer. Young Julius Kerwin Stein (he later changed 
the spelling of the last name and the pronunciation of the first to "Julie") 
was enthralled and leaped on stage to sing a tune with Sir Harry. The 
entertainer was so impressed that he insisted that the boy be given piano 
lessons. Shortly after the Steins immigrated to Chicago, his uncle found them a 
home with room for a piano. By age 9 the boy was being touted as a prodigy and 
playing with the Chicago and Detroit symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied harmony and composition and wanted to become a classical pianist. 
But a teacher convinced him that his hands would never be large enough or 
strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned to popular music and met another Stein, this one named Jules, who 
was booking bands into various clubs while studying medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 That Stein turned Julius Stein into Jule Styne and got him a job as a pianist 
with a beginning clarinetist named Benny Goodman. It was the same Jules Stein 
who would later found with Lew Wasserman the entertainment giant MCA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new name and a latent enthusiasm for popular songs, Styne left Goodman 
and moved to the Metropole Hotel in Chicago, where he accompanied Helen Morgan, 
Ruth Etting, Fanny Brice and Al Jolson. Styne said years later that one of his 
biggest fans was a man who liked to be called "Mr. Brown" but who in fact was 
Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1926 Styne wrote his first hit, "Sunday," which was quickly popularized by 
Jolson. By 1932 the young composer had organized his own band. He moved to New 
York City as a vocal coach, and that job led to a studio contract with 20th 
Century Fox, where his singing students included Shirley Temple and Alice Faye. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Republic, writing songs for Roy Rogers and Gene Autry. There he 
met lyricist Sammy Cahn. and the team produced "It Seems to Me I've Heard That 
Song Before," "Kiss Me Once, Kiss Me Twice," "There Goes That Song Again" and 
many more jukebox favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Cahn, Styne worked with such writers as Stephen Sondheim, Frank 
Loesser, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Styne's Academy Award was for "Three Coins in the Fountain," the title song of 
the 1954 film, and his Tony was for "Hallelujah, Baby!" in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "People" was a 1968 smash for Streisand at a period when few non-rock songs 
could get air time. 
</P>
<P>
 Styne has been credited with discovering Streisand and persuading the 
producers of "Funny Girl" to cast her as Fanny Brice. 
</P>
<P>
 He had caught her act in Greenwich Village, he said, and "I decided I wanted 
her, but no one else did. They didn't like the way she looked, but she made a 
sound I never heard before," he told an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Styne's musical "The Red Shoes," based on the movie about a 
ballerina who sacrifices everything for her art, closed after five 
performances. After all of his successes, a flop proved to be his final 
Broadway offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Styne had become a citizen in 1916 and his honors included one of the nation's 
highest, the Kennedy Center award. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps his most treasured honor came in 1958 when this tribute was read 
into the Congressional Record: 
</P>
<P>
 "The lives of Americans throughout our land as well as the lives of people 
throughout the corners of the world have been enriched by the artistry and 
genius of Jule Styne. As an American, he has brought great credit to his 
country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "His accomplishments have been great -- the position he holds in the hearts 
and minds of his fellow Americans is just as great." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Margaret, two sons, a daughter, seven 
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be held Friday in New York City.

SURVEY OF POLITICAL LEANINGS SEES 3RD PARTY IDEA GAINING; POLITICS: TIMES 
MIRROR POLL FINDS NATION ROILING WITH RESENTMENTS, ANXIETIES. MAJOR PARTIES ARE 
LOSING PULL.

<P>
 Disillusioned with President Clinton and uncertain about the Republican Party, 
Americans increasingly say they are willing to support a new third party, an 
extensive new poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey by the Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press portrays a 
nation roiling with resentments and anxieties: cynical toward government, 
hostile to immigrants, sharply divided along racial lines over the 
responsibility of government to help the needy, suspicious of the media, 
uncertain about the future and increasingly untethered to either of the two 
major parties. It suggests that the wave of anxiety about the nation's 
direction that propelled Clinton into office has not crested -- and could well 
submerge the President and his party in the November mid-term elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats have frantically sought to prevent Republicans from framing 
the 1994 election as a referendum on Clinton, the desire to send a message to 
the White House could become a determining factor, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three-fourths of those polled who approve of the President's job 
performance say they will back Democrats in the November elections; but almost 
three-fourths who give him poor marks say they will support Republicans. That's 
ominous news for the Democrats: just 42% of those surveyed in early September 
approved of Clinton's performance, while 52% disapproved. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was taken before the agreement reached Sunday to remove the Haitian 
military leaders from power, which could boost Clinton's public standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond its implications for November, the poll points toward a period of 
political fluidity and instability -- with Republicans divided on social 
issues, Democrats riven by racial disputes and disagreements about the role of 
government, and many middle-income independents convinced that neither party 
knows how to alleviate the economic pressures they face. "One of the most 
striking findings of the new survey is the declining role of the parties as a 
framework around which Americans organize their political thinking," the 
authors write. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are based on 4,809 interviews conducted in July and repeat 
interviews with 1,500 respondents earlier this month. The Times Mirror survey 
has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror Co. is the owner of the Los Angeles Times and other newspaper, 
broadcasting and publishing enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll updates a political "typology" introduced by Times Mirror in 1987. In 
that 1987 survey, the pollsters used dozens of questions about values and 
political attitudes to segment Americans into 11 clusters with distinct 
political and social profiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing the electorate through this lens illuminated the fissures in both of 
the party coalitions, as well as the divisions between the independents at the 
fulcrum of the political debate. The 1987 survey, for instance, found that 
Republicans were divided almost equally between two contrasting groups: 
economically conservative and upscale "enterprisers," and socially conservative 
"moralists." It found Democratic-leaning groups divided between older, socially 
conservative "New Dealers," upper middle-class and socially tolerant " '60s 
Democrats," and the heavily minority "partisan poor." 
</P>
<P>
 The new survey finds the electorate now organizing into a significantly 
different pattern than in the mid-1980s. Under the strains of growing 
alienation from government and uncertainty about the future, the poll finds, 
the tenuous partisan alignment in the first survey has further fractionated. 
</P>
<P>
 The new poll identifies 10 distinct clusters of voters. Six are groups 
identified in the first survey. Four of the groups are new: "Libertarians," who 
are fiscally conservative and socially tolerant; "new economy independents," a 
predominantly female and economically stressed group; the "embittered," a 
downscale alienated group skeptical about government's capacity; and centrist 
"new Democrats," who favor measures to protect the environment but are more 
pro-business than other Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the poll portrays a long-term shift in allegiance toward the 
GOP. In the 1987 survey, the groups that leaned toward Democrats constituted 
41% of probable voters, compared with 31% for the GOP. The new survey finds the 
Republican-leaning groups now make up 36% of registered voters, compared with 
34% for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But the larger story is the weakening partisan adhesion on both sides of the 
ideological divide. In the first survey, six groups exhibited sufficient 
loyalty to one party to be identified as a core constituency. In the new 
survey, only the conservative, pro-business "enterprisers" and the liberal 
"partisan poor" "display sufficient commitment to their parties to be regarded 
as 'core' groups," the authors write. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other groups, allegiance to either party has attenuated. Just 
two-thirds of "moralists" call themselves Republicans. Less than half of the 
socially liberal "seculars," another holdover group from the 1987 survey, call 
themselves Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups at the center of the electorate each identify more with Democrats 
than Republicans. But those attachments are weak among both the "new economy 
independents" and the "embittered." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those groups, in fact, indicate substantial support for a third party: 
68% of the "new independents" and 56% of the "embittered" say they are open to 
a new choice. Together with two socially liberal groups -- the "seculars" and 
"Libertarians" -- they constitute the core of support for a new party. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen through a more traditional demographic prism, the poll finds broad-based 
support for the concept of a third party. Overall, 53% of those surveyed are 
open to a new party, while 43% are opposed. That's up from 1982, when Americans 
were divided 44% to 44% on the question in an ABC/Washington Post poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new poll, support for a new party is most intense among the young -- 
with more than 60% of those 29 and younger backing the idea. Ideologically, the 
notion surprisingly draws the widest support from liberals, with 61% endorsing 
the idea. Support for a third party is also somewhat higher in the West, among 
men and with suburbanites. 
</P>
<P>
 Another measure of dissatisfaction with the parties is the continued strength 
of Ross Perot in a 1996 ballot test, despite an erosion in his public standing. 
In the poll, those who think favorably of Perot outnumber critics by just 51% 
to 45%. (In contrast, Clinton receives a 58%-41% positive rating on that broad 
assessment of attitudes toward public figures). 
</P>
<P>
 But even so, a mock 1996 ballot shows Perot roughly duplicating his 1992 
performance, when he captured 19% of the vote. Matched against Clinton and 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) in a hypothetical 1996 race, Perot 
captures 20% of the vote -- with Clinton holding 39% and Dole 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other findings underscore Perot's potential to divide the anti-incumbent vote 
in 1996 -- just as he did in 1992. Matched head-on in a two-way race, Dole 
leads Clinton 49% to 46%. In a hypothetical two-way race with retired Gen. 
Colin L. Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as the GOP 
nominee, Clinton fares even more poorly: Powell holds a striking 51%-41% 
advantage. Powell captures one-fourth or more of the vote from each of the 
Democratic-leaning groups, except the "partisan poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers may be less meaningful as a prediction of how Americans will 
actually vote in 1996 than as an expression of immediate discontent with 
Clinton that could influence the 1994 campaign. In almost all respects, the 
poll finds Democrats are facing an extremely adverse electoral environment -- 
even though 64% of those polled describe themselves as "pretty well satisfied" 
with their personal financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The public now gives Republicans a 12-percentage-point advantage over the 
Democrats on being able to manage the federal government effectively; a 
21-point advantage on being well-organized; a 20-point advantage on making 
"wise decisions about the country's defense policies"; a 13-point advantage on 
ensuring American competitiveness in the world economy, and 12-point leads on 
both protecting traditional values and promoting morality and personal 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Clinton's passage of the five-year $500-billion deficit reduction plan 
last year, the public prefers the GOP over Democrats by six percentage points 
when asked which party can best reduce the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats lead the GOP on concern for the disadvantaged, protecting the 
environment, reforming the health care system, improving schools and empathy 
for the concerns of average Americans. On the bottom line of which party voters 
intend to support in the congressional mid-term elections, Republicans now 
narrowly lead the Democrats, 48% to 46%; last July, the Democrats held a 
two-point advantage, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more ominous for Democrats is the enormous resistance in the 
survey to the core party belief that activist government programs can 
ameliorate the nation's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton has attempted to revive faith in Washington through such 
reforms as his "reinventing government" initiative, the poll found that 
Americans' attitudes toward the federal government have not improved since he 
took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans see the federal government as unresponsive: More than 8 in 10 of 
those polled agree that elected officials in Washington "lose touch with the 
people pretty quickly"; two-thirds reject the proposition that "most elected 
officials care what people like me think"; and nearly 3 in 5 disagree that "the 
government is really run for the benefit of all the people." Each of those 
findings is virtually identical to the response in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, according to the poll, the public overwhelmingly sees 
government as ineffective: 69% of those polled agree that government programs 
are usually inefficient and wasteful; that the federal government "controls too 
much of our daily lives"; and that dealing with a federal agency is often not 
worth the trouble. Just over 3 in 5 say government "regulation of business 
usually does more harm than good." 
</P>
<P>
 That skepticism about government undermines support for new initiatives to 
help the poor. In the poll, almost 3 in 5 Americans agree with the broad 
statements that government has a responsibility "to take care of people who 
can't take care of themselves" and should "guarantee every citizen enough to 
eat and a place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 But on the operational question of whether government should do more to help 
needy people "even if it means going deeper into debt," attitudes reverse: 56% 
say no and just 41% yes. That is a sharp deterioration in support since 1992, 
when 53% backed more spending even at the cost of greater debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The slide in support for new social spending has come almost entirely among 
whites. In 1992, 50% of whites and 77% of blacks endorsed new spending; in the 
new poll, 73% of blacks still back such programs. But only 37% of whites are 
now willing to spend more on the poor if it means exacerbating the federal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding illuminates one of the poll's most striking aspects: the 
hardening of differences between blacks and whites on racially charged issues. 
Although the poll finds support for tolerance at a personal level -- two-thirds 
of whites and nearly 90% of blacks endorse interracial dating -- it also 
captures clashing attitudes on the nature and extent of opportunities for 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, the percentage of whites who say that the nation has gone too 
far in "pushing equal rights" jumps to 51% from 42% only two years ago; 
likewise, the percentage of whites who say that the condition of blacks hasn't 
improved much in recent years drops to 44%, down from 54% in 1992. Nearly 3 in 
4 whites reject the idea that government should grant blacks and other 
minorities "preferential treatment" to improve their condition. On each of 
those questions, blacks overwhelmingly take the opposite position. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of these differences is a clashing perspective on the possibility 
for Americans to get ahead through individual initiative. Overwhelming 
majorities of whites and blacks agree that "poor people have become too 
dependent on government assistance programs." But a majority of blacks say that 
"success in life is pretty much determined by forces outside our control"; 
three-fifths of whites reject that proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In this polarizing environment, even the attachment of African Americans to 
the Democratic Party -- perhaps the sturdiest bond in American politics over 
the past 30 years -- shows faint signs of fraying. The poll finds that the 
percentage of blacks in the most Democratic-leaning clusters has declined to 
54% from 63% in 1987. Nearly one-third of blacks now fit into the 
independent-minded groups at the electorate's center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although blacks are no more inclined to embrace Republican attitudes," the 
study concludes, "they have become less prone to hold a set of political values 
that is explicitly Democratic." The New Electorate: Where Do You Fit? 
</P>
<P>
 In its extensive new survey of American attitudes and values, the Times Mirror 
Center for The People & The Press groups the electorate into ten distinct 
clusters, each with a common set of political beliefs. One group -- the 
so-called Bystanders -- are largely disengaged from the political system. The 
other nine range across the ideological spectrum -- from Republican - leaning 
groups like the Enterprisers, to the Partisan Poor, a group anchored in the 
Democratic Party. By viewing the electorate through this lens, the analysis 
attempts to isolate the fault lines within the two parties, and among the swing 
groups unattached to either.

 By some measures the American public is feeling more negative toward 
government and further alienated politically than even two yeas ago. Such 
alienation has boosted what the Times Mirror survey termed "outsiderism," the 
belief that new leaders are better than old ones.

INTERVENTION MAY NOT STOP RIGHTS ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The new outbreaks of violence against citizens by the Haitian military on 
Tuesday expose a potential flaw in the Clinton Administration's Haitian peace 
accord -- that it may have no effective plan for quelling the human rights 
violations that were a major reason for U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, U.S. military officials concede, the last-minute agreement obtained by 
the peace mission headed by former President Jimmy Carter has forced American 
troops into an awkward partnership with the repressive Haitian military and 
police forces they originally had planned to overwhelm and replace. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, these officials say, U.S. troops now must seek to "co-opt" the 
7,000-member Haitian military gradually -- hoping eventually to coax the 
Haitian army and police force into making reforms, even though that means 
allowing some measure of Haitian-against-Haitian violence to continue, at least 
for the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The task of keeping law and order in Haiti is the responsibility of the 
Haitian police force and the Haitian military," U.S. Army Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in 
Washington. "We are not in a business of doing the day-to-day law and order, 
for that matter resolving or quelling any demonstrations. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But senior U.S. officials admit that the approach contains risks that may well 
unravel the entire democratization plan. To begin with, the current policy, 
under which U.S. troops would have to stand by even while ordinary Haitians are 
beaten or shot at, fosters the perception that the Americans are backing the 
police -- and could prompt a backlash against U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili himself publicly conceded Tuesday that the hands-off policy 
eventually could backfire on U.S. forces, acknowledging that the 
Haitian-on-Haitian violence contains a "murky sort of threat" that could end up 
in "explosive situations." U.S. soldiers "have to be prepared for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, U.S. officials are fearful that the increasing appearance of 
such incidents on American television screens could well prove politically 
unsustainable in the United States, sparking public outrage that could 
intensify pressure on Congress to force the Administration to get out of Haiti 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some strategists are predicting that the incidence of beatings and 
shootings -- which are daily fare in Haiti but probably unacceptable on 
American TV screens -- is almost certain to increase sharply as the Oct. 15 
deadline for the departure of the army commander, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism already has begun in the wake of Tuesday's incidents. Pierre 
Sane, secretary general of Amnesty International, issued a statement saying the 
"impunity for human-rights violators granted in the agreement between the U.S. 
government and the Haitian military puts that country's population in immediate 
danger." 
</P>
<P>
 "Letting killers and torturers (in the Haitian army) off the hook undermines 
long-term solutions to the country's continuing human rights crisis because it 
sends a message that they can continue their abuses," Sane said in a speech 
delivered at United Nations headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The original invasion plan that the Administration had begun carrying out on 
Sunday would have resolved that aspect of the Haitian problem. The operations 
order called for U.S. troops to overpower the Haitian military and police 
forces and to take over all responsibility for keeping order in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But the arrangements dictated by the Carter accord -- while making it easier 
for U.S. troops to enter the country -- require U.S. commanders to cooperate 
with the Haitian military and police forces and leave to them the bulk of the 
responsibility for day-to-day police action. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that U.S. troops simply are not to intervene to stop Haitian police 
or militiamen from beating or even shooting ordinary Haitians, unless the 
violence becomes so widespread that it threatens the general stability of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 It also means that except in cases in which U.S. troops feel that they are 
being threatened, the Americans will not aggressively disarm Haitian units or 
individuals. Instead, U.S. personnel will try to persuade Haitian military 
leaders to recall unauthorized weapons. And they may finance a weapons buyback 
program to encourage Haitians to turn in their arms voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for overhauling the Haitian military is a slow one by any standard -- 
and an iffy one. A senior Pentagon official said Tuesday that the U.S. military 
hopes gradually to win the confidence of the Haitian military sufficiently to 
coax it into making some reforms, or at least into taking steps that may 
ultimately lead to more serious changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a hell of a lot longer" than overwhelming and replacing 
the Haitian military would have, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One such scheme calls for prodding the Haitians to provide members of the 
military and police forces with photo identification cards, keeping better 
track of their weapons and paying them with funds provided by the U.S. Agency 
for International Development to tie them more closely to U.S. influence. U.S. 
military police officers also could accompany them to serve as examples. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official warned that with the long history of police abuses and 
violence in Haiti, "you're not going to change Haitian society overnight." 
Haiti has a society "that lives by intimidation," he said. He charged that 
critics want to establish a standard of violence-control "that you can't meet 
in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of disarmament also is a touchy one in Haiti. Although the army, 
which is equipped with Israeli-made assault rifles and other lesser weapons, is 
so poorly armed that it is not considered a threat to the U.S. occupation 
force, hundreds of thousands of civilians are believed to have weapons ranging 
from target pistols to grenade launchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Security experts say "thousands and thousands" of Haitians have guns, 
including civilian auxiliary police forces called attaches , who are widely 
regarded as terror squads and who carry out the worst of the military's brutal 
oppression. "The really dangerous people have M-16s, 9-millimeters and all 
sorts of heavy firepower," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those weapons have been in evidence recently as groups of civilians, mostly 
young men in their 20s and 30s, have taken over nighttime roadblocks, 
threatening foreign reporters and promising to punish pro-democracy Haitians. 
"The army has handed out at least 3,000 rifles to its attaches and other 
civilian supporters over the last three months," one expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those Haitians who criticize the country's military say the U.S. plan to 
buy up civilian-held firearms is unlikely to work. "You're not going to buy 
back these weapons," one said when told of the American scheme. "These people . 
. . think their lives depend on their guns. What you'll get are rusty pieces of 
junk and useless stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Western observers contend the disarmament plan could work. While U.S. 
forces may be keeping the issue low-key right now, if disarmament becomes 
necessary "the guns will be brought in, at least most of them," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, when the Haitian army sought to dismantle the Tontons Macoutes, the 
55,000-member private security forces of the deposed Duvalier family, it simply 
ordered their weapons turned in.

ON CALIFORNIA: A LEGEND THAT GREW LIKE BAMBOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The poster boy of the embattled California farmer can be found in South El 
Monte, deep in the guts of Greater Los Angeles. He occupies a low-slung 
cinder-block building on a street of low-slung cinder-block buildings, close by 
the Pomona Freeway. Fan palms spurt through the sidewalk here and there, and 
that's about all that passes for agriculture on Max Shapiro Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Taung-Ming Lin's neighbors manufacture pipes and plastic molds and steel parts 
and furniture. He runs a bookbinding plant. A stocky, fit-looking man of 51, 
Lin wears a polo shirt, polyester slacks and Reeboks. No cowboy boots or 
overalls for him. He sits on a black couch in his small corner office and, over 
the whump, whump, whump of machinery, lets his daughter interpret as he tells 
his unlikely story in Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a halting interview process, with much lost in translation. Asked early 
on to describe what it's been like to become a national symbol of runaway 
environmentalism, to be remarked upon regularly by Rush Limbaugh and every 
politician under the California sun, Lin and his daughter confer with one 
another in Chinese, quietly, earnestly, for several minutes. Then she turns to 
the questioner and asks: 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is Rush Limbaugh?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How to explain Limbaugh to this innocent? How to explain dittoheads? Limbaugh 
is the conservative commentator who earns his daily bread preaching to the 
choir on radio. Like Ronald Reagan, he loves anecdotes that speak to liberal 
intentions gone astray, and earlier this summer the matter of Taung-Ming Lin 
presented him with a doozy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin had come to California three years ago from Taiwan on a visitor visa. He 
apparently had made a bundle selling refrigerators over there. In addition to 
the bookbinding business, he bought 700 acres of farmland west of Bakersfield. 
Actually, to call the piece a farm is a stretch. Bordered on one side by 
Interstate 5, the land is salty, overrun with sage and, at a price of $1.6 
million, quite the opposite of a steal. Nonetheless, Lin looked at the land and 
imagined something more. 
</P>
<P>
 "His dream," his daughter says, "was to retire someday and become a farmer. 
Not to make money, but for his own interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he acquired the land, Lin instructed his hired man, Rico Sanchez, 
to plant five acres in bamboo. "He says you can eat it," Sanchez later would 
say, sounding not at all convinced. The land, though, was so bad that many 
seedlings withered and died. Someone sold Lin "special water" to sprinkle on 
the soil, and Sanchez plowed some more. It was then the federal agents came, 
SWAT-style, and seized the tractor. They accused Lin and his hand of ignoring 
formal notice, of plowing up habitat of the endangered Tipton kangaroo rat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw no rats," Lin says through his daughter. "I only saw rabbits and" -- 
here they hold another long conference -- "that red thing that climbs trees?" 
</P>
<P>
 Squirrels? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, squirrels. No rats." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there had been similar cases, this one took hold like none before. 
After Limbaugh came national newspaper correspondents and television crews, 
came political candidates and brother-farmers, who took Lin along on tractor 
rallies to the state Capitol and fund-raising barbecues up and down the valley. 
Along the way, they all have poured gasoline on what had been a relatively 
small fire of protest against the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Taung-Ming Lin 
has become the most important farmer in California, if not all America. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's bigger than himself," says Lin's attorney. "He's Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 Lin seems a bit baffled by his role. "He wants to live a quiet life," his 
daughter says. He will have to wait. For now, the legend is framed, the 
concrete is poured and hardened. And it doesn't matter that Lin set out, not to 
feed the world, but to grow a little bamboo. It doesn't matter that, though 
celebrated in country-Western song as one more family farmer on the run, he is 
a city man, a light industrialist. It doesn't matter that, amid all the thunder 
about those mean old feds and enviro-freaks, Lin quietly has filed suit against 
the agricultural corporation that sold him the land -- essentially charging 
that the company sold him a lousy piece of land without informing him it was 
inhabited by protected animals. 
</P>
<P>
 These nuances just get in the way of a better story, a modern political legend 
that, when the inevitable movie version is made, will star a farmer who looks 
and talks a lot like . . . Sam Shepard. Welcome to America, Mr. Lin.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; INSURERS FATTEN QUACKENBUSH'S 
WAR CHEST; ABOUT 60% OF HIS MONEY COMES FROM COMPANIES AND AGENTS HE WOULD 
REGULATE, IF ELECTED, COMPARED TO ABOUT 10% OF HIS OPPONENT'S FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Both major party candidates for insurance commissioner have collected campaign 
funds from elements of the insurance industry, but Republican Assemblyman 
Charles W. Quackenbush has tapped far deeper into that source than his rival, 
and is intensifying his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of Quackenbush's war chest has been supplied by insurers, while 
Democratic state Sen. Art Torres has received less than 10% of his total from 
industry connections, mostly lawyers who represent insurers, according to 
figures supplied by the campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush's campaign Monday released a schedule of 35 fund-raising 
receptions to be attended by insurance agents with a stated goal of raising 
$397,750 toward a projected $1-million television advertising blitz. The 
receptions began in August. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of $107,757 has been raised for Quackenbush by insurance agents at the 
receptions that have already been held. Another $500,000 has come from other 
industry loans and contributions. Quackenbush has raised about $1 million so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, in contrast, even according to Quackenbush's campaign manager Greg 
Butler, has raised about $100,000 in industry money, out of what the Torres 
campaign says is a little more than $1 million that it has raised so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said Tuesday that he has decided to send $10,000 back to Sam Presley, a 
New Orleans owner of an auto insurer who was ejected two years ago by 
California regulators. Informed that the Quackenbush campaign was questioning 
the donation, Torres said, "I (knew I had to) send it back, as soon as we 
realized who he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush's reliance on a largely industry-funded campaign is stirring 
adverse comment, and not only among consumer leaders who might be expected to 
be critical. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading industry trade publication, National Underwriter, recently warned 
that such support could backfire against his election chances. 
</P>
<P>
 After the California Assn. of Life Underwriters endorsed Quackenbush, National 
Underwriter editorialized, "We think (the association members) are wrong to 
take sides in an election to choose who will regulate them for the next four 
years. They would have been wiser to stand by their 60-year history of 
political neutrality. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "The group . . . leaves itself open to charges that it is merely trying to 
co-opt the government official who will make critical decisions affecting the 
industry it represents. Any industry's effort to influence the election of its 
regulator can only be viewed by the public as self-serving, if not improper." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Rosenfield, leader of the Proposition 103 campaign against the industry 
in 1988, said he is more concerned about agents' associations that have 
ostensibly stayed neutral, but whose members have been organizing fund-raisers 
for Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield noted that more than half the agents' fund-raisers for Quackenbush 
are asking for less than $100 a person, meaning that under state law the donor 
does not have to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven of the 35 fund-raisers ask $99 each, just $1 under the reporting limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "While trying to hide its actions from public view, the insurance industry is 
mounting an all-out campaign to elect a pro-industry candidate to the office of 
California insurance commissioner," Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also expressed alarm that a recent letter from an insurance agency 
executive who loaned $200,000 to the Quackenbush campaign called for other 
agents to contribute $50 to Quackenbush for each $1 million in premiums that 
they had written. If everyone complied, Quackenbush would get $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of another reform group, Ruth Holton of California Common Cause, 
said that in raising so much money from the industry, Quackenbush may be 
"sending out a message that he is going to be friendly to the industry" if 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, speaking for Quackenbush, derided such statements as without 
foundation. He said that as an assemblyman for the past seven years, 
Quackenbush had occasionally defied the wishes of big contributors to vote for 
legislation, such as gun control and control of breast implants, because he 
believed it was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll never have a problem speaking out against the insurers when they're 
doing something wrong," Butler said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN FINDS DOOR TO DEBATE STILL SHUT; 
CHALLENGER TRIES TO MEET WILSON AT HIS OFFICE BUT IS REBUFFED. GOVERNOR'S CAMP 
SAYS SHE SHOULD ACCEPT HIS CONDITIONS FOR FORMAT. 
</P>

<P>
 Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown took her demand for a pre-election 
gubernatorial debate directly to Gov. Pete Wilson's office in the Capitol on 
Tuesday but was told he was too busy to debate the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting to regain the lead over Republican Wilson in opinion polls, Brown 
staged a small rally Tuesday morning with placard-waving supporters in the rose 
garden of Capitol Park to accuse him of ducking a debate by insisting on 
"silly" format restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I bet Pete Wilson doesn't even know that his handlers and lawyers 
have insisted on that long list (of conditions)," Brown, the state treasurer, 
said Tuesday. "I bet if I just go over there and talk to Pete Wilson, we can 
work this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailed by reporters and about a dozen backers, she led a march into the 
Capitol and to the lobby of Wilson's office, where she was met by press 
secretary Sean Walsh. He told Brown that the governor was too busy "doing his 
job" and signing bills to meet with her. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Wilson campaign official interrupted and challenged her to accept 
Wilson's conditions on a debate format, Brown gave up on her chances for a 
personal meeting. "I'm giving you my home phone number," she said as she handed 
over a piece of paper. "Ask him to give me a call so we can work this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Dan Schnur, chief spokesman for the Wilson campaign who had tagged 
along in the Brown procession, brushed aside her march as an "embarrassing" 
demonstration by a trailing candidate who "decides to make a public spectacle 
of herself." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to debate. We're eager to debate," Schnur claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown ticked off a list of what she called Wilson's "Top 10 Debate Dodging 
Excuses," culled from a proposed format agreement that Wilson made public last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other details, the proposed agreement demanded that the television 
studio include a "neutral color background" and that each candidate appear 
behind a slanted podium with a "shelf underneath with a glass of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown charged that Wilson wanted "friendly questions only" and that he wanted 
to "handpick the political reporters who ask the questions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schnur countered that Brown had misrepresented the document. He noted that 
under Wilson's proposal, the reporters would have to be "mutually acceptable to 
both campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Wilson's heavy schedule of political fund-raisers this month is 
proof that the governor is not spending all his time reviewing legislation. She 
released a purloined Wilson campaign schedule showing he had 17 money-raising 
events scheduled on 10 days in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Wilson campaign adviser Larry Thomas told The Times that the 
governor would have just nine fund-raisers this month. He corrected the number 
Tuesday, blaming the mistake on a clerical error. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Glazer, an aide to Brown, accused the Wilson campaign of 
deliberately understating the number of fund-raisers on his schedule to deflect 
criticism about the governor's refusal to debate his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lied," Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations for an Oct. 16 televised debate sponsored by the California 
Broadcasters Assn. collapsed last week when Wilson rejected a format favored by 
the broadcasters. He advanced his own alternative.

 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: State Treasurer Kathleen Brown took her demand for an 
election debate directly to Gov. Pete Wilson's office in Sacramento, but was 
told he was too busy doing his job to talk with her. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown will tour a Los Angeles aerospace facility today, 
talking about her plan to revive the economy in the basin. Wilson attends a 
$5,000-a-plate fund-raiser tonight in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced that she has agreed 
to three debate dates and called on Rep. Mike Huffington to do the same. 
Huffington's campaign, which has proposed one debate a week from now until the 
election, welcomed Feinstein's decision but stopped short of agreeing to 
specific dates. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Both Feinstein and Huffington are expected to remain in 
Washington for most of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTE

<P>
 A LIGHTER NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Tom McClintock, the former assemblyman who is running for state 
controller, has unveiled a new campaign poster that portrays him as "the 
cheapest man in California." The poster draws attention to McClintock's 
10-year-old suit ("Gray. Cotton-polyester blend. Cost $129."), his 5-year-old 
shoes ("Sensible black oxfords. Resoled."), his belt ("Reversible.") and the 
pen in his pocket ("Bic. Free with razor."). "Tom McClintock," it concludes. 
"He's got a list, a new Bic pen and an attitude."

MEDICINE / BREAST CANCER; RISK REDUCED BY EXERCISE, RESEARCHERS FIND; FOUR 
HOURS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY A WEEK CUTS DANGER LEVEL BY 58% FOR WOMEN UNDER 40, 
USC STUDY SHOWS. RESULTS ARE HAILED BY EXPERTS ON THE DISEASE, FOR WHICH THERE 
IS NO KNOWN PREVENTION. 
</P>

 In the first study designed to investigate whether physical activity can 
reduce the risk of breast cancer, researchers at USC's Norris Comprehensive 
Cancer Center have found that women of childbearing age who spend more than 
four hours a week exercising can cut their risk of the disease by nearly 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was limited to women under 40, who are generally less likely to be 
afflicted by the disease than older women. Nonetheless, experts hailed the work 
as another promising indication that lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A study like this is very encouraging because it does suggest an activity 
that may readily modify the risk of breast cancer, and there really are very 
few," Dr. Robert Smith, senior director of cancer treatment and prevention for 
the American Cancer Society, said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely exciting study," Dr. Susan M. Love, director of the UCLA 
Breast Center, told the Associated Press. "This is the kind of prevention we 
need. This is lifestyle changes instead of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 There is currently no proven method for preventing breast cancer, although 
researchers are looking into two possibilities: cutting dietary fat and taking 
the drug tamoxifen, a controversial step that would be used only for women at 
high risk. The disease is the leading cause of cancer in women, and is expected 
to afflict 182,000 American women this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC study, published in today's Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 
tracked 1,090 women, all age 40 or younger, all white, all residents of Los 
Angeles County. Half of them had newly diagnosed breast cancer when USC 
epidemiologists interviewed them in July, 1983. The other half served as 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers collected personal histories from the patients, asking 
questions about their exercise habits from the time they began menstruating to 
the year before the study began. They then followed the women for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers found that women who engaged in four or more hours of physical 
activity each week had a 58% lower breast cancer risk. Those who spent one to 
three hours a week exercising cut their risk by 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 The results do not come as a surprise to experts in the field. Rather, the 
research is "a well-conducted study that confirms what probably most of us 
would have believed," said Louise Brinton, chief of the environmental studies 
section of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous studies have suggested, although not as strongly as the USC study, 
that there is a link between physical activity and lower breast cancer rates. 
In 1981, for instance, Harvard researchers reported that female college-age 
athletes were less likely to develop breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts theorize that the link exists because exercise modifies a woman's 
menstrual cycle, often lengthening the cycle or halting ovulation altogether if 
the woman is extremely active. This lessens the woman's exposure to crucial 
hormones -- estrogen and possibly progesterone -- that are believed to play a 
role in breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the benefits of exercise extend to older women, particularly those 
past menopause, remains unclear. Since obesity is considered a risk factor for 
breast cancer in older women, some experts think exercise would be beneficial 
to women past menopause, if only to keep them slender. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein is currently conducting additional research among women aged 55 to 
64, and is hoping to answer two questions: whether being physically active 
during the childbearing years reduces the risk of breast cancer later in life, 
and whether exercise would protect women who begin exercising when they are 
past menopause.

SAN DIEGO OFFICIALS VOTE IMMIGRANT EMERGENCY; BORDER: COUNTY SUPERVISORS HOPE 
DECLARATION WILL PROMPT RELEASE OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF HANDLING 
ILLEGAL CROSSERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Board of Supervisors here voted Tuesday to declare a state of emergency 
due to the high cost of illegal immigration and to demand that President 
Clinton show the same concern for California as he has for Florida in repelling 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President darn well better stop treating California as a second-class 
citizen or he can kiss his reelection goodby," said Supervisor Brian Bilbray, 
who sponsored the declaration. "It's a no-brainer: California should get the 
same treatment as Florida." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 4 to 0 with one supervisor absent. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Gov. Pete Wilson said the governor will heartily endorse the 
supervisors' declaration and send a letter to Clinton asking that the county 
receive money from a fund set up by the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act 
for areas that are adversely impacted by immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton declares an emergency for San Diego County, the county would go to 
the top of the list for funding without having to compete with other counties 
for money. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor has written before to the President on immigration matters and 
even bought a full-page ad in the New York Times. In response, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton mocked Wilson and his letters during a recent campaign trip on behalf 
of the governor's reelection opponent, Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilbray and Wilson held a news conference last month in San Diego to decry 
Clinton's quickness to use military units to intercept rafters from Cuba while 
purportedly not giving the Border Patrol enough agents to seal the border with 
Mexico. In acting to use the Navy and Coast Guard, Clinton cited a state of 
emergency declared by Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County officials have complained for several years about the costs 
of illegal immigration, from providing health care to locking up illegal 
immigrants accused of crimes. The supervisors this spring sent a bill to the 
White House for $64 million, after Clinton made a remark during a televised 
town hall meeting suggesting that such a bill be sent. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency declaration was opposed by a variety of Latino rights, 
humanitarian and liberal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Anshell, an official with the Peace and Freedom Party's San Diego County 
Central Committee, said that "state-sponsored immigrant bashing" would only 
further the careers of politicians without solving the state's economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilbray, a Republican who represents the border area, is running for Congress 
against first-termer Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego) and is using his tough 
stand on illegal immigration as a major platform. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund in the 1986 Immigration Act that the county hopes to tap was recently 
allocated $74 million to cover the entire country. The supervisors have put the 
law enforcement costs alone for illegal immigration in San Diego County at more 
than $150 million.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; ARISTIDE: 'WE REMAIN VIGILANT'

 Statement released Tuesday by exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide: 
</P>
<P>
 The December 16, 1990, election was an expression of the sovereign will of the 
people of Haiti to choose democracy, the first step toward dignity and 
self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 36 months since the coup d'etat we have traveled with the people of 
Haiti back toward this democracy -- choosing a path that will not add to the 
5,000 murders already suffered, a path that will not lead toward greater 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 We must build a state of law so that there will be neither violence nor 
vengeance in our nation. That is why today we must remain committed to the 
agreements that we have signed, notably, the Governors Island agreement. 
Consistent with our constitution and approved by the United Nations and 
Organization of American States resolution, that agreement will lead us back to 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 We remain vigilant of the declaration of democracy expressed by the people of 
Haiti as, together with the people of Haiti, we move toward a new beginning.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; NORTHERN PORT RESIDENTS GREET U.S. TROOPS WITH GREAT 
HOPE; CARIBBEAN: MARINES WIDEN OPERATION, QUICKLY SEAL OFF AIRFIELD AND 
SEABOARD OF CAP HAITIEN.

<P>
 He came running in his bare feet, clad loosely in torn pastel, carrying a 
long, twisted wooden pole and, flapping in the light tropical breeze, the 
American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Along his path, dug in two men deep, U.S. Marines from 110 Bravo and 110 Fox 
companies watched the Haitian man nervously. They wore heavy armor and brown 
and green camouflage that covered their sweating bodies. They carried M-16 
rifles, and behind them Cobra attack helicopters and Army tanks bore witness to 
the might that is the U.S. armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the Haitian man stopped. He hoisted the flag skyward and shouted in 
French a word that any American would know: "Merci! Merci! Merci!"  
</P>
<P>
 Like a scene from a novel by Graham Greene, between 1,600 and 1,800 U.S. 
Marines aboard the amphibious helicopter assault ship Wasp landed Tuesday 
morning here at Haiti's second-largest city. Isolated in the northern reaches 
of this Caribbean nation, Cap Haitien is home to 65,000 people packed into 
thick green hillsides and into the stench-filled swampland where one might 
expect beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 After the initial landing of U.S. soldiers in the capital of Port-au-Prince on 
Monday, the Marines hitting Cap Haitien greatly widened the U.S. military's 
efforts at setting up peacekeeping in anticipation of Haiti's shift back toward 
democracy. There are now 6,500 American troops in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines took the city by sea and by air, quickly sealing off the airfield 
and the seaboard. They then set up a mile-long perimeter that kept Marines and 
Haitians separated by barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
 But the enthusiasm quickly spanned the man-made barricade. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians in large crowds -- families and children and grandparents -- rushed 
to the seaside to watch the advancing Marine landing crafts hover above the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 They crowded into alleyways, struck by the odd sight of Haitian military 
officers in khakis bicycling past American troops in combat harness. 
</P>
<P>
 They filled doorsteps and windows and rooftops, waving to Marines, giving 
praise to democracy and renouncing the local military regime that they said had 
beaten men, raped women and stomped this once-promising tourist resort into 
submission. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me? You want to know what is it like to me?" asked David St. Hilaire, 42, 
who hurried his wife and four children to the pier to watch the Americans. He 
is unskilled, unemployable, and he begs for food in the marketplace to feed his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw human rights coming to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Wilson, 26, in a faded swimsuit and a San Francisco 49ers T-shirt, 
pounded his fist on his leg. "We want our freedom back," he said, referring to 
the exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whose restoration is the goal of 
the U.S. operation in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But most looked away whenever a smirking Haitian soldier pedaled by. Many 
refused to give their names. Only the men would venture forward to talk to the 
Marines. Women kept far in the back of the surging crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 And some still questioned the wisdom of returning Aristide to the Haitian 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz Fratsite stood outside his tiny market, where a sign bearing his store's 
name, Marine Terrasse, had faded. Inside, there were only eight bottles of 
Pepsi. For two years, he has had no electricity, no water. He wanted $2 a piece 
for the sodas. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite his desperate situation, he is opposed to Aristide's return. He 
said the torture of the Haitian people was begun by Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 He shifted his California Angels baseball cap: "We don't want him back in 
power. No good. He's no good." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Marines, most of them in their early 20s, were touched by 
the outpouring of emotion that greeted them. 
</P>
<P>
 For six weeks, they had been holed up on the Wasp. They had come here from a 
training exercise in Okinawa, Japan, and have not been home in nearly nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, they had come within four hours of a hostile invasion of Haiti. 
But now they were coming as peacekeepers, and their emotions were strung tight 
from the sudden change in their mission. 
</P>
<P>
 But their commanders, including Col. Steve Hartley, head of Battalion Landing 
Team 2-2 and leader of Task Force Irish, made it clear that they would not 
permit any miscues in this delicate operation. No one was to shoot unless fired 
upon, the commanders said. And no one was to take civil control away from the 
local military. 
</P>
<P>
 And by late afternoon, there had been only a couple of incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no big deal," said Hartley. "Believe me, this has been no big deal." 
The Expanding U.S. Presence in Haiti 
</P>
<P>
 American troops entered a northern port city Tuesday in the second day of a 
massive U.S. military operation to restore Democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Port-au-Prince: Police firing tear gas beat up pro-Aristide demonstrators in 
front of arriving American troops. One Haitian demonstrator was apparently 
beaten to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap Haitien: 1,800 Marines secured the airfield and harbor in Haiti's 
second-largest city.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; NEW RESPECT FOR CEDRAS CONCERNS LEADERS IN CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a week ago, President Clinton described Haitian military leader 
Raoul Cedras as the head of a band of "armed thugs" responsible for murder, 
rape and other atrocities. Now, the U.S. government is treating Cedras with the 
deference due an allied commander. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden rehabilitation of Cedras, as a direct consequence of the deal that 
headed off a planned American invasion of Haiti, raises serious questions about 
the ultimate direction of U.S. policy toward the impoverished Caribbean nation 
and undercuts Clinton's own impassioned rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers from both parties voiced concern Tuesday over the developments. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the nation Thursday, Clinton detailed gruesome atrocities by 
the Haitian armed forces. "Let me be clear," the President said, "(Lt.) Gen. 
Cedras and his accomplices alone are responsible for this suffering and 
terrible human tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 But when former President Jimmy Carter led a team of negotiators in brokering 
an agreement in which Cedras agreed to resign his post by Oct. 15 and permit 
15,000 U.S. troops to land in Haiti without a fight, the U.S. attitude changed 
completely. Opening a White House news conference Monday, Clinton dropped all 
references to atrocities and even stopped referring to Cedras as a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.) said the reversal in the Clinton Administration's 
attitude "demonstrates the weakness" of Clinton's claim that an invasion of 
Haiti was justified by national security interests. But he added, "This is not 
the first time we've seen the demonizing of an opponent or a dictator only to 
end up having to deal with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) observed: "The President has immensely 
complicated the situation by the way he's proceeding here. Going on nationwide 
television and condemning Cedras as a thug and then saying that our generals 
are working with him and his police in a cooperative way . . . is confusing, to 
say the least." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), who supported Clinton's original plan to 
invade Haiti, also expressed doubts about the outcome of Carter's diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want Cedras and company to get out, and do it soon," Dodd said. "If this 
crowd stays around, it's going to be very difficult to restore a civilian 
government" 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who called upon Clinton to speed up Aristide's 
return so "we can begin dealing with the duly elected government of Haiti," 
added, "We shouldn't be dealing exclusively with Cedras and the military, as it 
now appears we are." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military leaders have begun meeting regularly with Cedras to discuss the 
maintenance of law and order -- by the same police and military that Clinton 
had accused of a "terrifying pattern" of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, conceded 
that the suddenly respectful treatment of Cedras was a potential source of 
embarrassment for the U.S. government if Cedras later reneges on his agreement 
to step down. But Shalikashvili said it was better to run that risk than to use 
military force to dislodge the Haitian dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 "For him to have been gone today, we most probably would have taken 
casualties, they certainly would have taken casualties," Shalikashvili said 
Tuesday. "And if we do it right and if we try not to create friction but, 
rather, try to maintain that cooperative spirit, I think that's one of our 
better guarantees to keep casualties low." 
</P>
<P>
 But other U.S. officials say the deal with Cedras upsets all of the 
Administration's plans for restoring democracy to Haiti. One official said the 
Administration had intended to "cleanse" the Haitian military by cutting its 
7,000-member strength in half and cashiering soldiers guilty of human rights 
abuses. But the Carter-Cedras deal makes that difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had gone in with force, we would have been in a position to dictate 
matters," the official said. "Now you have Jimmy Carter in the equation, and he 
has agreed to certain things."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; INVASION-READY BRIGADE NOW BIDES ITS TIME; MILITARY: 
CLINTON'S DECISION TO CHANGE MISSION LEFT SIGNAL UNIT SCRAMBLING FOR NEW 
ORDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a good thing the Army was not counting exclusively on its 35th Signal 
Brigade to make Haiti safe for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the 35th, like most of the U.S. forces preparing to invade Haiti, was 
whipsawed between readiness and anticlimax: On Sunday night, with some U.S. 
warplanes and paratroopers already in the air, a delegation led by former 
President Jimmy Carter reached an agreement with Haiti's military leaders that 
headed off the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 That turned the U.S. invasion force into an occupation force. Except for the 
35th, that is. After two aborted landing attempts, one caused by a thunderstorm 
and the other by mechanical failure, the 330 members of the 35th found 
themselves stuck Tuesday in this provincial town in the Dominican Republic, 
itching for action and increasingly frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer used baseball lingo to describe the way the Haiti invasion 
unfolded for the 35th Brigade as "a checked swing." 
</P>
<P>
 And more than the 35th was affected. With the 35th's officers and equipment 
sitting on a runway in this resort town, military communications inside Haiti 
were seriously deficient for the first 24 hours of the occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three days earlier, the 35th had been looking forward to a major role in 
the invasion. In a windowless building in the heart of Ft. Bragg, N.C., on 
Saturday afternoon, Col. James David Bryan called together the unit's officers 
for one last run-through of their marching orders. 
</P>
<P>
 For 2 1/2 hours, the brigade's staff pored over the complex details of their 
plans, months in the making, to rush 750 men, their vehicles and tons of 
high-tech gear to achieve their objective: establishing the main communications 
network of the military's joint command in Haiti overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four hours later, just as the first elements of the brigade were ready 
to move to their aircraft for the flight to Haiti, they received the order to 
stand down. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly became clear that Clinton's decision to halt the invasion had left 
military units scrambling to determine what their new missions would be, even 
though staff officers insisted that they had been working on contingency plans 
for a peaceful entry into Haiti since June. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the division and units scheduled to follow the paratroopers into Haiti 
found their roles changed radically. Commanders at Ft. Bragg had to switch to 
an alternate plan that called for a much smaller force led by the 10th Mountain 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Units from the division reached Haiti by helicopter early Monday from aircraft 
carriers off the Haitian coast. But for the officers and troops of the 35th 
Signal Brigade, as for many other units throughout the planned invasion force, 
Monday was a day of waiting and confusion. Thousands of troops at Ft. Bragg 
found themselves riding a giant military beast as it slowly changed direction, 
and they turned within for the stoic patience so often required to survive Army 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 In a battalion headquarters ready room, men from the 35th's 50th battalion 
were left in isolation, loaded down with all their gear, unsure of their 
status, and watching CNN on a big-screen television to see units of the 10th 
Mountain Division land in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess not knowing when or if we are going, that is the hard part," said 
Sgt. Chad Patton from Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to go or not go," added Lt. John Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Monday afternoon only a handful of officers and men from the 35th were 
on their way, aboard one of the first aircraft ferrying troops from Ft. Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Brian Hurley said that, after a series of hurried planning meetings, the 
brigade had cut back the size of its Haiti-bound force to about 250, down from 
the initial 750. 
</P>
<P>
 As they reorganized their unit, brigade commanders fretted about the equipment 
and vehicles they had already sent to cargo ships now waiting to dock in 
Port-au-Prince. Figuring out how to unload only the equipment designated for 
those units still headed for Haiti posed a fresh logistics nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since things have changed, what we have to do is try to put together a 
communications network with what we got going now," said Maj. Mark Mabima, a 
brigade spokesman.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; U.N. CHIEF BEGINS SEARCH TO REPLACE HAITI ENVOY WHO 
QUIT; DIPLOMACY: DANTE CAPUTO COMPLAINS ANGRILY ABOUT U.S. HIGHHANDEDNESS. HE 
SERVED IN POST FOR 22 MONTHS.

 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali launched a priority search Tuesday for 
a successor to the United Nations' chief Haiti envoy, who has resigned and 
criticized the United States for a "total absence of consultations" in 
last-minute negotiations to persuade Haiti's army leaders to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Caputo, who negotiated the 1993 Governors Island agreement on Haiti, 
asserted "the role of the United Nations has undergone an essential change" and 
that Washington had decided "to act unilaterally in the Haitian situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Caputo, a former Argentine foreign minister, in a letter released Monday by 
the United Nations, blamed the Clinton Administration for failing to even tell 
him of the weekend talks Haiti's generals had with former President Jimmy 
Carter, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn (D.-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
 "The total absence of consultations, and even of information from the 
government of the United States of America, makes me believe that this country, 
in fact, has taken the decision to act unilaterally in the Haitian process," 
Caputo said in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, in an interview in Argentina, he went further, asserting that the 
Administration had played into the hands of Haiti's military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just what he (Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian strongman) wanted -- 
to remain there and for U.S. rather than United Nations troops to land," he 
said. "Cedras will not budge, he will remain and is likely to lead a new 
political force in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the agreement forged by the team sent by President Clinton, 
Cedras must resign by Oct. 15 but is not obliged to leave Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, Boutros-Ghali accepted Caputo's resignation with 
regret. Officials close to the secretary general also made it clear that the 
United States had acted in accord with the Security Council mandate to return 
ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Negotiations did not have to be cleared or coordinated further," said a 
spokesman for the secretary general. "Clearly, Mr. Caputo felt he had not been 
included in this process, which was made into a bilateral process." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman stressed that, under the Security Council-approved resolution, 
it was unnecessary for the Administration to consult with the council during 
the weekend talks with Haiti's military junta. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman praised Caputo, saying, "He served for 22 months in one of the 
most difficult assignments imaginable, and he did it with great dedication." He 
declined to discuss the weekend agreement or to say when the secretary general 
was informed about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Caputo negotiated the Governors Island accord between Aristide and Cedras. 
Cedras quickly ignored the pact, which called for the junta to resign and 
Aristide to be returned. Later efforts by Caputo to implement the accord proved 
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Caputo, elected in 1988 for a term as General Assembly 
president, displeased some U.S. diplomats, expressing misgivings that the 
United States would make the United Nations responsible for managing a 
difficult occupation of Haiti and would depart as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats who spoke with Caputo after his letter was submitted said his 
resignation was expected. "He told me he has no role anymore," one envoy said. 
The diplomat said Caputo was not bitter but favored multilateral negotiations 
over Haiti's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, diplomats at the United Nations continued their wait-and-see 
attitude before lifting international sanctions against Haiti. U.S. officials 
said they were watching the situation closely, and other Security Council 
members indicated they were waiting for the Administration to introduce a 
resolution easing the embargo.

24 NATIONS ENDORSE DILUTED NUCLEAR SAFETY PACT; ENERGY: ACCORD REACHED AT 
MEETING OF U.N. WATCHDOG AGENCY IS STRIPPED OF ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. STILL, 
IT WINS PRAISE AS A FIRST STEP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At least two dozen nations endorsed an international convention on nuclear 
safety here Tuesday, but only after the accord was so watered down in the 
search for consensus that it contains virtually no means of enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to deter smuggling of nuclear materials also have run afoul of 
political and economic sensitivities at the annual general conference of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, which is expected to deflect the volatile 
trafficking issue to a panel of experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other international bodies navigating the turbulent political waters of 
the post-Cold War era, the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations has had to 
scale down objectives to guarantee broad-based agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia and Bulgaria -- home to some of the world's most hazardous nuclear 
plants -- were among the first countries to endorse the convention brokered by 
the IAEA and committing signatories to general principles of reactor safety and 
periodic performance reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 But the accord, originally aimed at extending Western safety practices to the 
aging and potentially dangerous reactors in the emerging democracies of Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union, was stripped in negotiations of any 
provisions giving the agency real power to inspect or close down substandard 
reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 It relies on a "peer review process" to assess the performance of 
participating countries on the basis of their own written evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the accord won praise as the first step toward creating an 
international safety umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first legal instrument to address directly the issue of safety of 
nuclear installations worldwide," said IAEA Director Hans Blix. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary noted that only five years ago, the 
concept of outside evaluations would not have gained general approval because 
of the mistrust that pervaded the world. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary acknowledged a need for Western consideration of the economic and 
social consequences that would result from forced shutdowns at reactors widely 
regarded as unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-reactor facility at Kozloduy, in Bulgaria, provides up to 40% of 
national electricity and employs 5,000 in an economically devastated country. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine, home of the Chernobyl plant that in 1986 was the scene of the world's 
worst nuclear disaster, has not signed the convention but has indicated to IAEA 
officials that it intends to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the seizure in Germany of four separate caches of smuggled plutonium 
and highly enriched uranium since May, Western nations have used the IAEA forum 
to press for more effective controls on the components of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 German authorities suspect that the materials they have seized from illegal 
traffickers came from poorly guarded facilities in the former Soviet Union. A 
German deputy minister for research and technology, Gebhard Ziller, appealed to 
the IAEA for urgent action to curb the black-market trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But that focus on Russia and Ukraine has ruffled political feathers at the 
IAEA, prompting O'Leary and Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov to 
play down the risks and diffuse the responsibility for smuggling incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be said there has been much speculation on this score, which at 
times is insulting to the Russian people," Mikhailov said of accusations he 
described as "provocation." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary suggested Monday that the international public had been unduly alarmed 
by "almost hysterical reporting" of the small-quantity trafficking arrests, but 
she conceded a day later that the nuclear agency should play a lead role in 
"policing and surveillance." 
</P>
<P>
 While the IAEA has no police powers, it has experience tracking nuclear 
material sources from its role as monitor of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Blix has proposed convening an international commission to examine control 
procedures at nuclear material sources and recommend ways in which they could 
be strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in three years, the IAEA general conference has been 
dominated by an issue other than North Korean intransigence on opening its 
nuclear plant doors to foreign inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The international standoff with North Korea persists, however, as Pyongyang 
stands accused of concealing stores of plutonium and barring international 
inspectors from two facilities thought to be engaged in production of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is negotiating with North Korea to gain access to the suspected 
weapons plants. A fresh round of talks is set for Friday in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea withdrew from the IAEA in June after the agency denounced the 
hard-line Communist country for violating safety and inspection agreements.

JAPAN MINISTER APPEASED BY CHANGE IN AIRLINE HIRING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation Minister Shizuka Kamei on Tuesday withdrew his objections to 
Japan Air Lines' hiring of contract flight attendants after JAL submitted a new 
plan to raise the level of cut-rate wages it will pay the new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamei's rejection in August of JAL's original plan to hire what are called 
"part-timers" had stirred a major flap over government intervention in private 
business. In Japan, part-time usually means working as many hours as 
full-status employees but with lower pay and no guarantee of continual 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamei's reversal Tuesday was expected to bolster the company's movement toward 
reducing full-status employees to pare wages that are now the highest in the 
advanced industrialized world, largely because of yen appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 The minister told a news conference that both JAL and Japan Air Systems have 
submitted new plans to raise wages for the contract workers to 75% of the rates 
that the airlines pay full-status employees, instead of only 50%. The two 
airlines also agreed to offer the contract workers the same insurance benefits 
that regular employees receive in case of air accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I highly evaluate the new plans, because they mean the airlines have followed 
our guidance," Kamei said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamei's announcement, nonetheless, was seen as a victory for business over 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Kamei claimed the part-timers would disrupt unity among crew 
members in dealing with crises that might occur in flight. But except for 
slightly higher pay and the insurance benefits, neither of the airlines offered 
major changes from their initial plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Both airlines' original plans limited the part-timers to employment for three 
years in principle, for example, and spokespersons for both said that had not 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the announcement, the third Japanese airline, All Nippon 
Airways, also was expected to start hiring contract flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the attendants involved are female. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, 20% of workers in the nation's labor force, according to the Labor 
Ministry, are hired on a "part-time" basis. Forty percent of all female workers 
lack full status as company employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor unions normally exclude part-timers from membership. 
</P>
<P>
 At JAL, an average attendant's wage of $80,000 year is about twice as high as 
pay for attendants on U.S. airlines, according to company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In its original plan, JAL set part-timers' annual wage at $20,000, or half the 
starting salary of a new full-status employee. Despite the low pay, 2,500 women 
applied for 100 cabin attendant posts that JAL was offering when Kamei 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Akira Terao of Japan Air Systems said the airline had not yet decided how much 
it will pay its new attendants. She did say, however, that JAS would hire only 
"part-timers" beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, the airplane was a high-class means of transportation. Now, it 
is a means of transportation for the general masses. . . . The path of the 
future will be lower prices and simplified service," Terao said. "I don't think 
you have to pay such high salaries."

CHILE'S PRESIDENT RESHUFFLES CABINET 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Eduardo Frei fired the top-ranking Socialist in his government 
Tuesday in a Cabinet reshuffle aimed at sharpening his much-criticized 
political team. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire 18-member Cabinet resigned at Frei's request early in the day to 
leave him free to form a new government after a series of political setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Frei replaced only four ministers, but they included Interior Minister German 
Correa, the highest-ranking Socialist in Chile's fractious coalition 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Correa was widely criticized for his handling of a political crisis in April 
when Frei demanded the resignation of Police Chief Gen. Rodolfo Stange over his 
alleged complicity in human rights abuses during the former military regime. 
Stange refused to step down and remains in the post.

U.S. JUDGES VOTE TO KEEP CAMERAS OUT OF FEDERAL COURT; JUDICIARY: PANEL MOVES 
TO END SUCCESSFUL PILOT PROJECT. THEIR DECISION BREAKS FROM A TREND IN MANY 
STATES TO TELEVISE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when television viewers have ready access to the drama of state 
court trials, the nation's top federal judges voted Tuesday to keep cameras out 
of federal courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a secret vote, the policy-making U.S. Judicial Conference rejected a 
recommendation that would have expanded to all courts a pilot project that 
allowed cameras at civil trials and appeals in eight courts. The judges also 
voted to keep an absolute ban on cameras at federal criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, a striking reminder of how much the federal judges cling to 
tradition, breaks from a trend in state courts to open their doors to 
television cameras and still photographers. An overwhelming majority of the 
states now allow televised coverage of some judicial proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They appear to have slammed the door on a very important experiment, which, 
if it had been expanded, would have benefited people throughout the country," 
said Timothy B. Dyk, a Washington lawyer who has been pushing to open federal 
courtrooms on behalf of news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges' vote snubs the millions of viewers who have turned TV trials into 
a pastime. Court TV, which has been on cable since 1991, has been wildly 
popular with its hour upon hour of legal proceedings. While Court TV plainly is 
a hit with sensational cases, such as the O.J. Simpson double-murder case, its 
staple is routine criminal trials from all corners of the country. Court TV 
inventor and CEO Steven Brill says the network educates viewers about the legal 
system as much as it entertains. 
</P>
<P>
 But judges have long worried that cameras would be disruptive and influence 
conduct of lawyers, judges, jurors and witnesses. The Simpson trial has 
generated debate over whether too much publicity can cost a defendant a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-judge conference, led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, did not 
make public any explanation of its vote. But spokesman David A. Sellers said 
Tuesday, "the tenor of concern was potential impact on jurors and witnesses, 
the view being that any negative impact could be a threat to the fair 
administration of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote against converting the three-year pilot project to a permanent 
venture was about 2 to 1, Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year pilot project included trial courts in Indiana, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington state. Participating appeals 
courts were the 2nd Circuit, based in New York, and the 9th Circuit, based in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Judicial Center, the courts' research arm, had considered the 
experiment a success. Earlier this year, it reported that the presence of 
cameras "did not disrupt court proceedings, affect participants in the 
proceedings or interfere with the administration of justice." Researchers 
acknowledged a "small number of participants" said cameras have negative 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Judicial Conference's committee studying the subject had recommended the 
experiment be made permanent. Under the proposed ground rules, any federal 
judge would have had the discretion to deny a request for television coverage. 
As it stands, the pilot program will end Dec. 31.

LAWMAKERS BLOCK PLAN FOR $3,473 CONGRESSIONAL PAY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawmakers voted Tuesday to block a $3,473 congressional pay increase that 
would have taken effect in January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 House and Senate negotiators restored language to an appropriations bill that 
will freeze the pay of rank-and-file lawmakers at $133,600.A small group of 
congressional leaders receive more. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress also skipped its raise for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The appropriations measure, which finances the Treasury Department and other 
agencies, must come before both houses for approval. But it is doubtful that 
lawmakers would reject the freeze and make the politically risky argument for a 
raise with the November election approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Ross Lightfoot (R-Iowa), who faces a tough reelection battle, had 
threatened to force a floor debate on the issue -- an embarrassment that now 
won't be necessary. "I am glad we raised the red flag," he said. "In my 
district, nobody I know gets a pay raise as big as Congress' automatic pay 
raise."

TOO MUCH FAT AND TV IN U.S. CHILDREN'S LIVES, REPORT SAYS; HEALTH: A MAGAZINE 
SURVEY ALSO FINDS THAT PARENTS SEEM TO BE AIDING YOUNGSTERS' BAD HABITS.

<P>
 American children still eat too much fat and sugar and, instead of working off 
the calories, watch enough TV to steal two months out of each year, a health 
survey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevention magazine says two-thirds of U.S. children fail its Children's 
Health Index, a measure of good health and safety released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Its most surprising finding was that parents appear to be slacking off in the 
nutrition battle even as their kids get fatter. 
</P>
<P>
 About 31% of children ages 3 to 17 are overweight, an increase of 29% since 
1984, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 50% of parents surveyed try to limit fat in their menus, down from 
64% in 1991. Only 49% fight sugar, down from 72%. Competing information on 
what's best to eat might be overwhelming parents, Prevention's Tom Dybdahl 
said. "Lots of people are feeling, 'I might just as well eat what I want.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But children also spend 912 hours a year watching television -- equal to two 
months of waking hours, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet parents report that 66% of children get 20 minutes of strenuous exercise 
at least three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, parents need to be educated about the difference between an active 
child, which is normal, and one who is physically fit," said Prevention 
managing editor Lewis Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the survey's other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * 41% of the families that own guns say the weapons are "just hidden away" and 
not locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only one-third of all children and 13% of teen-agers wear helmets while 
bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Index is based on a telephone survey of 424 parents by Princeton 
Survey Research Associates. It has an error margin of plus or minus 5 
percentage points.

CLINTON PLEDGES TO MAKE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MORE 'USER-FRIENDLY'

<P>
 President Clinton made some striking promises Tuesday: tax filing by phone, a 
repaired postal service, shorter waiting times at veterans hospitals and 
helpful people at federal agencies to get things done more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The promises are among a broad array of pledges in the government's new 
customer service standards.Clinton said that over the next few years they will 
make the federal government more user-friendly and demonstrate that service can 
be its hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Vice President Al Gore presented the new customer standards in a 
White House ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said the new standards will "force the government to respect the 
needs of ordinary Americans by requiring them to be treated as valued 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Under those standards, he said, there will be short time limits to answer 
mail, deal with applications, answer phone calls and accomplish the work of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards will build a new respect for government among the public "one 
customer at a time," Clinton said.

HALT TO HEALTH CARE ACTION FOR YEAR URGED; LEGISLATION: REP. DINGELL, A CLINTON 
ALLY, SAYS IT IS TIME TO GIVE REFORM 'A DECENT BURIAL.' MITCHELL MAY REASSESS 
CHANCES OF HIS MODEST BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of President Clinton's most powerful and influential congressional allies 
called upon him Tuesday to abandon the effort for the year, saying: "It is time 
to give health care reform a decent burial." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), which was made in a letter to the President, marked the first time 
that one of the stalwarts of the campaign has acknowledged publicly what has 
been obvious for weeks -- that the end is near. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) appeared to be 
preparing himself for the inevitable, although he was continuing his efforts to 
produce drastically scaled-back legislation with a bipartisan clique of 
senators who bill themselves as the "Mainstream Group." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said that in the next day or two, he plans to reassess the more 
modest bill's chances in light of increasingly strident GOP opposition and the 
defection of many of the groups that had supported the health effort to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe we should bring a bill up if there's certain defeat," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell cited statements by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and 
House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). During a meeting with Clinton on 
Tuesday, the two GOP leaders warned that if Democrats persisted in their 
efforts to produce a health bill, they risked losing international trade 
legislation as well. 
</P>
<P>
 While the comments raised the stakes, they also had the potential of putting 
Dole and Gingrich in the position of being blamed for the demise of health 
reform, if Congress' failure to produce legislation sparks a public backlash. 
Thus far, however, lawmakers say voters appear more relieved than alarmed at 
the apparent failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell's letter was particularly poignant, given his enormous emotional 
investment in the issue. Over a half-century ago, his father and predecessor in 
Congress helped write the first national health insurance legislation, and the 
younger Dingell has continued to introduce versions of that bill at the 
beginning of every Congress since he took his father's place in the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell's efforts to forge a compromise in his own committee were one of the 
early danger signs of how difficult Clinton's effort to overhaul the health 
care system would be. After months of struggle, Dingell finally threw in the 
towel. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I recognize that the Senate majority leader is still involved in 
efforts to craft health reform legislation, experience teaches clearly that the 
time has passed for consideration of any health reform measure this year," 
Dingell wrote. " . . . It is time for us to accept the fact that the health 
insurance industry, an assortment of small and large freeloaders, ideologues 
and their allies in the Congress have succeeded in their goal: preserving a 
status quo in which they prosper while millions of Americans suffer and our 
economy and competitiveness are made vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dole rejected the suggestion that special interests were responsible 
for the demise of the effort. He told reporters that it had been brought down 
by "the American people. . . . They did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dingell expressed hope for a "renewed effort to achieve meaningful 
reform next year," the November elections are likely to produce stronger 
Republican contingents in the House and Senate -- which is not conducive to the 
sort of legislation that Dingell would like to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and his allies are trying to agree on a bill that would make widely 
agreed upon changes in insurance practices, such as ending the practice of 
denying coverage to those who have poor health records, and would rely upon 
incentives and subsidies to cover up to 94% of the population, or about 9% more 
than have health insurance now. 
</P>
<P>
 However, consumer groups warn that it would also have the undesirable 
consequence of boosting health premiums overall. "The so-called Mainstream 
proposal would do more harm than good," said Gail Shearer, manager of policy 
analysis for Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort that Mitchell is leading is not the only one under way. A group of 
liberal senators is working on a plan aimed at expanding coverage of children 
and pregnant women, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) is also struggling to produce a modest plan.

CHEAPER, BETTER HEALTH PLAN SLATED FOR FEDERAL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SPENCER RICH and DAVID BROWN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when efforts to reform the nation's health system and cut its costs 
have all but collapsed on Capitol Hill, the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Program will expand benefits and cut average premiums for the 1995 benefit 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim King, director of the Office of Personnel Management, which runs the 
health insurance program for federal workers, retirees and their families, said 
Tuesday that the total average premium in 1995 will decrease by almost 
3.4%.Last year it increased by 3%. The average contribution by an enrollee for 
his or her portion of the premium will decrease by 1.1%, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, King announced four major changes in benefits: 
</P>
<P>
 * Starting immediately, all plans will be required to cover controversial 
high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone-marrow transplantation in the 
treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma, a benefit 
addition strongly sought by women's health advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lifetime maximum limits on mental health benefits in fee-for-service health 
plans will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 * All plans will cover childhood immunizations without deductibles or 
co-payments for the benefit itself, although the associated office visit might 
be subject to cost-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Opt-out" benefits will be offered by several prepaid HMO-type plans, 
allowing a patient to obtain treatment outside the plan's network and still 
receive reimbursement for part of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year or so, increases in premiums by insurers generally have 
continued to rise but at a slower pace than in previous years. But actual 
reductions in premiums are highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 OPM associate director Ed Flynn said insurers participating in the federal 
employee health plan, which insures 9 million people, have been able to slow 
down premium increases for 1995 partly by improving efficiency and cutting 
over-utilization of services.

 West Virginia sued 17 tobacco companies in an attempt to recover millions of 
dollars in health care costs and keep the companies from promoting cigarettes 
to minors. "For decades, the tobacco companies have gotten West Virginians 
hooked on their products, taken millions of dollars in profits back to their 
companies, and stuck West Virginia taxpayers with the bill for the medical care 
of people made sick by tobacco," said Atty. Gen. Darrell V. McGraw Jr. West 
Virginia spends at least $500 million a year for health care for 
tobacco-related illnesses, and has the highest smokeless tobacco consumption 
rate in the nation, McGraw said.

 A four-star admiral accused of mishandling a sexual harassment case won 
retirement at his full four-star rank Tuesday after four female senators 
withdrew their bid to open a new investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for a promise that the Senate would more closely examine military 
nominees, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) withdrew her amendment blocking the 
four-star retirement of Adm. Henry H. Mauz Jr., who was accused of being 
unresponsive to a sexual harassment case in his command. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate then voted 92 to 6 to accept President Clinton's proposal that Mauz 
retire at full four-star rank. Mauz, 58, now commanding the Navy fleet off 
Haiti, is retiring as commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet after 35 
years in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have come to the conclusion that the best use of my time and energy is not 
a single nomination, but on bringing about reform and change to the overall 
system," Murray said in explaining why she withdrew her amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, joined by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Carol Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.) 
and Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), wanted the Senate Armed Services Committee to 
investigate the allegations against Mauz instead of relying on internal reviews 
by the Pentagon and Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over Mauz's retirement marked the third time this year that the 
Senate scrutinized a senior Navy officer's handling of sexual harassment. It 
raised the issue of whether the Navy adequately investigates its own top brass, 
highlighted efforts by female senators to increase their influence and 
challenged the authority of the male-dominated Senate Armed Services Committee, 
which had voted 22 to 0 in favor of Mauz. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans complained that Murray was besmirching a highly decorated combat 
veteran for the sake of political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the Armed Services Committee chairman, said Mauz had 
responded aggressively and appropriately when he learned of the sexual 
harassment suffered by Lt. Darlene Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn conceded that "an assessment of the process by which the executive branch 
and the committee review both civil and military nominations is in order." Nunn 
said he would urge the committee and the Pentagon to propose improvements 
before the end of the year.

RELIGIOUS HARASSMENT RULES SHELVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Monday withdrew proposed 
regulations governing religious harassment in the workplace after a storm of 
protests from Congress and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rules were part of comprehensive guidelines governing workplace 
harassment that the commission voted 3-0 to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy arose a year ago when an Atlanta lawyer began advising 
business clients that they could avoid religious harassment lawsuits under the 
guidelines only by banning all religious expression in the workplace, including 
the wearing of a cross or a yarmulke. 
</P>
<P>
 Church groups quickly took up the cause, flooding the EEOC and congressional 
offices with thousands of letters and telephone calls. Mike Widomski, a 
spokesman for the EEOC, estimated that the commission received more than 
100,000 letters urging it to drop religion from the harassment guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 As originally drafted, the guidelines defined unlawful religious harassment as 
any verbal or physical conduct that "denigrates or shows hostility or aversion 
toward an individual because of his-her . . . religion . . . or that of his-her 
relatives, friends or associates." 
</P>
<P>
 EEOC spokesman Mike Widomski said the commission "felt it was better to 
withdraw the guidelines in light of the public outcry and the number of letters 
that were received." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), one of the leaders of congressional opposition to 
the guidelines, said that "this is certainly a victory for religious freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Senate approved a resolution by a 94-0 vote calling on the EEOC 
to drop religion from the proposed workplace harassment guidelines. A month 
later, the Senate inserted an amendment to fiscal 1995 spending legislation for 
the EEOC instructing the commission to remove religion from the proposed rules. 
</P>
<P>
 While the religious harassment rules sparked the controversy, the guidelines 
also were intended to address workplace harassment on the basis of race, color, 
sex, national origin, age or disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Widomski said the commission has no immediate plans to draft new guidelines.

 Months of strict water rationing ended for more than 700,000 residents of San 
Juan as heavy rains filled the capital city's primary water source for the 
first time in months. Rationing was halted at midday after three days of rain 
pushed water levels at Lake Carraizo to 40 1/4 yards. Forecasters said more 
than 4.5 inches of rain had fallen in the past 24 hours, forcing them to issue 
a flood watch for the eastern third of the Caribbean island.

 A protruding screw is being blamed for the loss last year of a $77-million 
weather satellite.The NOAA-13 satellite was launched Aug. 9, 1993, from 
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. It operated as expected for nearly two 
weeks until an electrical short-circuit developed and its signal was lost when 
the batteries were depleted. A 12-member investigating board concluded that a 
protruding screw was the most probable cause for that short. The satellites 
operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration orbit the Earth 
from pole to pole at an altitude of 540 miles.

STUDY FINDS MUSIC SOOTHES SURGEONS; MEDICINE: RESEARCHER SAYS PLAYING A 
DOCTOR'S SELECTIONS IN THE OPERATING ROOM LOWERS STRESS. SOME SAY SONGS HELP TO 
RELAX TENSIONS OR PICK UP THE PACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was an emergency appendectomy that taught Karen Allen her first lesson in 
the work habits of surgeons. As hospital orderlies wheeled her into the 
operating room, Allen, a University of Buffalo behavioral researcher who 
specializes in the study of stress, was startled to hear music -- a Mozart 
clarinet sonata, one of her favorite pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I live through this," she thought as she drifted off under anesthesia, "I 
want to study it." 
</P>
<P>
 So study it she did -- with intriguing results. 
</P>
<P>
 From Mozart to Madonna, Beethoven to the Beatles, Allen has found that music 
may help surgeons perform better in the operating room by keeping their stress 
levels down. And the type of music -- classical, jazz, rock 'n' roll, rap -- 
makes no difference, she said, so long as the tunes are of the surgeon's own 
choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's study, published in today's issue of the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn., is apparently the first to document the effects of music on 
surgeons. While patients might not like the idea of a knife-wielding doctor 
boogieing to the strains, say, of 10,000 Maniacs, the study's findings come as 
little surprise to those who make their living repairing the human body. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, music is so much in demand in the operating room that surgeons, nurses 
and anesthesiologists often spend time debating just who gets to control the 
dial. The surgeon, true to the stereotype of the hard-driving profession, 
usually prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 But not always, says Dr. James Piper, director of liver transplants at the 
University of Chicago Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trained at the University of Iowa, and the head nurse there banned music in 
the ORs and it was terrible," Piper said. "As soon as I left there the first 
thing I did was buy myself a CD boombox-type thing and I've been playing music 
in the OR ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 While he sometimes gives in to scrub nurses who request jazz, Piper is a rock 
'n' roll oldies man, preferring to slice and stitch to the beat of Billy Joel, 
Genesis, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
 While not all surgeons listen to music -- some insist on quiet -- those who do 
said in interviews that it relaxes them, and helps pick up the pace when an 
operation grows monotonous. At Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, Dr. Corey 
Raffel, a pediatric neurosurgeon who is a fan of the Eagles, Cream and Eric 
Clapton, says he turns off the music when he is "in the meat of a difficult 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 But he is rarely without tunes at the end of an operation, when the surgical 
team is tired and all that is left to do is sew the patient up. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when we listen to Led Zeppelin," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 While previous research has shown that music can be used to relax patients, 
Allen says no one before her has looked at whether the same is true of 
surgeons. For her study, she enlisted 50 male doctors -- she did not intend to 
exclude women, she said, but only men volunteered -- all of whom listen to 
music during surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 She put them in a laboratory and asked them to perform difficult mental 
arithmetic problems out loud, a standard technique for measuring stress. The 
doctors were asked, for instance, to begin counting backward, at intervals of 
13, 17 or 23, beginning with a six-digit number. 
</P>
<P>
 Each surgeon was hooked up to monitors that measure physiological indicators 
of stress -- blood pressure, pulse rate and sweating. While they were being 
monitored, the surgeons performed the arithmetic twice under three conditions 
-- once while listening to music they selected; once while listening to 
Pachelbel's Canon in D, which is often used in commercial stress reduction 
tapes, and once during silence. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors ranged in age from 31 to 61. All but four picked classical music 
-- Vivaldi, Allen said, was especially popular. Other surgeons say they find 
classical music distracting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how it goes real quiet and then, ba ba ba boom!" said Dr. Susan 
Downey, a plastic surgeon and colleague of Raffel's at Childrens Hospital. 
"Classical is not good to listen to in the OR." Most of the surgeons she knows, 
she says, listen to soft rock or country, but one listens to talk radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining four doctors in Allen's study, two listened to jazz and one 
chose Celtic harp music. The rowdiest selection was James Galway and the 
Chieftans playing Irish folk music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular thing is so noisy," Allen said, "I don't know as I'd want to 
play it in surgery. People are just whooping it up, the tin whistles are going, 
the drums are beating. It's like you're at a block party." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the board, Allen found that the doctors' performance -- as measured by 
the accuracy and speed with which they completed the math problems -- was 
better when they were listening to music they picked. Blood pressure, pulse and 
sweating were lower. She said the study confirms the importance of a doctors' 
own musical tastes, no matter what they are. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the average pulse rate while doing the arithmetic was 78 beats 
per minute if the surgeon selected his own music, compared to 100 during the 
soothing sounds of Pachelbel and without music. Blood pressure rose 
significantly during silence, to a state of borderline hypertension -- an 
average of 140/100. 
</P>
<P>
 "The silence was the worst," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper, the liver transplant surgeon in Chicago, agreed. "Liver transplants 
take five to six hours," he said, "and there's nothing worse than five hours of 
dead quiet."

2 DOZEN ARRESTED IN SNAKE POACHING STING; CRIME: FISH AND GAME OFFICIALS RAID 
11 COUNTIES, CHARGING 13 PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ILLEGAL SALES IN THE 
STATE REACH $100 MILLION A YEAR, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 Nearly two dozen people, including 13 in Southern California, were arrested 
Tuesday on charges of snake poaching, the result of a sting operation by state 
game wardens investigating the state's $100-million annual black market in live 
wildlife, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation, which was called Operation Ranching for Reptiles and culminated 
in raids in 11 California counties, had been aimed at the illegal sale of fish 
and wildlife native to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jerry Spansail, spokesman for the Department of Fish and Game, said more 
than 2,000 illegally obtained reptiles were confiscated in the sweep, including 
about 800 poached snakes seized from a single breeder in Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poaching of native wildlife is a runaway cottage industry in California that 
threatens our wildlife resources," said Lt. Eddie Watkins, who runs the 
department's special operations unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this operation, we targeted some of the major players who've made a 
commercial enterprise out of catching, breeding and selling thousands of 
reptiles to collectors throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Fish and Game officials have long been concerned about the 
underground traffic in wildlife and reptiles in particular. One reptile dealer 
is believed to have made $60,000 a year sacking snakes and selling them to 
collectors on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 As snake collecting has become more popular as a hobby, demand for rare and 
unusual-looking reptiles such as the San Diego mountain king snake has soared, 
authorities say. Fish and Game Director Boyd Gibbons said black market reptile 
dealers can make up to $2,000 a night just by trawling back roads for snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature created the Department of Fish and Game's special operations 
unit in the mid-1980s to address the problem. State law allows collectors with 
fishing licenses to capture two snakes of a given species, but it is a 
misdemeanor to buy or sell native species of reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poachers are hammering California wildlife," Gibbons said. "They're taking 
enormous numbers of deer, bear, abalone, lobsters, crabs, birds and snakes. No 
species escapes the poachers. They don't care about the animals they kill -- 
they're only driven by money." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's sting was the result of a two-year investigation conducted from a 
storefront in Temecula, authorities said. The phony business, named Temecula 
Reptilia, attracted reptile poachers and collectors seeking to do business on 
the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation, which focused on Southern California, netted 13 suspects in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Most of the animals 
seized were rosy boas, a species of snake that sells on the black market for up 
to $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seized were a dozen California rattlesnakes, a venomous Gila monster, a 
piranha, an opossum, snapping turtles and prohibited, non-native fish, 
including a longnose gar and a snakeshead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals were trucked to a Department of Fish and Game base in Chino, where 
they are being held.

COURT REJECTS FILIPINOS' BID FOR U.S. CITIZENSHIP

<P>
 A federal appeals court Tuesday rejected a claim of U.S. citizenship by people 
born in the Philippines before the islands gained independence in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that natives of a U.S. 
territory do not meet the standard of the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which 
guarantees citizenship to "all persons born . . . in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by seven Filipinos who faced deportation proceedings in 
Hawaii, potentially affects large numbers of middle-aged and elderly residents 
of the Philippines, said attorney Ronald Oldenberg. He said he would appeal the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Other federal courts have uniformly rejected claims of U.S. citizenship by 
natives of the Philippines during territorial status, from 1898, when the 
United States bought the islands from Spain after the Spanish-American War, to 
July 4, 1946. But Oldenberg said previous cases have not raised the same 
constitutional argument or attacked a series of Supreme Court rulings from 
early this century on application of the Constitution to territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Those decisions, known as the Insular Cases, found that constitutional 
guarantees applied in full only to territories that were singled out by 
Congress as destined for statehood. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority in Tuesday's ruling, led by Judge Thomas Tang, interpreted one 
Insular Case in 1900 as concluding that the 14th Amendment did not apply to 
territories like the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, Tang said, natives of the territorial Philippines are not 
U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissenting Judge Harry Pregerson disagreed with the majority's reading of the 
case and also said its status as a precedent was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Insular Cases are a product of their time, a time when even the Supreme 
Court based its decisions, in part, on fears of other races," Pregerson said. 
He quoted the author of the 1900 ruling as saying racial differences were among 
the difficulties Congress must face in annexing different territories.

RESCUER DRIVES 65 MILES IN FUTILE HOSPITAL SEARCH

<P>
 Authorities are continuing to sort out a bizarre traffic fatality in which a 
woman was struck by a tractor-trailer, then driven 65 miles by a passing 
Japanese tourist in a futile search for a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a really bizarre incident," Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Steve 
Harney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harney said the victim was believed to be from Los Angeles based on her car 
registration. He said fingerprints were being sent from California in an effort 
to identify the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman had been trying to push her disabled vehicle off Interstate 15 
before dawn Monday when a car struck her vehicle. She fled into the path of a 
tractor-trailer, suffering a crushed chest and massive head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 A passing Japanese tourist picked up the victim and headed for the bright 
lights of a cluster of hotel-casinos at the California-Nevada state line, 50 
miles southwest of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to find a hospital, the good Samaritan drove back to Las Vegas with the 
victim strapped in the front seat, Harney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourist, Akila Tanaka of Tokyo, happened on the scene after the truck 
driver stopped to call authorities, checked on the victim and was setting out 
warning devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanaka left his passenger at the scene of the crash and put the injured woman 
in his car, Harney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanaka drove 15 miles south to the hotel-casinos, only to find that there was 
no hospital. He then reversed directions and drove 50 miles to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped at a motel in Las Vegas and authorities were called. The woman was 
pronounced dead when authorities arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on everything we've seen, she probably would have died anyway," Harney 
said Tuesday. "The man tried to do what was right. You have to give him credit; 
he tried to do something. He was just trying to get her to the nearest 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 Harney said no charges would be filed in the case.

HUFFINGTON GETS PERSONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican U.S. Senate challenger Mike Huffington released two new television 
commercials recently that are on the air statewide. The ads make no mention of 
his Democratic opponent, Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE HUFFINGTON ADS: The 60-second version of Huffington's ad begins with 
video from several of California's natural disasters -- the Malibu fire, the 
Northridge earthquake and floods. A narrator's voice says: "The recent years 
have tested the will of the men and women who make California great -- the 
ranchers, the farmers, the teachers, the factory workers and small business 
owners. And while nearly 1 million people packed up and moved away, Mike 
Huffington and his wife came back to the state that educated him and is the 
birthplace of their two daughters." Huffington is then pictured, speaking to 
the camera about a need for "new solutions to old problems." A narrator says 
Huffington voted against tax increases and then Huffington speaks to the 
camera: "It was easy. The government didn't earn that money, the people did." 
The commercial ends with the line: "This election isn't just about who you'll 
send to Washington next year, it's about our children and their future." The 
30-second version of the ad contains the same message with some elements 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Polls show that more than half of the state's voters say they 
do not know much about Huffington. As a result, his campaign hopes to introduce 
the candidate and his family as well as to establish his connections to 
California and his recognition of the state's problems. Part of the commercial 
seeks to counter the criticism that Huffington does not understand California 
because he moved to the state in 1991. The ad refers to Huffington's previous 
residence in California when he attended Stanford University. Huffington has 
also campaigned against higher taxes, noting that he opposed President 
Clinton's 1993 economic package which included a higher levy on upper-income 
individuals and Social Security recipients as well as a general gasoline tax.

ASTEROID'S MOON IS CHRISTENED 'DACTYL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mile-wide moon orbiting the asteroid Ida between Earth and Jupiter has been 
given the name Dactyl, NASA said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dactyl was discovered in March when astronomers analyzed data collected by the 
Galileo space probe as it flew by Ida on its way to Jupiter, the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moon, about one mile across, is the first natural satellite of an asteroid 
ever discovered and photographed, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The name is derived from the Dactyli, mythological beings who lived on Mt. 
Ida, where the infant god Zeus was hidden by the nymph Ida, the agency said.

OSHA OPENS HEARINGS ON WORKPLACE SMOKE BAN; SAFETY: MONTHS-LONG SESSION WILL 
REVIEW PLAN TO END ALMOST ALL INDOOR TOBACCO USE AROUND EMPLOYEES. HUNDREDS 
HAVE SIGNED UP TO TESTIFY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a witness list that includes organizations from nearly every walk of 
American life, federal work safety officials opened a marathon hearing Tuesday 
on a proposal to ban smoking in virtually all workplaces, including restaurants 
and bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal officials have waged a broad assault on smoking and tobacco 
over the past year, the hearing by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration should provide the widest-ranging government forum yet for 
debating the effects of secondhand smoke. More than 350 speakers are to testify 
before the hearing concludes in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening day provided a glimpse of things to come as Ted Grossman, a lawyer 
for tobacco company R.J. Reynolds Co., told members of the OSHA panel that 
under his interpretation of the proposed rule, "a judge all alone in his 
chambers, reading a book, couldn't light a pipe, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Martonik, OSHA acting director of health standards programs, answered 
"yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The witness list, in addition to representatives of the tobacco and 
anti-smoking lobbies, includes a casino association, beverage groups, a carpet 
and rug institute, a postal workers' union, an air traffic controller group and 
the Refrigeration Service Engineers' Society. The OSHA rule would confine 
smoking in the workplace to enclosed, ventilated areas. Employers would be 
required to develop written indoor air quality plans, which would be enforced 
by OSHA inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "OSHA's decision to develop rules on indoor air quality -- including rules 
affecting environmental tobacco smoke -- flows directly from our duty, our 
statutory responsibility, to protect the right of American workers to a safe 
and healthy workplace," said Michael Silverstein, OSHA director of policy, as 
he opened the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 OSHA is the branch of the Labor Department charged with protecting the safety 
of the nation's workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco advocates are sounding alarms over the rule, which they claim is too 
restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only possible way to make this plan work is to create a heated, 
ventilated chamber where no business can be conducted, no drink or food can be 
served," said Tom Lauria, assistant to the president of the Tobacco Institute 
in Washington. Lauria said most businesses would opt to ban smoking in their 
buildings rather than spend the money to create a smoking room. 
</P>
<P>
 The national attempts at a ban come on the heels of a new workplace 
anti-smoking law in California. Gov. Pete Wilson signed a tough smoking ban to 
take effect Jan. 1 unless California voters approve a pro-tobacco initiative 
sponsored by Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 OSHA isn't likely to have an easy ride if it is to endorse its plan after the 
hearing ends. The tobacco lobby is expected to challenge the rule in the 
courts, which could hold up execution of the rule for years. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of health groups that includes the American Lung Assn. and the 
American Cancer Society endorsed the plan, pointing to statistics that list 
"involuntary smoking" as the third-largest cause of premature death. 
</P>
<P>
 While the OSHA proposal specifically cites tobacco smoke as a prime source of 
indoor air pollution, it also makes mention of paints and solvents. A 
preliminary OSHA review showed "indoor air pollution" causes a significant 
level of preventable disease in workers, Martonik said.

SYNAR LOSES IN CLOSE OKLAHOMA PRIMARY; ELECTIONS: VOTERS EJECT INCUMBENT 
CONGRESSMAN, OK TERM LIMITS. ELSEWHERE, GOP PICKS CANDIDATES TO OPPOSE SEN. 
KENNEDY, HOUSE SPEAKER FOLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a stunning upset, Oklahoma Rep. Mike Synar lost a Democratic runoff Tuesday 
to a little-known retired school principal, becoming the third incumbent this 
year to lose a congressional primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts' primary, W. Mitt Romney, son of former Michigan Gov. George 
Romney, easily won the GOP nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy. State Rep. Mark Roosevelt, a great-grandson of Theodore Roosevelt, 
defeated two candidates for the right to challenge popular GOP Gov. William F. 
Weld. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Oklahoma voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to limit 
U.S. representatives to three two-year terms and senators to two six-year 
terms. And Lt. Gov. Jack Mildren won a Democratic runoff for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington state, voters chose candidates to challenge GOP Sen. Slade 
Gorton and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma's 2nd district, Virgil Cooper had 47,798 votes, or 51%, to 45,189 
votes, or 49%, for Synar with 100% of precincts reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper acknowledged that some of his votes were protests against Synar, who 
has been criticized in his rural northeastern Oklahoma district of ranchers and 
farmers for supporting many of President Clinton's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would grab your hand and you would tell them you're running against 
Mike Synar. They would say 'You've got my vote,' " Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Synar, an eight-term congressman, was forced into the runoff after failing to 
get a majority of the vote in the Aug. 23 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The other House Democrats defeated in primaries this year were Reps. Craig 
Washington of Houston and Lucien E. Blackwell of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper will face Republican Tom Coburn, a Muskogee, Okla., doctor, in the Nov. 
8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Massachusetts' GOP Senate primary, Romney had 102,129 votes, or 82%, to 
22,046, or 18%, for fellow millionaire businessman John Lakian, with 55% of 
precincts reporting. Kennedy had no primary opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP officials believe they have a chance of ousting Kennedy with the 
47-year-old Romney, who has never held elected office. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls showed many voters think the 62-year-old Kennedy, the 
fourth-longest serving member of the Senate, has been in office too long. He 
was first elected in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Romney told cheering supporters that his next campaign stop would be the U.S. 
Senate, and Kennedy declared he was ready for battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very clear idea of where I stand, what I believe in," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic gubernatorial primary, Roosevelt had 109,449 votes, or 48%; 
former state Sen. George Bachrach had 59,778 votes, or 26%, and state Sen. 
Michael Barrett had 56,665 votes, or 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oklahoma's Democratic gubernatorial runoff, Mildren defeated state Sen. 
Bernice Shedrick by a margin of 59% to 41% with 100% of precincts reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildren, a former star quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners, will face 
Republican Frank Keating, a former Justice Department official, and independent 
Wes Watkins, a former congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma's term limits measure passed by a margin of 67% to 33% with all 
precincts reporting.

ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT BESET BY WOES, ON WANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With prominent groups like the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and the Wilderness 
Society facing sharp declines in membership and revenue as well as waning 
political influence, the environmental movement is struggling to recapture the 
momentum that made it one of the strongest forces in the nation over the past 
quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Few in the movement agree on a strategy for resuscitation. As they grope for 
solutions, some fear that their cause may have become so much a part of the 
American mainstream that many people no longer believe that it merits special 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook is gloomy despite some smaller success stories. Several regional 
groups who have built nationwide constituencies on behalf of specific forests 
or canyons continue to hold their own. And at least one innovative national 
organization has grown as it looks for ways to curb pollution that minimize 
costs and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a time when the movement was expected to prosper -- just two years 
after the election of its first White House ally in more than a decade -- most 
major organizations are groping for a vision that will replenish revenue, 
reunify members and inspire the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A deficit of several million dollars has put the Sierra Club, the nation's 
oldest environmental organization, in its worst financial shape in 20 years, 
said Carl Pope, the club's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to do all we can, and that will mean some cutting back, some 
restructuring, to avoid a crisis," Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the Sierra Club's paid membership has dropped to 8,300 
members from about 10,000 three years ago, said local Chairman Diana Berry. 
Turnout at meetings and at campaigns such as saving Laguna Canyon remains the 
same, she said, but contributions are not. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still around. They just are not supporting us financially as they 
had been. People are just as concerned as they always have been about 
environmental issues. It is just that they feel they have more personally 
pressing financial concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Greenpeace, a group that got its start in the early 1970s trying 
to block nuclear weapons tests, say membership is down nearly 1 million from 
its 1990 high of 2.5 million, and its revenues are off by a third. A 30% 
decline in membership during the same period has forced the Wilderness Society 
to close offices and lay off employees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that many of these groups are hobbled by layoffs and reduced 
budgets, they are trying to rebound from a dismal performance in Washington. Up 
against well-organized opponents, the environmental movement has not been able 
to pass a single piece of major legislation in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostile forces in Congress have succeeded in bottling up bills that would 
grant Cabinet status to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, strengthen 
the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Endangered Species Act 
and put more teeth in mining regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain of downsizing is aggravated by fierce infighting within the movement 
over the cause of its problems. Fund-raisers cite the recession and the 
public's preoccupation with crime and financial security. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Craver, an executive of a firm that raises money for several major 
environmental organizations, said the movement has lost support because "it has 
failed to demonstrate convincingly that its goals are compatible with the 
economic needs of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 With a friendly Administration in Washington, environmentalists are having to 
learn an age-old lesson of reform politics. Social movements often have more 
energy when they are out of power than when they are in. The environmental 
movement was never bigger or better funded than during the 1980s when it was on 
the outs, doing battle with two conservative Republican administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 For old hands in the movement, the turnabout in fortunes has been 
breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my years I have never before seen such apathy," said Liz Frenkel, a 
Sierra Club official in Oregon who has been an activist with the club since 
1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups, such as the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources 
Defense Council and the Audubon Society are hoping to compensate for declining 
membership by relying more heavily on foundation support, wealthy donors, 
celebrity performances and novel marketing schemes. This year, for instance, 
singer James Taylor is giving a portion of his concert receipts to the NRDC. In 
a joint venture with a stuffed animal manufacturer, the Audubon Society is 
offering free memberships to anyone who buys a teddy bear named Nature Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, public opinion polls have routinely found that fewer than 
5% of Americans think that the environment is one of the nation's pressing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 And although most Americans still think of themselves as environmentalists, 
said Washington-based pollster Celinda Lake, "not so many are inclined to 
identify with the environmental movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the changes in attitude, some analysts argue that the movement 
has become a victim of its past success. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have brought the environment into their lives to such an extent 
through recycling or buying green products, many no doubt feel they are doing 
their bit and don't need to do any more," said Jack Murray of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us got into this movement fighting faceless bureaucrats . . . who 
were hellbent on destroying some beautiful place," said Dennis Hayes, one of 
the architects of the first Earth Day 24 years ago, who now runs a foundation 
that gives $500,000 annually to environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, if you ask a typical American to name a bureaucrat, he'll point to 
someone in some environmental agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Among environmental groups, the Sierra Club may be the best example of 
bureaucratic heft. 
</P>
<P>
 With its $40-million annual budget, its Washington lobby and legal arm, its 
$6-million book business and $3-million worldwide eco-tourism operation, the 
Sierra Club looks more like a holding company than a society of nature lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you want to ask: Will the real Sierra Club stand up?" said 
Priscilla Feral, an animal rights advocate who tangled with the organization 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Feral said she felt betrayed when the club refused to join a boycott of 
Alaskan tourism spearheaded by her group, Friends of Animals, to protest the 
state's decision to allow the trapping of wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of joining the boycott, the Sierra Club took out a full-page ad in the 
New York Times, encouraging people to travel to Alaska and learn about the wolf 
issue firsthand. Club officials argued that exposing people to the wilds tended 
to make them wilderness advocates. But Feral accused club officials of allowing 
business interests to dictate environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's decision also reflected the complicated task of trying to satisfy a 
huge membership with widely varying views. Although many members favored the 
boycott, the club deferred to its Anchorage chapter, which opposed the boycott 
because it did not want to penalize local outfitters and guides who opposed the 
wolf kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy highlighted a developing rift within the movement over the 
impact that environmental policies have on the lives of working people -- from 
farmers and ranchers to wilderness guides and outfitters. 
</P>
<P>
 James Connor, a former head of the Montana chapter of the Sierra Club, quit 
the organization after it endorsed one of the most sweeping wilderness bills 
ever proposed in Congress. The bill, unsuccessful so far, would put a 
35-million-acre, five-state swath of wilderness off limits to any economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got involved in the environmental movement because I thought it was in the 
enlightened self-interest of humankind," Connor said. "But I'm not in tune with 
what is going on now. Something snapped. People in the movement have lost faith 
in humankind. They have retreated into utopian fantasies, become 100% 
environmentally correct and 100% politically impotent." 
</P>
<P>
 Connor argued that environmental extremism has played into the hands of 
political opponents who repeatedly depict groups such as the Sierra Club as 
enemies of working people. A broad alliance of rural landowners, suburban real 
estate developers and big-city industrial interests, the opposition has 
combined populist rhetoric with corporate contributions to repeatedly beat back 
environmental initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Craver, the movement's fundraiser, agreed. "The groups have not been good at 
responding to the jobs-versus-nature rhetoric that you hear in so many rural 
areas, and it has hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not every environmental organization is suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Defense Fund, which searches for market-based solutions to 
environmental problems, has grown from 100,000 members in 1990 to about 250,000 
today, while its budget has increased just over 20%, to $22 million, said Joel 
Plagenz, its director of public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The EDF helped draft provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act that reward 
companies that comply with clean air standards by allowing them to sell 
pollution "credits" to firms not meeting the requirements. The group is working 
on a proposal to offer financial incentives to property owners to set aside 
land that is home to endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some environmental hard-liners have made gains, particularly in places 
where ecological degradation has been the most conspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1,500 members scattered across the country and a $2-million budget, 
Oregon's Native Forest Council broke ranks with the mainstream movement when it 
called for prohibiting all commercial logging in the Northwest's ancient 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cut through the fog of rhetoric with a simple solution that appealed to a 
lot of people," said Victor Rozek, one of two ex-Sierra Club members who 
founded the group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hard-liners also are contributing to the rural backlash, and the 
voices of dispossessed loggers and ranchers are the ones being heard in 
Washington these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion that rural people are under siege by a bunch of yuppies is taken 
quite seriously in a lot of small towns in this country," said Andy Kerr, an 
early leader of the campaign to protect old-growth forests in the Northwest. "A 
lot of environmental groups are learning that these places have a surprising 
amount of political influence, but they don't know what to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr thinks he does. Last winter, he moved his family from Portland to Joseph, 
Ore., a small logging town where residents blamed a recent sawmill closure on 
environmentalists such as Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we start knocking on doors and getting involved in local issues, 
showing people their concerns are our concerns, we're not going to get very 
far," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington and in the offices of the nation's largest environmental 
groups, some people are more concerned about making peace within the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sierra Club, officials are so concerned about internal hostilities that 
they have threatened to cut off computer access to members who uses electronic 
mail to vilify their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to wake up in the morning knowing who the enemy was and how to face 
him," said Pope. "All too often lately, we seem to be treating each other like 
the enemy." 
</P>

 BOOK LOVERS: Got any old Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew books in the attic? Or 
perhaps a 1904 Bobbsey Twins first edition? Collectors by the hundred are 
expected at a Series Book Collectors Convention beginning Thursday that 
highlights a publishing phenom popular with youngsters for almost a century. 
(E1) . . . Among those expected: actor Frank Thomas, who played Nancy Drew's 
boyfriend opposite Bonita Granville's Nancy in four movies in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 PRICE OF DEATH: Maybe you can't put a value on human life, but county 
officials have affixed a price to the task of transporting the dead. . . . On 
Tuesday, the county agreed to pay two mortuary firms to take bodies from crime 
scenes and other locations to the coroner's office for $66 each. In all, the 
county expects to pay up to $170,000 a year for transportation of bodies.

 BACKTALK: Richard Nixon is the only recent Republican president spared any 
barbs in Robert McFarlane's new book, "Special Trust." The former national 
security adviser accuses both Ronald Reagan and George Bush of deceiving the 
public on the Iran-Contra affair in 1985. . . . McFarlane will speak on his 
book Oct. 17 at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda. "It's a chance for 
Republicans to ask him some hard questions," says library spokesman Kevin 
Cartwright.

<P>
 IN THE DOGHOUSE: Newport-Mesa Unified School District trustees got an earful 
recently before giving an initial OK to using drug-sniffing police dogs on high 
school campuses. . . . Estancia High School teacher Paul Fitzgerald decried the 
potential loss of students' rights. But Costa Mesa High School PTA President 
Kathy Koenig said her group supports using dogs. "The PTA has always been known 
as the punch and cookies people," she joked. "From now on, we want to be known 
as the Milk Bone and water dish people." Final approval is expected next month.

VICTIM HELD ANIMOSITY ONLY AGAINST PREJUDICE; PROFILE: FRIENDS SAY VERNON 
FLOURNOY WAS WILLING TO FIGHT OVER RACIAL INSULTS. IT MAY HAVE COST O.C. BLACK 
HIS LIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 Vernon Flournoy's parents brought their 10 children up to believe that people 
were just people. There was no such thing as race. Color didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in East Los Angeles and later living in Seattle, there was only one 
thing the quiet, serious Flournoy couldn't abide: "rude remarks, especially 
racial things," said his sister, 53-year-old Betty Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always said that our parents taught us when we were growing up that 
everyone is the same," Lewis recalled from her Ridgecrest, Calif., home. "Then 
you grow up and you find out that it isn't that way. I think he always had a 
hard time dealing with that." 
</P>
<P>
 If someone on the street gave him trouble because he was black, a dozen 
friends and relatives unanimously agreed Tuesday, Flournoy wouldn't have backed 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said if someone does something racial directed at him, 'I will fight it. I 
will fight that person. I will become instantly angry,' " said Raymond Johnson 
of Westminster, a co-worker of Flournoy's at Matson Navigation, a shipping 
company on Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
 This portrait of Flournoy emerges as police continue to investigate whether a 
racial epithet triggered the scuffle that cost the 44-year-old African American 
man his life last week. Police contend that Jonathan Russell Kennedy, a 
19-year-old white man with a shaved head and tattoos, shot Flournoy after a 
brief sidewalk altercation along Beach Boulevard in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has also been charged with the attempted murder of two Latino men in 
an assault the month before. Police say he has been seen with individuals 
associated with white supremacist organizations and are investigating whether 
the Flournoy slaying was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview Tuesday, Kennedy's mother denied that her son was a racist 
or a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that at the time of the killing, Kennedy was staying briefly at 
the Seabridge Villas, the same gated Huntington Beach apartment complex where 
Flournoy lived with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Sharon Flournoy, a real estate broker, said she had never seen 
Kennedy around the complex and knew nothing about him. After spending the day 
making funeral arrangements for her husband of just two years, Sharon Flournoy 
did not want to discuss whether his slaying was a hate crime, saying simply 
that Tuesday was "a bad time, a bad time for me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank Honorato of Fountain Valley, Flournoy's close friend and car-pool 
partner, said racial conflict was the one topic that enraged Flournoy, a 
refrigeration mechanic, during their drives to and from Terminal Island in Los 
Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's real defensive about it," said Honorato, who drove home with Flournoy 
the night of his death. "He told me one day when we were going home there isn't 
such a thing as race. We're all the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Honorato said he and Flournoy had recently talked of going on a fishing trip. 
On the drive home the night he died, Flournoy spoke with optimism that the 
rocky early going of his new marriage was finally over. His wife was 
establishing a real estate business. He spoke of buying a house and settling 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was happy," Honorato said. "Today I kept thinking he was going to come up 
to me in the shop at 5 p.m. and say, 'C'mon, let's go home.' That'll never 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy's siblings said he and his new wife had moved to Huntington Beach 
from Seattle as newlyweds in 1992 to be closer to their children from earlier 
marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 For Vernon Flournoy, the move was something of a homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy's parents -- "looking for the good life" -- had moved their six girls 
and four boys from DeWitt, Ark., to the Aliso Village section of East Los 
Angeles when Flournoy was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, the shy, well-behaved Flournoy dreamed of basketball stardom. 
As a senior at Theodore Roosevelt High School, he was a standout, recalled his 
sister Barbara Blanche, 59, who helped raise him. 
</P>
<P>
 But he left junior college after a year, when marriage to a neighborhood 
sweetheart and three children -- two girls and a boy -- landed him in the 
working world. He and an elder brother, Bruce, now 47, went to welding school 
and Flournoy found work in the Pomona area. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, a drunk driver scattered the tightknit family. Flournoy's mother, who 
didn't drive, was killed crossing the street when the drunk driver rear-ended 
another car, sending it plowing into her. Flournoy's father, who was ill with 
cancer, died a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he ever got over it," said elder sister Betty Lewis. "It 
affected us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy, who divorced his first wife in the early 1970s, moved north with his 
brother to a job in Seattle. For the next 18 years, he worked as a shipping 
container repairman and welder, said Bruce Flournoy, who still lives in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Flournoy, who had told family members he thought he would never 
remarry, fell in love again. The newlyweds moved to Huntington Beach, where his 
wife's daughter, a new job and warm weather awaited. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, Flournoy's life changed again, when a heart attack struck him on 
Super Bowl weekend, followed by an angioplasty to clear clogged arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, co-workers said, Flournoy no longer let things bother him. He 
bugged his brother to eat better, bought friends fruit bars and took long 
strolls through the neighborhood. And when he was offered doughnuts, he'd point 
to his heart and say, "No, thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 While his co-workers fought at weekly grievance meetings, Flournoy would sit 
in a chair off to the side with a slight smile on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like he had a secret," Johnson said. "He knew that our petty 
grievances are nothing. He was just glad to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd invite another co-worker, Bobby Perkins of Carson, out to "oldies" shows, 
jazz concerts or food fairs. Or he'd head out to play blackjack in Laughlin, 
Nev., or Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson said about four or five months ago, Flournoy was partnered with 
another mechanic whom Flournoy believed disparaged him and other black workers. 
In one incident, Flournoy told Johnson he saw the other mechanic bark at a 
black truck driver, then politely help a white truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said the other mechanic talked down to him and ordered him around," 
Johnson said. "He said (the racial slights) were the only thing he hadn't been 
able to let go of since his heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy's siblings said their proud brother may have found himself in a 
situation where his beliefs were put to a test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he'd start anything," said his brother-in-law, Jeff Blanche of 
Ridgecrest. "But if someone said something he'd probably advise him that he was 
uncomfortable with that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know his opinions, that he did believe in fairness in his job and in his 
life," said Bruce Flournoy. "Would he have stood up for himself? Well, yes he 
would." 
</P>

MOTHER SAYS SON NO SKINHEAD OR RACIST; SUSPECT: WHITE TEEN INVESTIGATED FOR 
HATE SLAYING 'HAS HAD FRIENDS OF EVERY RACE' AND HARBORED NO ANIMOSITY, SHE 
SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Jonathan Russell Kennedy -- the white teen-ager whose alleged slaying of an 
African American man last week is being investigated as a possible hate crime 
-- was not part of any skinhead group and held no racist views, his mother said 
in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time something starts happening between people of different colors, 
somebody starts yelling 'race,' " said Rhody Kennedy, a 37-year-old office 
manager for an insurance company. "I'm positive it was not" a racial incident, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't there. I wish I could have been there or have had him home," she 
added. "My heart hurts terribly for everyone and everything involved." Rhody 
Kennedy said her son shaved his head only Sept. 13, after she complained that 
the blond coloring in his close-cropped hair looked bad. Neighbors said they 
did not know the Kennedys, who moved in two weeks ago, but described Jonathan 
Kennedy as having blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in Huntington Beach . . . they all shave their heads," Rhody 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son, a 19-year-old high school dropout, harbored no racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had black friends and Mexican friends and Filipino girlfriends," she 
said. "He's had friends of every race." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Kennedy and a 17-year-old youth are charged with murder in the 
shooting death last week of Vernon Windell Flournoy, 44, outside a McDonald's 
restaurant in Huntington Beach. Prosecutors said Tuesday they would attempt to 
try the juvenile as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Kennedy has also been charged with attempted murder in the shootings 
of two Latinos, Juan Vergara and Angel Campos Silia, both 22, on Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhody Kennedy said her son, whom she calls Rusty, was a talented student who 
skipped a year in junior high school. His legal last name is Kinsey -- the name 
under which he was last enrolled in Valley Vista High School in Fountain Valley 
-- but he has gone by his stepfather's name since his mother married and 
adopted the name Kennedy eight years ago, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After mother and son moved to Huntington Beach from Alaska five years ago, 
Jonathan Kennedy dropped out of high school and was convicted as a juvenile for 
taking part in a burglary, Rhody Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Kennedy, who has a 2-month-old son living with a girlfriend elsewhere 
in Huntington Beach, was on his own for more than a year before he moved back 
in with his mother two weeks ago, Rhody Kennedy said. She said she does not 
know where in Huntington Beach he lived during that time but said he kept in 
close touch by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always calls and says 'I love you, Mom,' " she said, picking a 2-year-old 
photograph of her son from a cluster of family pictures on the coffee table. "I 
know I should know more, but he was always doing his own thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhody Kennedy said she visited her son in jail last weekend but did not ask 
him whether he was responsible for Flournoy's slaying or the August shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Kennedy's lips were swollen and that he told her Flournoy had 
punched him during the confrontation. Rhody Kennedy said she did not know 
whether her son owned a gun and doubted he would have started such a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never known Rusty to just go say something to somebody -- especially to 
an older person," she said.

2 DOZEN ARRESTED IN SNAKE POACHING STING; CRIME: OFFICIALS RAID 11 COUNTIES 
PROBING PORTION OF ILLEGAL SALES OF $100 MILLION A YEAR. AN IRVINE MAN IS AMONG 
SUSPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nearly two dozen people, including an Orange County man, were arrested Tuesday 
on charges of snake poaching, the result of a sting operation by state game 
wardens investigating the state's $100-million annual black market in live 
wildlife, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation, which was called Operation Ranching for Reptiles and culminated 
in raids in 11 California counties, had been aimed at the illegal sale of fish 
and wildlife native to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jerry Spansail, spokesman for the Department of Fish and Game, said more 
than 2,000 illegally obtained reptiles were confiscated in the sweep, including 
about 800 poached snakes seized from a single breeder in Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poaching of native wildlife is a runaway cottage industry in California that 
threatens our wildlife resources," said Lt. Eddie Watkins, who runs the 
department's special operations unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Fish and Game officials have long been concerned about the 
underground traffic in wildlife and reptiles in particular. One reptile dealer 
is believed to have made $60,000 a year sacking snakes and illegally selling 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 As snake collecting has become more popular as a hobby, demand for rare and 
unusual-looking reptiles such as the San Diego mountain king snake has soared, 
authorities say. Fish and Game Director Boyd Gibbons said black market reptile 
dealers can make up to $2,000 a night just by trawling back roads for snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature created the Department of Fish and Game's special operations 
unit to address the problem. State law allows collectors with fishing licenses 
to capture two snakes of a given species, but it is a misdemeanor to buy or 
sell native species of reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poachers are hammering California wildlife," Gibbons said. "They're taking 
enormous numbers of deer, bear, abalone, lobsters, crabs, birds and snakes. No 
species escapes the poachers. They don't care about the animals they kill -- 
they're only driven by money." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's sting was the result of a two-year investigation conducted from a 
storefront in Temecula, authorities said. The phony business, named Temecula 
Reptilia, attracted reptile poachers and collectors seeking to do business on 
the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation, which focused on Southern California, netted 13 suspects in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Most of the animals 
seized were rosy boas, a species of snake that sells on the black market for up 
to $250. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County suspect was identified as Kyle Kevin Rosenthal, 19, of 
Irvine. He was arrested in Riverside on suspicion of one misdemeanor count of 
illegal possession of a native reptile, said Jeff Weir, a spokesman for the 
state Fish and Game Department. If convicted, Rosenthal faces up to six months 
in jail and a $1,000 fine, Weir said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seized were a dozen California rattlesnakes, a venomous Gila monster, a 
piranha, an opossum, snapping turtles and prohibited, non-native fish, 
including a longnose gar and a snakeshead. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals were trucked to a Fish and Game base in Chino, where they are 
being held.

HOPEFULS SCRAMBLE FOR TITAN OPENING; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SEVERAL COACHES HAVE 
CONTACTED EASTERBROOK ABOUT REPLACING HOLLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Easterbrook began his career as Cal State Fullerton athletic director in 
whirlwind fashion Tuesday, facing the immediate challenge of replacing Brad 
Holland as basketball coach with the start of workouts only 25 days away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of telephones calls about the position, from people strongly 
interested in it, as well as other people making recommendations," Easterbrook 
said. "It tells me there is a lot of interest in this position, and in 
Fullerton basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Easterbrook's scheduled meetings on his first day on the job was one 
with Bob Hawking, who is most likely to be named interim coach if the 
university decides to move in that direction. Practice starts Oct. 15 and the 
university normally requires a 30-day posting before a position can be filled 
on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking, who was Holland's top assistant for his two seasons at Fullerton, 
said he definitely is interested in the position. Hawking, 45, has been 
recommended for the job by Holland, who resigned to accept the head coaching 
position at the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I have good support, and I'm pleased about that," Hawking said. "I've 
been told that some boosters have expressed that, and I know that a group of 
players have done the same thing with the new athletic director. I feel people 
around here have gotten to know me, and feel good about what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking has been involved in recruiting every player on the current roster 
except senior guard James French. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good opportunity for Brad to move on, and I think it would be a 
great opportunity for me to pick up what he started and keep things going in 
the right direction," Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking was an assistant for two years at Pepperdine after 14 years in the 
high school ranks at Simi Valley, where his teams reached the CIF playoffs nine 
times and won five Marmonte League championships. His 1988 team, led by Don 
MacLean, won the CIF championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Also mentioned as a possibility for the job is Utah assistant coach Donny 
Daniels, who is a former assistant at Fullerton under George McQuarn. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, who has been at Utah since 1989, said he would be interested in the 
position, but has no plans to apply at this point out of deference to Hawking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Bob, and I know he's interested, so I won't contact them about it," he 
said. "If they contact me, that's another matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels, who played for Fullerton from 1974-76 and graduated in 1977, believes 
Fullerton will need to move quickly to hire a replacement because of 
recruiting. "But if they name someone on an interim basis, the other recruiters 
will attack that like you wouldn't believe," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Fullerton graduate, Mater Dei High Coach Gary McKnight, also has been 
mentioned as a possibility and has indicated his continuing interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Schermerhorn, head coach at Riverside Community College, said he has 
telephoned to make his interest known. 
</P>
<P>
 Schermerhorn, 51, was an assistant at UC Irvine for three years and head coach 
at Southern Utah State for four years. He also was an assistant at Arizona 
State, and is starting his sixth season at Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get back to Division I if possible," he said.

YAKE TAKING SOME HEAT THIS TIME; HOCKEY: WILSON NOT IMPRESSED WITH PLAY OF 
DUCKS' LEADING SCORER LAST SEASON. BRUINS WIN EXHIBITION GAME, 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 How much have things changed for the Mighty Ducks? Could last year's leading 
scorer really be this year's fifth right wing? 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Yake had 21 goals and 31 assists to lead the Ducks in scoring in Year 1, 
edging Bob Corkum by one point. But with Paul Kariya, Valeri Karpov and Co. 
dominating the exhibition season, Yake has slid into the background, and he did 
little to prove his worth in the Ducks' 3-2 exhibition loss to Boston in front 
of 16,368 at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to get himself going because other people are playing a lot better 
than he is," Coach Ron Wilson said. "I wouldn't say he's in trouble (to make 
the team). He is in trouble of being the fifth right wing. If that's what he 
wants, fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The particulars might be news to Yake, but the general sentiment is not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm playing like horse . . ." he said. "There's no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a classic slow starter, his groin bothered him early in camp, he really 
hasn't had much ice time yet, and he has to admit it, this lockout threat is 
hanging over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not panic time, but there's no question I've got a long ways to go 
before I'm in midseason form," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the only veteran forward clawing for position. With the addition of 
Kariya and Karpov and John Lilley just about to lock up a spot, the Ducks are 
overstocked with forwards. At right wing, Yake has to contend with Karpov, 
Lilley, Joe Sacco and Todd Ewen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't gained my confidence. I'm generally a slow starter," he said. "I'm 
not worried. I just have a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks had a 2-0 lead -- against a Boston lineup that didn't include Cam 
Neely, Adam Oates or Ray Bourque -- after first-period goals by Karpov and 
Corkum. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bruins scored the next three goals, including two in the third period, 
and John Gruden beat Mikhail Shtalenkov on a screened shot at 18:32 of the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson found fault with his team's defensive attentiveness, calling the 
comeback "a couple of cheesy goals because we were trying to be too cute." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, who play Boston (3-2) at San Diego tonight, fell to 1-3-1. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond lights blacked out with 3:12 left in the first period, halting the 
action. The teams left the ice early for the first intermission, tacking the 
extra minutes onto the second period. Club officials linked the blackout to a 
sudden dip in power from Southern California Edison.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; FOLTZ LEADS GOLDEN WEST IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Becca Foltz, playing for the first time this season, had 11 kills to help

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: IT'S HARD FOR 2 TO KEEP TIME ON THE SAME 
BIOLOGICAL CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John and Carol, both in their 20s, had been married for five years when they 
realized that their body clocks were hopelessly out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
 John was a morning lark -- he liked going to bed at 8 p.m. so he could get up 
at 5 a.m. to go to work at his construction job. Carol was a night owl, 
preferring to stay up until midnight and sleep until 9 or 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was causing them a great deal of difficulty. What would happen is he would 
want her to go to bed with him at 8 and get up and make him breakfast," said 
Margaret White, a medical psychologist and member of the Sleep Disorders 
Institute at St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she had difficulty with this, he perceived it as rejection. He thought, 
'She doesn't love me. She doesn't want to have sex with me.' He was sure the 
marriage was over." 
</P>
<P>
 John and Carol turned to White for counseling. She helped them work out a 
compromise. Carol would go to bed with her husband at 8 to cuddle under the 
covers, but after he fell asleep she would get up again and enjoy a few hours 
to herself. She also made him breakfast and lunch before they retired so he 
wouldn't wake her up in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 John, meanwhile, came to realize that his wife wasn't rejecting him -- it was 
just too difficult for her to change her sleep pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once he became aware it was a function of her biological clock, he felt 
reassured," White said. "It was a case of education." 
</P>
<P>
 Conflicting sleep patterns can create serious disturbances in a relationship. 
When a morning lark shares a bed with a night owl, couples can find themselves 
leading separate lives that begin and end at different hours of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having your partner wandering around while you're sleeping is disconcerting," 
said Kerry Delk, a clinical psychologist and consultant with the Sleep 
Disorders Center at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem can be especially harmful to couples with busy schedules because 
bedtime might be the only time they spend alone together all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that doesn't happen there can be a loss of intimacy," Delk said. 
</P>
<P>
 One couple he counseled found that their conflicting sleep schedules left 
little time for togetherness day or night. Bill loved to stay up late and sleep 
in until 10 or 11 a.m., a habit he developed growing up with indulgent parents 
who never set limits. After he married, his wife, Susan, found his owlish 
habits annoying. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would wake up to find him busy in the den at 2 a.m.," Delk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan worked a traditional 9-to-5 job, so when she was up and about in the 
morning, Bill was sound asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Delk helped the couple solve the problem by teaching Bill behavioral 
techniques so he could change his sleep schedule to a more practical 10:30 p.m. 
to 6:30 a.m. shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife felt it was a great improvement," Delk said. "He was more available" 
to be with her during their waking hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekends are prime time for owls and larks to be at odds. Often, an owl will 
want to stay up late and party when the lark wants to go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will want to sleep, and she'll want to go to the symphony that doesn't 
start until 8," White said. "That's hard for larks." 
</P>
<P>
 Larks, meanwhile, will want to drag their mates out of bed for an 
early-morning church service, breakfast or a camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that one person ends up cranky, and the weekend excursion -- 
which was supposed to be a time of happy togetherness -- turns out to be 
another source of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who is also an associate professor of psychology at Cal State 
Fullerton, tells her students that when contemplating marriage they should 
consider -- besides family, friends, taste in food and credit history -- sleep 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The younger ones look skeptical, but the older ones nod knowingly," she said. 
"That kind of incompatibility can be detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't understand the powerful sway of the biological clock may 
misinterpret their partner's desire to go to bed at a different hour as a sign 
of rejection, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some people do indeed avoid their mates by going to bed earlier or 
later, more often their conflicting sleep habits are a function of nature: 
Their bodies simply require different amounts of sleep at different hours of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some need two or three hours of sleep a night. Others require 12. That's 
normal for them," said Peter Fotinakes, associate clinical professor of 
neurology and medical director of the UC Irvine Sleep Disorder Center in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is if you're married to someone at the other end of the bell 
curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the one who needs more sleep doesn't get enough rest in trying to keep 
up with the bright-eyed partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're an eight-hour person and your partner is a 10-hour person, you need 
to understand that's a need," White said. "Otherwise, you'll find you're 
married to an irritable, fatigued spouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if both parties sleep eight hours, the hours they spend catching their Zs 
can vary greatly. One person may be naturally inclined to sleep from 9 p.m. to 
6 a.m., while the partner will want to sleep from midnight until 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people's clocks are off two or three hours," Fotinakes said.  
</P>
<P>
 When someone's biological clock is seriously out of whack, it could be a sign 
of a sleep disorder. In those cases, couples should seek medical advice. A 
patient might be suffering from sleep apnea or chronic insomnia or some other 
malady that can be corrected through medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two cannot reset their clocks to conform to each other through medical 
or behavioral techniques, White suggests they concentrate on being together 
during "the middle hours." 
</P>
<P>
 "They meet in the middle of the day when their times overlap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of John and Carol, "they didn't change their rhythm, they learned 
to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply recognizing a mate is an individual with different physical needs can 
go a long way to solving sleep disputes, and enhance other areas of a 
relationship as well, said Barbara Kreedman, a clinical psychologist in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's allowing for someone to have his or her own individual needs without it 
being a sign something's wrong. If your partner needs more or less sleep, you 
should be able to give them that without making them change," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That requires compromise -- for example, lowering the lights and TV so the 
other can sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couples have problems wanting to make the other person like them, but being 
different is OK. You don't have to mirror one another in everything you do," 
said Kreedman.

RETURNING TO THE SCENE; GENERATIONS OF PRAISE FOR NANCY, THE HARDY BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two most enduring series books are the Hardy Boys (launched in 1927) and 
Nancy Drew (1930). 
</P>
<P>
 Simon & Schuster, which bought the rights to the two series from the 
Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1984, now publishes three separate Nancy Drew series 
and two Hardy Boys series under its Archway Paperbacks and Minstrel Books 
imprints. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew adventures are aimed at 8- to 14-year-old 
readers. But a new series launched this month, "The Nancy Drew Notebooks," is 
aimed at younger readers -- ages 6 to 7 -- and features an 8-year-old Nancy 
just beginning her amateur sleuthing career. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for characters first created more than 60 years ago. But these are all 
new adventures, and the settings have all the modern trappings such as 
answering machines, mobile phones and VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 Grosset & Dunlap, the series' original publisher, continues to publish the 58 
original Hardy Boys and 56 Nancy Drew volumes. The old stories, however, have 
been modernized several times since they were first revamped in 1959 to appeal 
to modern audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 For purists, Applewood Books, a Boston publishing company that specializes in 
reissuing books from America's past, has reissued a handful of the Hardy Boys 
and Nancy Drew titles as they were originally written. 
</P>
<P>
 Applewood publisher Phil Zuckerman recalls that a few years ago he was reading 
his 6-year-old son his favorite Hardy Boys book, which he had read as a child 
in the '50s, "The Mystery of Cabin Island." And, he says, "I realized there was 
something different from what I remember."  
</P>
<P>
 When he discovered that the books he had read as a kid had been dramatically 
altered to make them more contemporary -- critics say the language and plots 
were oversimplified and the detail and emotional depth drastically reduced -- 
Zuckerman "determined then and there that we had to reissue the originals." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Applewood Books has published three hard-cover Hardy Boys titles 
and five Nancy Drews. (They're exact replicas of the originals, down to the 
colorful book jacket art.) Two more Nancy Drew titles will be out this fall. 
"The Nancy Drews," Zuckerman says, "outsell the Hardy Boys by two to one." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the enduring appeal of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, in both the 
original and updated versions? Anne Greenberg, executive editor of Archway 
Paperbacks and Minstrel Books, figures it's "the nature of the characters 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very smart, very independent, and they're free of adult supervision, 
which I think is every kid's fantasy. They function very competently in the 
adult world, which is what makes them good role models." DENNIS McLELLAN

BOOKS & AUTHORS / ORANGE COUNTY: RETURNING TO THE SCENE; OLD FRIENDS OF NANCY 
DREW, THE HARDY BOYS AND THE LIKE WILL GATHER THIS WEEKEND IN BUENA PARK FOR A 
SERIES COLLECTORS' CONVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vicki Broadhurst of Newport Beach was a child in the 1950s when she discovered 
Nancy Drew. She and her girlfriends devoured every volume in the series 
starring the resourceful teen-age sleuth who tooled around River Heights in a 
sporty blue roadster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between all of us we had just about the whole set," recalls Broadhurst, 46. 
Like most girls who grew up reading Nancy Drew, she viewed the loyal, 
trustworthy and self-sufficient, all-American girl as a role model: "I would 
have been very happy in real life to have Nancy Drew as my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dan Josslin of Foothill Ranch it was the Hardy Boys. You remember sleuths 
Frank and Joe Hardy of Bayport, the teen-age sons of "internationally famous 
detective" Fenton Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did everything kids would really like to do and couldn't," says Josslin, 
48. "They had motorcycles, motorboats and cars -- and their parents didn't 
interfere with them. They were smart, attractive, popular and talented. Both 
the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew were just wonder kids." 
</P>
<P>
 If you read Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys as a child -- or you're a child 
reading Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys in the '90s -- Buena Park is the place to 
be this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadhurst and Josslin -- two of Orange County's biggest collectors of 
children's series books -- have joined three other Southern California 
collectors in organizing the Series Book Collectors Convention at the Buena 
Park Hotel Thursday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Drew and the Hardys are just a few of the fictional heroes and heroines 
who will be discussed, probed and appreciated at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of series book characters is a big one. There's everything from teen 
sleuths to sports series characters to Josslin's personal favorite, Freddy the 
Pig (the lead character in a series about anthropomorphic barnyard animals). 
There literally have been hundreds of children's book characters over the years 
and each, it seems, has someone who collects them. 
</P>
<P>
 Josslin is not sure how many series book fans they'll draw to Buena Park, but 
a Nancy Drew convention at the University of Iowa last year gathered about 400 
Drew fanatics from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make really good connections at these things -- you meet other people you 
can trade books with from around the country," says Josslin, regional services 
manager for the Orange County Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most series book fans who stopped buying the books as teen-agers and 
began collecting later in life, Josslin never stopped accumulating the books 
since reading his first Hardy Boys volume, "The Tower Treasure," at age 11. 
</P>
<P>
 He now has more than 4,000 books representing more than 100 vintage series. 
They're impressively displayed in floor-to-ceiling oak bookcases in an upstairs 
room devoted solely to his series-book collecting passion.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia is a primary incentive for an adult to start collecting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're in their 60s now, they remember fondly the books from the 1930s 
and '40s," he says. "My age group -- the baby boomers -- remember the books 
from the '50s. And, of course, once you get hooked as a collector you branch 
out and collect books from different eras too." 
</P>
<P>
 Series books are relatively affordable collectibles. A Hardy Boys book that 
sold for a buck in the '50s can be had for $10 to $20; Broadhurst, who began 
collecting in earnest 15 years ago and now owns about 2,000 series books, 
recently paid "under $500" for a "very scarce" 1904 first edition Bobbsey 
Twins.  
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of series books to children is no mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were real accessible to young readers because there was a lot of 
action," Josslin says. "After you read the first one or two you became real 
familiar with the characters and the formula. If it was a formula that 
appealed, like mystery or adventure or school stories or sports stories, you 
could count on that formula being repeated time after time." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a winning formula for nearly a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Stratemeyer, a writer of boys stories who became a phenomenally 
successful literary entrepreneur, is credited with founding the 20th Century 
series book. As Fortune magazine put it back in 1934: Stratemeyer did "the 
first of it, the best of it, the worst of it, and with rare justice made the 
most money from it." 
</P>
<P>
 The key? He reduced the price of the books from as much as $1.25 to 50 cents. 
The books were dubbed "fifty-centers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the combination of dropping the price so children could afford to buy 
them and shifting the focus from 19th Century sensibilities to a more 
contemporary approach," says Deidre Johnson, author of two books on the 
Stratemeyer Syndicate, which created the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew and nearly 100 
other series books for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who teaches children's literature at West Chester University in West 
Chester, Pa., and will lead a panel discussion on series book history at the 
convention, says series books for children started in the United States around 
1830. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, "Stratemeyer was the one who introduced a lot of things we 
consider standard now, such as modern technology or current events and 
characters who don't age."  
</P>
<P>
 In previous series books, says Johnson, the characters would have tremendous 
success and thus move themselves out of the series. "Most of Stratemeyer's 
heroes helped others and had smaller success so you could continue a series 
indefinitely. Before, many series would end after six volumes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

 Stratemeyer's first big hit, which he wrote himself early in the century, was 
the Rover Boys. In writing the series, which followed three brothers through 
adolescence, Johnson says Stratemeyer tried to be "more playful, entertaining 
and more varied than previous series about schoolboys." 
</P>
<P>
 After about 1906, Stratemeyer continued to write books published under his 
name and two pseudonyms, but for almost everything else coming out of his 
syndicate he would come up with the plots and others would write the books 
under pen names. They were, says Johnson, "mostly journalists who were able to 
write rapidly and smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 Another early Stratemeyer Syndicate series success, begun in 1904, was the 
Bobbsey Twins. Then came Tom Swift, the boy inventor, in 1910. But the heyday 
of the syndicate was between 1910 and 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 At the highest point between 1915 and 1925, says Johnson, "Stratemeyer had 
more than 30 different series going simultaneously and they covered everything: 
fantasy series, series aimed at little girls, series aimed at little boys -- at 
boys interested in technology, boys interested in war, girls who wanted 
careers, girls who just wanted to imagine they had the leisure to travel around 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The two most successful Stratemeyer Syndicate series books are the Hardy Boys 
(begun in 1927) and Nancy Drew (1930).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Johnson's view, the series books are less significant as children's 
literature than as a window on children's culture of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're invaluable for showing ideas that adults wanted to pass onto children 
and for looking at the importance of trends like technology," she says. "You 
could see America's amazement at the kind of technology coming out of that 
period. Airplanes started showing up in series books as early as 1909." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the reasons Tom Swift is so popular, she says, "because he's 
showing that kind of wonder at technology. The series (books) really seemed to 
catch cultural trends so you see socialization and what kinds of ideas were 
dominant." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says the older series books have been criticized for racist language, 
but even then "what they're doing, even though we don't like to admit it, is 
they're mirroring attitudes of the times." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says many of the Stratemeyer series books began to fade out by the 
early '40s due, in part, to paper shortages during the war. The popularity of 
the movies and later comic books and television, she says, also had an impact.  
</P>
<P>
 Although series books for children have continued over the years, she says, 
"their popularity has gone up and down. Right now they're in an up period." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, although she doesn't have current statistics for boys series books, an 
updated bibliography of girls series shows that there were 230 new series for 
girls between 1975 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson guesses that "it was the girls series that really pushed the new 
series renaissance. And they're taking off, going into directions we've never 
seen before -- something like the Choose Your Own Adventure series where you 
chose from different actions at various points in the plot so it's a story 
that's never the same twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most popular series today, she says, is the Babysitter's Club and 
its spinoff, the Babysitter's Little Sister. Other popular series in recent 
years have been Sweet Valley High and Sweet Dreams. And, she says, for older 
children there is a real resurgence in horror series such as Fear Street and 
Goose Bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is not sure why series books faded then came back strongly in 
popularity over the past decade, but she thinks there are a number of reasons 
for their popularity.  
</P>
<P>
 "One is they're predictable: Readers know they can get more of the same kind 
of story, which is very reassuring in an increasingly uncertain world. Another 
is just the fun of finding a familiar friend in books," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the series books into less-expensive paperback format in the late '70s 
and early '80s, she says, also had an impact on their increased popularity. 
Like Stratemeyer's "fifty-centers," the move from hardback to paperback made 
the books more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another reason for their appeal, Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe wish-fulfillment is the other reason. . . . Series characters usually 
seem to lead more successful, more glamorous lives than children in mainstream 
children's literature, or the readers themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And they often have an impact that lasts a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadhurst began collecting in 1979 after moving into a new home and unpacking 
all the series books she had kept from her childhood: "I realized I didn't own 
all the Nancy Drew books, and she was such a big part of my childhood. I 
thought, 'This is ridiculous; I need to fill in, I need to have all the books.' 
" Weekend of Words, Pictures and More 
</P>
<P>
 "'Series Book Collectors in Earthquake Land" -- a four-day gathering of series 
book buffs -- will run Thursday through Sunday at the Buena Park Hotel and 
Convention Center, 7675 Crescent Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is the third-ever general series book convention in the nation and 
the first in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 On the agenda are talks by Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys book cover illustrators 
William Gillies and Rudy Nappi; Nancy Axelrad, who wrote for Nancy Drew and 
several other series; Joyce Brotman, co-producer of the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys 
1970s television series, and actor Frank Thomas, who played Nancy Drew's 
boyfriend opposite Bonita Granville's Nancy in four movies in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention also will offer nuts and bolts information on how to grade the 
condition of old books as well as a discussion of reference books. A dealer and 
exhibit room will have displays of original book cover art work, movie posters, 
board games and other collectibles, author contracts and rare series books from 
the end of the last century through the 1970s. Registration is $85. For further 
details, call Dan Josslin at (714) 581-0435.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; RIO SUPPORTERS GET FIRED UP FOR A CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many property owners, the Rehabilitation Institute of Southern California 
worried about paying off the mortgage, but Sunday those fears went up in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 institute supporters attended RIO's burn-the-mortgage party, a 
black-tie gala at the Ritz restaurant in Newport Beach. Guests paid $125 each 
to attend the "Evening of Elegance" dinner, raising more than $125,000 for RIO 
to pay off the balance on its $600,000 mortgage. Fiery End 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers clad in tuxedos and evening gowns assembled for a champagne 
reception outside the Ritz, gathering around a table to watch the burning of 
the mortgage. With "You Light Up My Life" playing in the background, eight RIO 
supporters and volunteers held burning white candles and, with a little 
patience, set the mortgage on fire. The document burned to ashes in a silver 
urn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through some tough times, times when we worried about paying the 
bills," said Jim Owens, RIO board member. Paying off the mortgage will free up 
$60,000 annually for institute services. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the flame bearers was Mary Moore-Young, a longtime RIO supporter who 
helped make the payoff possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to shy away from people with disabilities," Moore-Young said. "I have 
(a disabled person) in my family, so I know what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
 Another flame bearer was 7-year-old Tiffany Anderson, who has cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could barely walk when she first went to the institute," said Carol 
Reese, Anderson's grandmother and assistant to the executive director at RIO, 
who looked on as her granddaughter walked up to the table to join in the 
ceremony. Ritz Hospitality 
</P>
<P>
 Guests later adjourned to the Ritz's dining room for a five-course feast. 
Among the offerings prepared by chef Claude Koeberle were scrambled eggs served 
inside the shell with caviar, wild mushroom soup (cleverly prepared to look 
like a cup of cappuccino), Maine lobster salad, broiled lamb sirloin and barley 
risotto. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritz owners Hans and Charlene Prager hosted the dinner on RIO's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a glamorous charity; it doesn't get in the news often, but they do 
the most outstanding work," Hans Prager said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange-based institute serves people of all ages with developmental 
disabilities, regardless of their ability to pay. Stroke patients, children 
with developmental problems and people who have suffered brain damage are among 
those served. Programs include physical, occupational and speech therapies, 
vocational services, child care and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Vescial was 18 months old when he came to the institute 29 years ago for 
treatment of spinal bifida. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have achieved the level of independence that I have without 
their help. They instilled self-confidence in me that's served me throughout my 
life," said Vescial, who lives in Blythe and teaches English as a Second 
Language at a community college. 
</P>
<P>
 RIO Golf Classic XII, another benefit for the institute, will be Monday at the 
Green River Golf Course in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the gala included: Praim Singh, executive director of RIO; 
Steve Harrison, board president, and his wife, Carla; Michael Carona, Maryann 
Brown, Linda Graf, Betty Poole, Gayle Fuller, Dick and Muriel Yarger, Gloria 
Gunton, Nancy Mockett, Walt Walton and Robert Lavoie. KATHRYN BOLD

THEATER REVIEWS; STANTON'S 'CALIFORNIA SUITE' IS MORE LIKE A MOTEL 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Old television hand that he is, Neil Simon writes sitcoms; indeed, he is the 
only playwright still able to sell them in live theater. Whether they're your 
cup of tea or not, in the right hands his plays can seem tightly crafted and 
funny, or at the very least amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the inept production of his "California Suite" at the Stanton Community 
Theatre is, under John Craig's haphazard direction, so clumsily put together 
that it allows the bare bones of Simon's writing to show. It's easy to see how 
thin and shallow the play really is. 
</P>
<P>
 A follow-up to Simon's "Plaza Suite," this is, like its older brother, four 
television-type stories about the various occupants of a suite at the Beverly 
Hills Hotel (which here looks more like Motel 6). 
</P>
<P>
 We get a long-divorced mother in town to fetch her teen-age daughter from a 
visit to her father; a young couple in town for the husband's nephew's bar 
mitzvah; a Brit film star in town with her bisexual husband for the Oscar 
ceremony; and two couples, best friends, dissolving into chaos after a game on 
the hotel's tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 What this prime-time silliness requires is actors and a director who can give 
the cardboard characters and simplistic writing some depth and detail, rounded 
characterizations, some semblance of reality and a good dollop of comic style. 
Without all that, they just don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Richard June -- who plays three of the husbands and who only 
succeeds by the standard television ploy of playing himself, which he does well 
-- none of the actors goes much beyond reading the lines and making appropriate 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Even June, as the British husband, suffers from an accent that sounds more 
like William F. Buckley's New England cockney. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettie Muellenberg, as the mother and the film star, is as pasteboard as the 
characters she plays, and has the added problem of an annoying habit: She keeps 
looking into the audience for reactions. As both the Jewish husband trying to 
hide a hooker from his wife and as one of the tennis husbands, Paul Walker 
could be funny under better direction, but he plays at an unrelieved high level 
that kills most of his laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Neil Simon deserves better. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; LONG BEACH BUILDS SOLID, HANDSOME 'FENCES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever fond of easy categories, theater critics often pigeonhole August Wilson 
as a naturalistic chronicler of black American life. Yet, as this new 
production of his 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winner "Fences" makes clear, Wilson at 
his best takes on a number of issues besides race. At the heart of this quiet 
tragedy about the fall of an aging baseball player lies a complex look at what 
it means to be a man -- black or white -- in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Bill DeLuca's staging at the Long Beach Playhouse Studio Theatre 
provides a solid interpretation of the text. Its key advantage is actor Billy 
Mayo, who captures both the raw fury and hidden pathos of the problematic hero, 
Troy Maxson. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Wilson's ambitious cycle of plays set in each decade of this century, 
"Fences" opens in 1957, the same year President Eisenhower dispatched troops to 
ensure school desegregation in Little Rock. While the play does not dwell on 
the burgeoning civil rights movement, it is suffused with the spirit of those 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiftysomething Maxson, once a promising player in the all-black leagues, 
knows that racism played a role in keeping him out of the majors. He has 
subverted his bitterness into a campaign to pressure his bosses to promote him 
from sanitation worker to truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 It soon becomes apparent that there is even more at stake than the tragedy of 
his athletic career. Plagued by bad choices and worse luck -- not to mention 
poverty and a prison record -- this tormented man allows his disappointment 
with life to consume him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, his buried need for affection is the very thing that compels him 
to cheat on his long-suffering wife Rose (a gloriously tough and nonchalant 
Robyn Hastings) and to brutalize his teen-age son Cory (Kyle Jones). 
</P>
<P>
 The Maxsons live in the sort of hardscrabble urban neighborhood whose 
residents work hard but have little to show for it. In Stewart Christie's fine 
set design, the front yard of a clapboard bungalow is a comfortable, slightly 
shabby place, strewn with the planks and sawhorses used to cobble together a 
rickety picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
 The chore seems to take Maxson years to complete; it becomes Wilson's 
none-too-subtle symbol of the character's creeping emotional isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLuca and cast can do little to fence in the occasional windy or repetitive 
lapses in Wilson's writing. Yet clear, honest performances propel the show at 
every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Though too young for the part, Mayo brings off a delicate balancing act, 
conveying all of Maxson's blustering rage against life (and death) while also 
suggesting his heartbreaking vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 This vexing character -- who trades such easy bonhomie with pal Bono (Wichita 
Troublefield) yet who moments later can become a vein-popping monster when 
confronting his own son -- finds fit expression in this handsome and frequently 
moving production. 
</P>

2 SWIMMERS RESCUED FAR OUT TO SEA; MISHAP: PAIR GOES FOR DIP FROM CATAMARAN, 
WHICH WIND BLOWS AWAY. ANOTHER BOATER FINDS THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple who went swimming in the open sea off a catamaran were fortunate to 
be rescued after the wind carried their boat away, stranding them five miles 
from land, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael O'Connor, a theatrical sound engineer from Dana Point, said he was 
alone aboard his 30-foot sailboat Monday afternoon when, on a whim, he decided 
to head toward a catamaran with a rainbow-striped sail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It passed me by 200 feet and as I looked, I saw there was no one on it," 
O'Connor said.  
</P>
<P>
 As the catamaran sailed toward shore at a 10- to 12-m.p.h. clip, O'Connor said 
he decided to take the same course in the opposite direction, hoping to find 
its former occupants before they drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes later, he said, he was about to call the Harbor Patrol for 
help when he heard a "faint yell." 
</P>
<P>
 "About 200 yards from the boat I spotted two people. They were waving their 
arms and screaming. It was at least five miles from shore." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor said he yelled to them and tossed them a life preserver. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the older of the two swimmers, 24-year-old Antonio Beltran of 
Huntington Beach, was in bad shape when he was pulled aboard.  
</P>
<P>
 "His lips were blue and kind of pale and he was really, really out of breath. 
He said he had another 15 minutes in him, but I doubt if he had five." Both 
swimmers had been skinny dipping, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other swimmer, a 17-year-old female from Capistrano Beach, was calmer and 
in better condition, O'Connor said. She was not identified because she is a 
juvenile, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Beltran declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor said that Beltran, a volunteer with the Sea Scout youth organization, 
who had obtained the 16-foot catamaran from the Sea Scout base in Dana Point, 
was very embarrassed.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor said Beltran told him he had left the sails loose so the boat would 
stay put. When the sails filled and the boat glided toward shore, the couple 
swam in an attempt to catch it, O'Connor said.  
</P>
<P>
 When that became futile, they started to swim toward shore, fighting a 
southerly wind and current. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been swimming about 45 minutes, O'Connor said, before he picked 
them up and bundled them in extra clothing he had aboard.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the rescue, he said, "there wasn't another boat for four or 
five miles in any direction." The couple, he said, were "very grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the crewless catamaran had washed ashore at Doheny Beach State 
Park, where it raised concerns among beach visitors.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was driving on patrol and was flagged down by park visitors who told me a 
Hobie Cat had come in with no one aboard," said park ranger Brad Keitzman. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5:15 p.m., Keitzman said, the state beach lifeguards called the Harbor 
Patrol, which dispatched a boat in search of the missing crew. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, two young men launched the Hobie Cat from the beach and 
joined the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The search was astoundingly short. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the Harbor Patrol left the harbor, a vessel radioed in that it had 
picked up two people," said Keitzman. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Mishica, who was on duty with the Harbor Patrol, said by the time the 
patrol boat caught up with the Hobie Cat, the rescue boat also sailed up with 
the couple aboard. It was then 5:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mishica said the rescued couple looked very serious after the ordeal, which 
Mishica blamed on "just a lapse in judgment on their part." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they realized that if any of the circumstances had been different, 
they would have been real difficult to find," he said. "It would have been like 
looking for a needle in a haystack out there."

REVITALIZATION PROJECT OKD IN ANAHEIM; ENVIRONMENT: THE DETERIORATING AREA 
AROUND DISNEYLAND WILL GET A FACE LIFT AIMED AT INCREASING TOURISM AND CITY 
REVENUE. SOURCES OF FINANCING FOR THE $172-MILLION PLAN WERE NOT SPELLED OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concluding three years of work, the City Council on Tuesday night unanimously 
approved a sweeping, $172-million revitalization plan aimed at eliminating 
urban deterioration around Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a complete rejuvenation of the area," said Councilman Irv 
Pickler. "The area has been deteriorating, and this plan is going to enhance 
the whole area. The people of Anaheim are really going to benefit from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the face lift for the 550 acres around the theme park would 
boost tax revenue, encourage growth and be a pivotal complement to the Walt 
Disney Co.'s proposed $3-billion Westcot resort. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents Tuesday night argued that the city's environmental impact report 
failed to adequately address negative effects of the project on traffic, 
housing and air quality. Others urged the council to postpone a decision until 
a firm financing schedule has been made public. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes landscaping, burying overhead utility lines, installing wide 
walkways and transforming the decaying area into a more attractive and 
"pedestrian friendly" environment, say city planners. Also, businesses will be 
encouraged but not required to display more understated signs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, however, concerns were raised again about who will pay for 
the landscaping, street and sewer improvements called for in the plan. City 
officials expect a large chunk of it to be paid with county, state and federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 But, officials say, developers and property owners probably will have to pay 
the remainder, estimated at $63 million. Anaheim officials repeatedly have 
ruled out using money from the city's general fund or raising residential taxes 
to support the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials would not discuss the plan's financing Tuesday, but said 
details will be laid out at another meeting on Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in October, city officials are expected to consider a $60-million plan to 
renovate Anaheim Convention Center, which is part of the area. Officials regard 
the Convention Center renovation as another key component to keeping Anaheim 
competitive with other cities trying to attract convention business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Convention Center plan would include a citywide increase of two percentage 
points, to 15%, in the hotel bed tax which, if approved, would generate $5 
million yearly in additional revenue, officials said.

<P>
 The bed tax would help finance the Convention Center remodeling and 
revitalizing of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 That triangular area includes Disneyland, the Convention Center and high-rise 
hotels. It is bounded by Orangewood Avenue, Walnut Street, Haster Street and 
the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved an environmental impact report for the project area. 
According to the report, even with mitigation measures, the plan will cause 
traffic congestion at four intersections, reduced air quality and the loss of 
56 acres of prime agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, however, have said the plan's financial benefits outweigh the 
environmental loss. When the improvements are done, the area is expected to 
generate an extra $4 million to $6 million in yearly city revenue.

 'DON'T HAVE KIDS, PLEASE.' ; FRIENDS IN LIFE, DEATH; TRAGEDY: CRASH CLAIMS 
THREE INSEPARABLE COMPANIONS ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM WEEKEND VISIT WITH YOUNG 
BUDDIES IN ARIZONA. 
</P>

<P>
 They met in kindergarten, dubbed themselves the "Loud and Live Mafia" at age 
10 and then, as teen-agers, met for lunch every day at a local deli even though 
they attended different high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three of the 10 young men who have always been best buddies are gone, 
killed when their pickup truck flipped on a desolate Arizona highway as they 
returned from a weekend visit with their childhood playmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled at 1 p.m. today for Babak (Bob) Dogmetchi, 20, 
and Arash Ghazinoor, 19, first cousins who immigrated here from Iran in 1981 
and grew up as close as twin brothers. Ryan Lemmon, a 19-year-old baseball star 
who was driving at the time of the crash, will be buried this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I've ever done, I did with them. Every story that I have, ever, is 
about them," said Christopher Peake, 19, the only survivor of the crash. "It's 
not like we just hung out once or twice -- it's like 95% of the days since I 
was 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember ever not seeing them every day," added the former football 
player, whose left shoulder sports an "LL" tattoo representing the group's 
nickname.  
</P>
<P>
 With ugly cuts on his head, one eye and both legs, Peake slumped on a couch in 
his parents' living room Tuesday as friends streamed through, bringing him a 
fast-food lunch, homemade chocolate cake, long hugs and a host of reminiscences 
about the gang of guys who were like family. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best memories were the most recent: up all Thursday night chatting 
at Lemmon's parents' house in Palm Desert, a Friday-night fraternity party and 
a long Saturday, filled to overflowing with raucous laughter at the University 
of Arizona in Tucson, and a Sunday morning breakfast at McDonald's before 
hitting the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just remember I wondered (during the weekend) if it would ever be that good 
again," sighed Peake, the only one of the four wearing a seat belt at the time 
of the accident. "I feel really guilty. Everybody's telling me not to feel that 
way but I can't help it." 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred about 11:40 a.m. Sunday as Lemmon, driving west at about 65 
m.p.h. on Interstate 8 in the 1994 Toyota extended-cab pickup truck that 
Lemmon's parents bought him two weeks ago, drifted into the center median, then 
overcompensated, causing the truck to roll over, said Arizona Department of 
Public Safety Sgt. Dave Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the young men were dead when police arrived, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident is still under investigation, but police suspect Lemmon may have 
dozed at the wheel, Myers said, adding that no alcohol was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real common type accident," he said. "The highways are long and 
straight and desolate. Fatigue becomes a factor. (Drivers) drift off the 
roadway and then become alert again and they attempt to correct it, but 
typically what happens is it's an overcorrection and they roll over." 
</P>
<P>
 Peake, who spent the night in an Arizona hospital and required stitches in 
three places, said he cannot remember any details about the crash. Lemmon had 
been wearing a seat belt when they started the drive at 10 a.m., but may not 
have put it back on when he removed his shirt about 20 minutes before the 
crash, Peake said, adding that Dogmetchi and Ghazinoor were not wearing seat 
belts so they could spread out and nap in the back seats of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Shock and horror have gripped the close network of popular athletes and their 
families as news of the tragic crash filtered back to Irvine. At Woodbridge 
High School, all three victims' alma mater, psychologists and counselors set up 
a grief center. Peake and Lemmon's parents received a steady stream of 
well-wishers Tuesday, while dozens of relatives, all clad entirely in black, 
gathered to mourn at Dogmetchi's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I tell you? The loss of your son -- it's part of your body, 
everything you have," blurted Ali Dogmetchi, Babak's father. "For us, your son 
is your backbone. I lost my backbone. I lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' mothers and grandmothers wailed, moaning laments in Farsi as younger 
relatives rubbed their backs, held their hands and tried to give them iced tea 
and a thick yellow soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Shookeh Ghazinoor, Arash's mother, repeatedly slapped her thighs and forehead, 
dropped her head between her knees to sob, then wrapped her arms around her 
shoulders, swaying back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to die too. I want to kiss them, I want him to give me a hug and hold 
me, hold me," she said, hugging herself. "He was a good son, too, such a good 
son. He filled my life with joy, he was such a good boy. I never, ever had a 
bad memory, nothing bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't have kids, please," Shookeh Ghazinoor begged a visitor. "They give you 
so much love and then they take it away without your knowing. You don't have 
any control." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the family's tragedy is that Ghazinoor's uncle returned home last 
week from a three-month hospital stay after a near-fatal automobile accident. 
At his home, next door to the Dogmetchi's, a magic-marker banner saying 
"Welcome Home Pafa" and a deflated Mylar balloon still sat in the living room 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wonders why he survived and they didn't," 21-year-old Amir Larijani, the 
victims' first cousin, said of his father. "A week ago it was a celebration -- 
now it's mourning." 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 10 months apart in age, Babak and Arash have been inseparable since 
early childhood, relatives and friends said. At Woodbridge High they played on 
the varsity basketball team together (Dogmetchi graduated in 1992, Ghazinoor in 
1993). Both went to UC Santa Barbara, though Ghazinoor was transferring to UC 
Irvine this year, scheduled to start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogmetchi, aspiring to be a lawyer, was independent and a little picky, 
Larijani said. Ghazinoor, friends and relatives agreed, was a goofy sports 
fanatic who made everyone laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogmetchi was obsessed with Pearl Jam while Ghazinoor loved the Beastie Boys, 
and both played their music loud: "You'd basically hear them coming to the 
neighborhood because they had their radios turned up," Larijani said.  
</P>
<P>
 Though they feel twice the grief, family members said they take solace in the 
fact that the young men died at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever they did in this life, they did together. They're still together. 
God just didn't want them to be separated," said Laya Dogmetchi, 23, Babak's 
sister, who spent part of Tuesday afternoon assembling a collage of photographs 
for the young men's funeral this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every tooth lost, they lost together. Every soccer ball that Bobby kicked 
went to Arash. Every basketball Bobby threw, Arash caught," she said. "It 
wouldn't be right if one died and the other was here." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away, Guy and Marcie Lemmon sat in their son Ryan's room, staring 
at baseball trophies and savoring the memories of a late-night heart-to-heart 
they had with the youngster last Wednesday, the night before he left for his 
last road trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've run out of tears, and then I think of something, and find out 
I've got gallons more," smiled Guy Lemmon as he thumbed through his son's 
scrapbook, filled with college recruitment letters, happy snapshots and 
personal tributes from friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemmon treasures the recent time he spent with his son: a nine-hour day 
shopping for the new truck, and then another five hours waxing it last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not about cars, not about baseball," he recalled of those 
conversations. "It was about life, about love, about school . . . about 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Since shortly after he learned to walk, Ryan Lemmon played baseball. He 
started on the varsity squad at Woodbridge High for four years, holds seven of 
the school's statistical records, and in 1993 was voted most valuable player. 
As a high school junior he went to the walk-on trials for the U.S. Olympic team 
(he didn't make it), and until his death he harbored semi-serious dreams of 
playing in the Major Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year he played at Pepperdine; this fall he returned to Rancho Santiago 
College to be with a former coach and teammates from Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Brown -- who met Lemmon at the batting cages when he was 12, then 
coached him for two years at Woodbridge -- said Lemmon's dedication and 
commitment served as an example to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemmon never missed the extra batting practice each day at 1 p.m., and 
adjourned to the gym for a weight workout after most field practices, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people believe they're invincible, and as a coach oftentimes you try to 
remind them to enjoy and love life and play to the fullest and take advantage 
of what they have, because it may not be there tomorrow," Brown said Tuesday. 
"A lot of them say, 'Coach, I've got forever and ever.' Now some of them have 
been reminded that there is no such thing as forever."

DANA PARSONS: IT'S TIME FOR ALL TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO BREAST CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've heard it before, either whispered in polite society or bellowed in less 
discreet settings: Why does AIDS seemingly get all the attention when other 
deadly diseases don't? Why do Hollywood stars wear red ribbons for AIDS but 
nothing, for example, for cancer or diabetes? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer may have many components, but everyone agrees on at least one 
thing: AIDS activists have been masterful at raising public awareness of their 
cause. Tens of thousands of people marching on state capitals across the 
country tends to draw attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether other groups feel resentment, envy or admiration for the national AIDS 
lobby, they uniformly concede its strategy is working. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why when breast cancer physician Dava Gerard discovered that an AIDS 
walk was scheduled this weekend in Los Angeles, on the same weekend as the 
annual Race for the Cure in Orange County, she confesses she was saddened and 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little bit of both," she says. "When I saw the AIDS walk was scheduled the 
same weekend, I said, 'There goes our L.A. coverage.' It's not that I don't 
have a lot of compassion (for AIDS victims). It was more like, 'Couldn't they 
pick a different week, so women are not being dinged again?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard's concern is that media attention will center on the AIDS event and not 
on breast cancer, which has killed more than 400,000 women in the last 10 
years, according to the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations. That 
figure is two to three times the number of AIDS deaths in the same period, 
according to various statistical sources. Breast cancer is the leading cause of 
death for women between 35 and 54, the alliance says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard has become wise to the ways of news coverage. Hollywood stars tend to 
adorn AIDS events, drawing media attention. And although the breast-cancer 
activists have some "stars" of their own, they tend to charge large sums for 
their appearances, in contrast to the AIDS activists, who often appear for 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the politics of disease-awareness. It would be trivial, perhaps, 
except that drawing attention to breast cancer is especially critical. That's 
because one-third of the women who die of breast cancer could be saved if they 
knew about early detection procedures, Gerard says. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely varying chances of getting the two diseases also factor in her 
frustration, Gerard says. While noting that both are catastrophic illnesses 
deserving of compassion toward their victims, she adds: "When you start looking 
at social issues, what I see is that AIDS by and large is preventable. There 
are large numbers of people where it's not preventable, but it's essentially 
preventable. I look at breast cancer, and that is not a preventable disease. 
Women are struck down seemingly at random from this disease, and it has nothing 
to do with what they've done and not done." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, she says, statistics suggest that one in roughly 1,000 or more women 
in Orange County will get AIDS at some point, compared with one in seven or 
eight who are likely to develop breast cancer in their lifetime. "So you're 
looking at a disease that is 100 times more common for women" to acquire, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS lobbyists succeeded because they went public with a very private disease. 
That, in essence, is what breast cancer patients must do. It's a step that 
historically has been difficult for women to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something that your grandmother or aunt had and they went away and had 
surgery and then came back," says Sueanne Pacini, spokeswoman for this 
weekend's breast cancer event. "If you were a daughter, you saw the scar and 
were shocked, but no one else even talked about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are obvious, Gerard says. Years ago, people were loath to discuss 
cancer, let alone breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Fleming is the director of social services for the AIDS Services 
Foundation of Orange County. That isn't the group sponsoring the AIDS event 
this weekend in Los Angeles, but I asked Fleming about other groups' feelings 
toward media attention of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she's aware of it and that women active in AIDS projects have brought 
up the subject themselves. "What I've heard is people coming back to the issue 
that we need not compete with each other. It's not about competition, it's 
about raising awareness. I think AIDS has taught a lot about the need to be 
vocal and to ask for what we need." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming says she's not resentful of criticisms, either veiled or otherwise, 
about the AIDS lobby. She says she sees both sides of the issue, as would other 
AIDS activists who have friends or relatives afflicted with other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, breast-cancer activists are expecting 10,000 people at the 
Saturday-Sunday event at the Newport Center, according to spokeswoman Pacini. 
</P>
<P>
 The old reality of breast cancer -- meaning that for years women didn't openly 
discuss it -- is changing. Angry, shouting women may never assault Washington 
with placards as AIDS activists have, but, day by day, they're beginning to 
come out of the closet.

LAWYER BLAMES CLIENT'S AMNESIA FOR 2 SHOP KILLINGS; COURTS: DOUGLAS STANLEY, 
58, OF WESTMINSTER IS ACCUSED OF SLAYING HIS SISTER-IN-LAW AND A CO-WORKER. 
PROSECUTION CONTENDS THAT GRUDGES -- NOT MEDICAL CONDITIONS -- LED TO 1993 
SHOOTINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westminster man was suffering from a form of amnesia triggered by stress and 
a bad heart when he gunned down his sister-in-law and another woman in July, 
1993, and then fled to Colorado where he was later captured, a jury was told 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual defense was revealed during opening statements in Orange County 
Superior Court as trial began for Douglas F. Stanley, 58, who faces life in 
prison without parole if convicted of killing Joyce Stanley and Terry Vasquez 
at the Fountain Valley embroidery shop where the three worked together. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Robert Molko told jurors that Stanley plotted the killing because 
of longstanding grudges against the women, and blamed his sister-in-law for his 
estrangement from his daughter. He also did not like having the two women as 
his supervisors at the business, which was owned by Joyce Stanley, 52, Molko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Stanley sat impassively, his head cocked to one side, Deputy Public 
Defender Denise Gragg told the jury that her client could have not premeditated 
the killings -- a factor needed to prove first-degree murder -- because the 
brain damage he was suffering rendered him unaware of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is in, essentially, a stroke" at the time of the shootings, Gragg told 
jurors, adding that her client began suffering "transient global amnesia," and 
only snapped out of the trance-like state when he found himself driving his 
sister-in-law's car in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the trial's opening arguments offered some insight into 
the July 8, 1993, shooting, which sparked a nationwide manhunt for the fleeing 
suspect. Stanley was captured July 11, after a gun fell out of one of his pants 
legs while he was talking to a Colorado state trooper. 
</P>
<P>
 Family tension dates back at least to 1991, the prosecutor said. The 
defendant's brother and sister-in-law, Charles and Joyce Stanley, sought 
guardianship of the defendant's daughter, Lisa, at that time, because of 
Douglas Stanley's transient lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not fight the guardianship, he blamed Joyce Stanley for his 
poor relationship with the girl, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never forgave Joyce for what he termed 'taking Lisa away from him,' " said 
Molko, who told jurors that the defendant boasted to a friend shortly before 
the killings that he was finally about to get his revenge. He also called a 
friend after the killings and bragged "I did it!" Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ironic twist, the victim seemed to care about the defendant. Joyce 
Stanley nursed the defendant back to health after by-pass heart surgery about a 
year before the killing and was constantly urging him to take care of himself, 
Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent effort to undermine defense contentions about Stanley's 
diminished capacity, Molko also stressed in his opening statement that Douglas 
Stanley withdrew a large sum of money from the bank shortly before the killing, 
repeatedly lied about his involvement in the slayings, and successfully eluded 
authorities for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends described Stanley as a "survivalist" type who collected guns and made 
it a habit to threaten people who angered him. Gragg told jurors those were 
hollow threats, and noted that relatives never feared Stanley in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is at least some evidence, according to the prosecutor, that 
relatives shied away from confronting the defendant. Joyce and Charles Stanley 
were planning to move their business out of state and secretly bought a house 
near the new location. 
</P>
<P>
 They were taking Douglas Stanley with them to a new apartment, but then 
planned to move to the new house and leave Douglas Stanley behind, Molko told 
jurors. Stanley also was angry because he believed Vasquez knew more about the 
relocation arrangements than he did, Molko said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CENTRAL; GARDEN GROVE; 2 SUSPECTS SOUGHT AFTER 2 ARE 
STABBED, 1 FATALLY

 Police are searching for two men in connection with the stabbing death of one 
man and the wounding of another who tried to break up a fight between a woman 
and her boyfriend Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the stabbings occurred about 3:45 p.m. after the woman called the 
victims on the telephone for help during an argument with her boyfriend at 
their mobile home in Meadowlark Mobile Estates, 12152 Trask Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Ramirez, 27, of Orange was stabbed in the neck and died at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange. Jose Rodriguez, 20, of Santa Ana was treated for a stab wound 
to an arm and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims had gone to help Rena Courette, 19. She had been arguing with her 
boyfriend, Miguel de Jesus Silva, 23, police said. Silva's friend and neighbor, 
Keith Zavala, 19, came across the street to help Silva after Ramirez and 
Rodriguez joined the argument, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Zavala is suspected of stabbing the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva and Zavala fled in Ramirez's red 1981 Mustang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbings disrupted what neighbors say is usually a peaceful mobile-home 
park. On Tuesday, bloodstains remained on the street outside Silva's mobile 
home while neighbors sat on their porches surrounded by flowerpots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very proud of not having troubles here. This is a damn shame," said 
manager David E. Wilson. "They (Silva and Zavala) were nice kids. They were 
very polite and very nice. I never had a problem with them," he said. DEBBIE

 Jean-Maurice Ripert, the consul general of France, spent an afternoon this 
week being interviewed on topics including Haiti, Bosnia and Russia for a new 
cable television public access program produced by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, "World Affairs Update" with Scott Allen Gates, focuses on global 
issues as viewed by guests who range from college professors to experts on 
foreign policy.It is shot in the Comcast studio at Buena Park High School and 
its makers are people who completed a monthlong workshop on how to film, edit 
and produce a television program. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people are aware of the workshops, which are free and open to any resident 
of Fullerton, Placentia or Buena Park, said Susan Grab, community access 
coordinator of the Comcast Public Access for North Orange County program. 
</P>
<P>
 Once people complete the monthlong workshops, they can produce their own shows 
for no more than the cost of the videotapes, Grab said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said most programs last about two years and range in format from musicals 
to talk shows touching on everything from medical technology to building 
aircraft to environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, 33, said that for himself and his partner, producer Nick Mamoenas, 41, 
their new show is a way to arouse a "thirst for knowledge in regards to the 
world around our audience." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience can be 30,000 to 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour program will be on twice a week sometime between 5 and 9 p.m. on 
weekdays. Viewers can tune in to the show on Channel 55 in Buena Park or 
Channel 65 in Fullerton or Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 She said anyone interested in enrolling in the workshops, which take place 
Wednesdays from 3 to 6 p.m., should call her at (714) 680-8842.MIMI KO

<P>
 Who: Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County 
</P>
<P>
 Contribution: Raised more than $6,000 at the center's first benefit golf 
tournament on Aug. 23 at Tustin Ranch Golf Course. Established in 1958, the 
center mobilizes institutions and individuals to meet community needs. The 
center placed 27,000 volunteers at nonprofit agencies in 1993, and trained more 
than 3,000 people on how to manage nonprofit groups. The center, headquartered 
in Santa Ana, is a partner of the Points of Light Foundation and the United Way 
of Orange County. GARDEN GROVE

<P>
 Who: Garden Grove Elks Lodge, Strawberry Festival Assn., City Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Contribution: Donated money to pay for six video cameras that were recently 
installed in patrol cars of the Garden Grove Police Department. The police 
sought help from the community to buy the fist-sized video cameras to help 
officers record traffic stops and other investigations. Police Lt. Ken Adair 
said that police now recognize the value of the video camera following the 
April, 1993, shooting of Officer Howard E. Dallies Jr., who was killed by an 
unidentified man during a routine traffic stop. Video cameras are effective in 
gathering evidence and reducing investigation time, Adair said. They also can 
be a protection to motorists, because officers are expected to follow proper 
procedures since their actions are being recorded. COSTA MESA

<P>
 A 30-year-old man was critically wounded when he was stabbed by an 
acquaintance early Tuesday morning at a low-income housing complex in Costa 
Mesa, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Pawel Kawalko of Costa Mesa was stabbed in his left shoulder, abdomen 
and right arm, police said.Police arrested Tomasz Zbigniew Budniak, 33, on 
suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Budniak is a resident of the Costa Mesa Village complex, 2450 Newport Blvd., 
where the stabbing took place. 
</P>
<P>
 After the stabbing, Budniak ran out of his room screaming for paramedics, 
fellow residents said. Residents said he also pulled the fire alarm, apparently 
in an effort to summon emergency help faster.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was my smoke detector," said Tom Johnson, 51, a resident who was 
getting ready for bed when the alarm went off around 1 a.m. "Just as I came 
out, this guy comes running out over to the bushes. He ran over (to the gate) 
when police came." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the complex declined to comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said when they arrived, they found Budniak armed with a knife and 
covered with blood. Kawalko was found in one of the rooms, Capt. Tom Lazar 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kawalko was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he was in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawalko was visiting Budniak when the two got into an quarrel, Lazar said. He 
declined tosay what the argument was about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa Village is a transformed Travelodge Motel with 96 units. It is 
the first "single-room occupancy" complex in Orange County that provides 
housing for single people making less than $20,000 a year, said Merrill Butler, 
one of the complex's developers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first violent incident since the complex's development in late 
1992, Butler said. NANCY HSU

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO CONSIDER HIRING LANDSCAPE 
CONTRACTOR 
</P>

<P>
 The city could save an estimated $100,000 a year by contracting its roadside 
landscape maintenance out to a private business, a city committee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very light figure.The number is probably closer to $125,000," said 
Dave Niederhaus, director of the General Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is the result of two studies -- one in-house and one by an 
independent consultant -- undertaken after the City Council requested that city 
department heads examine what services might be privatized. 
</P>
<P>
 If it meets the approval of the City Council Monday, Niederhaus said, he will 
look into "piggybacking" a contract with Costa Mesa or another city that uses a 
private tree trimmer for the same services. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the savings would be in salary and benefits costs. Contracting out 
services could mean reducing the general services staff by up to six positions, 
but layoffs are unlikely because five positions are currently open. 
</P>
<P>
 If those positions are eliminated, Niederhaus said he would have to consider 
cutting a management position so the department will not be top-heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he said, an outside contractor would be encouraged to hire any 
city employee whose job was eliminated, and the city would try to place workers 
in other departments ifnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also possible that up to seven other employees could face salary 
reductions and/or demotions as part of the process, Niederhaus noted, so the 
city would have to meet with the employee union before finalizing a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Private landscapers have been forced to lower their prices in recent years 
because of the recession, he said. The city contracted out landscaping services 
under similar circumstances in the late 1970s, but switched back to in-house 
trimming after a year because contractor prices rose. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 Two events honoring former Willis Warner Middle School Principal Joan Read 
will be held this week, a school district spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Read, 62, retired recently after almost 40 years with the Westminster School 
District, where she served as teacher and principal on several campuses, 
district spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Read's last year as principal at Warner, the school won a Golden Bell 
Award for its language arts program. The award is the highest honor bestowed by 
the California School Boards Assn., Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner will host an assembly at 12:15 p.m. today, which will be open to the 
public. Between 2 to 4 p.m., the school will host a community tea to honor Read 
in the school multipurpose room, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, friends and community members will hold a $30-a-plate dinner in her 
honor. The dinner will be at Seacliff Country Club, 6501 Palm Ave., in 
Huntington Beach.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ANGELS COACHES TO GIVE KIDS POINTERS

<P>
 The Angels coaching staff is going to bat for thousands of youngsters who were 
disappointed by the abrupt ending of the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 They will host a clinic at Anaheim Stadium on Saturday to give hitting and 
fielding pointers to Junior Angels fan club members who were upset last month 
when their trip to Anaheim Stadium for the Angels-Indians game was canceled by 
the players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters will also finally be able to empty the helmet banks they had 
filled with coins to aid the National Childhood Cancer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some disappointed Junior Angels spent months collecting change and complained 
when the strike appeared to scuttle the fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really thrilled about the event," said foundation spokesman Bob Pannoni, 
whose two children are Junior Angels. "The fact that these managers and coaches 
are coming in when they're worried about their jobs, and are willing to meet 
their obligation to us is fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Angels who cannot attend Saturday's event are asked to send the money 
they raised directly to the foundation at P.O. Box 60012, Arcadia, Calif. 
91066-6012, Pannoni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to compensate for the season's cancellation, all 1994 Junior Angels will 
receive free memberships in the Junior Angels Club next year, as the $5 
membership fee is waived. Junior Angels receive four free tickets to two games, 
a fan magazine, some baseball cards and a chance to become an honorary batboy 
or bat girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium will open at 11:30 a.m. Saturday for those showing their 
Junior Angels Club Membership Card. LYNN FRANEY

 Ernie and Virginia Cushing perform a job each Friday morning that enriches 
their lives and makes the lives of homebound seniors better. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, both 74, are among 45 volunteers at the Seniors' Outreach Center 
who deliver lunch and dinner to other seniors.Currently, meals are delivered 
each weekday to 75 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people appreciate it so much, they really depend on us -- we may be the 
only people they see and talk to all day," Ernie Cushing said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old Meals to the Home Program, like other city programs, is being 
threatened by budget cuts. Volunteers who deliver meals will not be reimbursed 
for mileage under the proposed budget for next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the $5,000 reduction is approved by the City Council next week, it will be 
difficult to recruit and keep volunteers, Ernie Cushing said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while some volunteers don't collect the reimbursement, for others 
it is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday, with coolers in the back of their car, the Cushings 
delivered frozen dinners of breaded steak, mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables, 
salad, plums, muffins and chocolate cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the recipients was Margaret Cookerley, 95. She has been receiving meals 
for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookerley can still play the piano and get around with the aid of a walker, 
but she is unable to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful for the meal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookerley said the volunteers deliver more than just the meal -- they provide 
friendship and companionship. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Cushing said the volunteer work is rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all make you feel good because they make you feel like you're doing 
something helpful," she said.DEBRA CANO

<P>
 Virgil Fouts, a long-time community volunteer, died Monday, just days after 
receiving an award created especially for him by the La Habra Area Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Fouts, 64, was known throughout the city as a volunteer who donated time and 
money to nonprofit groups that help the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Habra Heights resident, the co-owner of an electrical contracting 
business in La Habra, was honored with the chamber's "Special Achievement 
Award." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Joy, said: "It was very humbling for him to realize the appreciation 
people had for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Fouts was chief of the La Habra Heights volunteer fire department in the 
1970s, past president of the La Habra Area Chamber of Commerce and served on 
the boards of several nonprofit organizations in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 His death came after a six-year battle with cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 His wife said that even when he was in pain, he always kept his commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a person of his word," she said. "If he said he was going to help with 
something, he would do it even if he had to crawl. He was very caring." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Fouts is survived by two sons, Randy, 41, of Buena 
Park, and Larry, 37, of Monrovia, a daughter, Theresa Flor, 39, of La Habra 
Heights and 12 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be sent to the building 
fund of La Habra Christian Church, 1400 Vella Vista Drive, La Habra Heights, 
90631. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held at the church Friday at 3:30 p.m. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SADDLEBACK/SOUTH BEACH; SAN CLEMENTE; COUNCIL TO WEIGH 
PLAN FOR PIER BOWL DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans have been submitted for an estimated $15.6-million development on the 
scenic bluffs overlooking the city pier, including the historic Casa Romantica. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for converting Casa Romantica into a restaurant and 
building time-share condominiums and retail shops in the Pier Bowl area.The 
City Council will take a first look at the plans tonight but is not expected to 
vote until public hearings are held. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest task before the two developers -- Continental Commercial Corp. and 
Riverside Commercial Investors Inc. -- may be convincing a dubious public, 
which four years ago caused a similar proposal to be scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, however, say the new plans are far less dense than the 1990 
project submitted by the Ratkovich Co., which prompted hundreds of residents to 
attend meetings and speak up out of fear that their quiet, seaside atmosphere 
would be shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee you that the scale of this project is far smaller than 
Ratkovich," said Jim Pechous, assistant city planner. "The uses are the same, 
but the density isn't even close. Much less than half, I'd say." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the proposal are already lining up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be just as controversial" as the Ratkovich project, said Karolyn 
Koester, a former mayor and community activist. "We don't want the Casa 
Romantica to be a restaurant, people (living near the project site) just don't 
want commercial property below them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the city just wants the money that this would bring in," Koester 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that money is important, but far down the list of 
priorities in developing the Pier Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no denying we'd like to see economic development," City Manager 
Michael W. Parness said, "but our first priority is to preserve quality of that 
area, particularly the Casa Romantica." FRANK MESSINA

FOCUS ON CREEK POLLUTION

<P>
 Putting aside their differences, seven of South County's largest water 
districts Tuesday joined an informal task force to help keep Aliso Creek clean. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts and county environmental and health officials were invited by 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) to discuss solutions to the pollution problem that has caused 
popular Aliso Beach to be closed frequently over the decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, conflicts have erupted among water districts that belong to the 
Aliso Water Management Agency, a powerful umbrella agency for the seven water 
districts serving more than200,000 south Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the controversy and conflict over all these years," Bergeson 
said, "it's very heartening that they're not tossing bricks at each other but 
sitting down and talking over their differences." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-mile creek, which starts near Cook's Corner in Trabuco Canyon and 
meanders southwest to Aliso Beach, has carried an increasing number of harmful 
sewage spills and urban runoff that reach the sea and force beach closures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ongoing, long-term problem," said Laguna Beach Mayor Ann 
Christoph, who attended Tuesday's meeting, "that has gotten incrementally more 
troublesome." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that all these water districts and county officials are here is an 
indication there is a crisis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent spill occurred June 20, when 16,000 gallons of partially 
treated sewage dumped into the creek reached the ocean and caused county health 
officials to bar public use of the beach for three days. In 1994, the beach has 
been closed for 16 days because of creek pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian M. Smith, a co-founder of Surfrider Foundation's Laguna Beach 
chapter, had insisted on a formal task force for Aliso Creek, saying that 
water-borne illnesses are plaguing swimmers and surfers. He also took exception 
with the county's method for counting illnesses, which showed no illnesses were 
reported by swimmers in a 2 1/2-year period from January, 1992, to September, 
1994. DAVID REYES

TRUSTEES TO REDRAW BOUNDARIES 
</P>

<P>
 Saddleback Community College District trustees have decided to redraw election 
area boundaries before the November, 1996, election. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are elected by districtwide vote, but they must live in the trustee 
area they represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees on Monday, after nearly a year of discussion, resolved to change 
boundaries in order to have roughly the same number of people in each trustee 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees also asked district staff to prepare information on the pros and cons 
of both at-large elections and ward elections, district spokeswoman Diane 
Riopka said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board had five seats when the district was formed in 1967. That was 
increased to seven in 1972, which was also the last time changes were made to 
trustee area boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether to reconfigure trustee area boundaries first came up last 
November but it wasn't until Monday that trustees took action. 
</P>
<P>
 Because trustees are elected at-large, the district is not required by the 
state education code to redraw trustee areas to balance the population among 
the seven areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost to reconfigure trustee area boundaries will be about 
$10,000 to $12,000, according to a staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of public meetings must be held before the district can submit an 
approved petition and maps to the Orange County Committee on School District 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The paperwork would have to be turned in by March 1, 1996, to change trustee 
area boundaries before the general election. JEFF BEAN

<P>
 An explosion planned 140 feet below the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station in 
October to map hidden fault lines has a few residents questioning the safety of 
the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 But a station spokesman said the explosion will not endanger the vast 
stockpiles of high-powered armaments at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake scientists plan to set off a series of 60 ammonium nitrate 
explosions beginning Oct. 24 along a path from Seal Beach to Barstow. The goal 
of the experiments, conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Southern 
California Earthquake Center, is to predict what areas will be most affected by 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a site here on the weapons station where they're going to drill a 
hole for some explosives, but it's away from any ordnance," said weapons 
station spokesman Joe Davidson. "There is no cause for alarm. We've been told 
that at most, it's going to be a dull thud." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William J. Doane, who represents Leisure World, said some residents 
have raised concerns about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The residents who have called me seem to lack confidence in the scientists," 
Doane said. "The people's concern is that when they get going in there, they're 
going to set things off." 
</P>
<P>
 Leisure World resident Edith Wolff, 72, said the public should be concerned 
about the potential consequences of the seismic explosions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned that they don't really know what they're doing -- they're just 
experimenting," Wolff said. "We're trying to outguess nature, and I think 
that's going to be the downfall of the human race." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar experiments have been conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area without 
incident. Geological survey scientists said the largest blasts, planned only 
for rural areas, will amount to a magnitude 2.5 earthquake and will not trigger 
other earthquakes. A representative from the Geological Survey will discuss the 
experiment at the Monday City Council meeting.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NORTHWEST; CYPRESS; SCHOOL SMOKING BAN TAKES EFFECT DEC. 
19 
</P>

<P>
 Smoking will be forbidden as of Dec. 19 in any building owned by the Cypress 
School District regardless of the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
 And beginning July 1, 1995, "all individuals are prohibited from using tobacco 
products (anywhere) on district property or in district vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 The new edicts were unanimously adopted by the school board as part of the 
district's "tobacco-free workplace" policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government is prodding all school districts to implement such 
policies. A new federal law, which will take effect Dec. 26, requires public 
schools to ban smoking in their buildings regardless of the age of the smoker 
or time of day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress School District board on Sept. 13 adopted a ban on tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the school board, district staff said, "One expected outcome of 
the tobacco-free policy is the communication of a consistent message: Tobacco 
use is hazardous for adults as well as students and therefore unacceptable in 
the school setting. Further, the district has a legislative mandate to 
alleviate the hazards of the presence and use of tobacco products on any 
district-owned properties, including district vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote on the anti-smoking policy, trustee Edward K. Southfield 
jokingly asked, "Does this mean I can't have an occasional cigar?" 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Donna McDougall responded, "It means just that."BILL BILLITER

SUPERVISORS ASK DEVELOPERS TO REVISE COURTHOUSE PLANS; PROJECT: BOARD CALLS FOR 
SCALED-BACK COMPLEX IN SOUTH COUNTY THAT WOULD COST $5 MILLION ANNUALLY FOR 30 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following a plea from the South Municipal Court presiding judge for more 
courtrooms, county supervisors voted Tuesday to have four developers submit 
revised, less costly, proposals for a new court complex.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is no more room at the South Court Inn," Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles 
told the Board of Supervisors. "A solution must be found." 
</P>
<P>
 The county is trying to have a private developer build a complex with 19 
courtrooms, which the county would lease for 30 years with the option of buying 
it at the end of the lease for $100. Initially, the developers estimated the 
project would cost the county at least $10 million annually for the next 30 
years. That is roughly twice what the county staff estimates the county can 
afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of abandoning the project, the supervisors voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to ask 
the developers to scale back their plans so the project would cost about $5 
million annually for 30 years. The developers will be asked to reduce the 
acreage of the project, look for savings in construction costs and modify the 
lease terms with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "As South County continues to grow, the need for new courtrooms becomes 
critical," said board Chairman Thomas F. Riley. "The project remains a top 
priority and significant work needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also directed county staff to evaluate the possibility of 
expanding the South County court facility on Crown Valley Parkway in Laguna 
Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles said judges in South County do not have enough space in the existing 
seven courtrooms to handle an ever-increasing workload.  
</P>
<P>
 "In America these days, suing each other often passes for a national pastime," 
Iles said. "And . . . with the advent of task force justice programs that focus 
the energies of law enforcement agencies on crime, we must not forget that the 
place where all this work ultimately gets done is in the courts."  
</P>
<P>
 Iles said the county has dragged its feet long enough on building a new court 
complex in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court has delayed, deferred, compromised, negotiated and worked with the 
county. It's time for resolution of the impending crisis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said he will consider the needs 
of the court officials in South County but that the county is "going to build 
what we can afford and not anything more." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I think South Court should be pleased that for the first time ever, 
there has been a financial commitment by the board to build a project down 
there. That is a first." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the supervisors selected a developer to build a 
$50-million office complex in Santa Ana for the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi has said that office space is so limited in the 
Santa Ana courthouse that two attorneys sometimes work in a small office 
intended for one. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer will finance construction of the seven-story building and lease 
it back to the county for about $5.5 million a year for the next 30 years. At 
the end of the lease, the county will have the option of buying the building 
for $100.

EX-CHEERLEADER'S SUIT CLAIMS SCHOOL CHARGED ILLEGAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former cheerleader at Newport Harbor High School has sued the school 
district and several administrators, alleging that cheerleaders are illegally 
charged nearly $7,000 in fees for uniforms, transportation and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Delaney, 17, and her parents, Eileen and Philip Delaney, also contend 
that cheerleaders are graded by an adviser who is not credentialed, and that 
Heather was excluded from the tryout process this year because her mother 
questioned the required fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mac Bernd, superintendent of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District and one 
of the named defendants, said a district committee reviewed the family's 
complaints about the program in an internal hearing process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been working with the Delaneys for the last six or eight months on 
this issue," Bernd said. "We were saddened that they weren't satisfied with the 
resolution that came from that process." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Superior Court lawsuit alleges that the district is 
violating sections of the state Education Code forbidding public schools from 
charging fees for participation in classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd said he would not respond to allegations that involved the state 
Education Code. But Assistant Supt. Robert Francy said, "We have no programs 
where students are required to buy their own uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the allegation that an adviser is grading students, Francy said 
cheerleading program adviser Candace Jackson would "recommend a grade to the 
supervising staff member or administrator," Assistant Principal Lee Gaeta, who 
finalizes the grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd described the cheerleading program as part course work, part 
extracurricular, but said grades do count toward the student's grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really a combination of the two," he said. "There are some cheer 
activities in our school district that is a class. They receive elective credit 
for it, I believe." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also notes that football players and participants in "other 
male-dominated athletic programs" are not required to pay fees for tryouts, 
coaching, participation, transportation to games and special events, and 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Francy said he did not know how much cheerleaders pay in fees related to 
participation each year. "That's generally established between the adviser and 
the parent (booster) group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheerleaders, unlike football players, provide their own uniforms because they 
wear those -- and not street clothes -- to school, Bernd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great deal of the time I would say there is some savings on clothing to the 
parents because the uniforms get so much wear," Bernd said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that football players often wear their jerseys to classes on 
game days, but said that is different because they do not wear their entire 
uniforms to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd and Francy declined comment on the Delaneys' allegation that Heather was 
excluded from the pep squad in retaliation for complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather has since transferred to another high school.  
</P>
<P>
 The discrimination allegations recall another case brought by a former Irvine 
cheerleader, Melissa Fontes, who alleged that cheerleaders were held to a 
higher academic standard than the male athletes they cheered. A state appellate 
court agreed. The state Supreme Court let that decision stand but ruled that it 
should not set a legal precedent for other cases.

CAL STATE FULLERTON PLAYS KEY ECONOMIC ROLE, STUDY SAYS; EDUCATION: UNIVERSITY 
OFFICIALS SAY SALARIES, BENEFITS AND SPENDING PROVIDE ANNUAL $489-MILLION BOOST 
TO THE COUNTY. SCHOOL MAY ALSO SOON BE CITY'S LARGEST EMPLOYER. 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton contributes more than college graduates to Orange County, 
according to a new report the university released Tuesday: it also pumps about 
$489 million into the county's economy every year.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's Institute for Economic and Environmental Studies 
reported that salaries, benefits and other spending by the university have a 
$320.9-million economic impact on the county. And when students buy pens and 
pencils, get a few hamburgers at local fast-food spots and go to the movies, it 
adds up to an additional $168.3 million annually, researchers concluded.  
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted during the 1992-93 fiscal year, is the most comprehensive 
ever done on the economic impact of the Fullerton campus, said Robert A. 
Kleinhenz, the report's co-author. 
</P>
<P>
 "The university definitely makes an economic contribution, because it's 
bringing dollars into the community that might not be here otherwise," said 
Kleinhenz, a Cal State Fullerton economics lecturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The university is not just an institution for instruction," Kleinhenz said. 
It is "a purchaser of goods and services from businesses in Orange County and 
outside. Students buy books, food and other amenities. There are also a variety 
of functions that bring members of the community to the campus for theater and 
athletic events -- and they not only buy tickets, but spend money on 
restaurants and parking." 
</P>
<P>
 With about 2,800 full-time and part-time workers, the university is 
Fullerton's second-largest employer. It could become the city's largest 
employer within two years, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest employer, Hughes Aircraft Co., has about 6,800 people on its 
payroll in Fullerton, but the company announced last week that its Fullerton 
plant will be closed over the next two years. Most of the Fullerton employees 
will be transferred to plants in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 University President Milton A. Gordon commissioned the report, which also 
indicated that spending traced to the university generated a total of 9,082 
full-time and part-time jobs in the county in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said he is "amazingly pleased at the results" of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know the importance of the university intuitively, but now this 
quantifies it," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleinhenz and Anil K. Puri, an economics professor and the report's other 
author, said Cal State Fullerton has an impact outside Orange County as well. 
They found that the university had an impact totaling $591 million in the rest 
of Southern California, where it created 11,203 full-time and part-time jobs in 
1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 A UC Irvine study on its economic impact in 1992-93 indicated that UCI 
generated an economic impact of $1.01 billion in Orange County. More people 
work for UCI than Cal State Fullerton: UCI had about 9,700 employees, about 
1,000 of whom were faculty, that year. Fewer students attend UCI, however. In 
1992-93, about 17,000 went to UCI, while about 23,600 attended Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University's most recent economic impact report, in 1991, showed it 
contributed nearly $46 million to the county's economy in the 1990-91 year.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to reporting on its effect on the local economy, the Cal State 
Fullerton study found that Fullerton graduates return the state's educational 
investment back to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the school's graduates settle not far from the campus. As of fall, 
1993, the university had awarded 100,764 degrees, and 85% of those graduates 
currently live in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleinhenz and Puri said state taxpayers spend about $26,900 to educate each 
student that graduates from the California State University system. The 
economists estimated that each Cal State Fullerton graduate will pay about 
$94,770 more in state taxes over a lifetime than a student with just a high 
school diploma, reaping a $67,870 return to the state for the education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The return is 250%," Puri said. "This is a good investment, no matter how you 
look at it."

LOCAL ELECTIONS / WESTMINSTER MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL; VOTE REPRESENTS CALM AFTER 
THE STORM OF JUNE RECALL TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Compared to the unsuccessful recall election in June, the Nov. 8 municipal 
election here is like an after-thought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1986, when the mayor was first elected directly by 
the voters, there is only one candidate: Mayor Charles V. Smith, who will win a 
fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 And just three candidates are seeking the two open seats on the City Council: 
Margie L. Rice, 65, a trustee of the Westminster School District, and the 
incumbents, Craig Schweisinger, 47, a businessman, and Tony Lam, 58, a 
restaurant owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Local elections are often contentious in this city, but the bitter campaign to 
remove Smith, Lam, Schweisinger and Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman over last 
year's budget cuts in the Fire Department seems to have dampened the political 
fervor among potential candidates and the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for a cooling off period," said Joy Neugebauer, a three-time mayor 
who lost to Smith in the 1992 election, and was widely expected to run again 
this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of running for city government, Neugebauer, the first mayor directly 
elected by the people, is running to for director of Division 2 of the Orange 
County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Russell, a Little Saigon developer, took out nomination papers for mayor 
this summer but decided a few days before the Aug. 12 filing deadline not to 
run. He cited the press of business, saying he could not devote enough time to 
running a campaign or to serving as mayor, if he won. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort was backed by the Westminster Firefighters Assn. and sparked 
when the council slashed $1 million from the Fire Department's $6.6-million 
budget. The recall was defeated as residents backed the incumbents by a 2-1 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council got a vote of confidence from the people," said Smith, 62, a 
retired aerospace engineering manager, adding that the recall's failure may 
have deterred challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 On many issues the candidates for the two at-large council seats agree. All 
say that trimming city expenditures and seeking new sources of income are the 
biggest challenge for the council. They voice strong support for improving 
police service and youth and recreational programs, and advocate spending by 
the city to upgrade its aging water and sewer lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a still soft economy and the state periodically taking away property 
taxes, the candidates disagree about how much to spend on improving the 
business and cultural climate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was among a council majority that voted 3 to 2 recently to use federal 
community development block grants to build a community cultural arts center. 
The $8.8-million project would include building a park and the rehabilitation 
of the 15th Street apartments across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam and Schweisinger opposed the project, saying the grant money would be 
better spent on affordable housing or more pressing community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said she favors a community cultural center but would build something 
more modest. 
</P>
<P>
 All the candidates also favor the development of Little Saigon and its 
conversion to a tourist destination in the mold of San Francisco's Chinatown, 
but they have different views on how such a project should be financed and how 
involved city government should be in its development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lam complains that the city is not moving fast enough, or allocating enough 
money for improvements as recommended by an advisory panel of merchants formed 
two years ago. One of the recommendations was to set up a cultural center where 
events such as the annual Tet Festival could be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweisinger said he supports some form of an assessment district to pay for 
the improvements, but he insists that only property owners who would directly 
benefit should pay the special assessment, and not all property owners in 
Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said she favors creating a tourist and trade center in Little Saigon but 
is unsure how involved city government should be in the project and has not 
studied the different ways to finance such a development. She said such a 
project should not be undertaken by the city at the expense of other 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who is leaving for Vietnam Nov. 11 with seven other U.S. mayors on a 
fact-finding trip, said he expects to see Little Saigon become an important 
link in an increasing trade with Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be true in the past that we've taken out tax money more than we put 
in," Smith said of Little Saigon, which officials said provides about $2 
million a year in sales and property taxes. "But we'll correct that in 
partnership with the merchants there." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pressing problems the council will face after the election is 
finishing work on an ordinance that would regulate the conversion of mobile 
home parks to commercial and other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam and Schweisinger favor a draft ordinance recently recommended by the 
Planning Commission. It would give more benefits to mobile home park residents 
displaced by the closure of a mobile home park than are provided by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith called the draft unfair to mobile home park owners because it will make 
relocation of mobile home residents too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said that a mobile home park conversion ordinance with benefits greater 
than state law provides is necessary to protect the residents of the city's 18 
mobile home parks, but she said she is unfamiliar with the measure before the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, who is on the board of the Midway City Sanitary District, is making a 
third run for the council, after losing in 1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that the people of Westminster deserve a choice," said Rice, who lost 
to Lam by 132 votes out of about 14,000 cast in a 1992 contest. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning that election, Lam became the first Vietnamese American to hold 
public office in the nation. During his first term, Lam said, he has succeeded 
in erasing the perception that he represents only the Vietnamese community, 
which makes up about 20% of the city's population of 81,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that what I've been doing was for the good of everybody, not just a 
particular ethnic group," Lam said. "I've helped make Westminster a better 
place to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 Schweisinger, who is seeking his second term, said that city officials are now 
being asked to do more for less, and council members should be good financial 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do things better," Schweisinger said. "We have to do things 
cheaper because the economy is such that we can't rely on sales and property 
anymore. The state takes our money at every turn."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; THE OUTER LIMITS OF PROSECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attacks against people because of their race, religion or sexual orientation 
occur with such appalling regularity they have their own designation: hate 
crimes. But hate-crime prosecution is more easily called for than done. 
</P>
<P>
 State law defines a hate crime as "the interference through force or threat 
with an individual's civil rights" on the basis of race, religion, nationality 
or ethnic background. Also included are attacks on gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors need to be vigorous in pressing hate-crime charges that they can 
make stick, but society cannot count on the legal system alone to create a 
climate of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LAYMAN'S VIEW: Consider last week's gun killing in Orange County of Vernon 
Windell Flournoy. Sure, it was a hate crime "from a layman's perspective," 
notes Huntington Beach Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg, because one of the 
accused was a reputed associate of white supremacists and Flournoy was African 
American. Accused in the killing are Jonathan Russell Kennedy, 19, a so-called 
skinhead, and a 17-year-old. In addition, Kennedy is charged with the attempted 
murder of two Latino men last month, also in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are considering filing hate-crime charges in both cases, but such 
cases can be difficult to prove. Establishing a hate crime as defined by state 
law requires prosecutors to prove that a suspect deliberately targeted a victim 
for racial or other specified characteristics. In another case, the district 
attorney filed hate-crime charges in the beating death of a black woman at a La 
Habra mall but dropped them when further evidence showed a dispute over a 
parking space was one cause of the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the district attorney upgraded charges in an attack on a black high 
school student to attempted murder but declined a hate-crime prosecution on the 
grounds there was insufficient evidence to prove race was a motivating factor. 
Although to a layman it certainly looked like a racial case, proving the case 
in court under the official standards is a different matter. 
</P>
<P>
 TEACHING OUR YOUNG: At the same time, fortunately, Los Angeles and Orange 
counties' human relations commissions have done good work in documenting hate 
crimes, and private watchdog groups have been aggressive in spotlighting 
outrages and using civil laws where applicable to thwart hatemongers. This 
vigilance and good police work are necessary. But equally so is education, 
starting at home with instruction on diversity and the need for tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 School discussions, sermons from the pulpit, community meetings sponsored by 
service organizations -- all can help steer young people away from hate and 
toward a reaffirmation of democratic values. These are not easy tasks, but they 
are the important work we all must do in striving to build and maintain a just 
society, supported by effective law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate-crime cases in Orange and Los Angeles counties are yet more reminders 
that bigotry is dangerous, and that multicultural California cannot afford to 
shrug off this corrosive and demoralizing evil.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL; ROUGH SOCCER PLAY ADDRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the surface, Orange Empire Conference men's soccer seemed very cheery last 
season. Irvine Valley won its first State title, the third such triumph for a 
conference team. Orange Coast won State titles in 1989 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a unpleasant side as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches, athletic directors and game officials were shaken by the rapid 
increase in violent play and verbal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible year," said Barry Wallace, conference representative to 
men's soccer and OCC athletic director. "We had assistant coaches spitting and 
getting all over officials and players (doing it) too." 
</P>
<P>
 There were several violent plays and near fights last season and a Golden 
West-Rancho Santiago game was called in the second half because of a 
bench-clearing altercation. 
</P>
<P>
 The unsportsmanlike attitudes displayed on the field last season have resulted 
in rule changes for this season involving yellow and red cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rules adopted in August: players must sit out one game after 
accumulating three yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
 After the suspension, players have a clean slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, there was no penalty for accumulating yellow cards unless a player 
got two in the same game, which resulted in an ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something (Orange Coast) has wanted for a long, long time," Pirate Coach 
Laird Hayes said. "We're on the honor system (in nonconference games) to report 
these. But if this thing is going to work, we have to teach our players to play 
within the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Players receiving a red card are suspended for the remainder of the game the 
infraction happened in and the next contest as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But under another new rule, if the foul is of a violent nature, the player is 
ejected for the remainder of that game and two more. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cross-country: Irvine Valley co-coaches Bill and Julie Leach appear to have 
another strong women's cross-country team. The Laser program started in 1991 
and shared the State title with Mt. San Antonio that season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lasers were most impressive last fall, winning every invitational, then 
capping the year with a State title. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayra Medina returns to lead Irvine Valley. As a freshman, she overcame a leg 
injury the final week and finished 11th at the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 She appears in strong early-season shape this fall. She was fifth overall at 
the Orange Empire Conference preview run Saturday at Fairview Regional Park in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene Prewitt (sixth), Aree Khodai (eighth) and Jami Bickley (ninth) gave 
Irvine Valley four runners in the top nine. The Lasers won the team title with 
39 points. Orange Coast (74) was second and Rancho Santiago (95) third. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside's Charlotte Mayock of Union Springs, N.Y., won the 5,000-meter race 
in 19 minutes 43 seconds. Golden West's Kim Foster, who won the race last 
season, was second and Erin Remy of OCC was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley will be among the teams competing in the Golden West 
Invitational Saturday at Central Park in Huntington Beach. The races are at 9 
and 9:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Southland Poll: For the second consecutive week, no Orange County team appears 
in the football poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, no county team has a victory at this point. The five teams -- 
Fullerton, Golden West, Orange Coast, Rancho Santiago and Saddleback -- are 
0-5-2 thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield (2-0) is the top-ranked team in the poll. Palomar (1-0) is second, 
Long Beach (2-0) third, Riverside (1-0) fourth, El Camino (1-0) fifth, Cerritos 
(1-0) sixth, Mt. San Antonio (0-0-1) seventh, Los Angeles Valley (1-0) eighth, 
Chaffey (1-0) ninth and Pasadena (1-0-1) 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Things don't get much easier for Orange County teams Saturday. El Camino plays 
Fullerton (0-0-1) at Cal State Fullerton, Cerritos is at Saddleback (0-1). Both 
are 7 p.m. games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (0-1) plays Palomar at 1:30 p.m. at San Marcos High School. 
Palomar, the defending J.C. Grid-Wire national champion, has won 22 consecutive 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (0-1-1) plays at San Diego Mesa (0-1) at 6 p.m. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago plays host to the largest women's volleyball tournament in the 
State on Saturday. Twenty-five teams take part in pool play starting at 9 a.m. 
The title match is at 7:15 p.m. Admission is free . . . Matt Hattabaugh will be 
an assistant for the Golden West baseball team in the spring. Hattabaugh is a 
former standout catcher at Marina High School, Cerritos College and Cal State 
Fullerton. He was an assistant at Fullerton College last season.

CHANDLER REPLACING MILLER IN RAMS' PRACTICE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram quarterback Chris Miller, who's nursing a sore shoulder and ribs, will not 
throw in practice today, raising more questions about his status for Sunday's 
game at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup quarterback Chris Chandler will replace Miller as the first-string 
quarterback in practice today, Coach Chuck Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chandler will get the work that Miller usually gets," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-string quarterback Tommy Maddox, who has run the scout squad and was 
inactive for the first three games, will work with the top offensive units for 
the first time as a backup. The Rams traded a fourth-round draft pick to the 
Denver Broncos Aug. 27 to get Maddox, a former UCLA standout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy has a live arm and is an accurate thrower," Knox said. "He has picked 
up the knowledge of the offense very, very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has come back from two knee surgeries in the last two seasons, missed 
the exhibition opener because of a sore abdomen and received three pain-killing 
injections in his rib cage for the Atlanta game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he received an injection for a nerve he pinched in his right shoulder 
when he was sacked by San Francisco's Dana Stubblefield in the second quarter 
of the 49ers' 34-19 victory at Anaheim Stadium.

 When Kathleen Rockney worked in AT&T's Orange County office building, she 
enjoyed the informality of Friday's "dress down" day. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the past two years, every day has meant casual clothes for Rockney, 
who telecommutes to her job in Irvine from a spare room in her Fountain Valley 
home. "I absolutely love sitting at home in my sweats with no makeup on," said 
Rockney, who sells 800 telephone services to major corporate customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockney may dress down for work, but she's fired up about telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 She does not miss the daily traffic jams at the El Toro "Y" on the way to and 
from office. She happily eliminated after-school day care for her 10-year-old 
daughter, Ashley. And, she said, she has carved out more time for her husband, 
Bill, a produce buyer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockney also is confident that AT&T is benefiting from her stint of working 
from home via telephone and computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've discovered that we work harder from home," Rockney said Tuesday. "Our 
work group is all fairly traditional 'Type A' personalities and, if anything, 
we have to pull ourselves away from the computer at night." 
</P>
<P>
 About 22,500 of AT&T's 247,000 U.S. employees telecommute at least once a 
month, said Diane K. Schwilling, AT&T's media relations director in Los 
Angeles. That total includes 7,500 employees who are on the road and work out 
of "virtual offices," meaning that they use laptop computers, cellular 
telephones and fax machines to keep in touch with their offices and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rockney and Schwilling, who spends one day a week working from her 
North Pasadena home, were joined by more than 30,000 fellow AT&T employees 
across the country who had their bosses' blessing to stay at home to help 
showcase the benefits of telecommuting. In California, about 400 AT&T employees 
stayed home, eliminating a total of 500 hours commuting time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were, however, roadblocks along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Anderson, a national service manager, had hoped to spend the day handling 
business from his Capistrano Beach home. But Anderson eventually hopped into 
his car and dashed to the office when an equipment malfunction kept him from 
printing an important report. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuting Day also proved that some jobs simply don't lend themselves to 
being conducted via the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Allen showed his support for 
Telecommuting Day by directing an early morning teleconference with key 
executives from his New York-area home. Allen hurried to his Manhattan office 
later in the day to personally field questions from reporters about the 
$11.5-billion merger that AT&T completed Monday with McCaw Cellular 
Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for the most part, Schwilling said, the telecommuting experiment 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwilling, armed with two telephone lines, a fax machine, a beeper and a 
computer equipped with a fax modem, on Tuesday sent five faxes, made 17 
telephone calls, answered about a dozen calls, sent eight electronic mail 
messages and received about 18 messages from co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockney applauded AT&T executives for embracing the idea of working from home. 
But she noted that some managers "simply didn't want to let go" of their 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockney's experience is not unique, according to the Conference Board, a New 
York-based business research group. According to a recent Conference Board 
survey, fewer than 1% of employees whose organizations allow telecommuting 
actually exercise the option. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, it is management fears, not a lack of technology, that keeps 
employees from telecommuting. The Conference Board survey determined that 
"managers won't give up control. . . . They still can't trust that employees 
are working when they aren't present." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, which is developing product lines that are tailor-made for home-office 
users, staged Telecommuting Day to show customers that business won't 
necessarily grind to a halt if employees stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent AT&T study determined that every $1 pumped into a home office cuts 
corporate real estate costs by $2. Rockney, for example, no longer has an 
office with AT&T in Irvine. On days when she has to go in, she uses extra desk 
space that's made available to telecommuters. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T also is using telecommuting to help meet Clean Air Act regulations that 
require larger employees in big cities to reduce commuter traffic. 
"Telecommuting has been a big help when it comes to environmental regulations," 
Schwilling said. "And we do business in many areas, including California, where 
the Clean Air Act is a concern."

CHEMICAL'S BAN COULD BE BOON FOR ALTERNATIVE; ENVIRONMENT: PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC 
EXPECTS BIG PROFIT FROM SUBSTITUTE FOR WIDELY USED BUT OZONE-DEPLETING FIRE 
SUPPRESSANT HALON. 
</P>

<P>
 A Newport Beach company hopes to profit from the void left by the banning of 
environmentally harmful chemicals by tapping into a potential $60-million 
market opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific Co. said Tuesday that it has developed a substance that 
replaces the fire suppressant Halon, which is no longer being manufactured 
under international agreement because it is believed to damage the Earth's 
ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach company said its Triodide fire suppressant has proven 
effective in tests, yet damages neither the ozone layer nor contributes to 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not stay in the atmosphere very long. It decomposes," said Steve 
Breitzka, president of the company's HTL/Kin-Tech division in Duarte that 
developed the chemical product. 
</P>
<P>
 Halon is a substance that reacts chemically with fire to extinguish flames. It 
is widely used in computer facilities, telephone switching rooms or anywhere 
else where conventional water sprinkling systems might be ineffective or cause 
extensive collateral damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Halon is so damaging to the atmosphere that its manufacture was ended by 
the Clean Air Act of 1990 and by international agreement. It was no longer 
being made starting this year, Breitzka said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 manufacturers have stepped in to market Halon alternatives. But 
Breitzka said that he believes Triodide will catch on because it reacts the 
same as Halon to extinguish a fire and can be fitted into the same size tanks. 
Thus, users do not have to buy a lot of new equipment to accommodate the 
fire-suppressing chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 The product has also done well in testing by the military and in commercial 
applications. "But the testing has been so great that's why we decided to 
release it," he said. It is now for sale as prices that Breitzka said are 
comparable to Halon. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Scientific shares closed at $23.63, up 25 cents, in trading Tuesday on 
the Pacific Stock Exchange.

 A new Irvine eatery, Restaurant Cassis, is about to become the permanent home 
to Phantom Racing's collection of motor racing art. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-piece collection, pulled together over the past 20 years by Long 
Beach-based Phantom Racing's owner, Bill Cryan, includes paintings, photographs 
and sculptures of auto racing scenes, as well as Cryan's collection of racing 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Cryan, whose team races on the Indy Light circuit -- the step below Indy Car 
racing -- is a shareholder in the company that stages the Long Beach Grand Prix 
each year. He said that he has shown bits and pieces of his art collection at 
special events over the years and displays some pieces at a Long Beach 
restaurant, La Grotte, owned by the same restaurateur -- George Fodai who 
recently opened Cassis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be our first permanent gallery," Cryan said. The bulk of his 
collection, he said, will be displayed in a separate gallery next to the 
restaurant, with other pieces used to decorate the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 After a private grand opening reception Oct. 2, the gallery will be open to 
the public daily.

AMERICA WEST, CONTINENTAL OFFER DISCOUNTS

 Two airlines announced a round of leisure travel fare reductions Tuesday that 
could cut the price of some tickets for Southern California passengers by 
nearly half, but customers must act quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 America West Airlines is offering fares reduced by as much as 48% through Dec. 
20, but travelers have only until Friday to buy their tickets.The reductions 
require a 14-day advance purchase and a Friday night stay. The deepest 
discounts are available on Mondays through Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Airlines also said Tuesday that it will offer discounts on ticket 
sales through Friday to inaugurate new service starting Oct. 30, including a 
route from John Wayne Airport in Orange County to Newark, N.J. The limited time 
fare for that route will be $318 round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The America West discounts cut the round trip fare from Los Angeles to Chicago 
by 11% to $338, and from Las Vegas to Atlanta by 48% to $198. Rival airlines 
usually have matched the America West reductions in cities where they compete. 
</P>
<P>
 America West has offered discounts so often this year that they are receiving 
less attention from travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the sale that will never go away," said Thom Nulty, president of 
Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana. "It appears to work for them. . . . 
Consumers are conditioned to wait for a sale."

 Stylish Siblings: The muscular, turbocharged "GSX" version of Mitsubishi's 
redesigned Eclipse sports coupe gets rave reviews in the car enthusiast books 
for performance and handling, but its less powerful siblings often get ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Car and Driver, however, devotes a two-page spread near the back of its 
October issue to the Eclipse GS -- the absent X means it doesn't have a 
turbocharger or all-wheel drive.And with a $17,000 base price, the GS is about 
$4,000 less than than GSX version. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict: It's not a performance car, but it wasn't meant to be. It is, the 
reviewer found, "a styler ... personal transportation with dramatic looks ... 
and adequate performance at a realistic price." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a Japanese nameplate, the Mitsubishi Eclipse is manufactured at a 
plant in Illinois and distributed by Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of 
America Inc. Mitsubishi also builds a version of the Eclipse for Chrysler 
Corp., which sells them through Jeep-Eagle dealers as the Eagle Talon.

 Designing People: The fact that the Mazda Miata roadster was designed in 
Irvine has become part of automotive lore. 
</P>
<P>
 But the designers toiling in the concrete tilt-up building on Redhill Avenue 
have done a few more cars since the two-seater was introduced in 1989. Most 
recently, the 1995 Mazda Protege and the top-of-the-line Mazda Millenia were 
penned in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millenia is the same car that Mazda was going to use to launch its 
quasi-independent U.S. luxury nameplate, Amati, until economic troubles in 
Japan canceled the project.

 Popular Explorers: Mazda is negotiating with Ford Motor Co. for an allotment 
of four-door Explorers in the 1995 model year. Since 1990, Mazda has marketed a 
two-door Explorer as the Mazda Navajo, but Ford has steadfastly refused to ship 
it any of the more popular four-door models. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Mazda Motor of America said the Irvine-based import and 
distribution company hasn't decided whether it will continue selling only the 
two-door version if Ford turns down its request for the bigger model. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two-door Navajo and its Ford counterpart, the Explorer Sport, sell 
well in Southern California and a few other sunny climes, they aren't big 
movers for dealers in the East and the vast midsection of the country.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: HOME SALES UP 26.2% IN FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR; 
REAL ESTATE: THE INCREASE SUGGESTS RISING MORTGAGE RATES ARE NOT HAVING ANY 
MAJOR IMPACT, AN ANALYST SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of new and existing homes were up 26.2% in Orange County during the 
first eight months of this year, according to figures released Tuesday by TRW 
REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales were up more than 20% throughout Southern California, a signal that a 
recent hike in mortgage rates has not slowed a recovery in home sales, said 
Nima Nattagh, market analyst with Riverside-based TRW, a real estate data 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has been doing better than the other counties for about three 
to four months now -- most of that is new home sales," Nattagh said. "The 
numbers are suggesting that the recent rise in mortgage rates isn't having much 
of an impact, but it remains to be seen whether it will."  
</P>
<P>
 During the first eight months of the year, 24,380 homes were sold in Orange 
County, compared to 19,321 homes sold during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sales in Los Angeles County increased 18.6% during the first eight months 
of this year from last year. In Southern California, more than 138,000 
single-family homes and condominiums closed escrow between January and the end 
of August, compared to 115,382 during that same time last year. Home Sales 
Increase 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's new and existing home sales for the first eight months of 1994 
jumped 26.2% and the average price edged up 0.2% compared to the same period a 
year ago. Percentage changes in region compared to 1993: 03,16,07,07 County 
Sales Price Los Angeles 18.6% -1.3% Orange 26.2 0.2 Riverside 23.5 -0.8 San 
Bernardino 15.4 -2.5 San Diego 20.7 2.9 Ventura 19.0 -2.3 Southern 20.4 -0.2

 Ropak Corp.: Shares of the plastic container maker continued to climb in price 
Tuesday, reaching a new 52-week high of $9. 
</P>
<P>
 Ropak stock was up more than 8%, or 69 cents a share, in very heaving Nasdaq 
trading. About 258,900 shares changed hands Tuesday, compared with an average 
daily volume of 11,700 shares. The Fullerton company's previous 52-week high of 
$8.50 a share was reached on Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Cameron, chief financial officer for Ropak, said an analyst for Orange 
County's largest investment banking firm, Cruttenden & Co. in Irvine, visited 
Ropak on Friday. Cruttenden bought about 10,000 Ropak shares on Monday and at 
least 5,000 shares Tuesday, a trader at the company said.

 Cardiac Science Inc.: The company, which ran out of money and shut down 
operations in May, said Tuesday that it has raised $3 million from investors 
and will resume research and development of heart monitoring machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine company refused to divulge any information about the private 
placement of newly issued stock and refused to say how much stock the new 
investors control. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the stock sale will be used to help the company complete its 
clinical testing and obtain federal approval for its monitors. One of them, a 
bedside machine that detects abnormal heart rhythms and automatically sends 
small electrical jolts to correct them, is ready for its second phase of 
testing. Smaller, mobile units are still in development. 
</P>
<P>
 The research and development have already cost Cardiac Science the initial 
$3-million investment it received in 1991 when it was spun off as a separate 
company by Cytocare Inc., an Irvine medical device maker.

 Koll Resorts International: The company said Tuesday that it has tentatively 
agreed with a Mexican partner to develop a 600-acre golf resort and planned 
community in Hidalgo, north of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial terms of the agreement were not released. The joint venture calls 
for Koll to act as managing partner, responsible for the master plan as well as 
the design and construction of the 27-hole Jack Nicklaus signature golf course, 
which will be surrounded by 800 houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll's letter of intent was signed with Grupo Roca S.A. de C.V./Empresas La 
Cosa S.A. de C.V. Construction is expected to begin in February, and the golf 
course is expected to be completed by the summer of 1996, Koll said.

DANCE; THE PASSION OF 'CRUEL WORLD'; CHOREOGRAPHER AND ABT WRESTLE WITH SOME 
DIFFICULT SUBJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 James Kudelka doesn't fool around with small subjects. The choreographer from 
Canada came to international prominence in 1983 with "In Paradisum," a powerful 
work inspired by his mother's death from cancer. A current project is based on 
Frank Wedekind's "The Awakening of Spring," a play about the suffering of youth 
inflicted by adults' narrow-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
 And "Cruel World," his first work for American Ballet Theatre -- to be danced 
by the company tonight and Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
in Costa Mesa -- has been described as "a surrealistic tale of passion and 
sexual repression." 
</P>
<P>
 "None of my pieces is undramatic," Kudelka, 39, acknowledged during a recent 
phone interview from his home in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the title "Cruel World" represent his view of life? 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say that," he replied. "I won't say that. I'm not terribly 
interested in describing my work. I'm not chatty about what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he did reveal that "Cruel World," which is for 18 dancers and is set to 
Tchaikovsky's "Souvenir de Florence," originally was going to be set to Roy 
Harris' Violin Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought for a big American company, it would be good to use a big American 
score," Kudelka said. "But I didn't feel I would get on top of it in time." He 
happened to hear the Tchaikovsky music on the radio, and "once that bug got 
into my ear, I decided this is what I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked very fast on the ballet. I didn't stop to correct myself on the way. 
That's reflected in the work. It has a rawness to it -- just riding the first 
decision and pushing through it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he hates the process of auditioning dancers, he asked ABT to "just 
send me people. 'But we want you to look at everybody,' they said. I didn't 
know who anybody was. I paired a principal dancer with a corps dancer. They 
tried to steer me through (things like) that. I was nervous. It took a week for 
it to shake down. Mostly, we got round pegs and round holes together, square 
pegs and square holes together." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he sees anything wrong with going against the built-in hierarchy of 
dancers in a ballet company. On the contrary, "that's a very important part of 
the learning process. It makes a better company in the end. It seeps into the 
'Swan Lakes' and 'Sleeping Beauties.' 
</P>
<P>
 "If the egos get dropped, you find a generosity in the group. That became one 
of the tasks I was trying to deal with there -- not to demoralize a group of 
people, but to get them all together, to show the amount of talent within an 
organization. That was not previously the way the company had seen itself. It 
was not the usual pecking order." 
</P>
<P>
 The company generally responded well although, he said, some dancers resisted 
his ideas. "I said, 'I don't think I like that person.' 'Well,' they said, 'she 
doesn't like you either.' I won a lot but lost of few. It wasn't a great 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 He describes "Cruel World" as "pretty dark" but adds that "one tends to deal 
with dark images in order to make a better world. Dance allows us to see things 
and talk about certain subjects that are very difficult . . . difficult 
subjects of family abuse, partner abuse, child abuse, all those things. I guess 
'Cruel World' is talking about dysfunction, or this difficulty of sharing the 
same space. Partnering is sharing the same weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Kudelka joined the National Ballet of Canada in 1962 at age 16 after training 
at the troupe's school in Toronto. He became the troupe's resident 
choreographer in 1980 and left a year later to join Montreal's Les Grands 
Ballets Canadiens where he was resident choreographer from 1984 until 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 His career as a principal dancer essentially ended after a series of back 
injuries that began in 1986, although he still dances such character roles as 
Dr. Coppelius or Friar Laurence. He returned to the National Ballet in 1992 as 
artist in residence. 
</P>
<P>
 He has choreographed about 50 works for various companies including the San 
Francisco and Houston ballets. Orange County saw his work as early as 1983 when 
"Passage," set to Thomas Tallis' soaring motet "Spem in Alium," was danced by 
the Joffrey and sung by the Master Chorale, and as recently as 1991 when the 
National Ballet of Canada danced "Musings," a showpiece he created for Karen 
Kain, the troupe's senior ballerina. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his early admission to the dance world might sound ideal to some 
people, he says it left him bitter and angry. "I spent a lot of time in the 
last three or four years in therapy trying to figure out things about where 
boundaries are -- where I stop and where the world starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ballet school is a pretty interesting situation for a 10-year-old. It was a 
very disciplined atmosphere, long hours. I lived in a residence. I had never 
been away from home. Life became completely involved in dance. I didn't get to 
go through a lot of the rebellion which is sort of healthy for teen-agers to 
do. But I don't think you get to skip it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought these were my choices," he added. "I was told so. They 
weren't. I kept going along with them. There must have been certain 
dysfunctional aspects. I think a 10-year-old probably also said, 'I want to be 
a fireman.' But they didn't go with that." 
</P>
<P>
 But he feels he has reached some accommodation with his past. "I was talking 
with one of the dancers who was afraid of going into therapy and figuring 
things out. He thought it would take away part of his cachet as a performer. I 
don't think that's the case. Certainly my discoveries have allowed me to go 
even deeper into things and even better. The journey through life is to become 
wise -- to become one of those old people with fabulous wise eyes." 
</P>
<P>

 Campaign debate -- An article in Tuesday's editions did not fully explain 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's proposal for choosing a panel of questioners for 
a possible debate with state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic 
challenger. Wilson proposed that he and Brown each draw up a list of 10 
acceptable political reporters. Names that appeared on both lists would be 
placed in a hat, and three would be chosen at random.
