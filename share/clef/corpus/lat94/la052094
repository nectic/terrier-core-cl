 He'll have to sue in a higher court: Frank O. Gehry, L.A.'s world-famous 
architect, told a convention here: "A few hours after the earthquake, a New 
Yorker magazine reporter asked me if I was happy now that the rest of Los 
Angeles looked like my work." 
</P>
<P>
 Gehry, whose design for the Music Center's Disney Concert Hall has been 
likened to a shoe box that someone stepped on, added: "Luckily I had a reply. I 
said I'm very honored that God now is copying me."

 Bringing new meaning to the phrase "sticker shock": The auto industry, as you 
may have read, is under orders to begin selling electric cars in the state by 
1998. L.A.-area utilities already have pledged to install home 
electric-charging connections for any customer buying such a jalopy. (We don't 
know whether to choose a Voltswagen or a Honda Cord.)

 Since the technology is still developing, we assume the initial billboard ads 
for electric car dealers will be restrained in tone.

 The ballad of Old Dan: A story in The Times about the remains of a horse and 
chicken unearthed in a San Marino back yard brought a revelation from Richard 
Casey of Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who lives (at our old address) on 2nd Street in Manhattan Beach 
today," he said. "But if they excavated the back yard they would probably find 
some of the remains of Old Dan. Old Dan was a horse and he pulled the plow and 
wagon on the family farm. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When Old Dan died about 70 years go, my dad and grandfather dug a hole in the 
corral and dropped his body in. Back in those days there was no Humane Society 
to call for help. You just did what you had to do. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 We'd like to think that Old Dan at least had a happier love life than Smokey.

REWARD OFFERED IN SLAYING OF WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council offered a $25,000 reward Wednesday for 
information leading to the arrest of suspects who killed a North Hills woman 
outside a Bible study class last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Myles was slain Sept. 16 in front of her 9-year-old son, despite 
complying with a demand to hand over her purse.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson made the motion to post the reward, and said he hopes 
it will motivate any witnesses to contact investigators.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; NEIGHBOR HELPS 
SAVE WOMAN FROM BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 57-year-old woman was saved from a fire started by a cigarette in Burbank 
when a neighbor awoke to the sound of breaking glass early Wednesday morning, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Redington suffered second- and third-degree burns to a leg and an arm in 
the fire that started at 3 a.m. Wednesday, Burbank Fire Marshal Darryl Forbes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was touched off by Redington's cigarette when she either fell asleep 
or dropped it on the couch, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Helmace, a neighbor across the street on North Evergreen Street, heard 
the living room window shatter as the fire spread and called 911. He ran across 
the street and although he could hear the woman in the house, he could not get 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Police Sgt. Eric Rosoff arrived and kicked in the front door, but 
could not get past the heat and flames. A few minutes later, Burbank 
firefighters were able to enter and found Redington in the kitchen. She was 
taken to St. Joseph Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes said Redington was saved because Helmace reported the fire so early and 
told rescuers that there was a woman trapped inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, her condition would have been much worse -- if not dead -- had 
he not responded as quickly," Forbes said. Redington was later transferred to 
UCLA Medical Center, but her condition was not available.

DELAINE EASTIN FOR STATE SCHOOLS; GOOD CANDIDATES VIE FOR IMPORTANT POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the school voucher initiative failed resoundingly at the polls last 
year, surveys have shown that Californians are far from satisfied with public 
education. Voters didn't want a drastic and unfair voucher system that might 
kill the public schools but they also didn't want schools that served every 
purpose but academic learning. 
</P>
<P>
 The question facing voters in 1994 is, "Who among the 12 candidates for 
superintendent of public instruction is in the best position to make meaningful 
reform happen?" It's no easy choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin, the chair of the Assembly Education Committee, 
and two other strong candidates, Maureen DiMarco and Wilbert Smith, sound 
amazingly similar in proposing remedies for what's wrong with California public 
education: Teachers and administrators must be given the support and the 
up-to-date tools they need to teach children well and then must be held 
accountable for the results; more attention must be paid to vocational training 
for children who are not college-bound; the state schools chief must be willing 
to stand up to the special interests who resist changes that benefit 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 It is on that last point that Eastin has something to prove. While an 
endorsement from the California Teachers Assn., one of the most powerful 
lobbies in Sacramento, is undeniably politically helpful to Eastin, it also 
raises a flag. She must work harder to demonstrate that she is indeed willing 
to stand up to obdurate elements in the union that are more interested in 
what's good for the union than for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, it is Eastin who offers the background and the legislative savvy 
needed for this important state post. A former community college instructor, 
she has authored and supported key education bills, including one that places 
stricter checks and balances on financially ailing school districts. The 
Fremont legislator has drawn a broad base of support from the education and 
business communities. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary for child development and education and 
a former school board member in Orange County, has worked hard for the governor 
in advancing his agenda for children. Though she got off to a late start in 
pulling her campaign together, she remains a welcome voice of reason and 
pragmatism in the Wilson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a former bank executive from Pasadena who also happens to be African 
American, has managed to get major backing from influentials on the right. He 
offers good, common-sense ideas about getting back to basics in the schools; 
our enthusiasm for his candidacy is dampened by some of his notions about how 
to deal with the illegal immigrant student population. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin is best suited for state schools chief. If elected, she must deliver to 
a public weary of only talk of change. The Times endorses her.

DR. CHRISTOPHER AND HIS PATIENTS; SECRETARY OF STATE WORKS TO GET SYRIA AND 
ISRAEL CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher achieved no breakthrough in his four 
days of commuting between Damascus and Jerusalem this week, nor had he 
realistically expected to do so. The main point of his latest venture into 
shuttle diplomacy was to see whether he could find enough give in the positions 
of Israel and Syria to justify a further investment of his time in trying to 
nudge the two longtime antagonists into committed negotiating on specific 
issues. Not surprisingly, Christopher detected just enough flexibility to 
conclude that both sides want to keep the diplomatic option open. That minimal 
degree of encouragement is probably enough to send Christopher back to the 
region soon. 
</P>
<P>
 While all this falls somewhat short of qualifying as a triumph for American 
statecraft it does once again validate this country's essential mediating role. 
At this stage in their prickly and suspicious relationship it's clear that, 
left to their own, Israel and Syria would remain light-years apart in their 
approach to resolving their differences. So the job of American diplomacy is to 
try to round the edges of that difficult and combative relationship by 
communicating the ideas of one to the other purged of off-putting rhetoric and 
free of concerns about the political fallout of being publicly perceived as 
making the first concession. Lending great credibility and force to the U.S. 
role is the desire of both Israel and Syria to remain -- in Damascus' case, 
more accurately, to get on -- good terms with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The central issues in the Israel-Syria talks are how much of the Golan Heights 
is Israel prepared to return, and how quickly; what the conditions of 
demilitarization for that strategic plateau will be; and the nature of 
diplomatic and economic relations that will accompany the making of peace. 
Resolving these concrete issues is the meat and drink of diplomacy. But before 
hard bargaining can do its work there has to be a preceding change in the 
psychological atmosphere, as there was as a prelude to actual negotiations 
between Egypt and Israel or between Israel and the Palestinians. Are the two 
sides ready to make peace? Once they are, much of the rest of the process could 
be largely a matter of mechanics.

SENSITIVITY WATCH; PRINCIPAL PREJUDICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Justice has asked a federal judge to find that an 
Alabama school district discriminates against black students. The federal 
action signals a new and long-overdue vigilance by the department's civil 
rights division, which in the two previous administrations was accused of being 
lax in enforcing school desegregation rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the Alabama case is a principal's threat to cancel the senior prom 
in rural Randolph County if any interracial couples planned to attend. When 
questioned by a student with a black mother and white father, the principal 
allegedly indicated during a public assembly that the student was a "mistake" 
and he wanted to keep others from making the same "mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Those derogatory comments reflect attitudes in a school system that "has 
allowed an atmosphere of discrimination to persist," said Deval Patrick, the 
Clinton Administration's aggressive new assistant attorney general for civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The prom was held as scheduled. However, the federal government has questioned 
the school board's refusal to discipline or reassign the principal, who was 
suspended briefly with pay after the incident. Justice Department lawyers also 
challenge the district's allegedly discriminatory hiring practices, 
disciplinary policies and school bus operation. The district has been under a 
court-approved desegregation plan since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 While this case is perhaps a small one for the Justice Department, its 
symbolic importance is big. Patrick and his division are on the right track.

MILKEN ON EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The self-serving and pious column by unrepentant felon Michael Milken 
("Technology Married to Learning: a Millennial Wedding," Commentary, May 11), 
who tried using UCLA to burnish his sullied reputation, ignores several 
critical issues for the millennium. While more education is indeed important to 
maintain America's position in the world, so too is a firm grounding in ethical 
behavior, which must be stressed in all courses. Hopefully, the schools can 
graduate well-educated persons who won't repeat the mistakes of the '80s, a 
decade of unprecedented financial skulduggery and economic violence against 
those playing by the rules. 
</P>

<P>
 As a former member of the UCLA Chancellor's Committee, and for many years a 
member of the Dean's Council working closely with then-Provost Ray Orbach in 
trying to recruit outstanding faculty to UCLA, I wish to express the 
disappointment I feel that our UCLA students will be deprived of an extremely 
rare educational opportunity of learning firsthand about the real world of 
business and finance from Michael Milken and the outstanding giants of industry 
that Milken's class gave the students access to. 
</P>
<P>
 The night I was privileged to attend, two very distinguished members of the 
business school faculty sat with me. I asked why they were there. The first 
replied that word had spread of Milken's brilliant prowess as a teacher and a 
presenter of ideas. The other replied, "Where else would I ever have the 
opportunity to tap into such an unbelievable reservoir of real world financial 
knowledge and experience . . . and I got to spend 15 minutes to discuss in 
depth with Bert Roberts my ideas on the financial future of 
telecommunications?" (Roberts, chairman of MCI, told how without Milken's 
vision and willingness to take a risk, MCI would not exist.) 
</P>
<P>
 If such distinguished business school faculty saw this as a rich and 
extraordinary opportunity, how much more so for students starting out? When I 
was on the faculty search committee, it was impossible to get faculty of great 
stature because of the high cost of living in Los Angeles. To have so many of 
these giants of business available for free was beyond our and Provost Orbach's 
wildest dreams. What a tragic loss for UCLA, its faculty, and above all, its 
students. There's no way to replace such a valuable resource. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 I have taken the liberty of translating Milken's commentary into English, for 
the edification of your readers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, I'm Michael Milken, and you're not. Now that my colleagues and I have 
diverted this nation's capital out of production and into speculation, we are 
in a service economy (information and knowledge-based age), which means most of 
you will be servants, and will be paid accordingly (widening gap in 
compensation). But, not to worry. We are developing ways to keep you 
entertained, especially you youngsters (interactive education products), so you 
won't object to being turned into drones (well-trained, responsive graduates). 
Besides, my colleagues and I recently realized that there are still areas of 
capital that we have yet to loot (partnerships between education and the 
private sector). And we will ensure that your attitudes are adjusted, so that 
if you are still uncomfortable with a dead-end job, you will take it out on 
another poor person from some other ethnic group (multiculturalism), rather 
than taking it out on me and my colleagues. Ciao ."

</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between righteousness and 
self-righteousness. The pressure on Milken and Educational Entertainment 
Network to rescind their contract with UCLA is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Milken and his family have been donors to the UC system for decades. Their 
foundation has had a longstanding relationship with UCLA's Medical Center, 
Graduate School of Education, Law School, and School of Fine Arts. The Times 
reported over $3.3 million in gifts over the years -- much of it prior to 
Milken's legal controversy. This recent venture was a natural extension of 
their prior relationship with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 As a past president of the UCLA Psychiatric Clinical Faculty Assn., I know 
only too well that UCLA is facing financial difficulties, and has had to reduce 
or eliminate many important world-class programs: Public Health and Nursing are 
two which come to mind. They must look for innovative ways to finance their 
mission, including cooperation with the business community.  
</P>
<P>
 State Sens. Quentin Kopp, Patrick Johnston and others are seeking to establish 
an extra-judicial sentence on Milken with their Savonarola-like vilification. 
Milken did not receive a life sentence, nor did Judge Kimba Wood impose a ban 
on Milken's creativity, educational television, or the continuation of his long 
and fruitful teaching and charitable relationship with UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 Milken has led an exemplary life with a sad exception for which he has paid 
his penalty. He has sought to apply his creativity in an area in which he had 
been active for many years. His company put up all the risk capital. The 
university needs the money; the students need the information. Only the 
self-righteous would seek to deny Milken this opportunity to enhance education, 
make a financial contribution to the university, and creatively make the next 
phase of his life a step toward the vision of universal learning we all prize.

SEXIST WINE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * During a recent tour through the Napa Valley, I learned of an archaic law, a 
leftover from Prohibition days, wherein a male resident of California may, for 
his own use, produce wine in his home.A single male may produce 100 gallons 
year, a married male 200 gallons a year. In contrast, a woman may not produce 
any wine at all. The production for personal use requires a state license.  
</P>
<P>
 I would hope one of our more progressive lawmakers would set about removing 
this sexist law from the state books, which would probably bring about 
gratitude from female constituents.

BUCHANAN'S 1992 GOP ADDRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Buchanan's "Not Houston, Dan: Perot and the Economy" (Column Right, May 
10) shows a lack of understanding of election-year politics on a par with his 
actual convention speech. Of course Republicans publicly stated that his speech 
was great! What were they supposed to do before an election? State in front of 
the cameras that he divided the constituency and lost the election for the 
Republicans? No, the best they could do was damage control. 
</P>
<P>
 As my generation slowly becomes the dominating voting force in America (I'm 
30), I can see why the standard Republican agenda is failing and why the GOP is 
out of touch with America. Buchanan has missed out on one of the fundamental 
changes in America -- people still value the family, but no longer require a 
traditional definition of family. Furthermore, people are insulted when told 
what their family should look like. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan claims that the Clinton & Clinton agenda was "not the kind of change 
we can tolerate in a nation we still call God's country." Bill & Hill were not 
proposing a change to the country's social activities, but merely a 
governmental tolerance of what was already accepted in mainstream America. 
Furthermore, it's somewhat sickening (although unfortunately not that uncommon) 
that Buchanan veils his dogmatism under the guise of promoting Christianity. 
True Christianity is about tolerance, not moral enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Party is still the only viable political vehicle to promote 
economic common sense and validation of the work ethic in America. Buchanan's 
drive to impose his definition of family values will continue to divide the 
GOP, keeping the liberal economic agenda in place until our taxes hit the roof 
and there is no more hope to give incentive to growth and prosperity.

 I am dismayed that Buchanan still defends his 1992 Houston GOP convention 
speech and doesn't retract one word. As a lifelong, fiscally conservative 
Republican, I vividly recall watching Buchanan deliver that chilling, 
threatening diatribe against decent Americans who disagree with him. I remember 
going to bed that night saddened and disappointed and fearful for the future of 
our party. It was a shameful and hateful performance which significantly 
contributed to the defeat of President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans must realize and rejoice in the fact that Buchanan's opinions are 
held by a shrinking number of thoughtful Americans.

GNATCATCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugh Hewitt's diatribe (Opinion, May 8) is predictable in its inaccuracies, 
only a few of which are addressed in this letter. Hewitt states that the 
California gnatcatcher does not deserve listing by the federal Endangered 
Species Act, as there are 3 million of the critters in Mexico.This data was 
obtained from a developer-supported study which was never embraced by the 
scientific community, because its methods were flawed. The "3 million birds" 
were extrapolated from a sample of less than 400 birds! Also, the U.S. 
government has never in the past assigned to the Mexican government, or any 
other nation, the responsibility for preserving the resources we pave over. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt then resorts to putting on the hat of a scientist (which does not fit 
well, of course, on an attorney) by claiming that the alleged "withheld data" 
in the gnatcatcher case was used to support "two contradictory conclusions." 
Hewitt and other building industry attorneys wouldn't know how to evaluate data 
any more than a gnatcatcher understands endangered species law! 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it is apparent that Hewitt, a far-right Republican, is worried that 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Kathleen Brown are leading in the polls 
over their Republican opponents. He attempts to build a case that the 
gnatcatcher will be a prominent issue in the election. Hewitt knows full well 
that the case is one for the Interior Department to settle internally. The 
support or opposition by politicians is irrelevant.

...WHILE IN CALIFORNIA, A COURT AFFIRMS THE HUMANITY OF A FETUS; ABORTION: THE 
FETAL-MURDER DECISION WILL TOPPLE THE ILLOGIC OF THE PRO-CHOICE MOVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CARPENTER McMILLAN, Susan Carpenter McMillan is a KABC-TV commentator 
and spokesperson for the Pro-Family Media Coalition of Southern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monday's California Supreme Court decision allowing the prosecution of a 
defendant who causes the death of an unborn child as early as seven weeks into 
the pregnancy is an overwhelming victory for anti-abortionists and may prove to 
be a legal and moral setback for pro-abortionists.  
</P>
<P>
 The 6-1 decision gives California the distinction of being the most 
contradictory state: Long known as the late-term abortion capital, we have now 
ironically upheld the most protective fetal-murder law. Though the decision 
does nothing to interfere with the 1973 Roe vs. Wade abortion decision, it does 
make a powerful statement regarding the humanity of fetal life. 
</P>
<P>
 In Roe, abortion was protected under a fictional right to privacy. That 
decision effectively gave every woman the right to obtain an abortion 
throughout the entire nine months of her pregnancy. Since federal laws 
supersede state laws, all laws regulating abortion were immediately struck 
down; unborn babies were declared non-persons. Women were given sole discretion 
to decide whether their unborn children would live or die.  
</P>
<P>
 Since medicine in the 1970s was not as sophisticated and advanced as it is 
today, the fetus was thought to be merely a glob of tissue, an unviable 
parasite or a potential human who was not yet human. This sounds ridiculous in 
light of today's knowledge regarding fetal development and the advancement in 
early fetal viability, yet a pro-abortion ethic must continue to maintain these 
views. Since the courts would never rule that one life could supersede another 
life, a large dose of intellectual dishonesty was called for, and the courts 
declared that the unborn were non-persons in the legal sense, therefore 
abortion was not the taking of a human life.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, however, Roe began to collapse from its own weight, and 
Monday's decision declaring that the death of an unborn child caused through 
malice could result in the charge of murder turns the logic of Roe vs. Wade 
upside down. The law has twisted itself into a pretzel: One decision declares 
that the fetus is not a human being and hence can be legally destroyed; another 
holds that when a person other than the mother kills that same fetus, then that 
person can be charged with murder. If it's murder, then the fetus must be 
human, and if it's human, how can the courts allow its destruction through 
abortion?  
</P>
<P>
 This illogical legal mumbo-jumbo is what you get when a society seeks to 
justify laws that violate the sanctity of human life. Not only has the 
fetal-murder decision struck a blow for personhood, but this case also will be 
used to sensitize the American public to the desperate need to protect all 
human life.  
</P>
<P>
 We need this sensitivity training, for one look at our cities makes it 
painfully clear that the respect for human life has greatly eroded over the 
last 20 years. It is obvious that much of today's violence and despair can be 
traced back to the legalization of abortion, for when one segment of our 
society loses its rights, then it's only logical that the rest of society will 
follow. Today, immorality runs rampant, and if we don't find a solid foundation 
on which to rebuild our beliefs and standards, then we will soon become a 
nation devoid of values. What foundation is greater than that which guarantees 
the protection of all human life, regardless of color, religion, condition, 
disability or gender?  
</P>
<P>
 California's decision may result in the beginning of a new beginning. If we 
can legally declare that the fetus is human under one circumstance, then how 
long before we will legally redeclare that the fetus is human under all 
circumstances?

PERSPECTIVE ON PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY; WE ELECT A PRESIDENT TO WORK FOR US; HIS 
PROBLEMS CAN WAIT; IF CLINTON HAS TO ANSWER A POLITICALLY INSPIRED CIVIL SUIT, 
THE PRECEDENT WILL DOOM OUR MOST CHERISHED INSTITUTIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Should presidents of the United States be above the law? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes -- when the case is civil and not criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil lawsuit brought against President Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones 
should not be allowed go to forward. There may be a time for the courts to 
consider her grievance, but that time is not now. The business of the United 
States is more important than the concerns of a single citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not simply Bill Clinton and Paula Jones and their respective 
fates; the issue is the welfare of this nation, and whether this President -- 
or any President -- can govern effectively while he is the subject of a civil 
matter in the courts.  
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the particular issue, in this case a claim for damages from 
alleged sexual harassment, doesn't matter; the fact of the lawsuit does. 
</P>
<P>
 The media may have a field day with charges involving questionable sexual 
conduct -- and they are -- but any civil complaint filed against any President 
would be the object of intense media focus. The very intensity of that 
attention, coupled with the time-consuming nature of civil proceedings, means 
that a President will be required to devote considerable time and energy on his 
personal legal problems -- time and energy he'd otherwise spend on the affairs 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the sobering effect of legal costs incurred in responding to a 
civil suit (it is estimated that Clinton's may exceed $1 million). A President 
-- like Clinton -- lacking a personal fortune will have to find the money 
somewhere, which raises dicey questions: Should a President allow funds to be 
raised for his personal legal expenses? To whom will he be indebted? 
</P>
<P>
 No President should have to face a legal circumstance of a civil nature that 
divides his attention, weakens his policies, undermines his leadership and 
allows his opponents to win in court what they lost in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics can be, and often is, a very nasty business. President Kennedy's 
comment, "Don't get mad, get even," has been widely quoted and just as often 
ignored. Many people in politics do both -- they get very angry and their anger 
fuels the desire for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clinton presidency goes down for the political count, the victory of 
his opponents will be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The anger against Jones and particularly against those who are seen as her 
political manipulators will drown whatever civil discourse is left in American 
politics and threaten all future presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a fool would believe that Jones' action will be the last of such cases if 
it can be shown that you can seriously damage a President -- if not bring about 
his removal from office -- simply by filing a civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 And the presidency will not be the only institution hurt. The courts will also 
be affected if they are seen as being a tool of a President's political 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 To spare the presidency, to save our governmental institutions, to keep 
whatever faith is left in the political process, Congress should pass a law 
that prohibits the filing of any civil action against an incumbent President. 
Such legislation should also contain a provision extending the statute of 
limitations to enable a person desiring to sue to be able to do so once a 
President is no longer in office. This would allow Jones to still have her day 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
 There is substantial precedence for such a law, based on the proposition that 
the interest of the state in some specific situations is more important than 
the interest of a single individual to obtain redress through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 What is at stake is greater than President Clinton's political future. If 
Jones and her political masters continue on their vengeful course, the 
consequences will be ominous for all involved in politics -- left or right, 
Republican or Democrat. The only winners in this dangerous game will be those 
who hate our republic's democratic system.

AROUND TOWN: DREAMS OF A HAITI THAT ONCE WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, corpses of death-squad victims litter the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton and his advisers struggle with What to Do 
About Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in Los Angeles, Haitian-born Yvrose Pierrot and Pierrette St. Hubert and 
those they've recruited for their neophyte Haitian Women Assn. are starting to 
make their voices heard. 
</P>
<P>
 They feel the pain of the people of Haiti and they want to help. Although 
undecided how political they should be, they know this: There is power in unity 
-- and there is no unity among Haitians in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a divided community," Pierrot says. "It's a question of class. Haiti 
is a small country, but the class thing is big there. It's deep. . . . We left 
the country but we carry it on everywhere we go." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Pierrot called three other women; they met and organized. With 
more bravado than backing, they sent out flyers for a Jan. 1 gala marking 190 
years of Haiti's independence from France. 
</P>
<P>
 To their astonishment, 300 Haitians showed up. This was an idea whose time had 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Pierrot's first recruits to the Haitian Women Assn. was Gerry LaMothe, 
an engineer and a drummer in the Formula One Band, and Pierrot's significant 
other. Name aside, this is not a female-only club. 
</P>
<P>
 LaMothe joins this day in a discussion of the Haitian problem in L.A. That 
problem: Lack of community leadership, no community core, no newspaper or radio 
station. Says LaMothe: "You say Florida, you go to Miami, to Little Haiti." 
Chicago and Boston have established Haitian neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 These members of the fledgling association seem to typify the dilemma. 
Pierrot, a bookkeeper, and LaMothe live in Sherman Oaks. Adeline Devesin, a 
caterer, lives in Covina; St. Hubert, a pharmacy technician, in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Pierrot: "People tell me, 'The only thing I know about Haiti is black 
people and voodoo.' " And that refugees by the boatload are being denied asylum 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible that Haitians in greater L.A. -- 6,000 by their estimate -- are 
low-profile by choice, wishing to separate themselves from these boat people? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, big time, yes," Pierrot says. "Haitians want to disappear here." 
</P>
<P>
 Devesin is quick to retort: "We have Haitians who don't want to be Haitian? I 
don't believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 But LaMothe says: "On TV, they're showing a bunch of ugly-looking Haitians, 
all bones, getting off a boat, being pushed around. My friend told me, 'I do 
not want to be identified with that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, Pierrot says, "We are pulling each other apart" here, 
just as in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these four has been in the United States between 15 and 26 years and 
all but Pierrot are citizens. Yet they remain fiercely proud of Haiti's history 
and culture, and they are passionate in denouncing the poverty, political 
repression and violence that are decimating the island nation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still home. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am kicked out here," Devesin says, "I have a place to go. Black 
Americans have no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians find they have little in common with African Americans living in L.A. 
-- except skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any animosity, but the connection is missing," Devesin 
says. "We are relating as if we were not related." 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti is 90% black. "The struggle that (African Americans) went through, we 
did not have that." There is not that to unite them. 
</P>
<P>
 These are middle-class Haitians -- but with no delusions about Haiti. Pierrot 
speaks of schools that are free "if you have the right political connections." 
St. Hubert says her brother wanted to be a doctor, "but we were not part of the 
Duvalier regime, so he couldn't get in." Admission to a public hospital, 
Pierrot says, is a ticket to die. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk of the sharp class divisions that Haitians bring with them to the 
United States: Those who speak proper French versus those who speak a patois . 
Skin shade as a caste mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Still they hope that, in L.A., they can help bring Haitians -- doctors, 
engineers, mechanics, beauty operators -- together. 
</P>
<P>
 They tend to support "what (exiled President Jean-Bertrand) Aristide stands 
for," although not necessarily the man. They denounce U.S. immigration policy 
as racist and are debating how best to channel their anger into action. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Devesin: "The issue is not really them coming here. The issue is making 
it possible for them to stay where they are. We all have a dream -- to see the 
community together here and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti "is sinking," Pierrot says, literally and figuratively. But, says 
Devesin: "We still have our history, the most beautiful history. . . . We want 
people to remember we are the first black country to have its independence (won 
by a slave-led rebellion in 1804)." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierrot hopes to find people who will give two hours a week to alert fellow 
Haitians to what's happening back home, to collect food and clothing for the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as expatriates tend to, she and the others cling to the dream of a 
Haiti that once was. When it was called "La Perle des Antilles." 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian Women Assn. is co-sponsoring Haitian Flag Day celebrations tonight 
in Hollywood and Saturday night in Compton. Information: (818) 786-4514. Space 
Cadets Talk about the A-train. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-Eighth Street School fifth-graders Boris Rivera and Odell Smith and 
sixth-grader Melanie Banks plan to be in the crew when the first space train is 
launched in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, they're the ones who came up with the concept of a space train, 
launched by solar-powered rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among local students answering the Erector Space Challenge, marking 
the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Remember? "One small step 
for man, one giant leap for mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 Space travel has lost much of its luster in the years since, but the Erector 
set people hope to rekindle interest with this nationwide project in which kids 
built models of spacecraft of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Boris, Odell and Melanie put theirs together during L.A.'s Best, an 
after-school enrichment program, then wrote an essay explaining that the 
airborne steel train would be 1,000 feet long, 200 feet high and carry a crew 
of 50 and 1,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air inside the Space Train will be similar to Earth. Passengers will not 
have to wear space suits or oxygen masks." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will they have to rough it. The Space Train "will have recreation areas 
with televisions, movie theater, arcades, swimming pools and all kinds of food. 
. . . Each passenger's seat will convert into a sleeping area." 
</P>
<P>
 In short, space vacationers will travel in style to different planets and to 
cities built in outer space.

INK: WHERE NEWS AND COMMERCE GLADLY MEET 
</P>

 When Ted Koppel opened the first of two broadcasts this week examining "The 
Haldeman Diaries," the ABC newsman trumpeted what he called "a 'Nightline' 
exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tantalizing entries written by H.R. Haldeman during his years in the Nixon 
White House, as well as home movies and audiotapes, were "being made public for 
the first time," Koppel added. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no "exclusive" in the old-fashioned sense, when a reporter 
sleuths about and works the phone, a la Woodward and Bernstein, and unearths 
stunning truths about government and its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, "Nightline" obtained its exclusive on a silver platter -- from the 
publisher G.P. Putnam's Sons, which put "The Haldeman Diaries" on sale 
Wednesday, the day after Koppel's second broadcast. As other news organizations 
waited to receive the book from Putnam, they cobbled their initial reports from 
broadcast transcripts provided by "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
 If Putnam's agreement with "Nightline" works out as the publisher hopes, 
Koppel's two-parter will lead to an immediate burst of book sales. Meanwhile, 
ABC, which had promoted the "Nightline" broadcasts in this important May sweeps 
ratings period, led CBS and NBC in the top 31 TV markets on Monday and won the 
time slot even more impressively on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 This sort of arrangement happens all the time at the intersection of news and 
commerce. Publishers and authors routinely sell the so-called first-serial 
excerpt from a hot book to a weekly newsmagazine or a tabloid -- on an 
exclusive basis, of course -- or they try to line up "Nightline," "20 / 20" or 
another popular broadcast to launch the book into the marketplace. The show 
bites if the book might make for good television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a book with news, you want to orchestrate the campaign so that 
all the news breaks on the same day," said Lynn Goldberg, the president of Lynn 
Goldberg Communications, which has organized Haldeman-like rollouts for the 
memoirs of former Secretary of State George Schultz, Iran-contra principal 
Richard Secord and other figures. 
</P>
<P>
 To go the more-traveled route, and circulate unedited galley copies of a book 
before publication, may generate a published blurb or two to whet readers' 
appetites, "but you dissipate the explosive value of the news in the book," 
Goldberg added. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Random House withheld copies of Gerald Posner's "Case Closed," 
which presented compelling evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald alone killed 
President John F. Kennedy, until ABC's "20 / 20" had aired its report on the 
book and U.S. News & World Report had run an excerpt. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, whose 1988 memoir, "For the 
Record," revealed that First Lady Nancy Reagan used to consult an astrologer in 
the planning of President Ronald Reagan's schedule, was made available to 
reporters no sooner than a Sunday afternoon -- so that the resulting stories 
would not preempt that day's release of Time magazine, which had purchased the 
first-serial excerpt. 
</P>
<P>
 Common as these arrangements are, they do pose risks to the publishers. For 
example, critics' reviews of "The Haldeman Diaries" may not appear for days -- 
a significant lag, given the public's attention span -- because Putnam delayed 
the release of review copies until Tuesday to protect "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, publishers typically have little control over how a book will be 
treated by the news programs they do business with. Some authors have watched 
in horror as TV shows lay out their published revelations -- but barely mention 
the name of the book and who wrote it. Despite the enormous popularity of "60 
Minutes," CBS' Sunday newsmagazine is regarded warily by some publicists 
because the show has been known to do stories prompted by new books while 
giving minimal credit to the author. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, journalists are not in the business of selling books, and 
publishers are not in the business of journalism. A question raised by the 
careful release of "The Haldeman Diaries" may be whether the public is served 
by an exclusive arrangement between a publisher and a news organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it bug me? Sure it does," said Thomas F. Mulvoy Jr., managing editor of 
the Boston Globe. "All of us have the concern that we have become the ultimate 
transmission belt. . . . But my sense is that we will continue to do what we 
always do -- report what we see on 'Nightline' and then weigh in with our own 
view a day later. The idea of breaking news by book excerpt -- we're just faced 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be upset (by the deal with 'Nightline') if the book convincingly said 
that Nixon and Haldeman had been badly misunderstood all these years," said 
Ashley Halsey, national editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer. "But a book that 
says these two guys are still nasty? . . . It's not that big a deal to us." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Racks: In Style, the new Time Inc. magazine that showcases celebrities 
in their lavish digs, goes from three test issues to monthly circulation with 
the glossy June edition that comes out next week. It features a visit to the 
Barn, the spacious Malibu home of Barbra Streisand and her collection of 
Americana. In Style is guaranteeing advertisers a circulation of 500,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Anniversaries: Lauren Hutton and four other women on the June cover of 
Mirabella equals five, as in the fifth anniversary of the magazine, which 
salutes 100 so-called fearless women, ranging from Bella Abzug to Sinead 
O'Connor to Oprah Winfrey . . . Working Mother celebrates 15 years on the racks 
with its May issue, which assesses the strides and challenges of women in the 
workplace . . . High Times turns 20 with the May issue of the magazine and a 
new book, "High Times Greatest Hits" (St. Martin's), a scrapbook-like 
collection of pieces and confessions that have appeared in the monthly 
chronicle of the marijuana culture. 
</P>

 B Matter: Married couple divorces HarperCollins: In February, William M. 
Shinker surprised the book biz by resigning as publisher of HarperCollins' 
adult trade group. On Monday, his wife and partner, Susan Moldow, 
HarperCollins' associate publisher and editor in chief, was following him out 
the same door when it was announced that she would become vice president and 
publisher of Scribners, the distinguished literary imprint that recently became 
part of Simon & Schuster . . . Alan Light has been named acting editor in chief 
of Vibe, succeeding Jonathan Van Meter, who resigned, reportedly after a 
dispute with Quincy Jones, the magazine's founder . . . William Morrow & Co., 
which was for sale and then not for sale, has a new editorial director, William 
Schwalbe, who had been director of special publishing projects.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; MOURNING THE DEATH OF LIBERALISM: A REACTIONARY 
TREATISE; ON LOOKING INTO THE ABYSS; UNTIMELY THOUGHTS ON CULTURE AND SOCIETY, 
BY GERTRUDE HIMMELFARB ; ALFRED A. KNOPF; $23, 192 PAGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gertrude Himmelfarb is one of those academics who can drive readers up the 
wall. Not because she's obscurantist or pedantic -- in fact she's a fluid 
writer -- but because she's so threatened by non-traditional thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 "On Looking Into the Abyss" is a congenial read for those who admired Allan 
Bloom's "The Closing of the American Mind" and proves more thoughtful than the 
earlier screed, yet the book raises far more questions than it answers. The 
biggest question is easily stated: What is it about recent, relativistic 
scholarship that drives conventional academics so quickly from reasoned debate 
to rigid, defensive disputation? 
</P>
<P>
 The seven essays in this collection, all but one revised versions of 
previously published articles, are not limited to academic thought. But it's 
for good reason that Himmelfarb, an emeritus professor of history at the City 
University of New York, has dedicated the book to the memory of Lionel 
Trilling; he is the book's guiding spirit, for his abiding, high-principled 
belief in the social and cultural importance of "the liberal imagination" ( 
liberal in its older, commendatory sense). 
</P>
<P>
 Himmelfarb, judging from this volume, sees liberalism under siege on today's 
campuses, because everywhere she looks traditional standards are disappearing, 
traditional methods are mocked, traditional values are subverted. 
</P>
<P>
 The "new historians" -- beginning with H.G. Wells -- are antiheroic, intent on 
composing a "history from below" that discredits the "great men" who dominated 
previous accounts of the past. Contemporary postmodern historians admit to 
writing "a kind of propaganda," a description Himmelfarb finds appalling rather 
than honest or provocative.  
</P>
<P>
 The philosophy of neo-pragmatist Richard Rorty "verges on nihilism" in part 
because he adopts some of Heidegger's ideas while passing over his Nazism (an 
ability to separate the life from the work that Himmelfarb later praises, 
incidentally, in Victorian thinkers). And the multiculturalists politicize 
history, as if the decision to write history from one vantage point rather than 
another isn't inherently political. Himmelfarb even criticizes Art Spiegelman's 
Maus books on the Holocaust, which she believes appeal to postmodernists 
because they embrace a kind of amoral aesthetic, a distancing and 
dehumanization of history. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the idea -- the orthodox liberal ways of thinking about the world, the 
ones Himmelfarb practices, are the best ways. With one exception, of course: No 
liberalism allowed when it comes to thinking about liberalism, for here 
Himmelfarb and her band alone hold keys to the kingdom.  
</P>
<P>
 It's extraordinary, really, to find common liberalism coupled to such deep 
conservatism, to such bare-faced authoritarianism, because the postmodernists 
Himmelfarb takes to task aren't supplanting traditional liberalism (although 
many fool themselves into thinking otherwise) so much as supplementing it.  
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, does Himmelfarb find postmodern thought so threatening -- to the 
point that she feels compelled to warn that Rorty's philosophy "may ultimately 
subvert liberal democracy"? Because it says that the emperor of traditional 
objective scholarship, if not exactly buck-naked, isn't nearly as finely 
clothed as he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presumption of postmodernism," Himmelfarb writes, "is that all history is 
fatally flawed, and that because there is no absolute, total truth, there can 
be no partial, contingent truths."  
</P>
<P>
 Some contemporary scholars do take that view, but this definition 
misrepresents the views of many other postmodernists who continue to make 
claims to truth -- but only on a limited and personal basis. (One wonders: Does 
Himmelfarb ignore these thinkers because they are not the "great men" of 
postmodernism, the extremist, high-profile academics?) 
</P>
<P>
 These scholars have come to understand that the writer is incapable of 
transcending private, often unconscious interests, and that those who claim 
transcendence, who brazenly advertise their objectivity, are deluding 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Himmelfarb writes mockingly in her introduction that "On Looking Into the 
Abyss" could be called "The Confessions of an Unregenerate Prig" because it is 
"dedicated to the proposition that there are such things as truth and reality." 
The implication, of course, is that her scholarly opponents are not similarly 
dedicated.  
</P>
<P>
 Most are, in fact, but wear their dedication with a difference: While 
Himmelfarb believes she can see into the heart of things, they continue to look 
for solid ground, believing truth and reality to be elusive, complex and 
subject to multiple, divergent interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 John Milton understood in 1644 what Himmelfarb seems not to 350 years later: 
"The golden rule," he wrote in the "Areopagitica," is not to force belief 
through "the outward union of cold, and neutral, and inwardly divided minds," 
but "to be still searching what we know not by what we know."

'STRAIGHT SHOOTER' GETS MEDAL FOR HONESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having commented acidly about the gun control claims The Times has so 
assiduously propagated, I feel obligated to congratulate you and Paul Dean for 
"The Straight Shooter" (May 18). It was a real pleasure to read unbiased 
articles for a change! 
</P>
<P>
 How about continuing the "When the Smoke Clears" part for a few weeks? There 
is a lot of smoke that could well be cleared up.

MEN NEED A LESSON IN LOVE, DOGGONE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for Stephanie Miller's "Mere Men Are No Match for Puppy Love" (Laugh 
Lines, May 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Her admitting preferring Pookie (her dog) to boyfriends liberated me of the 
same feelings I've shamefully hidden for years in tight "closets." Arf, Arf, 
Arf, out, out, out . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to "out" what Miller's article is all about. It's about the betrayals 
women constantly experience -- are you listening, Mr. President? -- and how the 
"Pookies" of the world can teach us something about real and unconditional 
love, devotion and loyalty.

 The feminists were too greedy. They have finally awakened the sleeping bear, 
and dads are coming out to protest the biased system that makes them victims

 State Sen. Charles Calderon needs to be informed that it is deadbeat dads whom 
the government has been favoring -- at taxpayers' expense. These men need to 
realize that having a baby doesn't make one a father. Being a father involves 
loving, being available for and financially supporting their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the mothers and taxpayers of this country suppose to applaud and support 
these males for finally wanting to accept their responsibility?  
</P>
<P>
 If the government insists on further penalizing hard-working, taxpaying 
citizens financially for these worthless men, I hope they do something 
worthwhile with the money, such as researching male birth control, hiring 
bounty hunters to track down these deadbeats and building more jails to house 
them.

DO GIRLS 'EARN' HIGHER GRADES BECAUSE OF BIAS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "An Unfair Test for Girls?" (May 11), I am a little tired of reading 
how "Reliance on standardized test scores as the sole factor in choosing 
National Merit semifinalists will again cheat girls out of tuition aid they 
have earned by their superior academic performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it just possible that girls "earn" higher grades because of bias on the 
part of teachers, and objective standardized tests merely bear this out?

DID REVIEWER CONFUSE OPINION WITH FACTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a doctoral student with several years of academic and professional 
experience in the field of child abuse, I must take exception to Jill Neimark's 
review of Leonard Simon's book "Dissociated States" ("Couched in Lusty Mind 
Games, Thriller Is Out to Make Charts," May 10). 
</P>
<P>
 Neimark accuses Simon of not providing even "the least dollop of realism" in 
his depiction of multiple personality disorder, a condition whose only known 
cause is severe early childhood trauma (usually child abuse).I cannot speak to 
Simon's level of accuracy, but Neimark's is sorely lacking, as she injects her 
own inflammatory pop culture misbeliefs and treats them as fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Neimark claims that "we are in the midst of an enormous crisis in therapy 
because therapists are now being sued for using questionable hypnotic 
techniques . . . to 'unearth' memories of sexual abuse and nonexistent multiple 
personalities." Apparently, the fact that Simon's character, Felix Kiehl, 
exhibits several separate personalities before seeking therapy is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Neimark's so-called enormous crisis in therapy has more relevance in the 
tabloids and talk shows than in real-life therapists' offices. As family 
violence stops being a family secret, it is not surprising that organizations 
will sprout up to counter the claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The psychology of trauma is a burgeoning field. That trauma often leads to 
buried memories or dissociation of the psyche is well-established in the 
scientific literature. Perhaps Neimark should ask herself which writer is using 
pop culture distortions to catch the eye and make the charts.

ONASSIS GIVEN LAST RITES; FAMILY, FRIENDS GATHER; ILLNESS: ADMIRED FORMER FIRST 
LADY IS SURROUNDED BY 'A LOT OF LOVE' AS SHE STRUGGLES WITH LYMPH CANCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who charmed America as a graceful First Lady and 
then eased its anguish as a stoic young widow, received the last rites of the 
Roman Catholic Church on Thursday as relatives and close friends rushed to 
comfort her as she struggled with lymph cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A close friend described the 64-year-old widow of President John F. Kennedy as 
"gravely ill." But her nephew, Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), the son of the 
late Robert F. Kennedy, stressed another side to the sad news. "There's a lot 
of love in her room and in her apartment," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Onassis had entered New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center on Monday for 
further treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But she asked to return to her 5th 
Avenue apartment that faces Central Park on Wednesday after doctors decided 
that the disease could not be cured. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing more to do for her," her close friend Nancy Tuckerman told 
reporters. "The disease has progressed. She will not have any further 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her public life, Onassis has been known as a shy woman who tried to 
shun reporters and cameras but never could escape the glare of the media as it 
tried to satisfy the curiosity of millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 As she fought her illness in the seclusion of her apartment, scores of 
journalists crowded outside the exclusive building. Television trucks and 
special antennas stretched to the edge of the Metropolitan Museum of Art a 
couple of blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton said that he and his wife, First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, had talked with the former First Lady during the last few days 
and were receiving reports on her condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," 
Clinton said. "We're thinking about her and praying for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, relatives and close friends entered the apartment to stand 
at her bedside and then take solace in each other. Her son, 33-year-old John F. 
Kennedy Jr., ran across 5th Avenue from Central Park in the morning so he could 
rush into the building without replying to questions from reporters. Her 
daughter, 36-year-old Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, and her husband, Edwin, 
came to the bedside as well. 
</P>
<P>
 President Kennedy's last surviving brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
and his wife, Victoria, arrived in the early evening after a flight from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who joined the vigil included Onassis' sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and 
two of President Kennedy's sisters -- Eunice Shriver and Patricia Kennedy 
Lawford. Her brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, arrived with Eunice. Their 
daughter, television reporter Maria Shriver, also stopped by. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Kennedy, after visiting his sister-in-law for 90 minutes, told reporters 
that Onassis is "enormously grateful to all the people who have been kind 
enough to send her notes wishing her well. She's resting comfortably and I look 
forward to seeing her tomorrow."  
</P>
<P>
 The media outside chronicled all the comings and goings, not surprising since 
she is widely viewed as the most glamorous of American first ladies, a shy yet 
sophisticated woman who spoke French and immersed herself in the history of the 
White House.  
</P>
<P>
 When President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, the dignity of the young 
widow in black with two small children at her side at his funeral was stamped 
via television into the memory of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that aura was lost when she married the older Greek millionaire 
Aristotle Onassis, five years after the death of the President. But that 
marriage, though it lasted until Aristotle Onassis' death in 1975, was not 
regarded as a happy one, and she did not go to Paris to be near him in his last 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 A widow for the second time, she then entered the book publishing business in 
New York. She is now a senior editor at Bantam-Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, she was often accompanied in public by millionaire Maurice 
Tempelsman. He was reportedly at her bedside Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. George Bardes of St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church, her parish 
church, administered "the sacrament of the sick." That is more commonly known 
by its former name of "the last rites" and is given to anyone who is regarded 
as seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at the hospital had been treating Onassis with radiation and 
chemotherapy since January, when she was first diagnosed as suffering from 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, which produces the 
white blood cells that fight infection and bolster immunity.  
</P>
<P>
 Some variations of this disease are often regarded as curable, but there can 
be sudden relapses. The extent of the seriousness of Onassis' illness was not 
widely known and she was seen strolling in Central Park only Sunday, the day 
before she entered the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The gravity of the illness became clear, however, when she decided to leave 
the hospital and return to her bed in the apartment. "She's near death," said a 
friend of the family. "They're very careful about her privacy and they're 
trying to make it as private and dignified as possible."

event," explained festival spokeswoman Aileen Stein. . . . The four mascots, 
dubbed Super Strawberries, will receive passes to the festival and a free night 
at a hotel. Their costumes will be used by a church group to promote a

ROSTENKOWSKI LAWYERS STILL TALKING WITH JUSTICE DEPT.

 Attorneys for Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) were continuing Thursday to 
bargain with Justice Department officials to conclude a criminal probe that 
could threaten the lawmaker's committee chairmanship and even his ability to 
vote in the House, sources knowledgeable about the case said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) repeated predictions that there would be no 
indictment, and said: "Nobody in this Congress is indispensable.But he is one 
of the key members . . . a member of enormous experience, ability and value." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the status of the Rostenkowski case, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said 
Thursday, "I don't comment on pending prosecutions -- well, pending 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences for the Ways and Means Committee chairman could be 
devastating if he is charged with a felony. A conviction or plea to a 
misdemeanor could bring milder congressional consequences for Rostenkowski, who 
is at the center of efforts to reform health care, remodel welfare and approve 
the latest extension of a new world trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began as a drug-and-embezzlement probe of House post office 
employees in 1991 but eventually focused on Rostenkowski and his campaign and 
office account spending.

 Princess Diana is being hailed as a heroine for helping to save a drowning 
vagrant. The princess was on her way home from a jog in London's Regents Park 
on Sunday when tourists flagged her car, pointed to a bridge over the narrow 
lake and said someone had fallen in.Diana, still in running shoes and shorts, 
reportedly told her chauffeur to call police on the car phone, then dashed to 
the bridge where she was joined by Kari Kotila, 29, a Finnish student living in 
London. Kotila, followed by Diana, climbed over the parapet of the bridge onto 
the bank of the lake. The Finn then swam to the 42-year-old Irish vagrant, by 
then unconscious, and towed him to the bank.

FAA FOUND LAGGING IN TESTING OF BOMB-DETECTION EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Technical glitches are slowing the Federal Aviation Administration's efforts 
to develop new devices to protect airports and planes from terrorist bombs, 
congressional investigators reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the FAA has made little progress in meeting the goals of the 
Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990, a report by the General Accounting 
Office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law directed the FAA to speed up research and development so it would have 
new explosives detection equipment in place by last November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although several devices show promise, technical problems are slowing the 
development and approval of the devices," the GAO study said. "Similarly, FAA's 
efforts to enhance aircraft survivability are promising but are several years 
from completion." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has 40 detection projects under way but has conducted laboratory tests 
on only seven devices, the report said. None of them meets the FAA's 
performance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 An FAA advisory panel has estimated that approval of any new explosives 
detection equipment could be two to five years away, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials said they have not seen the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA is anxiously awaiting the report from the GAO," FAA spokeswoman Liz 
Neblett said. "When it does come out, we will give it all due consideration and 
consider all of their recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said it found a number of 
weaknesses in the FAA's security research program, including the agency's 
reluctance to test new equipment in airports. FAA officials plan to rely on 
tests conducted at its lab, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the airline industry and others disagree with FAA's approach and 
believe that operational testing should be part of the certification process," 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also criticized the FAA for lacking a strategy to guide security 
efforts to put new equipment in place.

SCALES OF JUSTICE: TEACHER WHO MOLESTED 2 GIRLS FORFEITS PIANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge who wanted to punish a piano teacher for molesting two girls decided 
to do so in a way that would affect the defendant most. He has ordered George 
Marrs to stay away from the keyboard for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That condition was part of the probation that state District Judge Ted Poe 
imposed as part of a plea arrangement that kept the musician out of jail for 
fondling 9- and 10-year-old girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took away the most important thing to him," Poe said. "I don't know 
anything about pianos. I don't like pianos. But to him, that piano was the most 
important thing in his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Marrs, 66, was accused of molesting the girls at his home during piano 
lessons. Both girls eventually told their parents, who notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Marrs, who pleaded no contest Wednesday, also must donate his $12,000 piano to 
a children's home and post a sign on the front door of his home that warns 
anyone under 18 to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe conceded Thursday that Marrs might get away with playing a piano somewhere 
other than his home. The intent of the unusual probationary clause, however, is 
to keep him from ever owning a piano again, thus stopping him from giving 
lessons, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 A probation officer, in periodic visits to Marrs' home, will check for pianos, 
Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is certainly appropriate because there is a nexus between the crime and 
the punishment," Poe said. "I see no legal problems at all. It's a means of 
keeping him from possessing a piano."

JOHN SCHUMACHER; RAN FAMED ICE CREAM PARLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Schumacher, the chemist who owned and operated Hollywood's legendary C. 
C. Brown's ice cream parlor for more than three decades, has died. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, who lived in Calabasas, died Monday in Valley Presbyterian 
Hospital, said his son Ted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Schumacher said the family -- Schumacher's wife, Jo Ellen, and his eight 
children -- will continue to operate the shop, closing only today for the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The main attraction of C. C. Brown's, according to Schumacher, has always been 
its hot fudge sundaes with the sauce served in a ceramic pitcher. The sundaes 
are ordered by three-quarters of the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hot fudge sauce is a secret formula. We haven't changed it since 1906," 
John Schumacher told The Times in 1987. "Really, it's like melted candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Schumacher said his father was in the kitchen -- dressed in his trademark 
white shirt, white slacks, white socks and white shoes -- making the sauce, 
sandwiches and candy until illness forced him to stop about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The old-fashioned ice cream parlor, which has withstood competition from a 
modern Haagen-Dazs shop near Mann's Chinese Theater, was created by Clarence 
Clifton Brown in 1906. Brown, an Ohio candy maker who brought his marble table 
and other tools west in a covered wagon, set up shop at 7th and Hill streets. 
The parlor moved to its present site at 7007 Hollywood Blvd. in 1928, complete 
with its original dark booths, horsehair upholstery and metal serving dishes to 
keep the ice cream cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, who always wanted to be in business for himself, started buying 
into C. C. Brown's in 1946 and finally acquired it from Brown's son, Cliff, in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proprietor was so determined to maintain the colorful business as 
generations remembered it that he did not even change prices until 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of Schumacher's secret fudge sauce, C. C. Brown's was one of 
only 24 ice cream stores in the nation recommended in David Hoffman's whimsical 
guidebook, "The Joy of Pigging Out." 
</P>
<P>
 "We get all kinds in here," Schumacher said. "We have dieters who come in and 
break down. We have people who come in and eat here every day -- and they don't 
look fat, no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop has served ice cream aficionados from Mickey Cohen to Ronald Reagan, 
Clark Gable to Michael J. Fox. After Reagan was shot in Washington, staunch 
Republican Schumacher sent him a get-well package of fudge. The President's 
thank-you letter was quickly taped to the shop's display counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher's wife dipped the sundaes and his eight children from two marriages 
grew up in the place, doing their homework in the booths and helping to serve 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife and Ted, Schumacher is survived by his children David, 
Kim, John, Tim, Joseph, Heather and Heidi, and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are to be held today at 11 a.m. at Forest Lawn Hollywood 
Hills.

ANGELS OPENING A NEW CAMPAIGN; BASEBALL: FARRELL, GRAHE COMBINE IN 5-4 VICTORY, 
THEIR FIRST UNDER NEW MANAGER MARCEL LACHEMANN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The temporary scoreboard at Anaheim Stadium displayed video clips of Marcel 
Lachemann's introductory news conference as the Angels' new manager before 
their game Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans watched. They listened. The videotape ended, and they sat in stony 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 They made it quite clear that it's going to take time to warm up to the idea. 
Certainly, they haven't been telephoning the Angel switchboard these past few 
days to exchange pleasantries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels realize there is one way to put an end to this public-relations 
fiasco, and Lachemann did just that Thursday night, managing the Angels to a 
5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals before 20,595. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels celebrated the victory by dousing Lachemann with beer. When he got 
to his office, the telephone was ringing and there was a bottle of champagne 
waiting. His brother, Rene Lachemann, manager of the Florida Marlins, was on 
the phone. The champagne was courtesy of the entire Marlin team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emotion of Rene calling was nice. It means a lot," Lachemann said. "It 
went by quick. I don't know how long the game lasted, but it seemed fast. There 
sure are a lot more things to be involved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sweet, there's no doubt about that." 
</P>
<P>
 There might have been no one who enjoyed the evening more than his 93-year-old 
father, Bill Lachemann, who was listening to the game. He may be too frail to 
go to the ballpark any longer, but it hardly curtailed his fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big day for the whole family," he said. "This is a day I'll never 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
 John Farrell, making his first major league start of the season, 
single-handedly assured that Lachemann's debut would be a success. He gave up 
only six hits and three runs (two earned) in 7 2/3 innings, and his eight 
strikeouts were the most he has had since Sept. 5, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that prevented him from pitching a complete game was Wally 
Joyner's sharp grounder off his right foot. Farrell was taken for X-rays, which 
proved negative. Joe Grahe, who was appointed the Angels' full-time closer by 
Lachemann, pitched the final 1 1/3 innings for the save. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, who stood on the pitcher's mound shaking hands with his team after 
the game, realizes nights such as these are desperately needed to help squelch 
the public's outrage over the firing of manager Buck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 He realizes it will take time before Angel fans accept him, but he plans to 
stick around for a while. He signed a two-year contract through 1995 that 
provides him an automatic one-year severance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel front-office might continue to be publicly abused and threatened by 
fans terminating their support, but management was more convinced than ever 
Thursday that the right man had been hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We respect the public's feelings, believe me, but we can not make decisions 
based on how the public will react," Angel President Richard Brown said. "If 
you're so concerned with the reactions, you might cower and not make the right 
decision that best benefits the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most vociferous outpouring we had was after the (Jim) Abbott trade, and I 
fully understood that. He was a fan favorite and organization favorite. We know 
Buck was popular, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm happy and optimistic because of Marcel Lachemann. I feel we have the 
right person as manager. I'm sure people will see the positive influence he has 
on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Lachemann's influence will be quite noticeable in the media. Gone 
are the days of the manager ridiculing players in the newspapers, chastising 
them on the airwaves or even criticizing them for lack of talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time that I would say anything about a player would be if he showed 
lack of effort," Lachemann said. "I'm never going to say anything about a 
player's ability. If they're not good, we have to get them better. That's our 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers' heavy criticism of his players helped trigger his firing. Club 
sources say Rodgers was warned about his style but refused to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are going to make some mistakes," Lachemann said. "But as long as 
they're aggressive mistakes and they're not repetitious, that's part of 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you've got the patience to ride through that, you're going to develop 
some real fine players." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, whose lone managerial experience before Thursday consisted of four 
games as an interim manager in 1992, doesn't say he will turn the team around. 
He makes no promises and certainly doesn't blame the Angels' 18-24 record on 
Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to fool anybody," Lachemann said. "I'll need help. I haven't 
handled a lineup card in 12 years. But I've been very fortunate to have been 
under a lot of very good managers and learn different things. 
</P>
<P>
 "John McNamara was a guy who made the game fun. Gene Mauch probably is the 
greatest strategist that I've ever been around. With Doug Rader, it was his 
intelligence, thoroughness and attention to detail. Buck was one of the better 
managers that I was ever with as far as handling a ballgame, and he was almost 
fearless in making moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother Rene is a lot of those guys put together."

SHARP HERSHISER SINKS ROCKIES; DODGERS: PITCHER IMPROVES TO 3-0. RODRIGUEZ, 
BUTLER AND PIAZZA GET THE BIG HITS AS TEAM MAKES IT NINE OF 10, 8-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The winds had been gusting all day Thursday, then picked up in the late 
innings at Mile High Stadium, but it didn't matter to the Dodgers. By then, 
they had 15 hits and were on their way to another victory, an 8-2 blowout of 
the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Even rookie infielder Garey Ingram got in on the fun. Ingram, batting for the 
first time as a major leaguer, hit a 2-2 pitch 384 feet into the left-field 
seats, then strode around the bases with a big smile on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got back to the bench, Mike Piazza had something to say to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him it wasn't that easy," Piazza said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, though, are making it look easy these days. After a string of 
eight one-run games that had Manager Tom Lasorda's stomach in knots, they have 
scored 35 runs in the last five games. And it doesn't matter that those games 
have been against the Rockies and San Diego Padres, the Dodgers are accepting 
all victories and remain in sole possession of first place in the National 
League West.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you what, it's contagious," said Brett Butler, who hit .444, scored 
five runs and drove in three during the four-game Colorado series. "We've got a 
rookie (Raul Mondesi) with 51 hits already, and Eli (Tim Wallach) who has 
rejuvenated his career. We have five guys hitting over .300." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers have won nine of their last 10 and took three of four here for 
their first series victory on the road. Five starters had more than one hit 
Thursday, helping Orel Hershiser to his third victory. With better support, 
better relief pitching or both, he might well have had seven victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser, 3-0 with a 2.54 earned-run average, has held opponents to three 
earned runs or fewer in each of his nine starts this season, turning over a 
lead in most of them. He is pitching his best since 1990, when he hurt his 
shoulder and underwent reconstructive surgery. He is stronger, his breaking 
ball is sharper and his sinker more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, he gave up two runs -- one earned -- in seven innings before leaving 
because he felt some mild discomfort in his hip, which he had jammed sliding 
into second base during the San Francisco series two weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our team is winning on the days I pitch, and that is important because I 
would like to return to the playoffs, " said Hershiser, the only player 
remaining from the 1988 World Series championship team. "I'm trying to keep us 
in the game until the sixth or seventh inning. Earlier in my career I wanted to 
go nine every time out. I don't see it as a cop-out, I see it as a strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy of hitting instructor Reggie Smith is to get the players to drive 
the ball, and their collective .286 batting average leads the league. They are 
getting good at putting together the big inning, and in this game, as in the 
game before it, the Dodgers scored five runs in the sixth, chasing starter 
David Nied (5-3) and taking a 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi, who is batting .333, had two doubles and a triple, scored and drove 
in a run. He extended his hitting streak to 11 games, during which he is 
batting .429 with five runs, two triples and five doubles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had seven straight games, now I get 11, maybe I get 100 straight games," 
joked Mondesi, who leads the league with 10 outfield assists and is tied with 
Butler for the league lead with five triples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy tells me every game, 'Don't swing at bad pitches.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Delino DeShields went two for three and stole the 200th base of his career, 
and Butler tripled, singled, scored two runs and drove in two. Piazza, who is 
batting .323, was three for five, including a two-run single in the sixth 
inning and a run-scoring grounder in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rodriguez hit his fifth homer in the second inning and started the 
sixth-inning rally when he pulled a line-drive single to right. He is batting 
.364. 
</P>
<P>
 Even reliever Roger McDowell got into the game, although he said later he 
needed a map to find the mound. McDowell, who hadn't worked in eight games, 
pitched two hitless innings.  
</P>
<P>
 "This team is capable of winning, and we still haven't hit our potential," 
Hershiser said. "I said that last week, and I still think it. We aren't firing 
on all cylinders. Bop (DeShields) and Offy (Jose Offerman), our speed game, 
aren't there yet. And the bullpen, Todd's been hurt. The starting rotation is 
just starting to come around. There's a lot of potential left to be fulfilled."

INDIANA FINISHES OFF HAWKS, 98-79 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After dodging a playoff bullet in their first series, the Atlanta Hawks took 
one straight between the eyes Thursday when the Indiana Pacers beat them, 
98-79, to win their NBA Eastern Conference semifinal series, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks, who had the best record in the East during the regular season and 
were seeded first going into the playoffs, had been extended to a fifth game in 
beating the Miami Heat in the first round, but this time the competition proved 
too stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Rik Smits, a thorn in Atlanta's side in the final four games of the 
series, scored 11 of his 27 points a third quarter in which Indiana outscored 
the Hawks, 34-16. The Pacers opened the second half with a 12-2 spurt for a 
50-37 lead and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks joined the Seattle on the playoff sidelines in the first year since 
1977-78 that both top-seeded teams failed to advance to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana advanced to the finals, to play the winner of the Chicago-New York 
series, for the first time since entering the NBA in 1976. The franchise had 
won three ABA championships, but had been 4-17 in NBA playoff games before this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana, which swept the Orlando Magic in the opening round, improved to 7-2 
in this year's playoffs, including a 4-0 record at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers nursed a 38-35 lead at halftime before blowing the game open in the 
third quarter. Atlanta closed within 53-46 with 4:08 to play in the third, but 
the Pacers answered with a 19-5 surge to end the quarter and put the game out 
of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller had 18 points, Derrick McKey 17 and reserve Byron Scott 14 for 
the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning had 21 points for the Hawks.

 Downey's California: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marge Schott's comment about "fruits" was misunderstood. What she meant 
was, she doesn't want Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I don't think the baseball is juiced. I think Marge is. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fill in the blank: Jennifer Capriati hates playing tennis on clay. Jennifer 
likes playing tennis on -- . 
</P>
<P>
 -- I say New York takes the Stanley Cup and the NBA championship trophy, then 
hocks 'em both. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What do brothers Rene and Marcel Lachemann have in common, besides managing 
major league teams? Rene landed the Marlins. Marcel landed the Salmons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dodgers put a cardboard cutout of Tom Lasorda on the field during the 
national anthem. The Angels would love to have a cardboard manager they could 
push around and keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I bet Brett Butler bunted in T-ball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Butler is the kind of hitter who can spray the ball to every part of the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Delino DeShields wore his stockings any higher, they'd be leggings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Clippers have expressed interest in Buck Rodgers.

 -- Having won the European soccer title, AC Milan is expected to sign with the 
Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some people are so politically correct, they say the Kentucky Derby was won 
by Go For Non-Alcoholic Beverage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I like Florida State to repeat as college football's national champion, 
provided it has 11 players left. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Air Pippen shoes. For that very special moment when the game is on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How can John Stockton play basketball in those little pants? 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Stockton wore Karl Malone's pants, all you would see would be his ankles 
and eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Brown is considering coaching both teams in the Eastern Conference 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Denver center's full name is Dikembe Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba Jean 
Jacque Wamutombo. This is so ironic. Mine, too. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Question: Who can run with footballs, swing at baseballs and dunk 
basketballs? Answer: Mutombo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Good thing the Kings cleaned house after missing the Stanley Cup finals for 
one year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Someone asked if the Fighting Illini from the University of Illinois should 
drop their nickname, now that the Warriors of Marquette have. First things 
first. First they have to drop the name Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Julio Cesar Chavez has just been announced as the winner of his next fight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Toronto named its NBA team after prehistoric creatures. The Lakers last 
season played several. 
</P>
<P>
 -- First player the Raptors should sign is Dino Radja. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After that, Rex Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dennis Rodman probably thinks Raptors are four guys who sing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hey, I have seen the Texas Rangers play baseball. Go ahead, let Jose 
Canseco pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There isn't a team in that division that couldn't use Geena Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- OK, I say Ken Griffey Jr., gets homer No. 62 on Sept. 25. What day do you 
say? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jody Reed is doing so well, his agent is thinking of asking Milwaukee for a 
pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No wonder "L.A. Law" is over. Arnold Becker kept ignoring his clients to 
play third base for Cleveland in those movies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Carter has vertigo. Poor Joe. Next time he bats against Mitch Williams, 
he won't be able to follow the trajectory of the ball as it comes down. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The World Cup soccer final will be played before an estimated 92,000 fans 
at Pasadena and will be seen in the United States on television by an estimated 
92,000 viewers.

<P>
 -- Now available in paperback, "The Stand," Stephen King's story of a place 
where you keep buying hot dogs while waiting for a World Cup team to score a

about our new "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nancy Kerrigan's attackers were found guilty last week under Oregon's new 
"three stooges" law. 
</P>
<P>

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; MATTEAU IS RANGER STAR THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A first-game goat, Stephane Matteau got to play the other role in Game 3 and 
found being a hero much more to his liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Matteau scored in front of the net on a back-hander 6:13 into the second 
overtime Thursday night to give the New York Rangers a 3-2 victory over the New 
Jersey Devils and a 2-1 lead in the Eastern Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Rangers' second in a row and it restored the home-ice 
advantage New York blew in losing Game 1 at home Sunday, in part because of a 
give-away by Matteau that led to a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different feeling," Matteau said. "In the first game people 
remember the pass I put on Bernie Nicholls' stick, a perfect pass that led to a 
goal. It turned things around and I felt pretty cheap and bad after that. 
Obviously this is a payback for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The payback was made possible when Mike Richter saved the game for New York by 
stopping Tommy Albelin on a two-on-one breakaway 3:40 into the second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three minutes later at the end of a long shift, Matteau struck after 
some hard work by Alexei Kovalev and Glenn Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson sent the puck from behind the net to Kovalev and he tried to chip it 
over Devil goalie Martin Brodeur. The shot went over the net and hit New Jersey 
defenseman Scott Stevens and bounced back in front. Matteau then got the puck 
and scored his fourth goal of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The puck came around the crease a few times," Matteau said. "It came out on 
my stick, I just saw the opportunity and put it in. I saw it at the last 
second. I was lucky enough it went on my stick and it went in." 
</P>
<P>
 The shot was the 50th of the game for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the goalies were playing we could have been here all night," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 4 will be Saturday night at the Meadowlands Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was extremely frustrating for the Devils, who saw a great opportunity 
to win vanish when Richter stopped Albelin. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams had chances to either score a go-ahead goal in the third period or 
win in the first overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The best chance in the first overtime belonged to Nicholls. He got the rebound 
of a bad-angle shot from the right corner by Tom Chorske right in front and 
fired it back in Richter's pads with 7:52 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in close and had to shoot it right away," said Nicholls. "It was a good 
save." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had had an equally good opportunity a few minutes earlier, just after 
stepping out of the penalty box. Breaking in from the right side, he took a 
cross-ice pass from Esa Tikkanen and missed a virtually open net.

MORNING BRIEFING: OUTFIELD NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR HOT PANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bret Barberie, Florida Marlin second baseman, recently sat out a game because 
he inadvertently rubbed hot pepper into his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle outfielder Brian Turang previously was burned in a more embarrassing 
place. After Turang made a diving catch in a game against Detroit on a cold 
afternoon, he leaped to his feet and ran toward the dugout with his hand on his 
posterior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took one of those plastic hand warmers out with me to stay warm, and then 
put it in my back pocket," Turang said. "When I dove, it broke and all those 
hot chunks were burning me. It was like I was on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Turang: Teammate Ken Griffey Jr. witnessed Turang's adventure and said, 
"He jumped into the air and hit a note that made him sound like Michael 
Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Why was it impossible for a horse to win the Triple Crown in 1917 
and 1922? Clip and save: After quarterback Browning Nagle was cut by the New 
York Jets, he said: "I'll have the last laugh, that goes without saying. That's 
what I told (Coach) Pete Carroll. I'm going to make them look like fools. They 
played me for a fool, and what goes around comes around." 
</P>
<P>
 Snails on hold: Atlanta wide receiver Andre Rison would have earned $90,000 
for a three-week trip to France to participate in a pro-am basketball 
tournament. However, he put the trip on hold to attend a Falcon mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did it because he likes June Jones, the new coach. "If it was still 
(Jerry) Glanville coaching, I'd be into that parlez vous stuff, eating snails, 
and somebody would be checking my passport right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Off and running: Del Harris, the new Laker coach, is made for California. His 
given name is Delmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet time: From "The Little Team That Could," a new book by former major 
leaguer Jeff Burroughs, a coach of Long Beach's Little League championship 
team: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was long past midnight by the time the 13 little delinquents on our bus 
finally fell asleep. The relief was tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the way America feels when the State of the Union address ends, or 
when sportscaster Dick Vitale signs off."  
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1947, the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Boston 
Braves, 4-3, in a game that produced 22 hits -- all singles. The Pirates had 12 
and the Braves 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers beware: C.W. Nevius in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Baseball players 
are, by consensus, the rudest, crudest, prickliest interviews in the business. 
There are several exceptions, but for the most part, the rule for a reporter is 
simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are invisible. You may make peeping noises to attract attention, but 
there is always the chance you will annoy the great man and he will have to 
curse or shout at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Kentucky Derby and Preakness were run on the same day.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: MCENROE TAKES CONFERENCE CALLS TO ANOTHER LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the unpleasant aspects of covering sports television is the conference 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 In the good old days, before the sports television business grew to 
unmanageable proportions, public relations people would line up one-on-one 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 They still do in some cases, but normal procedure now is to put 30 or 40 
sports television reporters on the line with an announcer, producer or 
executive -- or all three at the same time -- to drum up interest in an event. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times a reporter could do three or four conference calls a day. 
Usually, though, they are a waste of time. Who's going to say anything 
provocative or revealing with 30 or 40 reporters on the line? 
</P>
<P>
 John McEnroe, that's who. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC and the USA network, which will both use McEnroe as a commentator during 
the French Open, had him on a conference call Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For one hour 15 minutes, McEnroe, rambling sometimes but mostly honest and 
open, entertained reporters on a variety of topics. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, he praised tennis, calling it and soccer the two best sports in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, he criticized tennis for what it has become -- a sport played by 
spoiled athletes, or "robots," who simply think it is enough to go out and play 
good tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticized tennis for allowing young girls, such as Jennifer Capriati, 
to play professionally at 13 or 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a concept of what $5 is, let alone $5 million," he said. 
"They're expected to grow up in front of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe said the organizations that run tennis will handle the current 
Capriati situation -- her arrest on a marijuana possession charge and 
subsequent entry into a drug-rehabilitation program -- the way they usually 
handle such things. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will run away faster than Carl Lewis," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, McEnroe stirred things up during a similar conference call before 
the U.S. Open when he said women such as Mary Carillo should not be announcing 
men's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do women know about the men's game?" he said, adding that men shouldn't 
announce women's tennis. "How would they know how women are feeling at certain 
times of the month?" 
</P>
<P>
 He touched on the same topic Wednesday, and said he hadn't changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 And that led to the highlight of the conference call, which he saved till 
last, after all seemingly had been said. 
</P>
<P>
 A late arrival, Richard Sandomir of the New York Times, apologized and asked 
if there were time for one more question. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to know if McEnroe had seen a recent Sports Illustrated on the cover 
of which was the question, "Is Tennis Dying?" 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe said he had glanced through the story but hadn't put much stock in it 
because the writer didn't really know much about tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 He then repeated some of the points he had made about tennis earlier in the 
call -- that it is disorganized, that there is too much of it on television, 
that matches are too long, that the players are robots, that the sport needs to 
do a better job of promoting itself, that it needs a push to get going again. 
</P>
<P>
 He then complained that too much attention was given to his comments about 
Carillo and female tennis announcers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 10 more important things in tennis that need to be addressed before 
we worry about who's commentating," he said. "I mean, who cares?" 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing, he was soon attacking announcers in general and Bob Costas in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who do these announcers think they are, carrying on like they own the . . . 
sport, guys like Bob Costas?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what specifically bothers him about Costas, McEnroe said it was just the 
way he carries himself in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want an example, we're sitting around and, after a break, they show 
him at his home (in St. Louis) shooting free throws," McEnroe said. "I can't 
remember who it was with. (It was Dan Dierdorf, a neighbor). Who gives a . . . 
? 
</P>
<P>
 "Has he ever played the game? Maybe in a peewee league and the five-foot and 
under league. So he can shoot a free throw. What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
 "(Shaquille) O'Neal is a 60% free-throw shooter, but if he got Bob Costas out 
on the floor he'd step on him and squash him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Costas later: "Some critiques are thoughtful and well researched, some 
are not. Consider the source." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When McEnroe was in his prime as a player, he was known for his uncontrolled 
temper. Now it is his mouth that is out of control, which isn't necessarily a 
bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He gives sportswriters plenty to write about. 
</P>
<P>
 But sportswriters were also among his targets Wednesday. In particular, he 
went after Newsday's Mike Lupica. 
</P>
<P>
 "People read his column and believe what he writes, which is ludicrous," 
McEnroe said. "Somehow he gets a courtside ticket to the Knick games and then 
sits around and criticizes everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe also complained about negative sports reporting in general. He 
suggested that maybe reporters are so negative because they are underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think press people need to make more money, and us athletes should be paid 
less," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, Mickey Mantle would be making $70,000 and the newspaper guy 
$30,000. Now Shaquille is making $20 million and you're making $20,000. There's 
too much discrepancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, one last thing from McEnroe: "Don't quote me on any of this stuff."

NBA PLAYOFFS / WESTERN CONFERENCE SEMIFINALS; SUNS BEAT ROCKETS TO FORESTALL 
VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All-Star forward Charles Barkley, who maintains that he's retiring after this 
season, will have to work at least one more game. 
</P>
<P>
 On the verge of being eliminated from the NBA playoffs after losing three 
games in a row to Houston, the Phoenix Suns stayed alive by beating the 
Rockets, 103-89, Thursday night in the sixth game of their Western Conference 
semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley had 18 points and 15 rebounds and guard Kevin Johnson had 28 points 
and 13 assists as the Suns tied the series, 3-3. Game 7 will be played Saturday 
at Houston, where the Suns won the first two games of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley said he felt no pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the guys I was going to Houston tomorrow, or I was going to Vegas," 
Barkley said. "I was going to have a good weekend (regardless). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the best game we've played so far. In Games 3 and 4 I didn't 
play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Paul Westphal: "I've got a lot of confidence. We all thought at the 
start of the series it would go seven, and it's been a crazy road to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward A.C. Green, who started his first playoff game of the season, had 22 
points and 10 rebounds, including 12 points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "A.C. was phenomenal," Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns did a good job of defending center Hakeem Olajuwon, who had 23 points 
but made only nine of 21 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix, on the verge of becoming the first team since the 1969 Lakers and 
only the second team in NBA playoff history to lose a best-of-seven series 
after winning the first two games on the road, led, 76-66, going into the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they were one loss away from starting their summer vacation, the Suns 
are used to living life on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 During their drive to the 1993 NBA Western Conference title, the Suns faced 
elimination six times and were 5-1 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Suns about to set Thursday, Westphal shuffled his lineup, inserting 
Green in place of Cedric Ceballos and center Oliver Miller for Mark West, who 
shot only 33.3% in the first five games of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was reserve center Joe Klein who energized the Suns, who led, 50-47, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, who averaged only 3.9 points and 2.6 rebounds during the regular 
season, had eight points and two rebounds in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein also harassed Olajuwon, who made only five of 13 shots in the first half 
as the Rockets shot 36.4%. Olajuwon missed four of five shots in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, who imposed a gag order on the Suns before the game, let his game do 
the talking, scoring 14 points and grabbing 13 rebounds in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns, who shot 33.3% in the first quarter, shot 53% in the second, making 
nine of 17 shots and outscoring Houston, 30-25.

NUGGETS STOP JAZZ, MOVE CLOSER TO HISTORIC COMEBACK; NBA PLAYOFFS: MUTOMBO AND 
STITH'S FREE THROWS COMPLETE RALLY IN 94-91 SERIES-TYING VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 The Denver Nuggets keep making history, and they do it in the oddest ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as getting two winning free throws from Dikembe Mutombo, among the team's 
worst foul shooters during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as overcoming two missed free throws by Robert Pack, which allowed Utah 
to attempt a game-tying three-pointer that barely missed in the Nuggets' 94-91 
victory Thursday night that evened their series with the Jazz at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutombo, who had 23 points, 12 rebounds and five blocked shots, and Bryant 
Stith each sank two free throws in the final 30 seconds, helping Denver become 
only the second team in NBA history to come back from a 3-0 deficit and force a 
seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah guard Jeff Hornacek missed a wide-open three-pointer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other team to tie a series 3-3 after trailing 3-0 was the 1951 New 
York Knicks, who eventually lost Game 7 of that series to the Rochester Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already made history once," said Stith, referring to their comeback 
from 0-2 against Seattle. "There's no pressure on us at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Game 7 is scheduled for Saturday in Salt Lake City, where the Nuggets will be 
bidding to become the first team in NBA history to win a playoff series after 
falling behind 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan urged restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no panic," he said. "We still have all our arms and all our legs. 
It's just basketball, no need for all the craziness. We've still got the 
home-court advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Sloan said the Nuggets "hit tough shots and that's what turned the flow." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz controlled the game for the first three quarters and led, 74-67, 
entering the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone led Utah with 31 points and 15 rebounds.

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; NCAA THROWS UNEXPECTED SHUTOUT WITH NO WESTERN 
REGIONALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The slap in the face that the NCAA administered to college baseball in the 
West is still being felt. For the first time, none of the eight playoff 
regionals that begin next week will be in this part of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Few question the historic strength of the West. Western schools have won 26 of 
47 College World Series. Last year, Long Beach State and Arizona State advanced 
to Omaha. In 1992, Pepperdine and Cal State Fullerton played for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But that history apparently means little to a selection committee that appears 
to be more concerned with the bottom line than with equal representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any coach on the West Coast has got to feel a tap on the shoulder that says, 
'Hey, by the way, you guys are not that important anymore,' " Pepperdine Coach 
Andy Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The West's downfall is directly related to the economic success college 
baseball is enjoying in other parts of the nation, particularly the South, 
which was awarded regional sites at Miami, Tallahassee, Fla.; Baton Rouge, La.; 
Knoxville, Tenn., and Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sites, as well as Stillwater, Okla.; Wichita, Kan., and Austin, Tex., 
have demonstrated the ability to draw big crowds and turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the schools selected have great attendance history and great support," 
said Dave Keilitz, chairman of the selection committee. "We also have to 
consider the teams we know for sure are going to be in (the tournament)." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the schools from the West that submitted regional bids, only Arizona State 
has a history of financial success. And Arizona State's bid was reportedly 
about half as much as it usually would be because of anticipated competition 
for fans from the Phoenix Suns. It would have been very difficult for the 
committee to ignore Tempe if the Sun Devils had won the perennially powerful 
Pacific 10 Southern Division title. Arizona State, however, finished second 
behind Stanford, whose bid fell short because its stadium has no lights, 
Keilitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools in the West were handicapped by various factors. Fresno State 
could guarantee the crowds, but if the Bulldogs do not beat Brigham Young in 
the Western Athletic Conference championship series this week, there is no 
guarantee that Fresno State will receive one of the 24 at-large berths in the 
48-team tournament. Nevada, co-champion of the Big West Conference, has no 
track record for drawing large crowds, and Long Beach State's bid never got 
before the committee because it was inadvertently stapled to the back of 
another school's proposal by the NCAA office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say I'm getting used to getting on planes and traveling to another 
part of the country on Memorial Day weekend," Long Beach Coach Dave Snow said. 
"I think they're sending out a pretty strong message that, in their opinion, 
that's where they're doing the job of promoting baseball. It's coming down to 
money and politics. I'm not sure where fair comes into play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia Time: Which school has been host of the most consecutive NCAA regional 
tournaments? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA will announce the 48-team field for the tournament on Monday 
afternoon during a program on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen conference champions or conference tournament champions receive 
automatic berths in the tournament that ends June 3-11 with the College World 
Series at Omaha. Twelve conferences, including the West Coast Conference, will 
be involved in play-ins this weekend to determine six other berths. Twenty-four 
schools will receive at-large berths based on their records and strength of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 Southern Division champion Stanford is assured a spot in the 
tournament. USC and Arizona State would be certain selections were it not for 
the NCAA's arcane method of rating conferences. Pac-10 Southern Division teams 
and Northern Division teams are regarded as one conference -- even though there 
is not inter-divisional play and the Northern Division schools play weaker 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being ranked among the top 10 for most of the season, USC and Arizona 
State are on the bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada, Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton tied for the Big West 
Conference championship. Nevada earned the automatic bid, but Fullerton and 
Long Beach are locks for invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge finished 25-30 and will miss the playoffs for the first 
time since moving to Division I in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine could miss the playoffs for the first time since 1990. The Waves 
finished 33-20 overall and in second place behind Santa Clara in the WCC. The 
Waves are hoping that the WCC's improved power rating and record against other 
conferences will work in their favor. Last year, WCC teams had a 48-70-1 record 
in nonconference games against Division I opponents. This year, they improved 
to 59-56. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is a member of the four-member West Regional Advisory Committee, but 
he's not sure how much impact that will have on selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel a lot better about our chances if there was a Western regional 
site," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we have to hope a lot of things happen. Fresno State has to beat BYU and 
Santa Clara has to spank Jackson State. If they don't, I don't think we're 
going anywhere." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Ila Borders finished her first season as a pitcher for Southern California 
College with a 2-4 record and 2.92 earned-run average in 49 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, a freshman left-hander from Whittier, gave up 48 hits, walked 17 and 
struck out six. She earned a complete-game victory against Claremont-Mudd and 
limited opponents to a .244 batting average.

REDS' HANSON BEATS SMOLTZ, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erik Hanson is finally coming out of his slump. John Smoltz's misery just 
keeps getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson pitched eight shutout innings Thursday and the Cincinnati Reds scored 
twice off an injured Smoltz for a 3-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson (3-3) allowed five hits, struck out seven and walked one to get his 
first victory since May 3. Only two runners reached scoring position against 
him. Chuck McElroy pitched a perfect ninth for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 It was by far Hanson's best performance in his first season with the Reds, who 
thought they were getting a dependable starter when they got him in a trade 
with Seattle last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and illness set him back in spring training. He said his fastball 
finally was back to normal on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling a little better every time out," he said. "At the start of the 
season, I wasn't ready. I didn't want to admit it. Every outing I've gone out 
and felt a little better, a little more confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz (2-6) couldn't feel much worse after his fifth straight loss, matching 
the longest slump of his career. He had a swollen leg to go with all the 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz severely bruised his lower left leg while tagging Tony Fernandez out at 
the plate in the first inning, and needed several minutes to recover. He got 
ice between innings, but stayed in the game and pitched well enough to win. He 
allowed just three hits in seven innings, none after the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-hander walked three and struck out six before leaving for a 
pinch-hitter in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves have scored just nine runs during his five losses, including four 
in the last three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm tired of giving the other pitcher credit," he said. "I love to 
work with something (a lead). Unfortunately, I haven't had that." 
</P>
<P>
 Same thing Thursday: He gives up one earned run and loses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was outstanding," manager Bobby Cox said. "You can't pitch any better than 
that. He had a bruised leg, too." 
</P>
<P>
 That was little consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 2-6 and I've heard 'great game" seven times," Smoltz said. "Personally, 
I'm satisfied with the way I'm throwing the ball. I'm frustrated that we 
haven't been able to win my games." 
</P>
<P>
 His only bad pitch Thursday was his first. Barry Larkin hit it for his third 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez followed with a single, took second on left fielder Ryan Klesko's 
wild relay throw and went to third on Hal Morris' groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez tried to score when one of Smoltz's pitches bounced about 10 feet 
away from Charlie O'Brien, but the catcher recovered quickly and threw to 
Smoltz covering the plate. Fernandez slid in with his left foot high and rammed 
Smoltz's lower leg as he was tagged out. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz limped away from the plate, grimaced and threw the ball to the ground. 
He was treated for several minutes and stayed in the game, but got the leg 
iced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have a tough time walking tomorrow," Smoltz said. "When it first 
happened I didn't know if I was going to be able to pitch. There was a 
tremendous throb." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds added a run in the third when Larkin singled, took second as Klesko 
bobbled the ball for another error, then moved to third on O'Brien's passed 
ball. Morris then hit a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez singled home a run off Mike Stanton in the eighth.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; NERVOUS ROOKIE HOMERS FIRST TIME UP 
</P>

 Dodger infielder Garey Ingram pinch-hit for Orel Hershiser in the eighth 
inning of Thursday's game, and he said he hadn't been that nervous since his 
first day of double-A ball. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first major league at-bat, Ingram homered against Colorado reliever 
Mike Munoz, becoming the 38th player in the National League to homer in his 
first at-bat and the 67th player overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hit it, I just took off running, I was so excited," said Ingram, who 
was called up May 14 from double-A San Antonio to replace Dave Hansen, who is 
on the disabled list. "Brett (Butler) was there waiting for me and he was 
smiling, it made me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who was in the on-deck circle, said he was happy for Ingram. "I told 
him someday you will be bouncing your grandchildren on your knee, and you will 
be telling them about your first major league at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros, who had gone 28 consecutive games without committing an error, 
made two Thursday, misplaying a grounder in the first inning and throwing away 
a routine double-play ball in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter error cost the Dodgers a run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was due," said Karros, who has four errors this season. "That first ball, I 
thought I had it and when I looked in my glove it wasn't there, and the second 
one was tailor-made for a double play, I just took too much time. I thought we 
were out of the inning and in the dugout and then threw it away. " 
</P>
<P>
 Karros is batting .265 with five home runs, 10 doubles and 13 runs batted in. 
"I'm traditionally a second- half player and right now, they haven't depended 
on me. There's Mike (Piazza), Eli (Tim Wallach), (Raul) Mondesi who are coming 
through. But there will be a time when we will need my bat, and I will be 
there."

 Todd Worrell said he will throw again on Saturday and probably be activated 
when the team returns home on Monday. . . . Ramon Martinez said he has felt 
back stiffness before, but nothing like he did during Monday's game. He 
believes it occurred when he struck out in the sixth inning, but says he is 
much improved and will start Saturday. . . . Manager Tom Lasorda will give the 
commencement address at graduation for the College of the Arts at Long Beach 
State on May 27. MARYANN HUDSON

 Cincinnati Red owner Marge Schott, suspended from baseball last year for using 
racial and ethnic slurs, reportedly said she doesn't want her ballplayers to 
wear earrings because "only fruits wear earrings." 
</P>
<P>
 Schott's remark, reported in today's editions of The Cincinnati Enquirer, was 
made to about 115 people at a meeting of the Ohio County Treasurers Assn. on 
Wednesday.She was talking about the appearance of ballplayers with scruffy 
beards or who wear earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's come to the point that the city has become used to being embarrassed by 
Marge Schott's mouth," Tomm Kamm, spokesman for Cincinnati's Gay & Lesbian 
March Activists-ACT UP, told the Enquirer. "I'm sure people will respond to it, 
and I'm offended. But she knows what she's saying. I think it's mostly a 
behavioral problem and people should just ignore it. Unfortunately, that's just 
Marge." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball's ruling executive council, chaired by Milwaukee Brewer owner Bud 
Selig, will investigate Schott's comment.

 Representatives for baseball owners and players gathered in New York for 3 1/2

 Union head Donald Fehr said the talks were "not productive in any significant 
way," but management negotiator Richard Ravitch termed the talks "productive 
and useful."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; IS MCDOWELL BURIED IN THE BULLPEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda faced questions concerning his use of the bullpen 
for the second consecutive day. Lasorda relies mostly on closer Darren Dreifort 
and set-up reliever Jim Gott, often overlooking Roger McDowell.The other three 
relievers are left-handers, whom Lasorda uses in spot situations. McDowell has 
appeared in only 11 games, Dreifort has pitched in 19 and Gott in 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Dodgers' games have been close, which would seem to warrant using 
Gott or Dreifort. But in Monday night's 9-2 blowout, when Ramon Martinez had to 
leave suddenly in the seventh inning because of a stiff lower back, Gott got 
the call and Dreifort was sent in to pitch the ninth inning. At that point, 
McDowell, who is 0-2 with a 4.63 earned-run average, hadn't pitched for six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda defended his using Dreifort, saying he was warming up anyway and 
hadn't pitched since Friday. "Plus, you never know in (Mile High Stadium)," 
Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi's single in the third inning extended his hitting streak to 10 
games, the team's longest of the season. . . . Colorado pitcher Marvin Freeman, 
who was scheduled to start Wednesday's game, was scratched because of an upper 
respiratory condition and Willie Blair took his place. . . . Ellis Burks was 
sidelined because of a sprained left wrist he suffered on a checked swing in 
his second at-bat during Tuesday's game. . . . Ramon Martinez's stiff lower 
back has improved and he appears on schedule to start Saturday. . . . Todd 
Worrell said he felt fine the day after throwing, but Lasorda said he wasn't 
sure yet if Worrell will be ready to come off the disabled list Friday. MARYANN

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; DISARCINA: PLAYERS ARE TOO SENSITIVE

<TEXT>

 Shortstop Gary DiSarcina said he hopes Buck Rodgers' habit of saying exactly 
what was on his mind didn't play a role in his firing. But if some Angel 
players were offended by Rodgers' less-than-complimentary public critiques, 
DiSarcina suggests they find a new way to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you expect any praise when you've done your job well, then you ought to 
expect to get ripped if you don't," DiSarcina said. "And if you're sensitive 
about reviews of your performance, then you've picked the wrong profession."

 Rookie left-hander Brian Anderson, who broke his thumb while trying to field a 
ground ball with his bare hand May 6, is still wearing a cast but was cleared 
to play catch for the first time Wednesday. . . . Most of the Angels were sad 
to see Rodgers go, but many -- pitchers especially -- will be happy to see 
Marcel Lachemann return. The former Angel pitching coach has been almost a 
father figure for some of them. "The thing about Lach," Scott Lewis said, "is 
that he had this way of finding something good about the worst day you ever 
had." . . . Before Wednesday night's game, the Angels had more hits (396) than 
any team in baseball. But opponents were hitting .292 against Angel pitching.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LACHEMANN MAKES GRAHE CLOSER AGAIN 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann had not even taken his first lineup card to 
home-plate when he made his first big decision. No longer would the Angels use 
a bullpen by committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He is going with one man: Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what it does to that particular pitcher when he knows he's the 
closer," Lachemann said. "Joe did very well in that role when I was here." 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe was successful in 21 of 24 save opportunities in 1992 when Bryan Harvey 
was put on the disabled list. Yet Grahe lost his closer's role last season 
while succeeding in 16 of 20 saves since Lachemann left the Angels to become 
pitching coach for the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to working with him again," said Grahe. "I think it helps 
to have a role. It keeps you from having an emotional roller-coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have more knowledge on how you're used, it helps you prepare for 
that role better." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Butcher, Craig Lefferts and Bob Patterson will be used in the set-up and 
middle relief roles; Mark Leiter and John Dopson will be employed in long 
relief. BOB NIGHTENGALE

PREP GOLF / CITY CHAMPIONSHIP; ANGEL CRUISES, GRANADA HILLS WINS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darren Angel of Granada Hills High decided to hold nothing back on the final 
hole of the City Section golf championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel tried to drive the green on the 350-yard par four and came up just 
short.Other than that, precious little went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel shot his second consecutive three-under 69 Thursday at Knollwood Country 
Club in Granada Hills to win the individual title by 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he teed off at No. 18, the title was won. So why not let her rip? 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do it," said Angel, grinning. "I've driven (the green) before." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been in the winner's circle before too. Last year, as a sophomore, he 
won the individual crown and led Granada Hills to the team title. The 
Highlanders won the title again with a five-man total of 804, edging Grant by 
two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel's score could have been even better -- he missed a half-dozen putts from 
12 feet or less. Angel, the L.A. City junior champion, set the course record at 
Knollwood two months ago with a 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Golditch of Taft shot 73 to finish second individually at 148. STEVE

RUELAS TUNES UP AGAINST ALEXANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a title fight just over the horizon, Gabriel Ruelas has a 10-round 
tune-up tonight at the Olympic Auditorium against Paris Alexander, best known 
for being knocked out by Oscar De La Hoya in two rounds last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas (37-2, 20 knockouts), who was knocked down by Raul Hernandez in his 
last tune-up, is the No. 1 contender among World Boxing Council 
junior-lightweights and is due for a title fight against champion James Leija 
within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Ruelas camp worried that he might be looking past Alexander (16-8-3, 
three knockouts)? 
</P>
<P>
 "Every fight, you wonder if you're going to throw a wrench in the gears," said 
trainer Joe Goossen. "But we've got to fight guys like Paris Alexander to stay 
sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't fight, you'll get rusty. If you do, you take your chances. But 
if you're going to go ahead and fight, make sure you're prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card, which starts at 7:30, Jeremy Williams (15-1, 12 KOs) will 
fight Andrew Strokes (14-11-1, seven KOs) in a 10-round heavyweight bout. It is 
Williams' first fight since losing to Larry Donald last March. TIM KAWAKAMI

DOW CONTINUES CLIMB; DOLLAR CLOSES MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks posted solid gains Thursday, boosted by higher technology and 
transportation issues and falling long-term bond yields. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished mixed, falling modestly against the German mark but 
surging against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.09 to 3,758.98. In the broader 
market, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by nearly 3 to 2 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 307.35 million shares, down from 
337.67 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes also closed higher, pulled up by technology issues. The 
NYSE's composite index rose 1.43 to 252.16, while the Standard & Poor's 500 
index rose 2.80 to 456.49. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks 
rose 5.21 to 727.11. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation stocks rose following reports that Kansas City Southern is 
trying to sell its railroad business for as much as $2 billion. Kansas City 
rose 2 1/2 to 45 1/2. Railroad stocks rose in sympathy, pulling the Dow 
transportation average up 24.50, or 1.54%, to 1,618.86. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders began the day nervous that the market could lose the momentum that had 
been built by a nearly 50-point rise Tuesday, after the Federal Reserve Board 
tightened interest rates. But they were encouraged as the day wore on, and 
investors, spurred by a firming in bonds, moved in as buyers about midday and 
kept on buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks weakened in the early going after bonds lost ground on 
stronger-than-expected economic news. The Dow industrials fell more than 8 
points before recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds fell about 1/4 point but then began to recover in late morning, putting 
a floor under stocks and enticing buyers into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the Treasury's main 30-year bond yield was 7.23%, down from its 
previous close of 7.27%, while its price closed up 3/8 point, or $3.75 per 
$1,000 in face value. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 But bonds snapped back about midday, and that gave stock investors the 
confidence to begin buying. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar rose against the yen following statements by U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor indicating hope that preliminary discussions with 
Japanese officials will lead to a full resumption of the stalled "framework" 
talks on reducing Japan's huge trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar rose to 104.25 Japanese yen from 103.50 on Wednesday. 
It fell to 1.6540 German marks from 1.656. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were very strong for the second consecutive day, helped by 
Micron, which rose 1 1/2 to 33 7/8 after a Wall Street Journal article said it 
might escape the general slowdown in computer industry growth. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM, which staged a technical breakout Tuesday by piercing resistance at 60, 
rose 5/8 to 61 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 DSC Communications Corp. fell 8 11/16 to 49 1/16 in heavy trading. Analysts 
said the stock dropped amid disappointment that the company did not get part of 
Bell Atlantic Corp.'s network building contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * AT&T led the volume on the NYSE, rising 1 3/8 to 56 5/8. Along with General 
Instrument, the telephone giant was chosen by Bell Atlantic to furnish a new 
media network system. General Instrument rose 4 1/4 to 59 1/8. Bell Atlantic 
added 1/9 to 53 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the paper group, International Paper gained 1 7/8 to 68 3/8, Georgia 
Pacific gained 3 3/8 to 63 1/2 and Temple Inland was ahead 1 3/8 to 50 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler, which raised its dividend, gained 3/4 to 47 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco stocks slumped after reports that 50 law firms had committed 
$100,000 apiece to finance a class-action suit on behalf of people addicted to 
cigarettes. Philip Morris fell 1 3/4 to 51 1/4; American Brands lost 3/8 to 30 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average ended 
at 2,247.76, down 19.65 points on the day, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index 
fell 121.66 points to 9,354.98 after surging 432 points Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average closed at 20,221.34, up 68.61 points. 
London's Financial Times 100-share average gained 6.3 points to close at 
3,122.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index ended up 29.73 points at 2,404.91. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil rose 46 cents to $18.45 a barrel on the Merc, while soybean futures 
retreated moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders took profits from 
Wednesday's steep gains.

BACK ON THE HILL; FORMER STARTER CLAYTON A TOP BULLPEN PROSPECT FOR MARINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was a desperate situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chattanooga Lookouts were hammering the Jacksonville Suns last August, and 
the Suns were out of pitchers. They needed a mop-up guy, someone to get through 
one inning as painlessly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Marc Hill flipped through the file cards in his head. Hmmm, Craig 
Clayton. Didn't he used to be a pitcher?  
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, a third baseman, relished the chance. After all, he had been an 
All-American pitcher at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw that first pitch for a strike, and it all came back to me," said 
Clayton, a graduate of Loara High. "I set them down, 1-2-3." 
</P>
<P>
 From such random opportunities are career paths altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, a good-hit, no-power infielder, has moved onto a 90-m.p.h. track to 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance as an emergency reliever impressed Mariner officials and 
reminded them of his pitching abilities. They sent him to the Arizona 
Instructional League to get a look and then placed him on the 40-man roster 
after getting an eyeful. 
</P>
<P>
 In a couple months, Clayton went from being a tomato can, asked to get three 
measly outs, to contender for a spot in the Mariner bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to realize that I could be in the big leagues as a pitcher," 
Clayton said. "As a third baseman, I might have kicked around the minor leagues 
for six or seven years, then maybe got a cup of coffee in the majors. I just 
love pitching again." 
</P>
<P>
 He is getting a refresher course in it. Clayton is back in Jacksonville, but 
his progress is being closely monitored in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a spot in the Mariners' bullpen has all but been reserved by Manager 
Lou Piniella himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good-looking young pitcher, one of the most impressive pitchers in 
camp," Piniella said during spring training. "With a little improvement and 
experience, he's not far from pitching in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
 Heady stuff for a guy who hadn't thrown a pitch in more than two years. But 
Clayton has reacquainted himself well. In fact, his fastball has been clocked 
in the 90s, almost a full 10 m.p.h. faster than when he was in college. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 games, he has a 3.65 earned-run average and has struck out 13 batters in 
12 1/3 innings. Clayton picked up his first professional save Saturday against 
Birmingham. He struck out Michael Jordan, who made a more drastic career 
change, to preserve a 9-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 This despite spending a week on the disabled list with tendinitis in his 
shoulder. A minor setback, but hardly one to dampen his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, I didn't know how much I missed pitching until I got back on the 
mound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton's last stint as a pitcher was highly successful. He established 
himself as one of the best, and most versatile, players in Northridge history 
in three seasons. Clayton was third in the voting for Collegiate Baseball 
player of the year in 1991 after leading the Matadors to the West Regional II 
final as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton was 14-5 with a 2.25 earned-run average that season. He also led the 
nation with 166 strikeouts and was named first-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 He won 27 games in two seasons as a pitcher. He helped the Matadors get to the 
NCAA Division II World Series final as a sophomore and put them within reach of 
the Division I series the next season. Clayton beat Fresno State, 6-2, on two 
days' rest to force a second game in the double-elimination regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had tremendous confidence on the mound," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen 
said. "As a sophomore, he faced Cal State Fullerton, which was one of the top 
teams in the nation. That didn't bother Craig. He threw a one-hitter, facing 
one batter over the minimum. I knew that day he was a tremendous pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma, if you can call it that, was Clayton was equally effective at the 
plate. He hit .397 at Northridge and played every position except catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a 21-game hitting streak as a junior and also pitched 28 consecutive 
innings without giving up an earned run. So was he a pitcher who hit, or a 
hitter who pitched? 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners would worry about that later and took Clayton in the sixth round 
of the 1991 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really a two-way prospect," said Ken Compton, the Mariners' West Coast 
supervisor for scouting. "The plan was to send him out as a hitter and see what 
he looked like. We felt we could always move him back to pitcher if it didn't 
work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was, it sort of worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton hit well. In 1991, he hit .264 at Bellingham, the Mariners' lower 
Class-A team, and was bumped up to San Bernardino, where he hit .333. He hit 
.249 in 1992 but missed three months with after breaking an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Clayton was hitting .328 at Class-A Riverside with 32 runs batted 
in. He was selected to the California League all-star game but couldn't play 
because he was moved to double-A Jacksonville, where he hit .298. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have moved him back to pitcher a couple years ago, but he kept 
hitting .300," Compton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Clayton made some progress, he also had some drawbacks as a third 
baseman. He didn't hit for power -- only 10 home runs in three seasons -- and 
he wasn't exactly a slick fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't the prototype third baseman," Clayton said. "I was never going 
to hit 20 home runs and drive in 100 runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Still. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had good command of the bat," said Jim Beattie, the Mariners' director of 
player development. 
</P>
<P>
 So Clayton continued to tread water until the day the bottom fell out of 
Jacksonville's bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Down by 10 runs, Hill just wanted to get the game over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to use up our pitching, and I knew Craig had a strong arm," 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't prepared for how strong it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "My pitching coach and I looked at each other and went, 'Whoa,' " Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton made two more emergency appearances. He didn't give up a run in four 
innings. In his last game, he pitched one inning, striking out the side. 
</P>
<P>
 He also hit a three-run homer in his last at-bat to tie the score, but by 
then, reports about his arm strength were winging their way to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I was throwing harder," Clayton said. "Maybe I matured. 
Maybe the years away from pitching rested my arm." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter the reason, one thing was clear. "When we saw that arm strength, we 
knew it was time for us to move him back to pitcher," Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the instructional league, Clayton was 2-0 with a 1.55 ERA and struck out 21 
in 23 1/3 innings. The Mariners, fearing another team might draft him under 
Rule V, put Clayton on the 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to spring training, where he began to learn the subtleties of 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Clayton: "The first game I pitched, we were sitting in the bullpen, and 
the guys were talking about this one hitter. The guy couldn't hit a breaking 
ball, but he he could crush a fastball. I get in the game, and this guy is the 
first batter. So I threw him a fastball, and he hit it out. I found out it was 
a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that momentary setback, Clayton was impressive. In fact, he got a 
where-have-you-been reception from pitching coach Sammy Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made him a third baseman, for what reason I don't know," Ellis said 
during spring training. "After I saw that arm, I questioned it, but it wasn't 
my decision. I'm just happy we put him back on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
 As is Clayton. After all . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They carry 11 pitchers on a team and only one third baseman," he said. "I 
like those odds better."

WORLD CUP '94: 28 DAYS AND COUNTING; GERMANY'S BIG DOG; VOGTS, NICKNAMED 
TERRIER, WAS A TOUGH PLAYER, AND NOW AS COACH, HE SOMETIMES CAN BE A TERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In 1958, a diminutive winger named Mario Zagalo, sometimes known as "the 
Little Ant" by his teammates and fans, helped Brazil win its first World Cup, 
in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans-Hubert Vogts turned 12 that year. It was also the year his mother died. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, Zagalo and Brazil repeated their triumph by again winning the World 
Cup, this time in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Berti Vogts, who turned 16 that year, was beginning to show considerable 
promise as a player in the small West German town of Buettgen, near Duesseldorf 
on the lower Rhine. It was the year after his father died. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, West Germany, with Franz Beckenbauer, finished second to England in 
the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the year after Vogts had been signed as a professional by Borussia 
Moenchengladbach, the only club he would play for. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Zagalo, now known as "Lobo," or "Wolf," coached Brazil to its third 
and perhaps greatest World Cup triumph, in Mexico. Zagalo became the first man 
to have both played for and coached World Cup-winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts was on the West German team that year, along with Beckenbauer, but the 
Germans lost to Italy in overtime in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Vogts and Beckenbauer combined to lead West Germany to its second 
World Cup victory, exactly 20 years after the first. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, in Italy, West Germany won again, with Beckenbauer as coach and Vogts 
as his assistant. Beckenbauer joined Zagalo's club, becoming the second man to 
have won the World Cup both as a player and as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, with the 1994 World Cup less than a month away, there is the chance 
that Vogts can join them. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Germany's coach, having taken over from Beckenbauer immediately after 
the victory over Argentina in the final of Italia '90. Zagalo is Brazil's 
assistant coach, in line for an unprecedented fourth World Cup title. Both 
teams are strong favorites to reach the championship game at the Rose Bowl on 
July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither honors nor statistics tell the real story of Berti Vogts, the 
shoemaker's son who became one of the most successful players and respected 
coaches in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Buettgen on Dec. 30, 1946, Vogts went to live with his aunt after his 
father's death. She managed a restaurant owned by the local soccer club. That 
was that. Vogts' career was determined. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed his apprenticeship as a toolmaker, but soccer captured and held 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 At 18, he was signed by Moenchengladbach. He ended up playing 419 games for 
the club, scoring 33 goals and helping it win the German Bundesliga 
championship five times, the German Cup once and the UEFA Cup twice. Vogts was 
chosen as the league's player of the year in 1975 and again in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 His career with the West German national team was equally impressive. 
Nicknamed "the Terrier" because of his, well, dogged personality, Vogts was a 
relentless tackler. He would chase and harry opposing forwards nonstop for 90 
minutes. Occasionally, like Beckenbauer, he would move into the attack himself, 
but more often than not he was back near his own penalty area, guarding the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was his tenacity that Kevin Keegan, a former England captain and Europe's 
player of the year in 1978 and 1979, once said, "A team of 11 Berti Vogtses 
would be unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts played 96 matches for West Germany, including appearances in the 1970, 
'74 and '78 World Cup tournaments. He retired in 1979 to become coach of West 
Germany's national youth team, a position he held until becoming national coach 
in 1990. Almost all of Germany's players in World Cup '94 were coached as 
youngsters by Vogts. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking over from Beckenbauer, Vogts has kept Germany at the top of the 
world's game, although losing the 1992 European Championship final to Denmark 
and other occasional setbacks have earned him intense criticism in the German 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 If the other 23 World Cup '94 coaches think they are under pressure, they 
might consider this: Every one of Vogts' predecessors -- Sepp Herberger, Helmut 
Schoen, Jupp Derwall and Beckenbauer -- won either the World Cup, the European 
Championship or both. Vogts is expected to win in 1994. Nothing less will do. 
</P>
<P>
 But pressure does not trouble him. He shrugs off the media criticism and goes 
about his job of building a German team capable of taking on the world. The 
thought of failure does not cross his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we will play positive, attacking, winning soccer," he said on the eve 
of the European Championship in Sweden two years ago. "We have great potential 
among the players. Even if we lose some games, after giving our all, we will 
not be hurt by that. The public understands that a team cannot always win. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as my family life is good, I can take a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with only weeks to go before Germany plays Bolivia, Spain and South Korea 
in the first round of World Cup '94, Vogts is saying much the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall be very difficult to beat if we all concentrate fully on playing 
football," he recently told London's World Soccer magazine. "I am not that 
arrogant to claim that we are the world's best. For me, the Brazilians are the 
top dogs and World Cup favorites. We remain among the leading five, but we know 
we must improve." 
</P>
<P>
 At 47, Vogts is speaking out more often on matters that affect not only the 
German team but the sport as a whole. He surprised many soccer followers not 
long ago by coming out in favor of what would seem to be drastic rule changes. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he favors each team having one timeout per half to give coaches 
the chance to talk to their players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they would be good for the game," Vogts said. "It would give the 
coach more chance to have an influence on the game and, in my opinion, it would 
make the game much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when England earlier this year canceled a game against Germany in 
Berlin, citing fears of violence from English hooligans and German neo-Nazis, 
Vogts angrily blasted the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a question for sport," he said. "The politicians have clearly 
failed here. I'm very disappointed. If you (politicians) can't guarantee the 
safety of the German team and its foreign guests, then you have no right to get 
annoyed about Germany's bad image abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts is an unabashed admirer of the United States. His success has caused 
some in Germany to call him "Berti Rockefeller," but Vogts dismisses the 
intended insult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a multimillionaire," he said three years ago. "But one thing that I 
do have in common with Rockefeller is that we are both hard-working people." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same interview, Vogts explained his feeling for America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," he said. "It is the only country besides Germany where I would 
want to live. America is where one is awarded success in return for hard work. 
It is a country of possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 He also believes World Cup '94 will be a success on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to pay a great compliment to the Americans as far as the structure and 
organization of the tournament is concerned and as far as the atmosphere in the 
stadia is concerned," he said in an April interview with Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who think it will not run smoothly are being unfair to the Americans. 
I have been in five different venues recently and looked at problems like 
training pitches and security. We have everything there. They are offering us 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is certainly going to be a real World Cup atmosphere. We should maybe 
have some of it ourselves (in Europe). Sometimes the atmosphere in our stadia 
is great, but sometimes it is too aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American support is more friendly. You don't play in a cage. There are 
only all-seated stadia without a fence. This good atmosphere comes over (to the 
players) and that is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Since those remarks, three of the nine World Cup '94 venues -- Dallas, where 
Germany plays once, Washington and Palo Alto -- have decided to install fencing 
to separate the fans from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes seen as cold and aloof, Vogts has a good sense of humor but is 
equally capable of anger. Last year, for example, he lashed out at his players 
after a couple of less-than-satisfactory performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a big mistake in the past by assuming that every player would show 
their own initiative, and I didn't put any pressure on them," he said. "It must 
be the biggest thing in your career to put on a German shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday as the team arrived in training camp in Malente in northern 
Germany, he lashed out at three players -- defender Thomas Berthold, rising 
midfield star Mario Basler and forward Ulf Kirsten -- for their conduct in 
league play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to talk to all three of them privately," Vogts said. "I 
can't accept such behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 He also brought in World Cup referee Hellmut Krug to reinforce his message. 
</P>
<P>
 He will accept nothing but the best. That is the way it was for Vogts, and in 
World Cup '94 he is not about to allow his players to believe or act any 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, a World Cup is at stake and "Terrier Vogts" is not about to let it 
escape. Coach Profile

GETTING ALONG; PHIL JACKSON ADJUSTS BECAUSE THE BULLS WON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Travels with Phil, a journey through an NBA season and life, in whatever 
order: 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the series against the New York Knicks, Phil Jackson broke the 
tension by taking the Chicago Bulls on a ferry boat ride in New York. Scottie 
Pippen asked if he could toot the horn. The ferry captain noted that Jackson 
was standing right under the stack and might lose his hearing. Gleefully, 
Pippen begged harder to toot the horn. 
</P>
<P>
 If traveling with Phil Jackson is multifaceted, going anywhere with the Bulls 
is like chaperoning fifth graders. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to buy books for every player to read on West Coast trips. Most of the 
players looked at them as if they were artifacts from a lost civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 The last year, before giving up, Jackson handed Michael Jordan "How to Win in 
Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson used to have the Bulls travel by bus sometimes so they could actually 
see the scenery, rather than fly over it. Once riding through Texas, he passed 
out a psychological test -- a piece of paper with a circle and a dot in the 
middle. Players were supposed to say where they were in this picture and why. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they made paper airplanes or funny hats. No one handed his test in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not for everybody," says Jackson, grinning. "Lot of guys feel that's not 
their milieu, but there's some people that can appreciate it. It's for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever wonder if Phil Jackson is in the right business? 
</P>
<P>
 No other NBA coach ever moved to Woodstock or burns a sagebrush smudge stick 
in his office -- an Indian rite of purification -- or keeps a postcard of Sioux 
sign language on his desk or wears ties hand-painted by Jerry Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it just might have been a shaman they were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 How many other coaches could have kept Jordan on the reservation as long as he 
did? 
</P>
<P>
 In Houston last season, Jackson, worried that the Bulls were tired, put in a 
slow-down game plan. At halftime, Jordan told Pippen and Horace Grant that they 
were going back to pressing. That's what they did. Jackson made no issue of it. 
</P>
<P>
 How many teams would have weathered the latest firestorm? 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, infuriated by Pippen's Game 3 mutiny, blew the whistle on him for the 
nation to see. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, however, Jackson all but put his body between Pippen and the 
press, pulling a protective coverlet over him, welcoming him back into the 
bosom of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, Pippen had 25 points, eight rebounds and six assists and declared 
a media boycott. His buddy Grant joined the embargo. The Bulls were united once 
again and now can force a seventh game in the playoff series by beating the 
Knicks at Chicago tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't supposed to win three titles in a row, even with Jordan, or 55 
games without him, or push the Knicks. But here they are. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you say coach of the year in Sioux? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't your everyday NBA player, either. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the Knicks' house hippie in the late '60s and '70s, a handy player on 
the court where he lent an elbow to the Knick defensive effort, a popular 
figure off it in the Age of Psychedelia. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a Pentecostal minister, Jackson was raised strictly in tiny 
Williston, N.D. At 17 he sneaked out to his first movie, "Seven Brides for 
Seven Brothers." He arrived at the University of North Dakota rejecting Darwin, 
but left with his head spinning. By the time he hit New York, his beliefs 
defied characterization. His family now belongs to no church but gathers weekly 
to discuss spiritual matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson immersed himself in whatever he was doing. Knick Coach Red Holzman, a 
middle-aged steak-and-Scotch man as opposed to Jackson's vegetables-marijuana 
regimen, was so taken, he used to have Jackson scout opposing teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Holzman first told Jackson he should consider coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson did what every player does: He shuddered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all say it when we're players," Jackson says. "NBA players say, 
'I'll never be a coach. Look what you have to go through.' Thinking about your 
own ego and the guys you're playing with, the stuff you have to go through to 
placate the egos of the crazy nature of this game. But the reality is that it 
gets as close to the action as you get. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 This gains in importance as a player leaves the game and samples the real 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson tried running a health club in Montana. It was hard to make a go of 
it. He broadcast New Jersey Net games. He took a job coaching the Continental 
Basketball Assn.'s Albany Patroons, settling in Woodstock, N.Y., even though it 
was 55 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 He was on his way up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a CBA title, then was voted coach of the year. He landed an assistant's 
job with the Bulls -- on his second try. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time he interviewed, he showed up with a beard, wearing a big Panama 
hat with a macaw's feather stuck in the band. Coach Stan Albeck made up his 
mind on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time Jackson interviewed, for a job on Doug Collins' staff, he 
shaved, bagged the hat and was hired. If he was still leery of the 
Establishment, it had some things he wanted, too. 
</P>
<P>
 When the high-strung Collins was fired two years later, the mellower Jackson 
moved up and, in his second, third and fourth seasons, won the Bulls' first, 
second and third titles. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't go the way people thought it would. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly popular as an assistant, he seemed to be the man the system couldn't 
get to. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe it has. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It goes beyond irony that Jackson and Pat Riley, polar opposites and bitter 
rivals, share so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is now in Riley's Laker role, so dwarfed by his players' fame that 
little credit filters down to him. Last season, for guiding the tired, cranky 
Bulls to a third title, Jackson got exactly zero coach-of-the-year votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Their differences are obvious. Riley is a corporate role model, Jackson is the 
'60s, all grown up. Riley might consider Jackson a whiner and Jackson might 
consider Riley a jackbooted tyrant, but if you look closely, they're like 
brothers separated at birth who find themselves in similar positions: coaching 
high-profile teams in media centers, being pushed toward each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Riley are reformed nice guys, once beloved by all who knew them, 
adapting to high-pressure life-in-the-spotlight careers by withdrawing. Both 
are gracious and quotable in interview sessions but guard their privacy 
jealously. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks and Bulls are the NBA's twin Kremlins, with closed practices, 
limited access and conspiracy theories of the press- as- point- man- for- a- 
hostile- universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Riley are adept at sending messages through the press and needling 
one another. Riley, in particular, doesn't seem to like the give-and-take, but 
no one had ever compared him to Attila the Hun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat's a tremendous opponent when it comes to a coach on the other side," says 
Jackson. "You feel his pressure when you coach, and you know his teams are 
relentless. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can see the differences in our styles. I believe that what we're 
trying to do with this ballclub is genuine group dynamics. He's turned a group 
around, and he's got group dynamics going in a whole different value system -- 
hard work ethic, maybe a little us against them. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Like, his players can't talk to my players. His coaches can't talk to my 
coaches. That's the difference in our style. My style is open. I close my 
practices as he does, but my style is open. Freedom with the basketball club, 
closed basketball team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We should be rivals. I mean, this is what it's all about. We're not playing 
one on one against each other, but we're trying to outfox each other, we're 
trying to out-duel each other, we're trying to get our teams prepared against 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need the league's attention to what New York's doing defensively. I need 
people to say, 'Is this legal defense?' . . . That's all. I'm drawing attention 
to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows it's a psychological warfare. He's big enough to know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lest Riley forget, Jackson keeps reminding him. They're in this thing 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Riley was everyone's caddie -- Jerry West's buddy, Chick Hearn's color 
man, Paul Westhead's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Once no one knew what to call Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they call each of them coach.

SELES SEEKING $10 MILLION FOR LOSSES, PRISON STAY FOR GERMAN ASSAILANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monica Seles, facing perhaps the end of her tennis career, is striking back at 
her assailant and demanding at least $10 million from the German Tennis 
Federation for losses caused by the knife attack on her in Hamburg last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Seles disclosed for the first time Thursday that she is appealing the sentence 
of Gunther Parche, who was released on probation without serving time in jail 
for stabbing her in the back on the court April 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cologne attorney for the formerly top-ranked women's tennis player, who 
recently became a U.S. citizen, also approached the federation as a first step 
toward filing a lawsuit against it as organizer of the Citizen Cup tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm Danelzik said, "The next step now depends on the response of the 
German Tennis Federation, and that, of course, I can't predict. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to specify the damage because it is still going on. But at least 
$10 million is correct." 
</P>
<P>
 That amount, he said, includes actual losses from tournament winnings and 
tennis and non-tennis related endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Seles, particularly upset that Parche was not imprisoned, joined a legal 
prosecutor in Germany in appealing his sentence.

GO FOR GIN MAY NOT SET PACE; HORSE RACING: DERBY WINNER EXPECTED TO CONCEDE 
EARLY LEAD FROM NO. 2 POST TO POLAR EXPEDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Kentucky Derby winner Go For Gin drew the No. 2 post in a field of 10 for 
Saturday's 119th Preakness at Pimlico, the colt's co-owner might have tipped 
his camp's mitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy with our post," Joe Cornacchia said. "There's a lot of speed with 
us, on the inside, but Polar Expedition's outside. He's the one that should be 
out there early." 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin isn't expected to be too far off the pace, but Cornacchia's remarks 
indicated that his horse won't be in the lead, as he was for most of the Derby. 
Favored Holy Bull and longshot Ulises figured to be up front early at Churchill 
Downs, but Holy Bull, breaking flat-footed, was banged around leaving the gate, 
and Ulises could carry his speed for only half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Holy Bull, whose training was compromised by a minor blood infection, 
nor Ulises is running in the Preakness, but there are still enough speed horses 
to go around in the 10-horse field. Besides Polar Expedition, the runners with 
quick licks include Silver Goblin, who led until the final eighth of a mile in 
the Arkansas Derby, and Tabasco Cat, who was unable to use his natural speed in 
the Derby because Go For Gin broke awkwardly and bothered him at the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The Preakness, the middle race in the Triple Crown series, usually draws 
smaller fields than the unwieldy Derby, and consequently post positions are 
less important. The winners of the last 10 Preaknesses have come from these 
posts: 3-3-6-2-6-3-7-7-4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the way they will line up Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat, with Pat Day riding, at 6-1 on the morning line; Go For Gin, 
Chris McCarron, 2-1; Concern, Garrett Gomez, 7-2; Silver Goblin, Dale Cordova, 
6-1; Powis Castle, Brent Bartram, 20-1; Blumin Affair, Jerry Bailey, 8-1; 
Kandaly, Craig Perret, 20-1; Polar Expedition, Curt Bourque, 20-1; Looming, 
Andrea Seefeldt, 7-2; Numerous, Pat Valenzuela, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 All will carry 126 pounds, same weight as the Derby. Concern and Looming, both 
owned by Robert Meyerhoff and trained by Richard Small, will run as an entry. 
The purse is $688,800, with $447,720 going to the winner. At 1 3/16 miles, the 
Preakness is the shortest Triple Crown race. The Belmont Stakes, in New York on 
June 11, is the longest at 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning line, which was put together by veteran handicapper Clem Florio 
for Pimlico, is subject to review. Go For Gin's 2-1 number seems about right, 
since he was 9-1 in the Derby. But it would be surprising if Concern and 
Looming go off as the second choice, even though they will be over-bet because 
of their Maryland connections. The buzz horse has been Numerous, well rested 
after winning the Derby Trial a week before the Derby. Nick Zito, Go For Gin's 
trainer, has repeatedly said that trainer Charlie Whittingham's colt is the one 
to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preliminary line earlier this week, Florio had Numerous at 9-2, then he 
upped the odds at entry time Thursday when the colt drew the outside post. 
Numerous has run just off the pace in his best races. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Goblin's odds are too low and Blumin Affair's too high. Silver Goblin 
has won six of nine starts but scored all of those victories against 
second-rate competition at Remington Park. In his first start outside Oklahoma, 
Silver Goblin couldn't outrun Concern and Blumin Affair in the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Blumin Affair, winner of only two of nine starts, has had six consecutive 
non-winning races, dating to October, but he continues to be dangerous after a 
third-place finish behind Go For Gin and Strodes Creek in the Derby. Blumin 
Affair is either a horse who will break through in one of these important races 
or a strong finisher who will continue to lack that necessary punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four Derby horses -- the fewest since 1985 -- are running in the 
Preakness: Go For Gin, Blumin Affair, Tabasco Cat, who was sixth at Churchill 
Downs, and Powis Castle, who was eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly, the Louisiana Derby winner who was scratched from the Derby because 
of a muddy track, should run Saturday, with no rain in the forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way my horse is doing, he should run the race of his life," said Ron 
Lamarque, the car dealer who owns Kandaly. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't know if the race of his life is enough to beat these horses."

CAPRIATI BEGINS TREATMENT PROGRAM; TENNIS: SHE WILL DEAL WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE 
AT REHABILITATION CENTER. ARREST COSTS HER ENDORSEMENT DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati will be treated for substance abuse at a rehabilitation 
center on Biscayne Bay that offers art, yoga and psychodrama courses -- but no 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative for Capriati confirmed Thursday that the 18-year-old tennis 
star entered an addiction treatment program at Mount Sinai Medical Center in 
Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's optimistic. She's very cooperative with respect to the program she's 
in," Capriati's attorney, John Ross, told television station WPLG. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hopeful and fairly confident that Jennifer will come through this, that 
her judgment will improve. If my predictions are correct, whatever Jennifer 
decides to do, she will be a champion at it. She's a good kid." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, a Capriati spokesman challenged allegations that she used 
heroin and crack cocaine during a two-day motel room party preceding her arrest 
Monday for misdemeanor marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is coming from a crack head," Ross said of the allegations. "Examine the 
source and make a responsible decision as to whether or not you think it's 
credible." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the two people arrested with Capriati, a 20-year-old drifter named Tom 
Wineland, alleged in an interview that she used crack during the party. 
Wineland's attorney said he was told she was "whacked out on heroin." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had no evidence Capriati used heroin or cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati's arrest prompted the cancellation of her multimillion-dollar 
endorsement contracts with Prince tennis racket company and Diadora, the 
Italian sportswear company. In Italy, an official for Diadora said the drug 
charge "offends the image" his company was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati's agent, Barbara Perry, flew to South Florida to join her client's 
family. Capriati's parents have visited her at the hospital, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very much together and behind their daughter," Perry said. "Under the 
circumstances I think they're doing very well. They're very strong. They've 
been through a lot."

CASH REWARDS PAID TO HURRICANE PLAYERS, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some former University of Miami football players say they were offered cash 
for making big plays in key games from a fund partly bankrolled by players who 
had gone on to the NFL, the Miami Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Hurricane players say the cash rewards, in violation of college 
football rules, included up to $500 for a touchdown, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Herald, which interviewed more than 40 former players in a two-month 
investigation, said the game-day bounties are among NCAA violations that 
occurred primarily between 1986 and 1992, a period during which Miami won three 
national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money was paid by 2 Live Crew rapper and Hurricane fan Luther 
Campbell, the newspaper said. Campbell denied he ever paid for plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "They interviewed me about that football scandal," Campbell told the 
Associated Press. "I told them I denied everything. All the allegations they 
made. Paying people off to make touchdowns and big hits and all that. I don't 
know nothing about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson, who coached the Hurricanes through 1988, had no comment. Dennis 
Erickson, who took over from Johnson, said he didn't know of any infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Three players described Campbell's alleged pay scale to the Herald: $50 for a 
caused fumble or a fumble recovery, $100 for a sack, a block that flattens an 
opponent, an interception or a touchdown, and $200 for an interception returned 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Hurricanes lost, no money was paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Former players said it was no secret graduates were giving money to athletes 
still in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Former defensive tackle Jimmie Jones (1986-89) said some former players also 
contributed to the "big-hit-pool," which could grow to $800 per game. Active 
Hurricanes would put $5 to $10 into a kitty that former players would match. 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly large pot came in 1989 against unbeaten Notre Dame. The player 
who knocked receiver Rocket Ismail out of the game would receive $1,000. 
Quarterback Tony Rice was worth $1,500. Both lasted the game.

TRAIL BLAZERS FIRE ADELMAN AFTER EARLY EXIT FROM PLAYOFFS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Portland Trail Blazers fired Coach Rick Adelman on Thursday after a 
disappointing season capped by a first-round elimination from the NBA playoffs 
for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Houston eliminated Portland, 3-1, in the first round earlier 
this month.The Trail Blazers finished the regular season with a 47-35 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman, 47, was 291-154 in five seasons with the Trail Blazers, trailing only 
Jack Ramsay in victories earned by a Portland coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman, whose contract runs through the 1995-96 season, took over as coach on 
Feb. 18, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland finished second in the Pacific Division the next season and went on 
to lose to the Detroit Pistons in the NBA finals. They won the division title 
the next two seasons, reaching the conference finals in 1991 and the NBA finals 
against Chicago the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I can't say enough about the accomplishments of our team under the 
direction of Rick Adelman, I have had to make the very difficult decision that 
a change at this time is necessary," owner Paul Allen said.

STANFORD'S MARQUESS SAYS PLAYERS ARRESTED MONDAY WILL BE PUNISHED

 Stanford baseball Coach Mark Marquess said in a statement Thursday that 
disciplinary action will be taken against four players who were among seven 
Cardinal athletes arrested early Monday morning for allegedly vandalizing a 
campus sculpture. Marquess did not specify what the punishment would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior infielders Dusty Allen and Todd LaRocca, sophomore pitcher Bob Gardner 
and freshman pitcher Brendan Sullivan allegedly were part of a group that 
attacked the statue, a monument to gays and lesbians, with a wood bench and 
spray paint. Football players Mark Butterfield and Jason White and wrestler 
Thomas Irwin also were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won the championship in the Pacific 10 Southern Division this season 
and will open play in the NCAA tournament next week. Suspensions could be part 
of the disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The actions of the baseball players involved in this incident is completely 
unacceptable behavior and will not be tolerated," Marquess said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, one of the Cardinal's best players, is already scheduled to sit out 
Stanford's playoff opener as a mandatory one-game suspension for fighting. GARY

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; SCOUTING THE TRACK, STOCK CAR DRIVER IRVAN

 Winston Cup points leader Ernie Irvan and Robert Yates, owner of the Ford 
Thunderbird that Irvan drives, took a look around Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
on Thursday, comparing notes with Indy car drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I'd ever want to come try the Indianapolis 500, but I guess 
if I did, I'd have to be at a certain part of my career where Winston Cup 
wasn't as important," Irvan said after watching Nigel Mansell run a lap at 
223.5 m.p.h. "There's no doubt that someday I'd really like to try to drive an 
Indy car, but I don't know if Indy's the place I'd like to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan and Yates took a close look at Gasoline Alley, where their cars will be 
garaged for the Brickyard 400 stock car race on Aug. 6.

 Mario Illien, designer of the Ilmor Mercedes push-rod engine used in Al Unser 
Jr.'s pole-sitting car and two other Roger Penske cars, has been named 
recipient of the Louis Schwitzer Award from the Society of Automotive Engineers 
for "excellence and innovation in race car design and development." 
</P>
<P>
 The SAE recognized Illien for "going against the grain" in producing a 
push-rod engine, and for bringing it to reality in only 26 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Illien also won the award in 1986 for his design of the Ilmor Chevrolet 
engine.

 Geoff Brabham, trying for his 11th start in the Indy 500, got his latest start 
ever, appearing on the track for the first time with only four laps Wednesday. 
He was back for a full day Thursday, getting in 53 laps with his 1993 
Lola-Menard, including one at 221.391 m.p.h., which would easily put him in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same car he drove last year when he started 29th and finished 26th.

 Roberto Moreno, moved into a 1994 Lola-Ford on Tuesday when Al Unser Sr. 
announced his retirement, moved out again on Thursday when he could get the car 
no faster than 200 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Tero Palmroth, a four-time Indy starter from Finland, stepped into the car and 
got it up to 216.836 in 39 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other drivers who have yet to qualify, John Paul Jr. turned 222.058 
m.p.h. in one car and 218.452 in his backup car. SHAV GLICK

 Adam Harris clenched the ball in his right hand and stared skyward in 
disbelief as he allowed yet more runners to walk around the bases during a 
winter league game in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Harris should have been used to such processions. At the time, the 
right-hander was issuing more free passes than a movie studio conducting 
audience-screening tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Each pitch thrown by Harris produced adventurous moments for his catchers. 
Strikes became something other pitchers threw. 
</P>
<P>
 Few are supposed to know the intended destination of pitches. Generally, 
though, the guy throwing the ball is among the informed. 
</P>
<P>
 With Harris on the hill, you never knew. And neither did he. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildness is the nemesis of many pitchers, but the problem is especially 
disturbing when it afflicts someone who does not light up radar guns. Harris' 
fastball is not his best pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just horrible . . . atrocious," Harris said. "I had no clue where the 
ball was going. Actually, it was kind of scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was facing one of those challenges that test one's mettle. In keeping 
with his character, he entered the battle head on -- and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the Mater Dei High senior conquer his demons, he has been one of 
Orange County's dominant pitchers this season. Harris is a big reason the 
Monarchs won the South Coast League title. 
</P>
<P>
 He gets the start today when the Monarchs play host to Victorville Victor 
Valley in the first round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs. If 
Harris' turnaround tour continues for a little while longer, the Monarchs 
figure they might wind up with a section championship banner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember there was one game (during the winter) where he walked 11 guys in 
three innings -- three innings," Mater Dei Coach Bob Ickes said. "But all of a 
sudden, he caught fire and gave a major boost to the team. The kids really look 
to him. Every time he goes out there, the kids have the confidence we will 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs' faith in Harris is easily explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who relies on a sharp curveball and a hard slider, has an 8-1 record 
and leads the county with a 0.60 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' victory total represents half of the Monarchs' total (16-8-1). He has 
two one-hitters, and pitched the team's only no-hitter this season in an 11-0 
league victory over San Clemente on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly even more impressive, however, is the job Harris has done preventing 
opponents from putting balls in play against him. In 58 innings, he has given 
up only 20 hits. Harris also has 57 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had an outstanding season," Dana Hills Coach Bob Canary said. "He's the 
type of kid who gets the most out of his ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Victory is almost a given with Harris on the mound, his teammates believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the season, people used to ask me how we'd do, and I said a lot would 
depend on if Adam could come through," senior shortstop Erik Mattern said. 
"Well, that's exactly what he did. It's great to know you can score three or 
four runs and still have a great chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Said senior catcher Matt Treanor: "He comes in and throws a good game each 
time. We know we don't have to get a lot of runs on the board for him." 
</P>
<P>
 With each start, Harris surprises himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe the season I've had," Harris said. "I could never have set a 
goal to have the kind of record I've had and the type of ERA I've had no matter 
what, but especially because of all the problems I had in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing to me how I've been getting all these guys out considering 
where I was before the season started." 
</P>
<P>
 How could something so hard become so simple so quickly? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Harris, the problem was all in his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't taking my time," Harris said. "I was just trying to throw it as hard 
as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 The winter of his discontent was proceeded by a junior season in which Harris 
was 4-3 after winning his first four decisions. Understandably, Ickes was 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our only returning pitcher, so we thought he would be the No. 1 
starter, but he couldn't throw strikes," Ickes said. "We really didn't know 
what we were going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Some tutoring sessions with Mater Dei pitching coach Tom Linnert helped, but 
Harris said he did not turn the corner until he put his mind to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get in a hole like that, you get a lot of advice," he said. "But you 
have to figure out how to work it out for yourself because you're the one out 
there who has to throw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 Devising plans of action has never been difficult for Harris. He will graduate 
second in a class of 460 in June. His 4.54 grade-point average (on a 4.0 scale) 
is .04 behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Harris will attend Stanford. He also was accepted by Harvard and 
Dartmouth. But the lure of playing baseball for the Cardinal was too much to 
pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "His turnaround has just been unbelievable," Ickes said. "He's such a great 
kid. You just like to see good things happen for kids like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs hope Harris is just getting started.

 Mission Viejo got a victory in the last set to upset fourth-seeded Corona del 
Mar, 10 2/3-10 1/3, in a Southern Section Division I boys' tennis match 
Thursday at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo's doubles team of Fernando Machuca and Christian Fernandez 
defeated Corona del Mar's Tyler Stonebreaker and Greg Coleman in the last set, 
6-3. Mission Viejo won six of nine sets in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo (11-9) started the season, 1-7. The Diablos, the second-place 
team from the South Coast League, advanced to play Beverly Hills match Tuesday 
in the quarterfinals. Beverly Hills beat San Clemente, 17 2/3-3 1/3, also 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar, the champion of the Sea View League, finished 18-3.

<P>
 Dana Hills 15, Woodbridge 6 -- Dana Hills used a little incentive and a lot of 
talent to defeat Woodbridge at North Lake Country Club in Irvine. The Dolphins, 
who had beaten Woodbridge (16-6) this season, 17 2/3-3 1/3, were upset about a 
quote from Warrior Coach Joan Willett that appeared this week in a newspaper: 
"Our chances of winning are good. They had a great day against us last time and 
other teams in our league have played them close." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills players came out to prove they are seeded third for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things that were in the paper a few days ago gave our team more incentive 
to go out and win," Dolphin Coach John Stephens said. "I knew they would play 
us tougher this time, but we've been working hard to get where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills (21-0) came out strong, losing only two sets in the first round and 
one in the second to take a 10 1/3-3 2/3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubles player Carlos Betancourt got sick at lunch but played anyway. He and 
Justin Rimel won their first two sets at No. 3 doubles, 6-4, 6-0, but lost to 
Woodbridge's No. 1 Adam Call and A.J. Thoryk, 6-3. Call and Thoryk swept their 
sets, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; LUKAS ARRIVES LATE AT PIMLICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before last year's Preakness, trainer Wayne Lukas had had enough good luck at 
Pimlico to fill the pot at the end of the rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his two Preakness victories, with Codex in 1980 and Tank's Prospect in 
1985, Lukas had won the Pimlico Special with Criminal Type in 1990 and Farma 
Way in 1991. Twice Lukas saddled 3-year-old fillies who won the Black-Eyed 
Susan, the companion stake to the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the 1993 Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas had enough bad luck in last year's Preakness to erase the good that had 
trailed him around Pimlico for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad luck -- Union City breaking down on the backstretch and being 
euthanized shortly afterward -- was followed by bad press, a mountain of 
negative notices that questioned his ability as a trainer. He had trained Union 
City lightly at Pimlico after a 15th-place finish in the Kentucky Derby, one 
day not even taking the colt out of his stall. There were suggestions that 
Lukas had force-fed an unsound horse into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas, who misses little that's written about him, retaliated by freezing out 
some reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be as accommodating as I've always been," he said in the fall. "And 
they know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a year later, and Lukas, 58, is at a familiar stand, trying to win 
another Preakness. This time the horse is Tabasco Cat, who was sixth in the 
Derby and is 6-1 on the morning line against nine opponents Saturday. And once 
again, Lukas has chosen to march to an unfamiliar drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Derby, which was run on May 7, he has been training Tabasco Cat at 
Churchill Downs. The colt didn't reach Pimlico until late Wednesday, after most 
of the Preakness horses were already bedded down, having completed their 
important preparations over the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Lukas' arrival Thursday morning, there had been speculation that he and 
Tabasco Cat lingered in Louisville to deflect the glare: The glare that would 
be waiting here for the trainer a year after Union City's tragic death; the 
glare that will be with Tabasco Cat for eternity, because he's the horse that 
ran over Jeff Lukas, the trainer's son and No. 1 assistant, in a near-fatal 
accident in the Santa Anita barn area in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas said Thursday that he stayed away for none of those reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got 38 other horses to take care of at Churchill Downs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Left unsaid was that Jeff Lukas, 36, in the midst of a long rehabilitation 
program, might normally have been tending to those horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas has also studied the patterns of recent Preaknesses and decided 
that arriving at Pimlico late is the winning thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, it's worked," he said. "I know that it's worked for me. Tank's 
Prospect didn't have a workout over the track. Neither did Winning Colors." 
</P>
<P>
 After becoming the third filly to win the Derby, in 1988, Winning Colors 
didn't win the Preakness, but she gave a good account despite a bump-and-run 
trip with Forty Niner most of the way. Winning Colors finished third, four 
positions better than Forty Niner. Risen Star won the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the mention of Union City on Thursday reopened wounds. Lukas took a deep 
breath and fired a lengthy diatribe at his detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won this race twice," he said. "And then I had one really bad day. . . 
"Before the race, nobody asked about what I was doing with Union City. My plan 
didn't seem to bother anybody then. These (Triple Crown) races are hard on the 
athletes and something's going to happen, just like you're bound to have knee 
injuries and fractured ankles in a Super Bowl. I hope I'm wrong, but I'd be 
willing to bet a year's salary that in the next three weeks (between the 
Preakness and the Belmont Stakes), the same thing will happen to somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really got to me was that somebody else's horse (Preakness winner 
Prairie Bayou) had the same injury (as Union City) in the Belmont and was put 
down, but nobody made a big deal out of that training job. You were all running 
around writing about Julie Krone (who rode Colonial Affair, becoming the first 
female jockey to win a Belmont). Yet the autopsy reports on Union City and 
Prairie Bayou were interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I do is the best job I can. You can't find anybody who gets to the barn 
as early as I do, and stays as late. Instead of being judged by the press, I'd 
like to take 100 of the best trainers out here and follow what they think. 
Bring in guys like Charlie Whittingham and Nick Zito and ask them. They might 
disagree with individual things I'd do about this horse or that horse going 
into a race, but you won't find one of them that says I don't take care of my 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Union City had cooled out from the Derby, there was a world-renowned 
veterinarian who examined him from top to bottom. His comment was that the 
horse came back with absolutely nothing wrong with him. That same vet was here 
at the Preakness, checking the horse, and again he couldn't find anything 
wrong. And why was he here? Because I asked him to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the Triple Crown people have this trio of vets running around, checking 
all the horses before the races. God bless them. It's good press to have them 
here, and it keeps the animal-rights people at bay. But all of them combined 
wouldn't have checked out Union City as well as I had him checked before he 
ran."

<P>
 Corona del Mar's No. 1 boys' double team of Tim Wertin and Jason Eggleston won 
a decisive match over Marina's No. 1 team of Jeremy Sandy and Alan Huang to 
lead the host Sea Kings to a 12-7 victory in the Southern Section Division I 
badminton quarterfinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings will face defending section champion Alhambra Keppel Monday in 
the semifinals.Keppel beat Bolsa Grande, 14-5, also Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team did great," Corona del Mar Coach Pat Wilson said. "When our No. 1 
doubles team beat Marina's No. 1 team, I think it was a big break for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Wertin and Eggleston won the first game, 15-9. Sandy and Huang, Southern 
Section boys' doubles semifinalists, took the second game, 15-11. Wertin and 
Eggleston regrouped and won the third game, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to move them around and get more quick shots," Wertin said of the 
third game. "We tried to control the birdie, and that was the key to our win." 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the Sea Kings jumped to a 7-1 lead, after victories in boys' 
and girls' singles and Nos. 1 and 3 mixed doubles. Allysun Turner clinched the 
victory for the Sea Kings with an 11-12, 11-3, 11-5 victory over Kelly 
Nedderman in girls' singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Payyak swept his singles matches for the Sea Kings, and teamed with 
Kerry Smith to win at mixed doubles. Smith and partner Trina Howard also swept 
their doubles matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertin and Eggleston won their second doubles match with a 15-2, 18-14 victory 
over Chin Pham and Son Huyuk. JANE HUANG

SOUTHERN SECTION TRACK PRELIMINARIES; WOMACK USES SECOND CHANCE TO FULL 
ADVANTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Womack saw the opportunity and jumped on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ocean View junior capitalized on a timing system that malfunctioned in 
last Saturday's Southern Section Division I preliminaries, getting another 
chance with a runoff for the final berth in Saturday's 400-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending 400 champion in the Sunset League, running just outside 
Fontana's Desmond Ketton in Lane 4, surged ahead in the one-on-one race in the 
final 100 meters to secure the victory in 50.3. Ketton was timed in 51.4. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could have watched him, I would have had the advantage," said Womack, 
pointing out the obvious disadvantage by drawing an outside lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had to make sure that I stayed with him." 
</P>
<P>
 The rematch was set up when a mechanical failure of the Accutrack Timing 
System was discovered Monday by The Times. Fifteen athletes were affected by 
the malfunction; Womack was the only among the group who originally didn't 
qualify, but he earned a berth Thursday at Cerritos Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley's Laurel Simpson and Dana Hills' Roberta Burns faced off in 
the 100-meter low hurdles, but the event was contested at Trabuco Hills High 
School for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, the two-time defending South Coast League champion in the event, ran 
away from Burns to win in a hand-timed 15.4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to say that all the coaches and athletes are to be commended," 
meet manager Bob McGuire said. "I had all positive responses in regards to 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-way race for two qualifying spots, Pasadena Muir's Jamal Carr (10.3) 
and Quartz Hill's Troy Searcy (10.7) advanced to the boys' 100 final. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain View's Ignacio Barrios ran a hand-timed 14.3 to edge Levar Castillo 
of Lynwood to earn a berth in the 110 high hurdles. Virginia Williams of 
Compton Dominguez outran Gahr's Miesha McKelvey in the girls' 100. Williams 
equaled her personal best (11.9). 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens sophomore Michael Granville did not show for the runoff for the 
final two places in the 200, leaving Tyson Murphy of Santa Monica and Akinyela 
Taylor of Dominguez to advance.

grandparents have lived with her and her parents since she was 7. She and her 
grandfather, in particular, developed a special relationship, partially built 
around their love of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one who really got me going in softball," said Mortensen, now the 
star pitcher for the Cal State Fullerton team that begins play today in the 
NCAA regional softball playoffs at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen's grandfather, 75-year-old Jack Hoffman, played double-A baseball in 
the St. Louis Cardinals organization, then boxed in the Navy, as well as 
professionally in his native Ohio, before settling into a job as a painter. He 
retired 13 years ago, giving him more time to be his granddaughter's biggest 
fan when she was playing on youth teams and at Torrance Bishop Montgomery High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the day Jennifer brought home the flyer about the softball team. 
She was about 7 then, and Grandpa took her out that very day and signed her 
up," said Mortensen's mother, Peggy. "She started out as a catcher, then 
decided fairly quickly she wanted to pitch. My father was the one who decided 
she needed a pitching coach and helped arrange that." 
</P>
<P>
 Softball success followed Mortensen at every turn after that, from the days 
when she was a bright-eyed moppet just learning the game to today, when she is 
one of the Big West Conference's top pitchers. She set a Bishop Montgomery 
record for strikeouts, and then went off to play for Texas A&M in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But that same year, Mortensen's grandfather was diagnosed as having lung 
cancer; a lung and a bronchial tube were removed. And at that point, with her 
family under so much stress, Mortensen decided she wanted to be closer to home, 
and she left A&M after her freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her grandfather's illness was really the catalyst for her wanting to move 
back," her mother said. "They've always been very, very close. He and my mother 
were almost like surrogate parents with both my husband and I working." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen says she wanted to give her grandfather more opportunities to see 
her pitch. "When I was playing at home, he went to almost every game I played," 
she said. "He's been a real inspiration to me. He's the one who made me believe 
in myself. He told me that if you want something badly enough, you can always 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 As things have turned out, Mortensen's grandfather appears to have battled 
back from cancer, although his activities are limited. And Mortensen is happy 
she transferred. The Titans are ranked 20th in the nation, and the 32-27 record 
is a tribute to the team's strong comeback after a slow start. Fullerton won 15 
of its last 17 regular-season games and climbed to third in the conference with 
a 21-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen, a junior, has been the key figure all season, not just during the 
late surge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still wouldn't have a season left without her," Coach Judi Garman said. 
"She's the big reason we're in the playoffs. When we were struggling early in 
the year, she was the one who held us together. She gave us the chance to win 
every game she's pitched for us. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the team appeared to be falling apart all around her, Mortensen 
kept her cool. In an early game against Washington, the infield committed five 
errors in one inning. She also was the losing pitcher in a 7-6 loss to No. 
1-ranked Arizona when the defense had six errors. She pitched a four-hitter 
against Long Beach State but lost, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's set the tone for the rest of the team," Garman said. "She never gave 
up, even when things weren't going well earlier in the season. Even when she 
wasn't getting the support on defense, she kept encouraging everyone and never 
blamed the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Garman says Mortensen had to make a comeback of her own after a slow start in 
her first year at Fullerton in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't have the kind of season she had hoped for," Garman said. "She had 
to adjust to the new, livelier ball. She lost a game to Arizona on a home run 
last year in the PONY tournament and never seemed to recover from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen turned it around with a strong performance in the American Softball 
League season last summer. Her team, the Southern California Jazz, won the ASA 
women's A division championship. It was her third time on an ASA national 
championship team. The Southern California Raiders won the title in 1990 in the 
16-and-under division with Mortensen as a pitcher. In the championship game, 
she got out of an inning with the bases loaded and none out to preserve a 
one-run lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing ASA this summer was a big turning point for me," Mortensen said. 
"That let me get my confidence back. I pitched well all summer and that gave me 
a totally different attitude coming into this season. Last season I let things 
bother me a lot and I really struggled." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen is pleased with the way the team bounced back this season. "The 
defense especially has been playing so much better," she said. The Titans have 
committed only eight errors in their past 13 games, a far cry from earlier. 
Fullerton had 30 errors in its first 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mortensen has benefited. She has gone from 11-14 to 19-15. Her earned run 
average is 1.91, and she has 135 strikeouts in 234 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's turnaround has made her, as well as Garman, more optimistic about 
the Titans' chances in the regional. Cal State Northridge (46-7) is top-rated 
in the field that also includes Maine (32-5) and Washington (43-17), 
Fullerton's first-round opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited about the tournament," Mortensen said. "I think we have a 
good chance. I think we're competitive with both Northridge and Washington, 
although I don't know anything about Maine." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen is hopeful that her grandfather might even be able to join other 
family members at one of the regional games. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what he's able to do outside depends so much on the weather," Peggy 
Mortensen said. "With his situation as it is, we have to be careful. He still 
has to be checked regularly, but the doctors have told us that he's free of any 
cancer at this point. He seems to be doing great." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, as far as Jennifer Mortensen is concerned, is the best comeback of 
all.

MELROSE, BEVERLEY TRADE SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nick Beverley, fired Wednesday as the Kings' general manager, said Thursday 
that Coach Barry Melrose had repeatedly manipulated situations to avoid blame 
for the team's poor performance and cast that blame on Beverley. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose, who has been working for ESPN as an analyst on its playoff telecasts, 
said Wednesday that Beverley had opposed his suggestions to acquire bigger, 
stronger players to complement the team's skill players. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the direction hockey is going. The four biggest teams are still 
playing," Melrose said. "Nick and I didn't agree over that, to be honest with 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverley disputed Melrose's version of events, saying that Melrose was 
involved in all personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the misinformation that continues to be bandied about on national 
TV, I know the truth, and that's all that matters to me," Beverley said. "You 
go back and research all the (newspaper) articles and you'll see the same thing 
over and over and over again. He keeps saying, 'We've got to get bigger, 
faster, stronger and younger.' Since we supposedly were at odds and not on the 
same page, that means I wanted the team to get older, slower and weaker? 
</P>
<P>
 "How much of this has to get said before people get tweaked to where this 
guy's coming from? It borders on the ludicrous, if I have to spend all this 
amount of time and energy helping people see the true aspects of this."

 The hiring of Lachemann immediately has created speculation that left-handed 
starter Jim Abbott could be returning to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott, who's eligible for free agency after the season, practically worships 
Lachemann, and has told friends that returning to Anaheim has become an 
attractive alternative.The Detroit Tigers still are considered the front-runner 
for Abbott's services, but the Angels are expected to make a bid for him.

 The Kansas City Royals might have the best bargain in baseball at third base 
with Gary Gaetti, who began the game batting .308 with six homers and a 
team-high 30 runs batted in. The Royals are paying Gaetti only $109,000, while 
the Angels are picking up the remainder of his $3-million contract. BOB

 GOOD ENGLISH? Do not tell Tom Owens of Anaheim that all teachers are perfect. 
The private investigator has written a new book, "Lying Eyes," based on his 
work on behalf of police beating victim Rodney King. Owens says that early in 
the case, his 14-year-old daughter mentioned in a paper for her high school 
English teacher what her father was doing. . . . She got her paper back with 
these teacher comments: "Don't brag about your dad. King probably got what he 
deserved."

 FULL HOUSE: A "Maverick" movie without James Garner as gambler Bret? Even 
Garner, who plays a lawman in it, is excited to see Mel Gibson in the role he

screens in Orange County today (F1), tying the local record set by "Jurassic

 SAVING MATADOR: The National League runner-up in saves this season may not yet 
be a household name to most baseball fans, but he's certainly well-regarded in 
the Valley. He's ex-Cal State Northridge star Jeremy Hernandez, who has nine 
saves for the Florida Marlins. . . . "He was a very determined young man," 
recalled CSUN Athletic Director Bob Hiegert, who recruited Hernandez in the 
1980s. 
</P>

 BIG WEEKEND: Northridge breeds more than just big league baseball pitchers. 
Try big league race car drivers, such as Mike Groff. This weekend, he'll find 
out if he's made the field for the Indy 500. . . . So far, he's in, but he 
could get bumped. If that happened, he would get a chance to qualify again in

HOUSE BACKS EASIER CLAIMS BY COAL MINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House passed legislation Thursday that would make it easier for coal 
miners to seek benefits for black lung disease and protect them from losing 
money when their claims are rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Lung Benefits Restoration Act, approved by a 252-166 vote, would 
reverse a policy that requires miners to pay back any benefits they have 
already received if their claims are later ruled ineligible upon appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The change is "common sense and simple justice," said Rep. Frank McCloskey 
(D-Ind.). "How are we going to ask retired working people to pay back in many 
cases $30-, $40-, $50- or $60,000?" 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which was sent to the Senate, simplifies the claim procedure by 
limiting miners to three medical exams and coal company defendants to one. It 
also makes workers at coke ovens eligible for black lung benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill allows some 80,000 miners who have had claims rejected since 1982 to 
refile. 
</P>
<P>
 The current benefits system needs revision because it is weighted against 
claimants, said Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (D-W.Va.). "It is a cruel hoax that is 
being perpetrated against hard-working citizens," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the present system only 5% to 10% of claims are approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Black lung disease, caused by long-term inhalation of mine dust, afflicts 
about 250,000 people. Under legislation created in the 1969 Coal Mine Health 
and Safety Act and revised several times, those with the disease receive about 
$1.5 billion annually from former employers and the Federal Black Lung Trust 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the bill contended that it will bankrupt the trust fund, which 
they said is $3.9 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trust fund buster," said Rep. Harris W. Fawell (R-Ill.). "This is a 
catastrophe in terms of money for the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost the federal 
government $195.5 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Coal Assn. has put the cost at $1 billion over that same period.

KEY PANEL BACKS NATIONAL HEALTH BOARD; MEDICINE: THE SENATE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS 
AN AGENCY THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TRIM BENEFITS OR RAISE THE AMOUNT CONSUMERS 
WOULD HAVE TO SPEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Senate committee with a key role in crafting health care legislation voted 
Thursday for a cost containment provision that would establish a national board 
with the authority to trim benefits and raise out-of-pocket spending by 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a bipartisan compromise approved by the Labor and Human Resources 
Committee, the board's actions could be reversed only if Congress acted within 
45 legislative days after receiving the board's "recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-0 committee vote, after nearly two days of partisan wrangling, left 
members elated -- but confused over whether such a national health board could 
also reduce medical providers' fees and insurance premiums if health spending 
had to be reined in. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators vowed to clarify the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the provision will survive the long legislative process still ahead 
and ever become part of a final health care reform measure remains far from 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 But that did little to dampen a can-do spirit that flowed from both sides of 
the aisle as members and their staffs congratulated one another for having 
produced the first bipartisan agreement on a difficult health care reform 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also raised hopes of breakthroughs on other, equally perplexing 
matters as the committee races toward the Clinton Administration's Memorial Day 
target for reporting out a comprehensive health care reform bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), the panel's ranking GOP member, called 
the vote "a victory for moderation . . . and fiscal responsibility." Chairman 
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called it "a small step for health care but a giant 
leap for bipartisanship." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.) who may prove the most prophetic, 
saying: "Without the ambiguity, there wouldn't have been unanimity." 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan good feelings will be put to the test today when the Republican 
National Committee launches a $500,000 national television campaign attacking 
President Clinton for having proposed "a government-run system."  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's surprise agreement on a cost control mechanism was significant and 
telling in several aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was important because finding a consensus on how to control costs has 
been one of the toughest challenges facing Congress as it goes about 
overhauling America's $1-trillion-a-year health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote also revealed the sort of individual compromises that members must 
make as they tackle the complex issues. 
</P>
<P>
 By voting to control costs as they did, conservative Republicans were at the 
same time endorsing a dramatic expansion of the powers of a new regulatory 
agency -- a prospect that clearly unsettled some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a deep and widespread fear that medical spending could rage out of 
control as the nation extends coverage to the estimated 38 million uninsured 
Americans -- while guaranteeing all a comprehensive set of benefits that could 
include, for the first time, coverage for prescription drugs, mental-health and 
substance-abuse treatment and the beginnings of home- and community-based 
long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor and Human Resources Committee is working on a bill drafted by 
Kennedy that is closely patterned after President Clinton's reform plan. But 
Kennedy proposes even broader benefits than Clinton, prompting Sen. Dan Coats 
(R-Ind.) to call Kennedy's benefits package "an extraordinary expansion" that 
he and Kassebaum said must be scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in that ensuing debate that a compromise to expand the cost containment 
authority of a national board was worked out between Kassebaum and Sen. Jeff 
Bingaman (D-N.M.). 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would require the board to conduct annual fiscal analyses of the 
nation's health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for any shortfalls or drains on the federal budget, the board could 
recommend cuts in the benefits package. Such recommendations would 
automatically take effect unless Congress quickly acted to reject the 
recommendations or to somehow raise the needed revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that medical providers and insurance companies may escape the 
purview of the board's cost containment authority -- at least based on the 
amendment's ambiguous language -- drew a sharp rebuke from Gail Shearer, a 
Consumers Union analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "The committee has started down a slippery slope that could threaten consumer 
health care security," she said. "This action demonstrates how crucial it is 
that Congress build in real cost containment so that there won't be a deficit 
in the first place."

MALAWI PRESIDENT CONCEDES DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Africa's longest-ruling dictator, H. Kamuzu Banda, conceded defeat Thursday in 
Malawi's first democratic election after voters turned their backs on 30 years 
of single-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shaky voice, the aged, ill and eccentric Banda admitted that results 
showed his former ally, Bakili Muluzi, was the clear winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement ends Banda's three decades of often-terrorizing rule over the 
landlocked African nation. Banda took power at independence from Britain in 
1964 and declared himself president for life in 1971. He banned political 
opposition, detained those who challenged him and allegedly tortured them.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SECRETARY OF STATE; WOO ASSAILS RIVAL'S REDUCTION OF 
FINES FOR CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of state candidate Michael Woo charged Thursday that one of his 
chief rivals, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, has regularly forgiven 
fines against violators of election filing requirements -- reducing $2.5 
million in potential penalties to $400,000 over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Miller, the office has "become a lap dog rather than a watchdog," said 
Woo's campaign manager, Steve Glazer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woo campaign released a list of 2,335 fine reductions and waivers granted 
by Miller, who was chief deputy to Secretary of State March Fong Eu until she 
stepped down in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those able to persuade Miller to reduce their fines substantially were a 
number of major California developers, banks and corporations, including Sony 
Pictures and US Ecology Inc., the company contracted to run the proposed 
low-level nuclear waste disposal site in Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller defended the fine reductions. He said they were for non-willful 
violations of the state's reporting requirements for major donors, lobbyists 
and campaign committees. Without the possibility of receiving a waiver, Miller 
said, those who did not file by the deadlines might disregard the rules and not 
file at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he has reviewed each request to reduce the fines and has granted 
many of them impartially, without regard to political affiliations. "We do 
factor in things like earthquakes, family deaths and those kinds of things," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woo contended that "stiff penalties are the most important deterrence for 
ensuring allegiance to the law in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state's Political Reform Act, the secretary of state can waive or 
reduce a $10-a-day penalty for those who are late in filing the required 
campaign or lobbying reports. The small daily fine can add up to a sizable sum 
when a violation is finally discovered -- sometimes years after several reports 
should have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo, who is running against Miller and Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles 
in the June Democratic primary, pledges strict enforcement of fines against 
those who fail to report their campaign donations and lobbying expenses.

ELECTIONS / SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE; LAWYERS IN BAR SURVEY BACK FARLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By a margin of nearly 3 to 1, lawyers responding to a Ventura County Bar Assn. 
poll said they preferred criminal defense attorney James. M. Farley over 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White for an open Superior Court seat, bar 
officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first judicial election poll ever conducted by the local bar, Farley 
received 276 votes to 97 for White, said Steve Henderson, executive director of 
the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballots were mailed to the approximately 1,400 attorneys in the county, 
including the 900 members of the bar. Henderson said the 27% response rate is 
statistically significant but not a scientific barometer of lawyers' preference 
in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything over 20% is excellent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the poll come 2 1/2 weeks before the June 7 election. The 
Farley-White race is the county's only contested judicial election. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar's poll is the second major announcement in the campaign this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, representatives from every major law enforcement agency in the 
county gathered to announce their support for White, who has been 
second-in-command of the district attorney's office for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews Thursday, White and Farley offered different 
interpretations of the poll results. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said the outcome illustrates that lawyers believe he is the 
better-qualified candidate for the judgeship, which was left vacant when 
Superior Court Judge Edwin Osborne retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said lawyers are best suited to rate him and White because they work in 
courtrooms and with the law every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that my peers recognize my qualifications and my 
experience," said Farley, a defense lawyer for 27 years. "They want me to be 
their Superior Court judge." 
</P>
<P>
 But White downplayed the significance of the poll, saying police officers and 
other law enforcement personnel who have announced their support for her deal 
directly with crime victims and criminals every day. 
</P>
<P>
 She said fewer than one-fourth of the lawyers polled returned their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected that result from the plebiscite," White said in an interview in 
her office. "A large number of the (bar) members make their careers defending 
criminals. I would have been surprised if they would have voted for someone who 
had their career putting criminals behind bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley disagreed with White's assessment of the lawyers who responded to the 
poll. "I'm surprised that Toy would denigrate the poll by saying it's just a 
bunch of criminal lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Others suggested that White's support seems to be confined to the district 
attorney's office, noting that more than 80 lawyers work there and she received 
97 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But several prosecutors who were interviewed said they did not return the 
bar's poll ballots, among them Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison, who 
supports White. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis LaRochelle, past president of the bar, said both White and Farley would 
make good judges. The election winner will probably be assigned to civil cases, 
court officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Jim has an edge on Toy on knowledge of the law in the civil arena," 
LaRochelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawyers said they voted for Farley because of his extensive experience 
in the courtroom. They said they believe that White lacks courtroom experience 
because she has been an administrator instead of a trial lawyer most of her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it means to me is that lawyers recognize the need for a person who has 
been involved in trying cases to take a seat as a trial judge," Ventura defense 
attorney Wendy Lascher said.

WASTE BOARD MEMBER'S OUSTER URGED; POLITICS: MOORPARK LEADER IS CRITICIZED BY 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS FOR SERVING ON THE COUNTY PANEL WHILE RUNNING FOR SUPERVISOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Ojai-based environmental group demanded the resignation Thursday of Ventura 
County Waste Commissioner Scott Montgomery, blasting the Moorpark city 
councilman for serving on the commission while running for a seat on the county 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery has actively campaigned to place an initiative on the November 
ballot aimed at opening a new landfill in Weldon Canyon near Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Coalition to Stop Weldon Canyon Dump contend that Montgomery's 
support of the issue has tainted his representation on the commission, made up 
of appointed representatives from all the cities in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly his prerogative to express his opinion," said Michael Shapiro, 
a member of the group. "But as chairman of a Waste Commission that has already 
sent a letter stating its opposition to building landfills in the county, it 
seems inappropriate."  
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro called Montgomery's campaign a "gross conflict of interest," stating 
that the commission's job was to review the best alternatives for dealing with 
solid waste in the county. By advocating a new landfill in Weldon Canyon, 
Montgomery showed his bias, Shapiro said.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, Shapiro questioned Montgomery's motivation for supporting the landfill 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It begs the question of who's funding his campaign," Shapiro said after the 
meeting. "When he announced his candidacy he said it was going to be a 
grass-roots campaign, relying on small donations. Now he's got a campaign 
office and consultants. I'm not saying there has been any impropriety but he 
should resign to eliminate any questions of a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the meeting, Montgomery denied any impropriety and said 
he resented Shapiro's remarks. He said he lobbied for a landfill in Weldon 
Canyon long before running for supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that I have to suddenly give up my First Amendment rights just 
because I'm serving on this commission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting he said he would resign if any commission members asked him. 
None did. 
</P>
<P>
 Eloise Brown, a former Moorpark City Council member who helped draw up the 
initiative, said Montgomery was merely representing people in Moorpark. 
Residents there, she said, would have to deal with increased truck traffic 
headed for the Simi Valley landfill if no west county landfill opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those trucks are going to the landfill right now," she said. "We already have 
to deal with what these people in Ojai are worried about. And residents in 
Moorpark and Simi Valley don't want to have the whole burden for the county's 
trash . . . (Montgomery) is representing his constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 While members of the Coalition to Stop the Weldon Canyon Dump were 
unsuccessful in getting Montgomery to resign, they vowed to take other actions 
to try to defeat the effort to open a new landfill in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've demonstrated that we're a potent force," Shapiro said. "We're ready to 
fight this throughout the county."

BIG CROP OF STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL-GOERS EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Oxnard city leaders and strawberry enthusiasts decided to stage 
a festival at the Channel Islands Harbor celebrating the juicy red fruit that 
is Ventura County's second largest cash crop. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25,000 people attended the two-day event when it debuted in 1984, and in 
the years since the California Strawberry Festival has mushroomed into one of 
Ventura County's biggest special events. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, organizers expect more than 70,000 people to crowd College Park in 
Oxnard for the two-day festival, which begins Saturday at 10 a.m. and will 
feature live entertainment, arts and crafts, pie-eating contests, a 10K race 
and strawberries prepared in every conceivable way. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Dog Night, the Temptations, Big Mountain and Doug Kershaw will headline 
the weekend's musical performances, while clowns, puppets and face-painting 
will entertain children throughout the weekend in the festival's 
Strawberryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters expect scattered storm clouds that have hovered over Ventura 
County for days to clear this weekend, revealing sunny skies and warmer 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really tried to focus on a family event," said festival committee 
member Don DeArmond, who was one of the event's original planners. "We've tried 
to (create) something that the city of Oxnard could be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 This week the Oxnard City Council agreed to turn over the festival's 
management to a private, nonprofit corporation next year. City leaders want to 
spin off the event so as to reduce the city's liability and make the festival 
self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the past five years, the festival has generated more than $500,000 
in profit, with much of it directed to support local nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 DeArmond said the privatization will help ease the festival's budget process 
and attract long-term sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason we needed to do that was for years we've been budgeted on a 
yearly basis," he said. "Our problem was now that we've grown, our sponsors 
want to talk to us about two-year and three-year deals and we couldn't do that 
because we had to come up to the yearly budget." 
</P>
<P>
 DeArmond said the decision to privatize won't affect the character of the 
festival, which prides itself on its family oriented events and low cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to refine it, improve it and bring in better entertainment and arts 
and crafts. We don't want to turn it into a commercial monster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the festival are $5 for adults, $3 for senior citizens and 
children ages 2 to 12, and children under 2 are admitted for free. The ticket 
cost includes admission to the featured concerts.  
</P>
<P>
 The Strawberry Festival's growing popularity has overwhelmed officials at the 
Oxnard Chamber of Commerce and the city's special events office, who have been 
deluged by phone calls in the weeks leading up to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "In February, I was getting 20 calls a day just on the festival," said chamber 
employee Peggy Hollinger. "Now, we're getting up to 50 and 60 calls a day, and 
we're not the ones who handle the festival." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's special events office, which is handling the event, has resorted to 
a recorded message to field the calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year it just grows and gets bigger and better," Hollinger said. "We are 
overwhelmed."

COLLEGE STUDENTS REACH MILESTONE; EDUCATION: ABOUT 330 PARTICIPATE IN VENTURA 
GRADUATION. ANOTHER 700 WERE ELIGIBLE IN SCHOOL'S LARGEST CLASS.

 No one in Julio Hernandez's family had ever finished college -- until 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old Oxnard man was among more than 300 Ventura College graduates 
who walked across the stage, shook hands with the college president and moved 
their tassels from right to left to symbolize their success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult at times, but I made it," said Hernandez, clutching a black 
diploma cover. "I'm very proud because I'm the first one in my family to 
graduate from college." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez isn't done yet. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two degrees bestowed upon him Thursday -- an associate of 
arts in liberal arts and associate of science in general studies -- he plans to 
earn a bachelor's degree in criminal justice from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really persistent," said Hernandez, who studied for three years at 
Ventura College while selling shoes at an El Rio footwear shop. "I never give 
up until I finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was not the only success story at the college on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides about 330 students who participated in the graduation ceremonies, 
another 700 were eligible, making the Class of '94 the largest ever, college 
President Jesus Carreon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fabulous accomplishment," he said in an interview before the 
commencement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, living through the economic times of today is tough," Carreon said. 
"A great majority of our students work full or part time, and for these 
students to get an A.A. degree is a real triumph." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduation ceremonies are scheduled today at both Oxnard and Moorpark 
colleges. Also, graduates of the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge will 
celebrate their achievements at the satellite campus' first-ever commencement 
May 27. . 
</P>
<P>
 During his address Thursday, the Ventura College president congratulated 
students for ranking in the top 25% of state community colleges for student 
transfers to four-year universities. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rob Stewart, a 23-year-old Ventura man who works full time as an insurance 
adjuster, Thursday was the culmination of years of night school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me five years, but I made it," he said, sipping punch in the quad 
after the ceremony. "This fall I'm going to Sonoma State to study film 
production." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were able to concentrate full time on their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Dorenkamp, a 39-year-old nursing graduate who has taken a job at St. 
John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, finished in two years with the 
support of his wife, who works full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed to go by so fast," he said, still wearing his white cap and gown. 
"I think it's because the pace of the learning is so quick. They're always 
throwing new information at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorenkamp said he first entered nursing because of the salaries and job 
security nurses enjoy. "But then I got to like helping other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Thomas, 39, also took a different path to Ventura College. He was a 
carpenter for 15 years before injuring himself in a work-related accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with an A.A. degree in liberal arts, he plans to pursue a bachelor's 
degree in psychology at the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge and someday 
teach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about academic settings that's kind of nice," said Thomas, 
who complained that his was the only name mispronounced as he crossed the 
stage. "It's not like the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate Christin Destito, 20, plans to use her A.A. as a steppingstone to a 
bachelor's degree in business administration. Even so, she took a few minutes 
Thursday to toast her achievement before once again working toward her 
long-term goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm incredibly excited," said Destito, who finished her Ventura College 
course work in December and now attends Cal State Northridge. "It took a lot of 
work, but now I'm ready to move on to the next step." 
</P>
<P>
 A handcrafted banner with a slight misspelling hung on the campus bulletin 
board during the reception that followed the commencement exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 It read: "You came. You saw. You transfered. " FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Graduation ceremonies for Oxnard and Moorpark colleges will be held today at 
the respective campuses. The Oxnard College commencement will begin at 1 p.m. 
in the campus quad, and the Moorpark College ceremony is scheduled to begin at 
5 p.m. in that college's central quad. The Ventura campus of Cal State 
Northridge will for the first time host a graduation ceremony. It will be held 
in the gymnasium at Ventura College at 10 a.m. next Friday.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA/OXNARD; POWER FAILURES AFFECT 4,300

 An underground electrical connection and a cable terminal failed in two 
separate outages Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, cutting off power to 
4,300 customers in the Ventura and Oxnard areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Montoya, area manager for Southern California Edison, said the first 
outage occurred about 8 p.m., affecting about 800 customers in parts of east 
Ventura and Oxnard and causing traffic signals at Victoria Avenue and the 
Ventura Freeway to malfunction for most of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the California Department of Transportation said they expected 
the traffic signals at the northbound ramp of Victoria Avenue to be restored 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first outage, service was restored to about 600 of the 800 customers by 
9 p.m., Montoya said. The rest had power by 6 a.m. Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That outage was blamed on an "elbow" at the end of a cable that blew out.  
</P>
<P>
 At about 4:25 a.m., an underground connector at Ventura and Gonzales roads 
failed, causing about 3,500 customers to lose power, Montoya said. Electricity 
was restored about 25 minutes later, he said. PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GALLEGLY SPEARHEADS BID FOR INS REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and 13 Republican colleagues requested a 
congressional review Thursday of a program to conduct criminal background 
checks on immigrants that the lawmakers said "may be alarmingly vulnerable to 
fraud and abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Their concern focuses on the process employed by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to do routine fingerprint checks on immigrants applying 
for citizenship, green cards or political asylum. The fingerprints are sent to 
the FBI to screen prospective newcomers for criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly and his colleagues expressed alarm over newspaper reports that 
unregulated storefront shops, charities and volunteer organizations are 
permitted to collect the fingerprints and are not required to ask for 
identification.  
</P>
<P>
 An INS spokesman said the agency relied on outside reputable groups as well as 
local police to do the fingerprinting. An INS spokesman has said the policy, 
which has been in practice for 12 years, was due to an overwhelming workload.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that there was no regulation or licensing of the businesses that play 
this role. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 Republicans asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm 
of Congress, to determine "how the INS selects organizations to collect 
fingerprints of aliens seeking admission into the United States, and what 
safeguards exist to prevent fraud within that system."  
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly spearheaded the request. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS reported that the background checks had discovered that nearly 9,000 
of the 890,000 immigrants whose fingerprints were submitted to the FBI in 1993 
were found to have been convicted of a serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release, Gallegly said: "How many more dangerous criminal aliens 
were among the 890,000 immigrants whose fingerprints were submitted to the FBI 
cannot be known because the prints themselves were so likely to have been 
fraudulent or tampered with." 
</P>
<P>
 An INS spokesman in Los Angeles said Thursday that he could not respond to the 
Republicans' letter in detail because he was not familiar with the program.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FIRM OFFERING WORKERS CLASSES IN ENGLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly half of the 65 workers at Sta-Rite Industries in Oxnard speak no 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 But that in itself is no problem for the company: The workers don't need 
English to perform their jobs assembling the water filters that Sta-Rite 
manufactures for use in swimming pools and Jacuzzis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sta-Rite has had difficulty, however, finding bilingual supervisors who can 
talk to the Spanish-speaking workers in the plant and the English-speaking 
bosses in the company's offices. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year, the company is trying a new approach to this old problem: It's 
teaching the workers English. 
</P>
<P>
 Sta-Rite has contracted with the Oxnard Union High School District for a 
teacher to hold two classes at the plant each week, making the company one of 
the few businesses in Ventura County to pay for its employees to learn English. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 of Sta-Rite's 65 employees showed interest in the course, although 
Sta-Rite is limiting each class to 10 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage the employees to stay after work for the instruction, Sta-Rite 
pays participants their regular wages, which average about $5 per hour, for one 
hour of each two-hour class. 
</P>
<P>
 Sta-Rite Operations Manager Richard Nelson said the company is acting not only 
out of self-interest, but also out of a sense of social responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Understanding or comprehending or being able to use the English language will 
make our employees better employees," he said. "They'll be more valuable to the 
corporation. But they'll also be better citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is taking a risk, he added, by teaching its workers a skill that 
may lead them to find better, higher-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may lose these people," he said. "Our turnover rate may go up 
substantially. But I think it's something that more corporations of our size 
should do. The more residents we have that speak the language, the better off 
we'll be." MAIA DAVIS

 Oxnard police arrested eight residents Thursday in a raid of homes near the 
corner of Cooper Road and Hayes Avenue, an area that has suffered from chronic 
problems with drugs and violence, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11:20 a.m., police raided five buildings, serving search warrants that 
stemmed from a monthlong undercover narcotics investigation, according to a 
statement from the department. 
</P>
<P>
 They found several grams of heroin, about an ounce of cocaine, two handguns, a 
rifle and $1,500 in cash during the sweep, police said. Officers raided a cafe 
and two homes on Hayes Avenue and nearby businesses on Garfield Avenue and 
Grant Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover investigation was part of a state-funded program aimed at 
ridding La Colonia of drug traffic, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Javier Garcia Rodriguez, 40; Goddredo Reyes Mejorado, 47; 
Silvestre Amaya Perez, 26; Georgina Gaytan Verduzco, 23; Manuel Tarazon Gomez, 
56; Samuel Rico Rodriguez, 22; Pedro Marron Zamora, 27, and Javier Mendoza 
Sanchez, 20, all of Oxnard. MATTHEW MOSK

 Co-workers of a Simi Valley man who lost his wife and 7-year-old son in a fire 
this week have established a memorial fund to pay for their funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Booker, 36, was in critical but stable condition Thursday at the burn 
center of Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker suffered third-degree burns on his arms and head as he tried to save 
his wife, Odette, and son, Brandon, from their burning house Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker works in the mail room of Simi Valley-based clothing manufacturer Bugle 
Boy. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE; ABUSE SUSPECT TELLS OF LOVE FOR DAUGHTER

 Charlotte Russo, the affluent Westlake woman on trial for alleged child abuse, 
finished three days of testimony Thursday by saying she loves the daughter she 
is accused of biting and forcing to live in a back-yard racquetball court for 
months on end. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo also said under cross-examination that she would welcome the girl back 
into her home. The girl, now 16, has been in a foster home since May of last 
year when her parents were arrested on charges of physically abusing her. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo faces felony and misdemeanor charges of child abuse in the Ventura 
County Superior Court trial. She has denied assaulting the girl and said her 
husband ordered the girl to sleep in the racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona played a tape-recorded interview that Russo had 
with a sheriff's child-abuse investigator hours after the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo described her daughter as a problem child and said she had done 
everything within her authority to rein her in. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not describe any abuse on the tape, but in court has acknowledged that 
she once bit the girl in self-defense and often slapped her for "mouthing off." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Corona said she played the tape because she thought it was 
significant that Russo did not divulge the biting incident or other abuse to 
the investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told him every other thing about the girl, why didn't she tell him that?" 
Corona said during a recess. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Russo said her husband -- Richard, 50, who pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanor child abuse -- ordered the girl to sleep in the racquetball court 
for two weeks last year. Corona asked her why she did not supply the girl with 
a bed in the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo said the girl was "15 1/2 years old and could have taken out a bed as 
well as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial will continue Monday and is expected to go the jury for deliberation 
late next week. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; TREATY OF CAHUENGA WILL BE RE-ENACTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A re-enactment of the historic signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga -- the treaty 
that helped end the Mexican-American War -- will be held Sunday at Campo de 
Cahuenga, a city historical monument in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The free event, held at the adobe at 3919 Lankershim Blvd., will begin at 1:30 
p.m. and feature look-alikes of U.S. Army Lt. Col John C. Fremont and Mexican 
Gen. Andres Pico.The men signed the treaty at the Campo, a former adobe home, 
on January 13, 1847. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Weddington McCreary, president of the Campo de Cahuenga Historical Assn., 
said the event is a "living history." Although the organization holds a 
celebration in January to mark the actual treaty signing, McCreary said foul 
weather limits the January celebration to lectures that provide little feeling 
for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a chance to change the whole perspective of the thing," 
McCreary said. "We're actually getting people involved historically and go 
through the signing itself. For example, after the treaty was signed, Pico 
threw a fiesta. We'll have a fiesta too." 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights will include the Russek Spanish Fiesta Dancers, Claremont 
Rifle/Hampton's Legion in authentic uniform and display items from the 
Mexican-American War. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the signing of the treaty in 1847, Mexico gave up claims to 
California, which joined the United States as the 31st state in 1850. The 
fighting, which claimed 13,780 American lives, began when settlers rose up 
against Mexican rule in 1846. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PROJECTS FACE REVIEW FOR IMPACT ON 
POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to concern about rising crime in one of the nation's safest cities, 
Thousand Oaks City Council members have agreed to evaluate every development 
proposal to determine whether the project would strain police resources. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a feisty half-hour debate, several council members this week rejected 
the notion that they should hire more sheriff's deputies simply because the 
city's population continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently emerging as the third-safest city of 100,000 or more in annual FBI 
crime statistics, Thousand Oaks has been "operating very successfully" with the 
current ratio of one sworn deputy per 1,250 people, Councilman Alex Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 State guidelines recommend one officer for every 1,000 residents and 
Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski has pushed to boost Sheriff's Department staffing 
to that level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've fallen behind in an area that's essential to maintaining a safe and 
healthy growing community," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore, however, derided the state standard as "some magical formula" that did 
not necessarily apply to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends where those 1,000 people are," he said. "Certainly, in Vatican 
City, I wouldn't think you'd need one officer per 1,000 people, and perhaps in 
Downtown L.A., you might need two officers per 1,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not consulted during the council debate, Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp 
said later that officers assigned to Thousand Oaks "can handle most things."  
</P>
<P>
 Kemp did note that detectives investigating violent crime are overburdened, 
and said her patrol squad could always use reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any police chief anywhere who would tell you they don't 
need more officers," Kemp said. "But we understand that there are a lot of 
needs in a lot of areas. I can't come in and say we need 10 more officers. 
That's just not reasonable." STEPHANIE SIMON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PLANS FOR PRICE CLUB ARE PUSHED FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite lingering questions about traffic and the building's appearance, the 
Simi Valley Planning Commission has pushed forward plans to bring a Price Club 
discount store to Simi Valley before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Store officials agreed to a number of concessions about the project's layout 
and said they would agree to change the company's traditional store design to 
get quick approval and meet their goal of a November opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did give up some of the things we normally would have pursued, but we 
wanted to be in this community, and we wanted to be open in time for our peak 
season," said Kathy Nishihira, development director for the San Diego-based 
Price Club chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, which will consider several proposed zone changes, must 
approve the project before construction can begin. Nishihira said the company 
planned to break ground the day after the council's vote, expected on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The 135,000-square-foot store would be located off Madera Road near the Simi 
Valley Freeway in an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during a lengthy debate at Wednesday night's Planning Commission 
meeting, the project was attacked by commissioners because of traffic and 
design problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners forced a change in the store's traffic plan to prevent shoppers 
from exiting onto Cochran Street. They also agreed to review the traffic 
pattern six months after the project was under way to see if there are 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also forced Price Club to screen the proposed store's 
roof-mounted air-conditioning and heating units so the equipment would not be 
visible from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to have to put all that equipment on the roof, I think they 
should have to cover it up," Commissioner Robert Swoish said.  
</P>
<P>
 The store intends to hold interviews for an undetermined number of prospective 
employees in late August. MATTHEW MOSK

$5.1-MILLION JUDGMENT IS ISSUED AGAINST FINANCIER IN FRAUD CASE; COURTS: AWARD 
COMES NEARLY FIVE YEARS AFTER MASSIVE INQUIRY INVOLVING OLEN PHILLIPS BEGAN. 
SOME DOUBT HE CAN REPAY THE INVESTORS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Ventura County judge has issued a $5.1-million judgment against financier 
Olen B. Phillips in connection with a failed real estate investment in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, issued Wednesday by Superior Court Judge Edwin Osborne, comes 
nearly five years after authorities launched a massive fraud investigation into 
real estate investments managed by Phillips' company. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Phillips was subsequently convicted on only one count of grand theft, 
investigators maintain that hundreds of people have lost as much as $30 million 
in complicated land deals.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the investors named in the suit say they don't know if Phillips 
will ever be able to pay the judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-million judgment stems from lawsuits filed against Phillips in 1992 by 
investors and partners in a plan to buy 2.5 acres in Thousand Oaks and build a 
172-unit residential-care facility for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Phillips raised about $1.5 million from 56 investors to buy the 
property on Thousand Oaks Boulevard near the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 But without the knowledge of the investors, Phillips diverted more than 
$700,000 from that project's account and then secretly borrowed $300,000 from 
an individual investor, according to Roger Stanard, a Woodland Hills attorney 
representing the limited partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assume that he used it to keep his other partnerships afloat," Stanard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the $300,000 loan, Phillips issued a deed of trust for the land 
to Alfred Van Leuven, who worked as a commercial pilot for United Airlines 
along with Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors and partners in the venture did not know about Van Leuven or his 
claim on the property, said Wayne Baldwin, Van Leuven's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have enough money to close escrow, so he needed to scramble," 
Baldwin said, referring to Phillips' cash loan from Van Leuven's retirement 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior center project eventually stalled when Phillips failed to obtain a 
construction loan, possibly because it would have led to the discovery of the 
second deed on the property, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-million award, including compensatory and punitive damages, was split 
among limited partners -- who invested from $10,000 to $300,000 -- Van Leuven, 
architect Charles Scribner and the widow of Joseph Danford, who acquired the 
right to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Osborne awarded $2.5 million to the limited partners, $1.24 
million to Danford and Scribner, $1.16 million to Van Leuven and an additional 
$250,000 to Scribner for his architectural services. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu resident Jackie Fry, whose family lost about $400,000 in the limited 
partnership, said many investors trusted Phillips because of his involvement in 
the Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips' company was shut down after investigators raided his offices in 
December, 1989, and seized thousands of documents as part of a fraud 
investigation by state and local officials. The company's assets were frozen, 
and an attorney was appointed to sort out its affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months after the raid, Phillips and a pair of his top company managers 
were indicted on 81 counts of grand theft and securities fraud, described at 
the time as the largest fraud scheme in the county's history. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a four-month trial, Phillips was convicted of only one count of 
grand theft and sentenced to probation and 60 days in jail. His right-hand man, 
Charles J. Francoeur, received 7 2/3 years in prison in the same case. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, believed to be living in Texas, now faces federal sentencing in a 
separate bank-fraud case. After an earlier mistrial, he pleaded guilty last 
month to two counts of making false statements in loan applications and bank 
statements. He is scheduled to be sentenced June 13 and faces up to 24 months 
in prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, attorneys involved in the civil suit said they did not know when, 
if ever, their clients would see any cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Patterson, who represents Neal Scribner, said he did not know if 
Phillips had any money left after his legal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know one way or the other," he said. "There's nothing to be said . . 
. because you're treading off into the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys involved with the case said they believe the award is the first 
successful civil suit against Phillips by investors. 
</P>
<P>
 And Baldwin predicted that the $5-million judgment issued Wednesday may set a 
precedent for future awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanard, however, said other investors have been blocked thus far from trying 
to recover their losses because Phillips' company was seized by investigators. 
The suit over the senior center was allowed to move forward to free the 
2.5-acre property for development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad thing is, O. B. Phillips will never in a million lifetimes make 
enough money to pay off all the judgments that are probably going to be 
(issued) against him," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad for him and his family. It's sad for the investors," Baldwin added. 
"I think Phillips got in over his head and was trying to keep things afloat, 
and that's when he got into trouble."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: WEINTRAUB MADE NAME ON SCHOOL BOARD, NOW READY TO GRADUATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ROBERTA REDUX: Former Los Angeles school board member Roberta Weintraub is 
seeking a new political incarnation, this time as the successor to Los Angeles 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is expected to easily win election to the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seat now held by Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody should believe this will be a cakewalk, but I've got good name 
identification and I intend to win," said Weintraub, 58, as she assessed her 
prospects in a 5th City Council District election that is likely to produce a 
slew of ambitious aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub, who resigned last June from the Valley-based school board seat she 
had held since 1979, has already pumped $10,000 of her own money into her 
campaign coffers and several years ago switched political parties. After years 
as a Republican, she became a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wonder if Weintraub -- best known for leading the fight to dismantle the 
Los Angeles school system's desegregation plan and whose political base has 
been in the San Fernando Valley -- can pull votes on the liberal Westside. 
Sixty percent of Yaroslavsky's district is on the south side of Mulholland 
Drive, while the rest is in the Valley and includes Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weintraub says she's got a track record that easily transcends her origins 
as a foe of court-ordered desegregation. She points to her role in establishing 
contraceptive-dispensing health clinics at high school campuses; setting up 
day-care centers for student mothers at schools in the east San Fernando 
Valley, and working to build a dozen magnet school programs that seek to offer 
an exciting curriculum to a multicultural student body. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some even wonder if Weintraub's Valley base is all that secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub raised hackles when she supported a 1992 school board 
reapportionment plan that stripped the Valley of one of its two all-Valley 
seats. Former ally Bobbi Fiedler, the founder of Busstop, accused Weintraub of 
selling out the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But since leaving the board, Weintraub has tried to stay in touch with the 
Valley's pulse by supporting the breakup of the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has she been resting since she left the board a year ago. Currently, she 
serves as a Mayor Richard Riordan appointee to the city's Library Commission, 
co-directs Students Run LA, a group that trains youngsters to participate in 
the Los Angeles Marathon, and is an appointee to the Board of Governors of the 
California Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If Weintraub were to win a seat on the City Council, it would amount to a 
reunion of sorts. Two other former Weintraub colleagues on the school board -- 
Jackie Goldberg and Rita Walters -- now sit on the council. 
</P>
<P>

 ROSENTHAL REPRIEVE: State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), now trying 
out for the job as successor to state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys), has so 
far failed to arouse the same ugly controversy that made Roberti's tenure as a 
Valley lawmaker harrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, this quiet state of affairs in the 20th Senate District is 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old Rosenthal, who represented the Westside for two decades, 
shares much of the baggage that got Roberti in trouble. Like Roberti, Rosenthal 
is not from the Valley, he's a liberal and he has backed gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosenthal has not encountered the same hostile Valley electorate that 
greeted Roberti when he began shifting his political base from Hollywood to Van 
Nuys in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have something to do with the fact that Roberti, as the author of a 
1989 assault-weapons ban, was the state's most visible symbol of gun control 
and thus the hated target of 2nd Amendment activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite disavowals, the energy and animosity directed at Roberti came from gun 
activists. Although he voted for the gun measure, Rosenthal was not a notable 
figure in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a sense that the gun activists are lying in wait for us," said 
Lynette Stevens, who is on leave as Rosenthal's chief of staff to manage his 
latest political venture. "But we're not saying it won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Seedborg, Rosenthal's political consultant, added that Rosenthal, unlike 
Roberti, also benefits from not being a total stranger to the Valley. In fact, 
Rosenthal's current 22nd Senate District, due to the vagaries of 
reapportionment, includes 40,000 constituents residing south of Ventura 
Boulevard who also live in the 20th District. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the April, 1992, and April, 1994, races were special elections 
in which Roberti found himself running against a throng of Republican and 
Democratic foes, all clamoring for his head. Such elections encourage ganging 
up against the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal, by contrast, faces one foe in the June 7 Democratic primary who is 
having trouble rustling up even $1,000 in campaign contributions. When the 
senator dispenses with his fellow Democrat, he will face one GOP foe in the 
Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Republican primary has proved to be a quiet affair peopled with 
personalities who tried unsuccessfully in 1992 and again this year to defeat 
Roberti. Running here are Dolores White, a real estate broker, Randy Linkmeyer, 
a gun store owner, Larry Martz, a maintenance contractor, and until recently Al 
Dib, a retired green grocer and perennial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dib bowed out of the race and endorsed Linkmeyer. Businessman David Honda, who 
had trouble getting enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, is out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DEJA VU?City Hall is still trying to fathom what's going on in Los Angeles 
City Councilman Marvin Braude's office. In recent days, Braude has learned that 
he's losing two longtime aides, Cindy Miscikowski, his chief deputy and 
principal planning aide, and Rosalind Wayman, the head of his Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
 Miscikowski's departure has provided the grist for some weighty political 
conjecture. Much discussed is the question of whether Miscikowski, the wife of 
lobbyist-attorney and real estate heir Doug Ring, will run against Braude, much 
as Laura Chick did against Joy Picus. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Chick, it will be recalled, worked several years 
for Picus, resigned to go back into private life, in 1992 resurfaced as a 
critic of Picus and in 1993 challenged her former boss in a hotly contested 
election. Picus cried foul throughout the campaign, likening Chick to a trusted 
employee who steals trade secrets and then sets up a competing business. 
Despite it all, Chick won. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Miscikowski says she has no plans to run for Braude's seat 
whether he's in it or not and that she's headed for the job of executive 
director of the Hebrew Union College's Skirball Cultural Center. The center, 
which includes a museum featuring the works of Jewish-American artists, is 
scheduled to open next year in the Sepulveda Pass. (It's the facility that's 
being built on the west side of the San Diego Freeway near the top of the 
pass.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I think not," Miscikowski said when asked this week if she'd run for City 
Council. "It's really time for a change -- a time to see if there's life 
outside City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Miscikowski, a Brentwood resident like Braude, has long been considered 
a prime candidate for the seat Braude has held since 1965, and many observers 
find it hard to believe she will not seek election someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Glenn Barr, Braude's press deputy, said recently that Braude has 
not foreclosed the possibility of running again in 1997. Others wonder, 
however, if the 73-year-old anti-smoking crusader, who has had Miscikowski 
virtually running his council office for years, will want to hang on to the 
seat if he must attend more closely to the affairs of office.

HAAG GETS PAST A COUPLE OF BARRIERS; TRACK AND FIELD: GRANADA HILLS STAR WINS 
HIS HEAT IN TWO HURDLE EVENTS AND ALSO QUALIFIES FOR CITY FINALS IN LONG JUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 His bruised right heel is nearly 100% healed. 
</P>
<P>
 His hurdle workouts are proceeding better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Danny Haag of Granada Hills High just needs to relax a little more the day 
of a meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Haag ran 14.82 seconds in the 110-meter high hurdles and a personal best of 
38.95 in the 300 intermediates Thursday to win his respective heats in those 
events of the City Section preliminaries at Birmingham High. In addition, he 
spanned a wind-aided 22 feet 6 1/2 inches in the long jump to qualify for next 
week's City finals in three events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to run a better time in the highs," Haag said. "I've been 
running much better in the highs in practice than I've shown in the races and 
that's been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my problem is that I get so hyped up during the day of a meet that by 
the time it gets time to run the highs, I feel tired. I've just got to find 
something else to think about during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Haag, a senior, recorded the fastest time of the meet in the highs and the 
second-fastest in the intermediates. His long jump mark qualified him fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 His time in the intermediates was a personal best, though he stutter-stepped 
badly at the fifth of eight hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heel doesn't bother me (from an injury incurred in March) in the highs, 
but after the long jump, I definitely feel it in the intermediates," Haag 
explained. "And I'm still having some problems with my steps. I've worked on 
alternating my lead leg in practice, but I haven't done it in a race yet. Maybe 
I will next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham, which has finished second, first and second in the last three City 
championships, produced 11 qualifiers for the finals, behind defending champion 
Dorsey with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lincoln led the Braves by qualifying in four events for the second year 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge-bound senior placed second in his heat of the 110 
high hurdles (15.16), leaped a wind-aided 22-4 3/4 in the long jump to qualify 
sixth, was one of 12 athletes to clear 6-0 in the high jump and bounded 44-4 
1/4 for second in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top local efforts were turned in by Andre DeSaussure of Taft, Dante Cain 
of Monroe, Neisha Henderson of Cleveland and Darvena Merritt of North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure posted the fastest time of the meet in the 400 with a clocking of 
48.52, even though he waved to the crowd with 50 meters still remaining in the 
race. He also ran a 48.1 anchor leg on Taft's 1,600 relay team that finished 
third in its heat and grabbed the eighth -- and final -- qualifying spot with a 
time of 3 minutes 27.75 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe had a disappointing meet overall as the Vikings' 400 relay team failed 
to advance, but Cain led long jump qualifying with a wind-aided 22-10 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson was the leading qualifier in the long jump and triple jump with 
personal bests of 17-1 and 36-7 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt's personal best of 42-2 in the girls' shotput led qualifying in that 
event by nearly six feet.

SHORT SPRINT GETS SEARCY TO LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troy Searcy of Quartz Hill High finished second in a runoff in the boys' 
100-meters dash at Gahr High on Thursday and advanced to Saturday's Southern 
Section Division I track and field championships at Long Beach Veterans 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Searcy ran a wind-aided 10.7 seconds to finish behind Jamal Carr (10.3) of 
Muir, but ahead of Anthony Rudolph of West Covina and Tyson Murphy of Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two finishers advanced to the Division I final as the eighth and ninth 
qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The runoffs became necessary when section officials discovered Monday that the 
Accutrack timing device malfunctioned early in last Saturday's Division I 
preliminaries, resulting in incorrect times and erroneous seedings for the 
championships.

HEAVENLY AGAIN, ANGEL WINS BY 10; CITY SECTION GOLF: HE CLAIMS INDIVIDUAL TITLE 
AGAIN AND HELPS GRANADA HILLS TAKE TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Darren Angel of Granada Hills High grabbed a pencil and scribbled another 2 on 
his scorecard. Birdies were piling up. Quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, maybe it wasn't a 2 after all. Perhaps it was a Z, because the way 
Angel was cruising, the rest of the field might as well have slept in. Even 
Angel appeared to be snoozing at times as he shredded the field Thursday in the 
final round of the City Section golf championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't even look like he was trying," said Scott Golditch of Taft, one of 
Angel's playing partners. "It didn't look like he even cared." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, looks can be deceiving. Angel may have a low-key manner, but when it came 
time to put away the opposition, he slammed the door by slamming home six 
birdies to win the individual title by a remarkable 10 shots at Knollwood 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, a junior, fired his second consecutive three-under-par 69 to win in a 
runaway. Angel, the defending champion, also led Granada Hills to its second 
team title in a row. The Highlanders fired a five-man, 36-hole total of 804 to 
edge Grant by two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Golditch, who finished third last season, shot 75 in the second round to 
finish second but was never really in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel, who started the day with a six-shot lead, birdied the par-three sixth 
hole to take an eight-shot lead and all but put it in the bag with another 
birdie on No. 7. Angel shot 35-34. 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt he was playing poorly on the back side and was still beating me," 
said Golditch, who will play next year at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel set the field on its collective backside, to be sure. Other than 
Golditch, no other player finished within 20 shots of Angel, a third-team 
All-American last year. He averaged 280 yards off the tee, missed only two 
greens in regulation and reached the 11th hole, a 461-yard par-five, with a 
drive and an eight-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel's score could have been dizzying -- he missed six putts from inside 12 
feet. Peter Yang finished at 158 and Tyler Foster at 159 for the Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
 The team competition was as close as it sounded and wasn't without 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills Coach Joe White, whose team entered the second round with a 
two-shot lead over Grant, ordered course officials to group the tee markers in 
the middle of the tee boxes. Knollwood is the home course of Granada Hills, 
which played host to the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the women's tees were moved back and the championship blue tees 
were moved forward, both to the approximate area where the white tees would 
normally be located. It gave Angel, a big hitter, an advantage and added 
several hundred yards to the course for Allison Wilson of Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, one of the area's best girls' players, was allowed under City rules to 
play from the women's tees. In the first round Wednesday, she enjoyed an 
advantage of about 20 yards on every hole. Thursday, she teed off with the 
boys. Wilson shot 79-80 and tied for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 White said he was trying to make the course easier for everyone by grouping 
the tees. After the tournament, all tee markers were back in their typical 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't trying to cheat," White said. "She hits it as far as the boys. It's 
only a few yards a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's Josh Jacobs -- playing in the second-to-last group -- was misinformed 
after the 16th hole that Grant held a 10-shot lead. He bogeyed the 17th and 
missed the green at No. 18 before getting some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then they said I had to birdie (the 18th) to win," said Jacobs, who bogeyed 
the hole to shoot 81. "I said, 'Thanks a lot.' "

CAL LUTHERAN HOPES TO GET A GOOD START WITH ARROYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Arroyo, a senior pitcher from Buena High and Ventura College, will start 
for Cal Lutheran against UC San Diego in the first game of the NCAA Division 
III West Regional today at 3 p.m. in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo, a right-hander, has a record of 8-1 with one save and an earned-run 
average of 2.73. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the guy who's pitched Friday games for us all year," Kingsmen Coach 
Marty Slimak said. "He's used to being in that spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Slimak said that Arroyo's arm recovers quickly, which might enable him to 
pitch again on Sunday if the best-of-five series goes a fourth and fifth game.  
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the series advances to the Division III College World Series 
next weekend in Battle Creek, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Weiss and David Jaglowski, both right-handers, will start for Cal 
Lutheran (29-6-1) in Saturday's doubleheader. Weiss, a junior from Los Angeles, 
has a record of 9-1 with a 3.01 ERA. Jaglowski, a sophomore from Apple Valley, 
is 5-1 with an ERA of 6.24. 
</P>
<P>
 UC San Diego (28-4) has not announced its starting rotation, but the Tritons 
probably will start Ryan Flanagan (8-2), a senior left-hander, against Arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego staff also includes left-hander Steve Height (5-0) and 
right-handers Mark Hartmann (6-1) and Marc Abrams (3-1).  
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons' closer is Kurt Luhrsen, a hard-throwing right-hander who is 5-0 
with six saves. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams last met in the 1992 West Regional and the Kingsmen won in four 
games.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: LITTLE PARQUE RINGING UP BIG NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley High's Jim Parque stands only 5-foot-9 but must look 10-feet 
tall to opposing batters. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior left-hander bound for UCLA has enjoyed a remarkable regular season. 
He will take a 10-2 record and an 0.40 earned-run average into today's first 
round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also the area's strikeout king with 136 in 70 2/3 innings. Parque has 
struck out 10 or more in nine games and 14 or more five times. 
</P>
<P>
 He had double figure strikeouts in all but one of his eight league outings. He 
struck out 17 against Muir, 15 against Hoover and 14 against Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was going to be good, but he has done better than I thought," Coach 
Tony Zarrillo said. "He has gone above and beyond anything I expected. He's had 
a tremendous season." PACIFIC LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Parque's Partner 
</P>
<P>
 With Parque on the team, it's easy to overlook Garrett Lee, a senior who also 
had a remarkable season. He was 4-1 with an 0.50 ERA in league games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was overshadowed because Jim had such a great season," Zarrillo said. "But 
his league stats were very impressive. He has pitched wonderfully well for us, 
especially in the last month. We certainly would not be where we are if it were 
not for Garrett." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is 4-3 with a 1.33 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley's John Jenkins admitted that he might have been a little too 
relaxed when he won the 50-yard freestyle Saturday night in the Southern 
Section Division II swimming finals. He won by more than half a second but his 
time of 20.62 didn't match his 1993 record-setting 20.53 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the evening, Jenkins' focus had changed. A raucous crowd of 
Loyola supporters seated behind the starting blocks had succeeded in firing him 
up for the 400 relay. "I wanted to make sure they didn't go home with 
everything," Jenkins said of Loyola, which had already locked up the team 
title. "We wanted to claim the last race as our own. I hadn't been that pumped 
up for a race in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons trailed Loyola by a length as Jenkins prepared for his anchor leg. 
After glaring at the Cub swimmer next to him, Jenkins made up the deficit in 
the first 25 meters and held on to win by a length. CHANNEL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Not Worst, Young 
</P>
<P>
 When you ask Rio Mesa baseball Coach Richard Duran about his team's 
worst-to-first season, he quickly interjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you look at the word 'worst,' we look at that in a positive 
way," said Duran, whose team was 10-14, 4-10 in league play last season. "When 
we finished last, playing in the Channel League, which is a difficult league, 
our kids learned how to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't really poor last year, we were just young. I look at last year as 
being the building block for this year." 
</P>
<P>
 In '94, the Spartans finished the regular season 18-6 and 11-3, and they could 
be better next season. The team has only three seniors. Among the top juniors 
are Chad Snyder (.440, 23 RBIs), Steve Arneson (.397, 30 RBIs), Eric Flores 
(.360, 15 RBIs) and Richard Soliz (6-1, 1.82 ERA). MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Lancer Triple Play 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks became the first school in six years to qualify three runners 
for the Southern Section finals in the boys' 1,600 meters when Kevin Marsden (4 
minutes 21.63 seconds), Jeff Fischer (4:24.12), and Chadd Aldrich (4:25.74) 
posted those respective times in Saturday's Division I preliminaries at Long 
Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's Bryan Dameworth, Peter Oviatt and Bob Gorman placed third, sixth and 
ninth in the 1988 1-A -- now Division IV -- finals. ALPHA LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Telling Numbers 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Baptist baseball team picked the right time to peak. The Knights 
(19-5), who clinched their second consecutive league title last week and are 
seeded first in the Division V playoffs, are enjoying a 12-game winning streak 
with 11 of those victories coming against league opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Five players with at least 18 at-bats in league play are batting .400 or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mr. Consistent award goes to Ryan O'Connell, who hit safely in all 12 
league games, batted .450 (18 of 40) and had 17 RBIs. Leadoff batter Dana Berg 
had an on-base percentage of .500 and scored 19 runs in league games. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Hernandez (9-1) gave up only four runs and went 5-0 in league play, 
beating each opponent at least once and finishing with an 0.82 ERA. NORTH 
VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Things 
</P>
<P>
 What if they held a North Valley League showdown and no pitchers showed up? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened last week when first-place Granada Hills and second-place 
Kennedy played twice. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Granada Hills pitcher Josh Goldberg walked five batters and 
allowed eight earned runs in only 1 2/3 innings and Kennedy won, 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Golden Cougar pitchers Keith Bryden and David Soto issued a 
mind-numbing 13 walks. Soto walked three batters with the bases loaded in the 
fifth inning in relief, and Kennedy lost, 5-3, to fall two games behind Granada 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single run they scored was either put on base by a walk or driven in by 
a walk," Kennedy Coach Manny Alvarez said. "It was frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Granada Hills Coach Darryl Stroh: "It was lousy pitching by one side or 
another the whole way through." Around the Leagues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Thousand Oaks' Matt Elam had more stolen bases (33) than hits (26) this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rio Mesa has stolen 40 bases in 41 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rio Mesa pitching staff has held opponents to a .243 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agoura outfielder Kevin Sass' stolen bases slipped from 24 his junior year 
to seven this season, but there are factors other than his speed to consider. 
Sass batted leadoff last season and he batted third or fourth this season. He 
also had a slugging percentage of .620. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rio Mesa, Newbury Park, Moorpark and Hart lost their final league baseball 
games after clinching league championships. What's more, Moorpark and Hart were 
11-0 in their leagues before losing their final games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale (18-6, 11-4) won six of its final seven league games but still 
could not win the Golden League title outright, because three of its four 
league losses were to Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highland, which earned a playoff berth last season, loses 12 seniors and 
went 0-15 in league play this year. A ray of hope: The junior varsity was 11-4 
and won the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chatsworth pitcher Jim DeBiase is having an outstanding senior season. The 
right-hander is 8-1 with a 2.12 ERA and has six complete games in 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antelope Valley's Chris Tapia finished the regular season with 20 extra-base 
hits in 21 games. Tapia had 11 doubles, seven triples and two home runs and a 
Golden League-leading 36 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sylmar shortstop Hiram Damwijk (.329) went hitless in 18 consecutive at-bats 
before ending his hitless streak last week. He must have found the problem and 
corrected it. In the past two games, Damwijk is seven for nine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fifteen of Van Nuys' 26 games were decided by two or fewer runs. Of the 15, 
Van Nuys won five. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poly's ERA is an incredibly low 0.88. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poly first baseman Paul Cespedes recently worked himself back into the 
lineup. In 28 at-bats, Cespedes has 10 hits and 14 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hart freshman Monica Oleksyn's Southern Section Division II record time of 
1:05.72 in the 100-yard breaststroke Saturday was a surprise considering 
Oleksyn had only the third-fastest qualifying time. But she cut 1.81 seconds 
off that time in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dwight Hernandez of Palm Springs was the surprise winner in the 
region-dominated consolation final of the Division II 100 freestyle. Mike 
Scarcelli (Crespi), Jeff Robb (Crescenta Valley), Jon Schild (Crespi) and Mike 
Failoa (St. Francis) finished second through fifth.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Delgado's pitching and hitting powered visiting Poly High to a 6-2 
victory over first-place Sylmar in an East Valley League baseball game 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado, a senior right-hander, held Sylmar (24-4, 15-1 in league play) to 
three hits, striking out four. In the seventh, Delgado delivered a two-run 
double that snapped a 2-2 tie and triggered the winning four-run uprising. 
</P>

 When a sixth-grader sees a teen-age couple getting married and says, "Why do 
they do that when they're so young?" it ap pears that harsh reality may be 
dawning on young lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But the teen-agers are not the sixth-grader's older contemporaries. They're 
Romeo and Juliet in Shakespeare's tragic romance, and the student is in a 
workshop brought to his school by L.A. Troupe. Under an Equity contract, the 
group tours Southland schools with 45-minute adaptations of classic literature 
dovetailing with the students' curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Friday, the group will be at San Fernando High School, performing 
"Macbeth" and "Edgar Allan Poe," featuring works by the American writer. 
Burbank's John Muir Middle School will host the company's original piece, 
"Cultural Mythology" on June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the sixth-grader's comment, troupe co-founder Cherie Brown says, 
"That's their reaction to these two kids when they find out how old they are. I 
really think it's starting to get across, overall. Kids look at this and say 
they shouldn't have gotten married. They should have waited. That's the 
reaction we get." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and her partner, Koni McCurdy, have long been dedicated to bridging the 
gap between students and the classics, and to doing it theatrically, bringing 
the dusty images from the page into full-blooded reality before the students' 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the workshops, which sometimes precede the performance and 
sometimes are held separately, Brown says, "We try to connect the issues, 
themes and messages that are in the shows to the workshop. We talk about the 
universality of the themes connected to the play but also connected to their 
own lives, so that it becomes one big story, one big idea that they can take 
away with them, based on the classical ideas that come out, for example, in 
'Romeo and Juliet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy remembers going to one school for a "Romeo and Juliet" workshop, where 
they found the African American students sitting on one side of the room, and 
the Latino students on the other. By the end of the workshop, McCurdy recalls, 
they were all on stage together. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were working together," she says. "The teachers couldn't believe it. 
It's because all of a sudden you're giving them a focus. You say to them, in 
'Romeo and Juliet,' did it make any sense that these two families were 
fighting? They kept killing each other. Why did they do it? The students make 
the connection. They know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown adds, "In the end of the play we have this moment, 'Come Capulets, come 
Montagues,' whatever the lines are. And I said, 'Let's take the moment that 
they hold hands, and come together before we move on.' The students visualize 
that. We try to hit the visceral as well as the language. Maybe on an 
intellectual level they're not going to get everything, but it's going to hit 
them somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and McCurdy's techniques have evolved through long experience as 
professional actresses and teachers. Brown teaches part-time in the theater 
department at Cal State Fullerton and at L.A. Valley College. McCurdy teaches 
part-time in the Fullerton School District, bringing theater, music and dance 
to the schools in a program called "All the Arts for All the Kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The classically trained performers met during the '80s, when they were 
appearing at West Hollywood's Globe Playhouse in "Macbeth." Brown was Lady M. 
</P>
<P>
 They were both interested in taking theater into the schools. McCurdy already 
had begun a program called "Traveling Burn Safety Show" for the California Burn 
Foundation (an educational program that continues to this day). When Brown 
started performing in the burn show, L.A. Troupe was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first show, in 1988, was a 45-minute version of "Cyrano de Bergerac" 
(McCurdy was playing Cyrano's love, Roxane, at the time at the Globe) at a high 
school in Orange County. The duo went to educational conferences and 
conventions, making themselves known. They found their mentor in Sheila Smith 
of the Los Angeles Unified School District's Gifted and Talented Program, and 
the troupe was on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy says: "They need programs coming into the schools that are very much 
educationally oriented. But they don't play down to the kids. And for us, the 
most important thing is that we don't change the language at all. What the kids 
see is the original, the original Shakespeare, the original Moliere. And that's 
what Sheila Smith saw. We work very closely with the LAUSD." 
</P>
<P>
 The work has peripheral rewards when a breakthrough occurs. Just before the 
January earthquake they had an elementary school workshop on "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream," in which they told the story of the play. The quake delayed the 
rest of the workshop for about six weeks. Reviewing the story, McCurdy asked 
the students for the names of the four young lovers in the story. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one kid raises his hand," McCurdy says, "and he knew the names. And 
they're not easy -- Hermia, Lysander, Demetrios, Helena. This teacher comes up 
to us and says, 'That was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. This kid is a 
crack child, and really slow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of result inspires Brown, McCurdy and their actors. And the kind of 
response they recently elicited at Taft High School in Woodland Hills in the 
question-and-answer period following their production of "Julius Caesar." 
Several sophomores commented on how real the words had become, hearing live 
actors speak them. At the moment of Caesar's murder in the Forum, there was an 
audible gasp from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janina Carranza, who had not read the play, said, "What I liked best was that 
it was all very true, very real. It made the story very clear, like when he was 
refusing the crown. And it wasn't boring. It's very dramatic. I'm looking 
forward to reading it now that I've seen it. It's a good introduction." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Stone, who said he was "bored" reading the play in his drama class, 
agreed. "I thought it was well-acted, especially the death scenes. It kept me 
up. It was exciting the way it kept moving. There weren't any slow parts. Now 
when I read it in class, I'll enjoy it more." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Hein, who coordinates special programs at Taft and arranged to bring the 
show there, is one of the troupe's biggest fans. "We have students who have 
never seen a play, any kind of a stage production. This might be their first 
exposure to it. That's valuable, and bringing to life a piece of literature 
that they're studying is a wonderful way for a student to kind of be gripped by 
the story itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it far more interesting to the kids. It lends a feeling of reality 
to the words. It will be a far more vital piece of literature now. Shakespeare 
for this age student isn't very alive. This takes them past that. They suddenly 
have real people, and the words on the page are more meaningful." WHERE AND

THEATER REVIEW; ANOTHER LOOK AT HOLMES; THE CUMBERSOME PLAY PORTRAYS THE SLEUTH 
AS A WOMAN DISGUISED AS A MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ray Loynd writes regularly about theater 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's quite elementary, if you think about it. Sherlock Holmes was a woman who 
disguised herself as a man. That high voice and hairless chin, that secrecy 
about the past and the mysterious childhood. That love of dissembling. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't believe it, visit Group Repertory Theatre and meet Holmes the 
confident masquerader in "221 B Baker Street," the first full-length play by 
Therese Lentz who manages, in one swoop, to outrage both Holmesologists and 
cross-dressers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind you, this is not wicked satire or exaggerated comedy so much as 
intriguing revisionism. As far as the character Holmes is concerned, director 
Patricia Lee Willson presents him/her forthrightly enough, albeit in a comedic, 
sometimes farcical context. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the plot almost defies explanation on paper, and on stage it's 
totally numbing and defeating. 
</P>
<P>
 We meet the great detective (actress Whitney Vale) in his/her cluttered Baker 
Street study indulging in a pot of tea with the lovable and bumbling Dr. Watson 
(the delightful Shelly Kurtz). Suffice it to say that Watson, the Boswell-like 
chronicler, has incurred the wrath of Holmes' elder, thin-skinned brother 
Mycroft Holmes (the over-the-top Andrew Brennan) by calling him uncouth names 
in the Victorian periodical "The Strand." 
</P>
<P>
 The frenetic, priggish Mycroft concocts a lavish plan to exact revenge on 
Sherlock and Watson with the help of a phony suicide report and the arrival of 
a spoiled, hyper intermediary (the amusing Mike E. Smith). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruse blows apart when Holmes falls for the young intermediary, who is 
equally drawn to Holmes in a liaison that materializes discreetly in Holmes' 
bedroom (the fusty, rumpled two-room interior is designed by Jim Yarmer). 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with all this is not the concept (which is rich in implication) 
but the airless plot, the endless, overheated chatter, the excessive length and 
the curious lack of interest built into Holmes, both in the writing and in 
Vale's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In pants or not, Holmes is off-putting instead of magnetic, towering, droll or 
clever -- all the qualities you admire in "The Collected Works" or the Basil 
Rathbone movies. There's something smirky and insufferably self-satisfied about 
this Holmes. Perhaps worst of all is that Holmes is short, the shortest person 
on stage, even shorter than the cozy landlady (the wonderfully vivid veteran 
Olive Dunbar, the production's strongest actor). 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes may be a woman (most of us can live with that), but she's got to have 
height, and she's got to be physically commanding, preferably tall and dapper. 
(By the way, most of the costumes, designed by Bonita Friedericy, are indeed 
dapper.)  
</P>
<P>
 There's also one regrettable moment in which Holmes (Vale) bares her breasts 
while undressing alone in her bedroom. It's totally gratuitous, even if her 
male disguise is convincing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the production is harmless. The trouble is that, with the exception 
of a few touches (Dunbar's housekeeper, Kurtz's Watson and Smith's interloper) 
it's charmless and not much fun. WHERE AND WHEN

PAIR BRINGS 'FAME' TO AMERICA; TWO MEN COME FROM STOCKHOLM TO PRESENT THEIR 
PRODUCTION AT THE ALEX THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The American aura glows around the world these days. Films, television shows, 
recordings. Even our Broadway musicals. Even something as indigenous as "Fame," 
both the film and the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 And the stage adaptation, called "Fame, the musical," conceived and developed 
by David De Silva (who produced the original film) has been running in 
Stockholm for the past two years and is still going. 
</P>
<P>
 Its Stockholm success was one of the reasons its director, Runar Borge, and 
its choreographer, Lars Bethke, were brought here to re-create their staging 
for the Alex Theatre production, which opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 For 47-year-old Borge, a native of Oslo, "Fame" is No. 62 in a long list of 
directorial assignments, from "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Chicago" to "West Side 
Story" and "Chorus Line." 
</P>
<P>
 "We do all those shows," Borge says with a chuckle. When asked how this -- his 
first American production -- came about, he laughs even louder. "You're asking 
me ? It was the last thing I thought, really. It's the most American thing I 
can think of, the dream of becoming a star. Scandinavia is so far away from 
that. We must have done something with the show in Stockholm that the producers 
liked, because they came over and saw it, and that's how it happened. We didn't 
ask them to come. They came. " 
</P>
<P>
 Borge was anxious about their seeing his production. He had cut some music, 
trimmed some scenes and tailored the staging for the Stockholm cast. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers thinking, "Oh, God, they're coming. We changed things. They'll 
come and say, 'No. Stop the show, we don't want it.' " But the opposite 
happened. Borge was told not to change a thing. "When you come to America," he 
was told, "this is the way we want it." This, after four previous American 
productions had come and gone. That isn't to say Borge is going to duplicate 
the Stockholm production here. He just doesn't work that way. He's prone to 
make the production fit the performers. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains, "I'm not a director who can go around the world doing the same 
show. People are doing that, happy having one or two shows, going around the 
world doing them. The same show every time." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not allowed to change a thing," Borge continues. "I couldn't do it 
like that. I'd rather work at something else than copy myself all the time. 
It's not fun at all. You have to change." 
</P>
<P>
 The choreographer for the Swedish production and this new one at the Alex, 
Stockholm's Lars Bethke, agrees wholeheartedly with Borge. Although most of his 
choreography is the same as in their first staging, he explains that some of 
the numbers have been changed.  
</P>
<P>
 Bethke, 28, is a multi-threat artist, having appeared as Danny in "Grease," 
Bernardo in "West Side Story" and Mr. Mistofeles in "Cats," all under Borge's 
direction. He choreographs ballets and modern dance, and look closely at the 
dancer doing the jump-split on the "Fame" lobby poster. That's also Bethke, 
although he never appeared in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fame" is his first choreography for a musical. When Borge asked him to take 
on the task, Bethke was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "After doing 300 or 400 performances of 'Grease' for two years, I 
just felt I didn't want to go up on stage right after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethke has had the opportunity to be inventive in his choreography for the 
show.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are not a lot of musicals around where you can make things that you 
really like yourself. . . . It's fun to be able to do it again and make those 
changes, and see it grow even more." 
</P>
<P>
 Capturing the American feeling of the show was not a problem, Borge says. 
Sometimes at home they call Stockholm "Little New York." Borge says he's used 
to the "style of America." They see American films and television shows in the 
original language, with subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Borge and Bethke are glad to be here staging this production, but say 
they would not come here looking for work. Both realized -- as Borge says -- 
when auditioning close to 600 young performers for the Alex production, ". . . 
It's hard to find work, because the talent is fantastic, really." WHERE AND

FAMILY LOVE AND EUTHANASIA; 'BURKIE' EXPLORES A DYING MAN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH 
HIS SON AND DAUGHTER.

 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 A play opens, first off-Broadway, then in Philadelphia. It explores the trian 
gular relationship of a father dying of pancreatic cancer, his doting son and 
not-so-doting daughter. The father wills himself to die. The reviews make 
little of this element. 
</P>
<P>
 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 A play opens in previews tonight in North Hollywood at Theatre Exchange, care 
of Interact Theatre Company. It explores a father-son-daughter relationship. 
The father, suffering from pancreatic cancer, wills himself to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Same play. Different decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Graham wrote his first produced play, "Burkie," when few knew who Dr. 
Jack Kevorkian was, when doctor-assisted suicide and euthanasia were hardly 
topics for civilized conversation. He now says he never intended that issue to 
dominate the listener's mind as it is sorting through the conflicted emotions 
between father Ed Burke, son Jon and daughter Jess. 
</P>
<P>
 "His desire to bring an end to things just follows from a life that's shutting 
down," says Graham by telephone from Philadelphia, where he is resident 
playwright at the Philadelphia Festival Theatre. Graham will soon be a big East 
Valley theater presence when, during the "Burkie" run, Burbank-based Alliance 
Repertory Company opens another Graham drama, "Minor Demons." 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues of euthanasia and the rest are never even mentioned," says Eddie 
Jones, returning to the role of Ed, which he originated in the off-Broadway 
production. He is sitting in the front row of the theater with actor Denise 
Bessette, who plays Jess, and director Kevin Kelley, and considering the scenes 
they have just finished rehearsing. "It's kinda buried in the play, but you 
know today's audiences will be thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jess, overcompensating for not attending to her father's physical decline 
while growing her sports-equipment business 2,000 miles away in Phoenix, is 
convinced that a little desert sun therapy will turn things around for Ed. "But 
his illness has gone way past that," Bessette says. "She will never capitulate, 
but as I've thought her through, it's no longer about some all-consuming guilt. 
It's about saving him. 
</P>
<P>
 "But people feel differently now about all of this, that it's best to die with 
dignity and avoid every last-ditch measure. Now, she has become un-PC, and 
it'll be interesting how she's accepted by the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jess does all of the wrong moves for all the right reasons," Kelley says, 
"which makes this play especially human and painful." 
</P>
<P>
 The just-finished rehearsal period appeared painful as well, with Kelley going 
over minute details with Jones and Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Does he always take such a micro approach -- this director who, in the past, 
has specialized in such macro dramatists as Shakespeare for the Shakespeare/LA 
company? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no," he quickly says. "There have been many days here with Eddie, Denise, 
Steven (Culp, playing Jon) and Buck (Kartalian, as neighborhood friend Dom) 
when we've taken scenes in big stretches. Other days, I'll get down to very 
particular things like actions and timing. How I feel about a scene, how it's 
developing, will change my directing approach from day to day." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Burkie" company has enjoyed both the comparatively luxurious rehearsal 
time of five weeks (compared to the customary three-to-four week process 
typical in Los Angeles theater), and the added sense of, as Bessette puts it, 
"making this production our own." 
</P>
<P>
 "Burkie" marks one of the first times in Interact's four-year history that 
company members have initiated a production of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burkie" is very different from Graham's subsequent work. Due to Graham's 
position as a resident playwright, Bessette says, "he is able to really crank 
out work, but most of it isn't traditional family drama like this play, but 
really dark, harsh stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 More like "Minor Demons," says Graham, 37, who says he has a darker streak 
than is exhibited in "Burkie," where "I was dealing with things close to my own 
life."  
</P>
<P>
 "For sure, 'Burkie' is the most personal thing I've written. I never told my 
parents about it, and then my dad read the reviews and called me and said, 'Why 
do I feel like I'm reading my damned obituary?' . . . But this shouldn't be 
taken as an autobiographical play . . . There's a rivalry going on between 
brother and sister, but that doesn't exist in my life. Jon and I are in no way 
alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the old Philadelphia streets of "Burkie" are very much those of 
Graham's neighborhood. "I'll never leave Philly, no way," says Graham. "I mean, 
I had an offer to join the staff of 'Roseanne.' But that meant moving to L.A. 
Not a chance." WHERE AND WHEN

CELEBRATING THE FEMALE ENERGY; THREE WOMEN EXPLORE THEIR INNER SELVES IN AN 
EXHIBIT AT THE NEW CANYON GALLERY IN TOPANGA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When fires raged in Southern California last fall, Minisa Crumbo of New Mexico 
called two friends -- Kristine McCallister of Topanga and Lynn Creighton of 
Northridge -- to find out how they were faring. She also learned that her 
artist friends were addressing the same theme in their work that she was in 
hers. 
</P>
<P>
 The myth about the Handless Maiden had engrossed them all. In that myth, a 
father tries to give his daughter to the devil, but she resists. As punishment, 
the devil makes the father cut off her hands. She sets out on a pilgrimage to 
reclaim them. 
</P>
<P>
 Motivated by that fable and other influences, including Clarissa Pinola Este's 
book, "Women Who Run With the Wolves," these women have chosen to take rather 
brave journeys through their own hands to find their true selves. They have 
brought their different but harmonious artistic efforts together in the show, 
"Chrysalis: Emergence of the Intrinsic Feminine," at New Canyon Gallery in 
Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us is trying to depict the myth," Creighton said. "My work is about 
women discovering that they have hands and how they are meant to be used. Hands 
are for bringing joy into our lives through what they are capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
 A ceramic artist for 30 years, Creighton started developing her figurative 
pieces only three years ago. That was just about when she became single for the 
first time in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The lissome abstract female figures of her series, "Reclaiming the Sacred 
Source" flow with a sense of strength, sensuality and genuine reverence for and 
delight in the female body. "I am speaking from my center of the individual 
ecstasy of being in your own body with yourself," Creighton said. While 
creating a figure, she "has a love affair with the form as it evolves."

 Creighton sees her work as part of the efforts of her exhibit colleagues and 
other women to "identify the source of their energy in order to be more fully 
alive in whatever they're doing. Creative energy comes out of orgasticness," 
she said, explaining that she is not referring solely to sexual experiences 
with another person, but also to such pleasures as singing and dancing. "My 
work is about women experiencing the joy of their own intrinsic nature: the 
ability to open completely to everything." 
</P>
<P>
 McCallister's paintings developed from a dream. A friend, who appeared more 
beautiful than ever in the dream, had no hands; yet, her handprints were 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So strong were the dream images, McCallister felt compelled to paint them. 
Paintings preceding those in the gallery depicted large women, the earliest 
ones without faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stuck in a quandary of expressing myself and exposing myself at the 
same time. Everything I was afraid of came out on the canvas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those faceless images have evolved into the women of such paintings as 
"Handless Dream" -- where hands abound on and around a woman -- and "Deo 
Gratias." The three figures in this painting represent the earthly body from 
the natural world, the heavenly body with its wings and halo, and a woman 
in-between. The faces of McCallister's current work seem like a blend of 
herself and her 12-year-old daughter, Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallister said she has "seen herself unfold" through this work as the women 
in it "get stronger, more at ease. It's been a path to wholeness for me as I 
try to reach deeper and deeper into the truth."  
</P>
<P>
 Crumbo delved into her Muskogee Creek Indian heritage to create the "Corn 
Maiden" series. From a body of corn, figures develop with very abstract 
references to hands. Out of this progression of portraits, the fully realized 
"Angela" emerges with hands. The image in the upper corner of this painting is 
not a cross, but the Morning Star. 
</P>
<P>
 Crumbo said that in corn -- a grain of great significance to Indian peoples -- 
"there is a being that comes in perfect harmony and balance to feed the mind, 
heart, body and spirit." Her work is "my acknowledgment of what we say -- that 
our people came from the stars. I'm depicting my star ancestry and history with 
the spirit beings through dream vision and life experience."  
</P>
<P>
 While Creighton sees our own human form as a manifestation of spirit, she also 
said that such a "spiritual connection to something larger informs us." WHERE 
AND WHEN  
</P>

A CAREER AND A PASSION; YEARS AGO, KYE PALMER WAS ON HIS WAY TO BECOMING AN 
ENGINEER. TODAY, HE MAKES HIS LIVING PLAYING JAZZ TUNES.

 Some people seem so destined to follow a particular path in life that no 
matter how ardently they may attempt to stray from it, they simply can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Take trumpeter Kye Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music is almost a primal need for me," says Palmer, 31, who plays Thursday 
with pianist Gerard Hagen's quartet at Jax. "Ever since I was 7 or 8, I have 
been so fascinated with music, and have gotten such a strong emotional 
impression from hearing it." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same Kye Palmer who, six years ago, was just about set to take his 
bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from Cal Poly Pomona and 
get a job developing computer systems with a firm in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music was what I loved, but I never saw it as a career," says Palmer, a 
native of Redlands who now lives in Long Beach. "Besides, I was good at science 
and math," and in college, those areas seemed the "natural ones" for a degree. 
Even while in school, Palmer never abandoned his favorite music, mainstream 
jazz in the be-bop/hard-bop mold. 
</P>
<P>
 But a potential full-time career in engineering -- Palmer had already worked 
as an associate engineer for McDonnell Douglas and Honeywell while an 
undergraduate -- got waylaid. Renowned Los Angeles-area trumpeter Bobby Shew, 
who had heard Palmer play as a guest with the Cal Poly jazz band, called him 
and asked if he was interested in playing with Woody Herman's big band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Yeah!' Who wouldn't be interested?" Palmer remembers asking 
rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 The years 1988 to 1990 with Herman's ghost band -- the esteemed bandleader 
died in 1987 -- proved to be prophetic for Palmer. Primarily, he jump-cut to 
another career: music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first professional experience where I was making my living as a 
musician every day," he says. "And I haven't worked a job in engineering 
since," he laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing with the Herman ensemble, which was led by saxophonist Frank Tiberi 
and was then touring four and five months at a crack, raised Palmer's 
performance level several notches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real eye-opener," he says. "I could never have learned on my own 
what I learned with that band. When you're practicing, most of the time no one 
is listening so it's not the same kind of pressure you have in front of an 
audience. When you get used to that pressure and distraction, and start playing 
as well as you do in practice, then your playing goes way up." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer still appears occasionally with the Herman band, but mostly works in 
Southern California, where he performs steadily. The jobs might range from 
playing at Disneyland with a marching band or an R&B unit to guesting with a 
Dixieland band led by Eddie Reed in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He says that while he doesn't play a lot of strictly jazz jobs, he still gets 
to play a lot of jazz. One of his favorite jobs is with Hagen, an Orange 
County-based pianist who has been leading a quartet with Palmer, bassist Chris 
Colangelo and drummer Kevin Tullius for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the way we synthesize originals with standards like 'Body and Soul,' " 
says Palmer, who names Clifford Brown and Freddie Hubbard as his principal 
influences. "With a standard, you can tell where things are going, but pieces 
by, say, Kevin, are more modern, and you have to be more intuitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen's pianistic approach intrigues Palmer. "He's different," says the 
trumpeter. "He's a very flowing player who doesn't just run the chord changes, 
and the tunes we play showcase his strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer is yet another Southern California resident who studied jazz 
improvisation with Charlie Shoemake, the vibist who now lives in Cambria but 
who ran a jazz studio in Sherman Oaks from 1974 to 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 1,500 or so people that studied with me, Kye was one of those 20 or 25 
players that was really important, who understood the music," Shoemake says. 
</P>
<P>
 The trumpeter looks forward to the day when he'll lead his own band, playing 
his own music. "My long term goal is to put something together that 
communicates what I want to say, something from the be-bop and hard-bop 
tradition but with an individual sound," he says. WHERE AND WHEN  
</P>
<P>
 Who: Kye Palmer is featured with the Gerard Hagen quartet.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; LOOKING FOR A GOOD NEIGHBOR; CANOGA PARK EFFORT IS UNDER 
WAY TO CONVERT A CLOSED X-RATED THEATER INTO A COMMUNITY PERFORMING ARTS 
CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When the Madrid Theater opened in what is now Canoga Park in 1926, the owners 
boasted about its beautiful Spanish decor and modern equipment. The Glad 'n 
Nell Sweet Shoppe in the storefront next door provided refreshments for patrons 
of film, stage and vaudeville attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners also promised that only the best films, like the opening feature, 
"Across the Pacific," starring Monte Blue, would be shown. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater at 21622 Sherman Way hasn't always lived up to those great 
expectations. For decades, it has been the Park Pussycat Theatre, showing only 
X-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
 But a community effort is under way to convert the earthquake-damaged building 
with a checkered past into a multipurpose performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 James Domine, music director of the West Valley Symphony Orchestra, is among 
those spearheading an effort to acquire the theater, which would be run by a 
nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strongest asset is that the people in the community really want it," 
Domine said. "Everybody likes the idea. If I had a million bucks, I'd just buy 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly this is a win-win situation," said Karen Constine, chief of staff 
for City Councilwoman Laura Chick. "This would return a legitimate art house to 
the community and remove an undesirable one. No one wants an X-rated theater in 
a commercial shopping area." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Hartsfield of Walnut Properties, which owns the location, said the 
company would like to sell the property but, "we haven't gotten into any heavy 
dialogue. We gave them a price, and they haven't come back yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday voted to set aside $30,000 in next 
year's budget to study the possibility of converting the facility into a 
performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, one of the oldest buildings in Canoga Park, has been closed since 
being severely damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. Cost for repair and seismic 
upgrade work alone has been put at about $500,000, Domine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley greatly needs a theater of this size and type, he 
said. The 400-seat theater could be expanded because it originally had 600 
seats. The only indoor venues in the Valley of comparable size are the 
Mainstage Theater at Pierce College, which seats 375, and the Campus Theatre at 
CSUN, which can accommodate 400. Domine said many ensembles vie for performance 
dates at the Pierce facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater/community center project and other ideas will be on the agenda at 
a revitalization planning workshop for the Canoga Park and Reseda communities 
that Chick's office is sponsoring June 3 and 4, Constine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Constine estimated that it would cost between $700,000 and $1 million to buy 
and convert the theater into a multipurpose community arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing about it is that it would be multipurpose, used by a variety 
of different groups," Constine said, adding that the theater might serve as the 
centerpiece for the revitalization of the entire commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pussycat Theatre has been perceived as a lightning rod for criminal 
activity. In 1991, after police had made 96 arrests in the theater for lewd 
conduct during the previous two years, the city filed a lawsuit under the 
California Red Light Abatement Act to force the theater owners to cooperate 
with police to reduce crime at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Gene Leary of the West Valley Vice Unit said the theater reached an 
agreement with the city attorney's office to increase lighting, hire an on-site 
security guard and have regular police inspections. The agreement resulted in a 
reduction in lewd conduct arrests, but also reduced business. 
</P>
<P>
 "TRIAL" RUN: When Woodland Hills Community Theatre's production of Saul 
Levitt's "The Andersonville Trial" opens tonight, it will be the company's 
first show under an Actors' Equity contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic director Jon Berry said the move to Equity production is being made 
to gain credibility for the company as a "professional" entity rather than to 
upgrade the quality of the company's work. It is the only way for the company 
to get noticed in the crowded Los Angeles theater scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get reviewed. I want to have more people know that we have a 
theater out here. People in the area know about us. I'd like to have people 
Downtown know about us. I'd like to be one of the premiere theaters in Los 
Angeles," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Equity contract requires that a bond be posted and that union work rules 
be followed for the cast, Berry said. Additionally, at least one acting union 
member must be paid union wages for the performances.  
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills Community Theatre staged its first production in 1986 and 
incorporated as a nonprofit house in 1989. The company rents theater space from 
the Canoga Park Methodist Church and has almost 200 season ticket-holders.  
</P>
<P>
 For its first Equity production, Berry chose an ambitious project, a period 
costume piece with a cast of 30. 
</P>
<P>
 When the play was first produced on Broadway in 1959 it starred George C. 
Scott and was directed by Jose Ferrer. Years later, Scott directed an 
award-winning production of the play for PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 The story deals with the 1865 trial of Henry Wirz, who was the commander of a 
Confederate prison for Northern soldiers during the Civil War.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Andersonville Trial" opens at 8 tonight, with regular performances at 8 
p.m. Fridays and Saturdays through June 18. Matinee performances will be at 
2:30 p.m. May 29 and June 12. Tickets are $15 general, $13 seniors and 
students. Call (818) 884-1907.

COVER STORY; A NATURAL SETTING; STRIPPED OF THEIR INHIBITIONS, NUDISTS AT 
ELYSIUM FIELDS IN TOPANGA CANYON SAY THE SAFE ENVIRONMENT SETS THEM FREE. THE 
CAMP HAS ENDURED SINCE 1968 DESPITE EFFORTS TO SHUT IT DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On warm weekends, its grassy, eucalyptus-scented grounds are covered with 
naked men and women. Waitresses and teachers mingle with affluent couples and 
aging hipsters, their tanned bodies glistening in the sun. Some play tennis in 
nothing but sneakers. Others skinny-dip in the pool. Children romp across the 
lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 With the passage of time, the Elysium Fields nudist camp in Topanga Canyon is 
more quaint than risque. A product of the sexual revolution of the 1960s, it 
has survived prudish neighbors, prayer vigils outside its gates, and, until 
recently, persistent efforts by Los Angeles County officials to close it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few of the nation's 100 or so nudist camps have fallen on bad 
times, Elysium Fields -- like nude recreation generally -- thrives. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp, where sex is prohibited, has become a popular venue for 
self-awareness experts spreading the New Age gospel. Parents take their kids 
there to explain the birds and bees. Women who wouldn't be caught in a singles 
bar swear by the secluded, eight-acre compound as a place to meet quality men. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were hoping for and fighting for in the '60s, people are more 
comfortable doing now," said Ed Lange, Elysium's 72-year-old founder and a 
former Life magazine photographer. Sitting on a veranda overlooking his domain, 
wrapped in a towel as a concession to the weather, Lange resembles a professor 
who has just stepped out of the shower. He is among the movement's elder 
statesmen, having spent four decades trying to demystify the nudist way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 As the publisher of nudist books and magazines, Lange has fought numerous 
legal battles, including one that led to a 1956 U.S. Supreme Court decision 
that granted second-class mailing privileges to nudist publications. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1950s, he persuaded Eastman Kodak to change its policy of refusing 
to return prints of nudes that were sent for developing. Later, he successfully 
challenged the publishers of Look magazine after they took exception to him 
calling one of his publications Nude Look. 
</P>
<P>
 He even scandalized daytime TV viewers in the early '60s by appearing -- fully 
clothed -- on "Art Linkletter's House Party" to promote the lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 26 years, his focus, and the source of his pride, has been 
Elysium Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled below a hill at the end of a tree-lined back road, Elysium is a rustic 
Shangri-La where visitors are encouraged to shed their problems along with 
their attire. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign on a towel rack beside the steam bath reads, "Leave Your Hang-ups 
Here." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no loudspeakers, televisions or radios. Patrons are invited to get 
in touch with their senses, to smell the grass, enjoy the fresh air, count the 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 On sunny weekends, when crowds number in the hundreds, the grounds are filled 
with couples and families with lunches spread on picnic blankets. People read, 
meditate, sunbathe, throw Frisbees. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a park scene like any other, except that, for the most part, the 
participants aren't wearing clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet eroticism is strangely absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small bits of clothing are far more seductive than nudity can ever be," 
explains a divorced fashion model, lounging in a lawn chair, her chin resting 
on her knees. She brings her young daughter whenever possible. "If I wanted to 
be leered at, I'd go to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Although uninhibited among themselves, many nudists remain wary about 
revealing their lifestyle to others, noting the lingering stigma associated 
with it. The model, for instance, didn't want her name revealed for fear that 
it would complicate a child custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think nudists were wackos," says Paul Stevens, 82, a Woodland Hills 
pharmacist who began coming to Elysium with his wife in the late 1960s and has 
continued since her death 10 years ago. "It's easy to ridicule something that 
you don't know anything about." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other nudists, he extols the lifestyle for its ability to break down 
ordinary social barriers. "Communication is easier when you're naked," he said. 
"Out of their uniforms, people are on a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 He tells of once talking to a pleasant man from England named Alex for nearly 
an hour "right here where you see me now" and not learning until later that he 
was Alex Comfort, the noted biologist and author of "The Joy of Sex." 
</P>
<P>
 In the pool with Stevens this day was a brain surgeon, a prominent child 
psychologist and a former National Geographic photographer on his first visit 
to the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Kaufman, the newcomer, had brought his 5-year-old daughter to attend 
one of the numerous "clothed" events hosted by Elysium throughout the year. 
When his daughter insisted on swimming, he shed his clothes and joined her. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't meet any strange, weird or questionable characters," he said. "Nor 
did I see it in anybody's eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 An oasis of tranquillity where the two most common status symbols -- cars and 
clothes -- have no currency, Elysium seems an unlikely target for the kind of 
campaign that forced Lange to spend an estimated $1 million in legal fees in 
order to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 "A less determined person would have walked away a long time ago," said Los 
Angeles criminal attorney Stanley Fleishman, whose clients, besides Lange, have 
included the publishers of Henry Miller novels and the exhibitors of the movie 
"Deep Throat." "Ed has stuck to his guns because of his beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Not until early last year, following a series of court reversals, did the 
county finally recognize the camp's right to exist. A political realignment in 
1991 had removed Elysium from the district of County Supervisor Michael 
Antonovich, a longtime foe. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp's troubles began almost as soon as it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints from neighbors, deputies arrested Lange and two dozen 
other nudists on successive weekends in 1968, charging them with indecent 
exposure under a 29-year-old county law. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lange waged a successful legal battle to overturn the law, the county 
used zoning changes in an attempt to drum Elysium out of business. When that 
tactic also failed, the supervisors -- led by Antonovich -- asserted that the 
property was seismically unsafe to accommodate visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the complaints once lodged against the camp border on the comical. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Rohde, a Los Angeles civil attorney, still chuckles when recalling a 
courtroom exchange with an Elysium detractor, a woman whose house bordered the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'After dinner parties, do you take guests up to the attic with 
binoculars to peer over the eucalyptus trees?,' and she said, 'We don't do it 
all the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although some neighbors still object to the nudist camp, local opposition has 
largely melted away. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Topanga Chamber of Commerce whose members once shunned Elysium now 
use its clubhouse for their functions. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the stuff that our opponents imagined was hidden was revealed to be 
nonsense," Lange said. "I didn't have a tail and horns and there were no orgies 
being conducted on the grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange became fascinated with nudism as a teen-ager growing up in Chicago after 
buying an early nudist magazine, Sunshine & Health, under the counter at a 
drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other young men drawn to the magazine because it was the only 
publication at the time to offer an unimpeded view of the female anatomy, he 
was more interested in the articles than the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resented guys in school who were only out to (score), and I resented girls 
who were only out to find a lifetime meal ticket," he said. "Unhealthy 
attitudes about sex and the human body seemed to drive each group." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoning Chicago along with his strict Baptist upbringing, Lange moved to 
Los Angeles in 1940. He found work as a set designer and free-lance 
photographer and renewed his interest in nudism just when one of the movement's 
pioneer West Coast leaders came under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Besieged by hostile newspaper accounts and under pressure from authorities, 
Lura Glassey was on the brink of losing her popular Elysia nudist park in the 
hills above Tujunga in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Herald-Express printed stories hinting at "unspeakable orgies" 
behind the "impenetrable walls" of Elysia. In 1939, county supervisors passed a 
law effectively prohibiting the practice of nudism in the county -- the same 
law that Lange was later responsible for overturning. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply, Elysia's female members took to wearing G-strings. But when an 
unsuspecting sunbather dropped hers to go skinny-dipping, sheriff's deputies, 
peering through binoculars, swooped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Glassey was arrested. As her case languished in court, she was forced to sell 
the property and close the nudist park. Through the ordeal, Lange was one of 
her strongest supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me angry," he said. "From that point on, my dream was to some day 
open my own camp and do something to improve conditions for nudists." 
</P>
<P>
 The nudist philosophy is simple: To be nude is to be natural. It isn't that 
nudists are opposed to clothes. They simply believe that clothing restricts the 
full enjoyment of nature and outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite adage is: "Clothed when practical, unclothed when possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Once regarded as nut-eating, berry-chewing exercise fanatics and treated as 
social lepers (outsiders often even referred to their gathering places as 
"colonies"), nudists by tradition have tended to be socially conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement was created in an environment of fear where to acknowledge that 
you were a sexual being was to imply that you were a pervert of some kind," 
Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his former wife, June, set about to change what Lange refers to as 
nudism's "puritanical streak" when they formed the Sundial Club for nudists out 
of their Hollywood apartment in the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the movement were dismayed when a stunningly attractive club member, 
Diane Webber, posed for Playboy and later became one of the most photographed 
female sex icons of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Nudist sensitivities were also tested with the opening of Elysium Fields, with 
its more libertine rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Elysium allowed touching, frowned upon at other camps. Professional masseurs, 
unheard of in the nudist world at the time, were added to the staff. And 
Elysium was designated as "clothing optional," a departure from camps that 
required guests to disrobe before getting past the entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say such changes have helped make nudism more acceptable to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place represents a different attitude toward sexuality," said Art 
Kunkin, who gained notoriety in the '60s as founder of the Los Angeles Free 
Press, the nation's first underground newspaper. He works for Lange part time 
as publisher of Journal of the Senses, an Elysium quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a full-fledged nudist ("I'll take off my clothes to go in the 
pool"), Kunkin was attracted to Elysium as a kind of truce zone where men and 
women relate to each other without being caught up in the sexually infused 
gamesmanship involving fashion and possessions. "People here aren't abusing one 
another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the example of Esalen Institute, the personal development center 
near Big Sur, Lange introduced a curriculum of personal growth seminars -- 
including yoga, diet and fitness experts, psychological counselors and 
herbalists -- and promoted them in his own as well as non-nudist publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elysium has been on the cutting edge in any number of ways," said Debra 
Peterson, an official with the American Sunbathing Assn., the nation's largest 
nudist group, with 44,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 Long content to keep a low profile, that group now actively promotes nudism by 
sending speakers to civic clubs and to trade and travel conventions, places 
Peterson insists "would have been out of the question just a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 At Elysium, the membership roll recently topped a record 1,400, and Lange 
anticipates a new growth spurt now that the threat of closure has dissipated.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like nudist camps everywhere, Elysium strives to keep a balance between men 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's established that if the balance gets out of kilter, both men and women 
start to feel uncomfortable," says Norm Swirin, a librarian who moonlights as 
the camp's tennis coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp leaders say that currently, 65% of members are men. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a requirement, male enrollees are encouraged to bring their wives 
and girlfriends, with discounts provided for couples. Besides the $200 annual 
dues, members pay daily grounds fees that range from $8 to $11, depending on 
the season and the day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sessions for prospective new members are held three times a week. A staff 
member gives the newcomers a tour, lays down what few rules there are ("Don't 
violate others' personal space; use a towel when sitting") and tactfully seeks 
to weed out voyeurs from those genuinely interested in nudism. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the weather is lousy, a few people usually show up. 
</P>
<P>
 On one such day recently, a weekday morning, three men came, including Don, a 
young UCLA graduate student, and Carl, a retired insurance salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Don said he learned of the place after meeting a young woman at a shopping 
mall who had an Elysium bumper sticker on her car. By the end of the day, he 
was eager to share the experience with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl, who was visiting from Florida, had slipped away from his wife on the 
pretext of sightseeing. And that was exactly what he was doing. "She wouldn't 
go for this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Lesley, Elysium's executive coordinator, insists that people who come 
for the wrong reasons usually don't return. "They see what goes on and the type 
of people here and we usually don't see them again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesley, a former ballet dancer, recalls her first day at Elysium 10 years ago 
with mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressed from the demands of motherhood and her job as a network TV censor, 
she had been admonished by a doctor to find somewhere to unwind. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend suggested Elysium Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You're kidding, how do you get naked with a whole bunch of people?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Her first husband, the late film director Nicholas Ray, had been a private 
nudist, shedding his clothes after coming home from work the way some people 
toss their shoes. It was not something she cared for. 
</P>
<P>
 But her friend was persistent. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls mustering the courage to walk out of Elysium's ladies room after 
disrobing. "I whispered, 'Let's go somewhere up the hill where nobody will 
notice us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the stack of TV scripts she had brought from the office were abandoned. 
"I discovered for the first time in my life the pleasure of being totally 
unfettered, like a baby," she recalled. "It was extremely liberating." WHERE TO

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: RESALE HABIT; CONSIGNMENT STORES CAN MAKE TOP DESIGNS 
AFFORDABLE. BUT LARGE SIZES ARE RARE, AND SHOPPING THERE CAN BE ADDICTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When speaking to a group of women on the joys of resale shopping, I always ask 
for a show of hands of those who regularly shop at the many resale stores we 
have in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Invariably, the hands that go up belong to those ladies who are the 
best-dressed in the room. And why shouldn't they be? They have a selection of 
haute couture and top designs from all over the world to choose from at the 
growing number of consignment stores. 
</P>
<P>
 From Encino to Studio City on Ventura Boulevard you'll find a wonderful 
selection of these stores, and it can be a grand day of shopping for that 
special-occasion outfit or just to replenish the wardrobe. One of the latest 
additions is Forever Young, which was once a part of Winnick's Furs, but now is 
a whole new operation under the aegis of Lisa Zohar. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it not for resale, how else could the average shopper afford to own a 
Gianni Versace purple suede jacket with gold beadwork originally priced at 
$2,800? In perfect condition and in a medium size, the tag at Forever Young 
reads $379. It has that never-worn look; perhaps it was a gift and the 
recipient was not the purple-with-gold type. But someone out there will adore 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 One favorite was a pink and black linen Valentino dress, Size 12, for only 
$129; originally it sold for $700. Can't get through the summer without a good 
white jacket? Here's an Isaac Mizrahi white linen jacket for $169. A print sun 
dress with a matching jacket, also by Mizrahi, in a Size 6, sells for $269 -- 
considerably less than the original $800. Good in any season would be a 
Christian Lacroix Size 8 brown jacket with gorgeous rhinestone buttons for $398 
(new $1,900).  
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Bob Mackie is a name we all know but few of us can afford to own. 
However, for $249, you can have this esteemed designer's silk dinner suit in a 
gorgeous cobalt blue -- if a Size 6 will fit. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings up the chief drawback in shopping resale -- most of the inventory 
in these stores is from Size 4 to Size 14. There are very few garments larger 
than a 14 and not many of those, which just confirms what we already know. The 
rich are thin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turn then to the accessories, particularly handbags. The finest in my wardrobe 
are from resale stores. Good leather only gets better with age, remember? 
</P>
<P>
 At Forever Young, a Louis Vuitton satchel that originally sold for $400 was in 
perfect shape and priced at $149, and a white Hermes handbag can be yours for 
$499 -- not cheap, but a lot better than the original $1,700 price. Or how 
about a Furla bag for $39 instead of $139? 
</P>
<P>
 A word of warning about shopping resale -- it definitely is addictive. Once 
the feel and fit of a Chanel or an Ungaro or a Claude Montana gets to you, 
you're hooked. Let the owner of any resale shop you visit know who your 
favorite designers are so that when items come in -- as they do every day -- 
you can be notified. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're bringing apparel in to Forever Young to sell, it must be in perfect 
condition and no more than 2 years old; when it has been sold, you get 50% of 
the selling price. 
</P>

NOTHING BUT FUN IN MIND AT REBAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wednesdays are KROQ nights at Rebar, a Woodland Hills dance club that attracts 
a large crowd with nothing but fun on the agenda. By 10:30 p.m., there's a 
half-hour wait to get in the door -- so get there early. The club, open from 9 
p.m. to 1:45 a.m., has a $5 cover. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: The club packs a lot into a little, so dancers should expect to 
bump shoulders once in a while on the tiny dance floor. Bottles of domestic 
beer are sold in a corner at a slightly lower price than at the one large bar. 
Tables and bar stools crowd the rest of the space, providing room for any 
conversation that can be heard over the roar of the music. Several video 
monitors hang from the ceiling, but they only show about one music video an 
hour. Club-goers judge weekly themed contests, including dance, tattoo and sexy 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The 21- to 32-year-olds have an almost-anything-goes dress code. 
Styles range from jeans and shorts to leather and flowered baby-doll dresses. 
Everybody seems to know everybody else, but newcomers fit right in. Attitude is 
in low concentration and, unlike at most clubs, the men as well as the women 
are comfortable dancing solo. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: KROQ DJ Richard Blade keeps the crowd dancing each Wednesday to 
alternative music with techno and industrial rock mixed in. Artists range from 
Depeche Mode and Berlin to Ned's Atomic Dustbin and Nine Inch Nails. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: "Sometimes we come here not caring what we look like or how we're 
dressed," said Heather Edmondson, 24, a CSUN student. "We look like we're just 
here to have fun. At other clubs, if you weren't like totally hot, the chicks 
would look at you like, 'What is she doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it a lot. It's not like a meat market, it's not sleazy," said Donald 
Gutterman, 23, a regular for two years. "The people are not here to scam, they 
just like to dance. It's a comfortable place." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: "The only thing it needs is more industrial music. And better-looking 
men," said Barbara Wood, 26, a CSUN student. "I mean, I know all the guys here, 
we're all family." 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "Hey, babe, you got killer hair, is it all natural?" one Casanova 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 CAPITALIST ALERT: One recurring theme -- the San Fernando Valley is sorely 
lacking in alternative-music clubs, and, as one woman said, "the rest of the 
Valley is square." Said Nicole Guerrero, 25: "If someone wants to make a lot of 
money, they'd duplicate this place. We bring 12 to 30 people here at a time."

FORGING A NEW IDENTITY; EDITORS OF JUXT HOPE TO DISPEL THE STEREOTYPE THEY SAY 
HAS BEEN CREATED BY THE TERM 'GENERATION X.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a MacIntosh home computer and a little help from her friends, 25-year-old 
Hillarie Waadt is on a mission to change the label leveled at her generation. 
</P>
<P>
 X doesn't mark the spot for this Sherman Oaks native. 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent release of the magazine's second issue, Juxt -- kind of an 
anti-Generation X publication aimed at those born between 1961 and 1981 -- 
Waadt is fighting what she feels is an apathetic stereotype thrust on her age 
group by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all so different and that is what we have in common as a generation," 
said Waadt, who refuses to even use the term "Generation X." 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are going to separate us by generation, they should come up with 
new criteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Peters, 29, the magazine's co-publisher and co-editor, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People of our age group hate the label so much that if they hear it they tune 
out," Peters said. "It sounds like an experiment gone awry, and that just isn't 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Their solution was to start Juxt -- short for juxtaposition -- which offers 
its target audience everything from political interviews to poetry to open 
letters to President Clinton, in about 50 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 They describe it as a "compilation of friends' work." 
</P>
<P>
 "The value of the project is the subject matter," said Peters, who grew up in 
Studio City and graduated from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. "There 
is no real representative voice for the post-baby boomers and there is a lot of 
slanted media regarding this generation." 
</P>
<P>
 In the May issue, articles range from an obituary of an artist who died in the 
Northridge Meadows apartment collapse to a story on the trend of computerized 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the yuppie crowd, nobody is going to get rich from this venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Waadt's stepfather and father have funded the last two issues, and 
contributors to the magazine get paid in cookies. "It's kind of piecemeal," 
Waadt admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Waadt, who grew up in the Valley and attended Grant High School, took the high 
school proficiency exam and left for Los Angeles Valley College at 15. Recently 
she decided to leave her studies for a year to concentrate on Juxt. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of friends, 5,000 copies of the May issue will eventually be 
distributed, twice the amount of the first issue that came out in December, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Valley, copies are distributed on Melrose Avenue and 
Beverly Drive, as well as on college campuses and to a few nightclubs in Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a do-it-yourself distribution center," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day the May issue came out, Waadt sped around the Valley in her Bronco 
truck, stopping off at hangouts favored by hipsters such as the Boom Boom Room, 
a funky coffeehouse and deli in Valley Village. With 1930s music playing in the 
background and a few customers seated at small tables, Waadt rushed in and 
placed her magazines next to L.A. Weekly and Bam. 
</P>
<P>
 After she left, Phil Downey, 26, a Boom Boom Room regular, picked up a copy 
while downing a quick cup of coffee.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is really a cool mag," Downey said. "It's not like LA Weekly where 
everyone is so politically correct. They don't follow those guidelines, and do 
a lot of risk-taking." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is the little things that Downey likes most about Juxt. In the current 
issue, it is an offbeat poem about cereal. "The thing that made me laugh was 
the 'Eau d'Cereal.' It starts off being really deep and ended up being about 
cereal," Downey said. "Simple, yet risky. I like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, during an afternoon break at Insomnia Cafe, a stone's throw from where 
she grew up, Waadt sits back on an old red velvet couch and indulges in what 
she calls "artistic decadence": lots of coffee and all-natural cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 With her long blond hair, green eyes and an athletic build, she still has that 
Valley Girl look, a label she accepts more comfortably than the Generation X 
tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my turf, so I feel more comfortable here," she said, tossing back her 
hair. "Because I'm from the Valley, the magazine is not quite as urban. It's 
more relaxed . . . Less dismal than if I had grown up in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Her less-than-serious approach is evident, especially when it comes to 
defining her generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should break up generations by which video games they played when they 
were young," she joked. "I grew up with Pong, and then there was Atari and 
Nintendo."  
</P>
<P>
 As with any budding project, Waadt and Peters ran into problems early on. The 
Jan. 17 earthquake delayed the second issue by a month, and in August, 1993, 
the pair ended a professional relationship with a third partner over the 
direction of the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Juxt survives on advertising from local merchants as well as Kinkos and 
Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
 Both issues have been mailed to Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and 
congressmen "of our generation," Peters said, such as U.S. Representatives Cleo 
Fields, 31 (D-Louisiana) and Richard Pombo, 33 (R-California). 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been no response. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Leaders) don't ask questions of people of our generation who have something 
to say; they go to people who are Beavis and Butt-head fans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle to win a good name for their generation is not an easy one, but 
seeing their message get across is sometimes good enough for Waadt.  
</P>
<P>
 "The cool thing is to hand it to someone and have them start reading it cover 
to cover because they like it," she said. WHERE TO GO

 Brandyn Barbara Artis never expected to have breast cancer. Although her 
grandmother died of the disease at age 35, Artis, a willowy singer-actress, 
didn't think she fit the profile of a breast cancer patient. After all, she 
told herself, she was young; she watched what she ate; she exercised; she took 
good care of herself.  
</P>
<P>
 But in 1987, a lump in her breast turned out to be malignant. "I thought they 
had confused me with another little black lady someplace," said Artis, who 
doesn't reveal her age because now she knows that breast cancer can strike any 
woman. "I said, 'This can't be right! How can this be happening?' " 
</P>
<P>
 During the next several months as she underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy, 
Artis poured her feelings of fear, anger and dread into a journal. Those 
journal entries became the basis for the play, "Sister, Girl," which premiered 
at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in 1991. The full-length, one-woman play 
chronicles her battle with -- and victory over -- breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Artis will perform "Sister, Girl" as the centerpiece of a seminar titled 
"Breast Health: Myths. Truths. Survival," Saturday at Encino-Tarzana Regional 
Medical Center. The event will include lectures and workshops on developments 
in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as mammography, hormonal 
replacement therapy and breast reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Artis said she aims to show there is life after a cancer diagnosis -- but the 
women who can most benefit from the performance often refuse to attend. "They 
don't want to come out and see something like this because they don't want to 
be reminded," she said. "They don't want to face it. But theater should push a 
button. The play runs the gamut of emotions: People laugh; they cry; they 
connect." 
</P>
<P>
 One in nine women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime, according to 
the American Cancer Society. This year, about 180,000 women in the United 
States will be found to have the disease, and about 46,000 will die from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are frightening," said Mary Cirricione, a registered nurse who is 
coordinating the breast health seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breast cancer will touch more and more of our lives. Our goal is to bring the 
newest information to women who are dealing with or recovering from breast 
cancer, as well as to women who live in fear of it. We will break down the 
myths and give the hard-core facts, and we will present all sides of the issues 
that have hit the press lately, such as implants and mammography for women in 
their 40s." 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians and nurses will discuss new screening methods such as stereotactic 
mammography, which combines mammogram and needle biopsy and provides results 
within 24 hours. Currently, if a mammogram appears suspicious, a woman may have 
to wait at least two weeks to undergo and receive the results of a hospital 
biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a huge base of information on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment 
-- and there is a huge pool of women who would benefit from the information," 
said Dr. Avrum Bluming, an Encino oncologist and cancer researcher. He will 
talk about studies on the timing of breast cancer surgery (survival rates seem 
to improve when surgery coincides with ovulation, according to Bluming) and 
estrogen replacement for post-menopausal women who have undergone a mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual breast self-exam demonstrations will be offered for any woman who 
would like private instruction. "A lot of times doctors ask women, 'Do you 
check your breasts?' and the women answer, 'Yeah, I guess so,' " said Gail 
Stell, a registered nurse who will lead the 20-minute lessons. "But women don't 
really know what to look for or how to do it. I teach them to palpate all areas 
of their breast tissue so they can practice breast self-exam confidently and 
competently." 
</P>
<P>
 Cirricione said that women who attend the program should walk away armed with 
knowledge -- and hope. "Our purpose is to give women the information they need 
to survive," she said. WHERE AND WHEN

RESTAURANT REVIEW; DIVERSITY IN THE DESERT; THE VARIED BISTRO MENU AT BAKERY 
EXPRESS INCLUDES SAVORY ANTIPASTOS, CRUSTY BREADS AND RICH DESSERTS.

<P>
 The spirit is willing at Bakery Express Cafe. The flesh, unless otherwise 
specified, is medium well. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that this Palmdale establish ment -- owned by Bob and Linda 
Ginsburg, a couple with an obvious passion for cooking -- isn't a star in the 
Antelope Valley restaurant constellation. Its only real rival up here, in terms 
of creativity, is the estimable Downtown Cakes and Company in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Cakes and Company actually led me to Bakery Express, because I 
included it in a couple of Valley Top 20 restaurant lists, and in doing so 
provoked a flood of letters in praise of Bakery Express Cafe. So I phoned the 
place and asked what sort of restaurant it was. Bob Ginsburg hemmed and hawed, 
and finally characterized it as a "continental bistro."  
</P>
<P>
 Now that I've eaten here, I understand why he hesitated. No designation, 
except perhaps the overworked "eclectic," would do justice to the Ginsburgs' 
highly personal style, which spans a territory from northern Italy to the 
American Southwest. These people cook what they like -- terrific breads, 
oddball appetizers, meat-rich main dishes and sumptuous desserts -- but in so 
individual a manner that it defies category. 
</P>
<P>
 Be prepared for a serious whiteout on entering. This brightly lit place has 
white wood walls, white tabletops and white chairs. The dazzle of the walls is 
broken only by posters of things designed to make you hungry -- pasta shapes, 
green onions -- and a decorative assortment of wicker baskets. The seating is a 
little tight, but the room is so cheerful that you probably won't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 One appetizer deserving praise is the fried cheese antipasto plate. Its rounds 
of soft goat cheese and sticks of pungent smoked mozzarella are lightly breaded 
and fried warm and soft. The garnish is artichokes, roasted peppers and a 
punchy heap of sun-dried tomato pesto. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is the New Orleans garlic shrimp, which looks and tastes suspiciously 
like something you get in a New England chowder house under the name of baked 
stuffed shrimp. Imagine four medium shrimp, baked in a scallop shell in a bath 
of buttery, garlic-flavored bread crumbs. You'll be scraping the crumbs off the 
shell, mainly to capture the faint flavors of sherry and chopped green onions 
in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Fried homemade ravioli is a dish popular in St. Louis, although here the 
ravioli are filled with spinach and ricotta instead of ground meat. And here, 
alas, the dough has been rolled too thick. The best thing on the plate is a 
fine sauce made from fire-roasted poblano chiles -- even if the sauce and 
ravioli filling do clash mightily. Let's call this a noble failure.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the entrees, some of the meats are distinctly overcooked. Beef 
bourguignonne, for instance, comes in a pretty little crock topped with an 
attractive crust of whipped potatoes. But the beef inside is frazzled onto the 
sides.  
</P>
<P>
 A nice center-cut pork chop has those same good potatoes, plus a tart green 
apple puree and a thick, creamy pan gravy to embellish it. Too bad we hadn't 
yet figured out that the kitchen's vice is overcooking, because we got it dry 
and tough. This would probably be an excellent dish if you asked for it medium. 
 
</P>
<P>
 One evening the chef's mixed grill was chicken, shrimp, salmon and Italian 
sausage, and all of them would have benefited from less time on the range. But 
oddly, given the American tendency to overcook pasta, our wild mushroom and 
chicken linguine escaped the wrath of the stove. The noodles came with a nice 
al dente texture, the hearty chicken and mushroom topping was soft and 
flavorful.  
</P>
<P>
 The fire-roasted chile on the cheese appetizer plate also turns up as a main 
dish, stuffed with a curious mixture of minced chicken, various Mexican cheeses 
and Southwestern spices. I find it tasty but rather mushy. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no problem when it comes to breads or desserts. Linda Ginsburg appears 
to be a top-notch baker, as attested by her tender, yeasty wheat bread and 
crusty country white bread, served with all meals. Her dessert case, too, is 
filled with rich pastries.  
</P>
<P>
 The best of them might be the exemplary strawberry-rhubarb cobbler. Light 
eaters can order a lemon souffle, but if you want rich, they've got that too. 
Pineapple macadamia nut cheesecake has a dense cheese filling, while turtle 
torte is a fudgy pie laced with caramel and pieces of pecan. WHERE AND WHEN

HIT-AND-RUN DEATHS ANGER NEIGHBORHOOD; TRAGEDY: MARIA AND AMALIA GODOY WERE 
KILLED AT A BUSY INTERSECTION WHERE RESIDENTS HAD PETITIONED FOR A TRAFFIC 
LIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents living near the Pacoima intersection where a woman and her 
12-year-old daughter were killed by a hit-and-run driver had complained for 
years that the corner was dangerous to pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, city transportation officials agreed to begin installing traffic 
signals at the intersection of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Montague Street next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors say they are angry the improvement comes too late to save the 
lives of Maria Godoy, 48, and her daughter, Amalia, who were struck by a car 
while crossing the unmarked intersection Wednesday night on their way home from 
a relative's house. They were pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Godoy's 13-year-old son, Marco, who was also walking home, avoided being hit 
because he stopped to tie his shoe before stepping into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should have never gotten to this point," said Paula Aguilar, who led the 
campaign to install signals there. "I called and called and they said, 'You 
have to wait your turn.' And now this." 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged driver of the car, Fernando Bengoechea, 23, of Arleta, turned 
himself in to Los Angeles police shortly before midnight Wednesday, about four 
hours after the accident. He has been charged with two counts of manslaughter, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Godoy and her daughter were carrying cooking pots containing their 
dinner as they walked home from a relative's house nearby, according to family 
members. When they reached the intersection, they waited for a break in traffic 
and began to cross.  
</P>
<P>
 Marco stayed behind to tie his shoe and waved to thank the driver who had 
stopped for them, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maria and Amalia began crossing, another motorist -- who police allege was 
Bengoechea -- swerved from behind the first driver, striking the mother and 
daughter with a force that knocked them 140 feet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that the driver did not slow down after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the corner was marked with paper flowers, balloons and black 
ribbons wrapped around light poles. Throughout the day, friends and family 
members added to the impromptu memorial and talked about the battle for a 
traffic signal at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it a shame it took this?" asked one woman. "A mother and daughter die, 
and now we'll get our stoplight." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, residents of the neighborhood collected about 300 signatures for a 
petition that urged the city to place a signal at the corner. Neighbors said 
the petition was given twice to an aide of former City Councilman Ernardi 
Bernardi because one set of petitions was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors had been particularly concerned for students attending nearby 
Montague Street Elementary School, as well as for pedestrians crossing the 
intersection to reach a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of their efforts, the city's Transportation Department had 
completed the necessary steps for putting a stoplight at the intersection, 
according to an internal city memo. Those steps included a study of vehicle and 
pedestrian traffic, a review of reported accidents and a survey of the area's 
existing traffic signals.  
</P>
<P>
 The city found there were seven serious accidents -- including two fatalities 
-- at the intersection since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 city memo concludes: "A review of all the factors affecting traffic 
behavior at the intersection of Laurel Canyon Boulevard an Montague Street 
indicates the installation of a traffic signal is justified. In conjunction 
with the installation of a new traffic signal, crosswalks will be installed." 
</P>
<P>
 A Transportation Department official said Thursday that the construction of 
the signals and crosswalk had been approved for this summer. Such improvements 
routinely take as long as two years after department approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a result of the accident this week, crews will begin installing the 
light Monday, city officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a very high priority before (the accident)," said Tom Swire, a 
senior transportation engineer. "There are other locations that have more 
prevalent accidents. . . . It is too bad it wasn't up a month ago. Every death 
is untimely but this one was more so." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the back patio of his big green house on Bracken Street, Marco 
Godoy Sr. said Thursday he harbored no resentment for the hit-and-run driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel mad to the guy who killed my family," the 56-year-old parking 
garage manager said wearily. "I'll leave that to God." 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, Godoy said his sister paged him at work. "My sister said, 
'Come home, right now. Something happened that is terrible.' She wouldn't tell 
me what had happened, but I thought it was just a minor accident. I never 
thought I would find my wife and child dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy also struck in the Westlake district west of Downtown, where 
7-year-old Kimberly Lopez died and her 11-year-old brother, Alan, was seriously 
injured after they were struck by a car while standing on a sidewalk. The 
accident was witnessed by dozens of children playing in a nearby schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were still searching for the driver of the yellow or tan 1974 Toyota 
Corolla with license number 880 KEL that witnesses said caused another car to 
hit the Lopez children at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.

BUDGET SAVINGS AT SCHOOL QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While admitting that Los Angeles schools could learn new, effective ways to 
save money from the San Fernando Valley's first charter campus, a financial 
review of the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center's budget concludes that the 
elementary school received special treatment that cannot be extended to other 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page review sent to Los Angeles Board of Education members 
Thursday, district officials found that Vaughn succeeded in saving a total of 
$1 million, in part by decreasing students' and teachers' absenteeism and by 
hiring less-experienced -- and less-expensive -- teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report also disclosed that most of the savings -- about $700,000 -- 
came from the district giving Vaughn financial breaks on costly items. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, for example, was given more money for teachers salaries and benefits 
than other schools and was charged less for Los Angeles Unified School District 
support services, the report showed. The district would be unable to give those 
same breaks to other campuses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the review found that the school, led by director Yvonne Chan, 
had miscalculated its surplus by about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The district financial study was prompted by Chan's public assertions that she 
had saved $1.2 million this year by operating the school more efficiently. In 
response, the district sent two members of the accounting division to review 
the school's finances for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, who met with the accounting officials Thursday afternoon, said she 
disagrees that her surplus has dropped to $1 million and that future meetings 
are being set up to discuss the school's budget. In addition, she said the 
school's successes could be easily duplicated across the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're any smarter than anyone else," Chan said. "I don't think 
we have any better conditions than anyone else. If we can do it, why can't 
everyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 The district report did praise Chan and her staff for being innovative and for 
implementing many of the reforms other schools are now attempting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Chan, her staff and parents are to be commended for their vigorous 
efforts in effecting school flexibility and reform," the report said, "even 
though a substantial portion of the savings resulted from District efforts 
which treated Vaughn more generously than other District schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Rivera, the school district's spokesman, said the district adopted 
spending practices that were unique to Vaughn to encourage the new charter 
school. He said the district could not afford to extend the same favorable 
budget formulas to other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing a hell of a job," Rivera said. "A lot of schools are going to be 
looking at this. But a lot of what she has done has been with one-time funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The district gave Vaughn higher funding for teachers salaries and benefits 
even though the campus had teachers at the lower end of the salary scale, the 
report said. The school also received more year-round incentive money than 
other campuses, the review found. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera said other schools could copy Vaughn's staff and attendance efforts. 
The report found that the school reduced its use of substitute teachers and 
effectively used parent volunteers. The campus also quickly followed up on 
student absences -- boosting attendance to 99.14% -- by requiring valid 
excuses. Only excused absences are paid; schools lose money for unexcused 
student absences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings clearly lend support to the long-held premise in education that 
an outstanding administrator providing superb leadership, with strong 
supportive parents and staff, will make a difference in the quality of the 
instructional program," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said she has taken advantage of parents who have offered to help 
supervise students and to work at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she is not through fighting the behemoth district. She said she 
wants the district to further reduce the amount it is taking from the budget 
for support services, such as money for the lawyers' and deputy 
superintendents' offices. "They've disowned us but we're still paying for their 
services," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the charter school program is new to the school district, officials 
still are trying to determine the best ways to fund the campuses. Budget 
administrators are examining the funding patterns for all schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Charter Schools Act, passed two years ago, gave campuses authority 
to break away from district and state rules and regulations. Using its budget 
flexibility, Vaughn successfully argued last year for more per-pupil funds and 
has waged public battles over the district's spending practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Board president Leticia Quezada praised Chan and said she might be the key to 
the school's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vaughn has been helped in terms of policy decisions but it has a lot to do 
with Yvonne Chan being a charismatic leader," Quezada said. "The question is, 
in the absence of a charismatic leader, does the design work in and of itself 
to save money." 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members said the system was unfair to other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were overly fair to Vaughn," said board member Mark Slavkin, who 
voted in the fall against giving Vaughn more per-pupil funds. "I think we did 
some things for Vaughn that we're not going to be able to do (for) other 
schools and it's not fair to set that up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were hustling for their kids and that's to their credit," he said.

CBS PLANS TO EXPAND FACILITIES; TELEVISION: NETWORK SAYS THE 
245,000-SQUARE-FOOT PROJECT WILL HELP MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR STUDIO SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the support of local homeowners, CBS is hoping to expand the studio 
compound that gave this community its name, adding seven sound stages on an 
11.5-acre site just north of the network's current lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The television network will bring the 245,000-square-foot project before a Los 
Angeles zoning administrator July 8, seeking permission to build on the 
residentially zoned land and to exceed current height limits on Radford Avenue. 
The land, already owned by CBS, is now partially used for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Grebow, CBS's executive vice president of operations and 
administration, said that with cable and other outlets needing more 
programming, the business of providing space to create those programs is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Grebow said, the 16 sound stages at CBS Studio Center are full. 
"Seinfeld," "Roseanne," and "Dave's World," are among the shows produced on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a shortage of first-class studio space . . . and television 
production in general is increasing in L.A.," Grebow said. "We're in the 
business of providing studio facilities for our own productions and for other 
studios and producers. It's a good business for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, about two-thirds of the shows produced at Studio Center are non-CBS 
shows for other networks, Grebow said. CBS has outlined a project that includes 
the additional sound stages, dressings rooms, storage areas, production support 
areas and 1,202 parking spaces. It also proposes building a bridge over the Los 
Angeles River to connect the new and old lots. In all, say CBS officials, the 
new lots will create about 800 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 If granted the conditional use permit in July, the network plans to build the 
first two sound stages before the fall of 1995, according to Gary Morris, a 
planner with Engineering Technology Inc., the company overseeing the early 
stages of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the area, and the Studio City 
Residents' Assn. praised CBS for consulting the community as the project 
evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message in this is that people can work together, there are common 
concerns," Wachs said. "It isn't just homeowners versus the businesses. 
Everyone has a stake in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lucente, the residents' association president, said the network first 
approached neighbors at their annual meeting in March, and then met with them 
two times in April to go over the plans and solicit concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucente said there were some questions about traffic congestion and seismic 
safety, but that the network was responsive to the neighbors' apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our reaction was favorable," Lucente said. "A large percentage of our 
membership works in the entertainment industry or are associated with the 
business. This is how we got our name; this is our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The lot was first christened by Mack Sennett in 1928, when he built the 
studios that bore his name near the corner of Laurel Canyon and Ventura 
boulevards. Republic studios bought the lots in 1930 and then sold them to 
Columbia Broadcasting Systems in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 According to local lore, the move to name the area Studio City came not from 
studio executives, but from nearby farmers eager to share in the movie glamour. 
</P>
<P>
 John S. Reidy, a media analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in New York, said 
the television industry in general is poised to pick up a bigger piece of the 
production pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to November, 1993, networks were working under tight restrictions about 
what they could produce, and were barred from reselling their own entertainment 
shows. With the growth of cable and other outlets the regulations were relaxed, 
and experts predict the studios will benefit from the resulting boom in demand 
for studio space. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly CBS would like to not just produce shows for CBS, but for the other 
networks, for cable and the international market place," Reidy said. "They're 
now allowed to be programmers, so they're trying to build up their programming 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the physical manifestation, along with the changes in programming 
production, of the idea that the TV networks are going to become ever more 
important factors in the production in short form film entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to planning the site, ETI is also helping negotiate the plans 
through the city bureaucracy. Reports from the city ethics commission detail 
that CBS paid Alan Shuman, ETI's chief operating officer and a lobbyist, close 
to $130,000 in 1993 and 1994 -- the largest fee paid to an individual lobbyist 
in more than a year, ethics commission analyst Dominic Alfaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman downplayed the fees, saying that if he earned more than any other 
lobbyist, it is testimony that there have not been other large projects 
proposed in the Los Angeles area.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; 1 MILLION IS LUCKY NUMBER ON TRASH DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan Sidy was the millionth customer. It says so right on his garbage can. 
</P>
<P>
 An amused Sidy was greeted Thursday morning with a convoy of garbage trucks 
parked in front of his Tarzana home, all to deliver his new, black garbage can. 
It looks like any other garbage can, except, that is, for the gold leaf 
lettering with the words "L.A. Resource Program," a telephone number, and 
instructions on how to use the container. 
</P>
<P>
 A white sign also marked it as the millionth container used for automated 
curbside pickup by the Los Angeles City Bureau of Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidy, the 29-year-old owner of a landscape services company, became one of 
532,000 households now using the 60-gallon black container for non-recyclable 
household garbage. He'll use a 60-gallon green container for grass clippings 
and tree trimmings that will be made into compost and sold through local 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidy's neighborhood was next on the city's list for garbage and recycling 
container delivery, and the council offices were looking for someone to be the 
lucky millionth customer. So they called Sidy, who serves on numerous local 
boards and has been appointed to commissions by City Councilwoman Laura Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 They told him some people would come by in the morning. But Sidy said he 
wasn't expecting four garbage trucks loaded with containers, or representatives 
from the mayor's office, Public Works Department and even the manufacturers of 
the rubbish cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly did not expect what happened today," he said. "We were joking 
that somebody made a mistake and they were delivering 1 million garbage cans to 
me. It really was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Sidy began recycling aluminum and plastic in the city's 
14-gallon yellow bins. 
</P>
<P>
 By limiting each household to only one container for non-recyclable waste, the 
bureau hopes that residents will start recycling more garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the refuse collection and the recycling service are part of the L.A. 
Resource Program begun in 1989 in an effort to reduce the amount of waste in 
California landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1995, when all cities and counties are required to have diverted 25% of 
their waste from landfills, the program will have reached 720,000 households, 
said Roland A. Silva of the L.A. Resource Program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sidy's gold-embossed can won't be among those sitting on curbsides. The 
city is going to give him another container, sans gold leaf, for his garbage. 
And the fancy can? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am taking it into my house as an addition to my furnishings. As an end 
table," he said. "I'll put a lamp on it or something." TERESA ANN WILLIS

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; SHOULD LAPD CONTINUE USE OF 
HOGTYING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the death of Pasadena barber Michael James Bryant in March, 1993, while 
he was hogtied, or hobbled, by police officers, questions have arisen over the 
safety and humaneness of this method of restraining suspects. Used mostly with 
violent or drug-influenced suspects, hogtying involves handcuffing a suspect, 
then connecting the suspect's ankles to the handcuffs with a cord or strap. 
Suspects who have died while hogtied suffocated because they were restrained 
stomach-down. Most police departments have outlawed the practice. The Los 
Angeles Police Department still permits it, but officers have been instructed 
to place suspects on their side and monitor their breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should LAPD officers be allowed to continue hogtying suspects? 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Law, lieutenant with the Pasadena Police Department: 
</P>
<P>
 "With some suspects, it's almost a necessity. The Pasadena Police Department 
still hobbles suspects, but we no longer handcuff them and tie their feet and 
connect the feet with the hands. . . . If we elect to hobble them, their feet 
are tied and the excess hobble is closed in the door to keep them upright with 
their feet remaining on the floor. . . . I don't see any possible way, even if 
they elect to lie down on the seat, that they could actually end up face down 
on their stomach." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zinzun, chairman of the Coalition Against Police Abuse: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that history has shown that the us- against-them attitude exhibited 
by the members of the LAPD is a clear indication that we need to maintain the 
moratorium on the chokehold and that the new regulations regarding the hogtie 
should be brought to the community for its input. . . . The new policies for 
the hogtie should not be implemented until the community is able to weigh the 
positives and the negatives while we maintain a moratorium on the old holds." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Parachini, public affairs director of Southern California ACLU: 
</P>
<P>
 "We have long been extremely concerned about the potential lethal danger of 
the hogtie. The technique has been repeatedly linked most recently among 
suspects who are also pepper-sprayed. We believe that the LAPD should restrict 
the use to circumstances where the lives of officers, victims or bystanders 
need to be protected. . . . We don't argue that there aren't violently 
combative suspects. The issue here is that the technique has tended to be 
abused and clearly has lethal results." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Watson, attorney who represented the parents of Tracy Mayberry, a 
33-year-old Hollywood man who died while hogtied by LAPD officers in November, 
1990: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hogtying is inhumane. Most other police departments nationwide do not find 
this barbaric method of restraining necessary. The idea that they can cart 
around a suspect like a suitcase is unwarranted. There are viable, 
non-life-threatening alternatives that should be used. . . . After my case, the 
LAPD changed its policy, advising officers to place the suspects on their sides 
and monitor their breathing. But they did not communicate this change or did 
not communicate the reason for the change because they wound up killing Michael 
Bryant." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Carrier, spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office: 
</P>
<P>
 "When you compromise a person's breathing, sometimes it leads to death. When 
people are under the influence of methamphetamines or cocaine, or experiencing 
delirium tremens, it affects the heart. . . . It's called, 'Obey the law,' and 
we won't have any of these deaths. People shouldn't be using illicit drugs."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT FOR QUAKE SAFETY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new pilot program to help San Fernando Valley senior citizens quake-proof 
their homes is seeking volunteers to launch the project. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the "Earthquake Survival Project," volunteers will be taught to 
visit homes of seniors and eliminate potential hazards such as overloaded 
bookcases. 
</P>
<P>
 The first training session will be held Monday at 9:30 a.m. at the Valley 
Storefront Jewish Family Services, 12821 Victory Blvd., in North Hollywood. 
Volunteers will begin visiting homes next week.  
</P>
<P>
 "We got lots and lots of calls from people who were caught unawares by the 
first quake," said Dory Gradwohl, director of the senior center. Seniors, she 
said, "tend not to prepare" and "sometimes have a fatalistic attitude" toward 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Gradwohl said, many seniors find themselves struggling to stay alive in 
the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to anticipate what seniors need to do to prepare 
themselves," Gradwohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspections will be made by appointment and involve two-person inspection 
teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Advice will include stockpiling extra medication until quake-wracked 
pharmacies are open again.  
</P>
<P>
 A collection of spare medication, eyeglasses and some articles of clothing 
should also be placed in an accessible location. 
</P>
<P>
 A handyman will be available to secure heavy bookcases, water heaters, or make 
other quake-proof modifications to the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty households have already requested the non-sectarian service, with more 
expected, Gradwohl said. Volunteers will be asked to work one day per week, 
following three to four hours of training. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; MUSLIMS TO GATHER FOR RITES AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Muslims in the San Fernando Valley will gather 
on a lawn at the Cal State Northridge campus early Saturday morning to 
celebrate Eid al-Adha, the feast of sacrifice associated in Islamic tradition 
with the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Prayers will begin at 7 a.m. on the university's Engineering Lawn, according 
to Hasan Mulla, president of the sponsoring Islamic Center of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Eid al-Adha commemorates Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son as a test of the 
patriarch's loyalty to God -- a story found also in the Hebrew Bible.  
</P>
<P>
 The event is one of only two holidays on the Islamic calendar, the other being 
Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, the holy city of Islam, is one of the five 
pillars of faith for Muslims, who are expected to make the ritual journey at 
least once in their lifetime.  
</P>
<P>
 The stories of Abraham and his family are associated in Islam with places on 
the pilgrims' route in and around Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 A larger gathering of Muslims will take place at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center on Saturday morning, but as many as 3,000 are expected to attend the 
outdoor ceremony in Northridge, Mulla said. JOHN DART

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA; TRAINING CAMP RAISES CONSTRUCTION FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Villa Esperanza home for developmentally disabled adults has raised 
$660,000 needed to build a new kitchen and common room so its clients can eat, 
socialize and train for careers together. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction project, which is scheduled to begin June 8, also will 
include outfitting the rustic camp in the hills of unincorporated Agoura with 
an elevator and wheelchair ramps for the 20 residents and their visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 3,000-square-foot building and other improvements are complete in 
about a year, the camp will be used to more effectively train more clients to 
work as waiters, cooks and other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling about ourselves comes from what we are able to do and how useful 
we are," said Villa Esperanza Director Betty DeSantis. "These people are just 
the same. It improves their self-esteem to be able to get out and work." 
</P>
<P>
 The $660,000 was raised during the past year through grants from foundations 
and contributions from individuals. KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; RESIDENTS WON'T FIGHT PATIO LIQUOR PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A popular mini-mall is a step closer to being able to serve alcohol in an 
open-air patio, now that a residents group has decided to go along with the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 After securing promises by the developer to limit patio seating, look for 
additional employee parking and attempt to address potential traffic problems, 
the Studio City Residents Assn. has decided not to appeal the one-year trial 
permit received by the Laurel Promenade last month, association president Tony 
Lucente said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like they're very aware of our concerns and will make a good effort 
to address the concerns," Lucente said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center is located at the intersection of Laurel Canyon and 
Ventura boulevards. The three restaurants that want to serve alcoholic 
beverages on their patios are Louise's Trattoria, Gaucho Grill and the Daily 
Grill. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom O'Brien, planning consultant for Los Angeles-based Laurel Center Group, 
which owns Laurel Promenade, said he was pleased with the association's 
decision, and that he is putting the finishing touches on a parking plan that 
addresses the group's concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate the time they've taken to work with us on that," he said. "I 
think we're going to be able to come up with a plan that works for the 
community, the center and the center's tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 The developer has agreed to reduce the number of patio seats by 30 to 120 and 
survey nearby office and business properties for additional employee parking. 
The Laurel Center Group will also consult with the Los Angeles Department of 
Transportation on ways to prevent traffic problems that residents fear will 
result from cars making illegal left turns in and out of the shopping mall.  
</P>
<P>
 Landscaping improvements will also be made. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hurdle remaining is for the developer to get a zoning administrator 
to approve its parking plan, which is due in mid-June.  
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Center Group applied for the conditional use permit last October. The 
Board of Zoning Appeals granted the permit April 5, overturning a zoning 
administrator's decision to the deny the application because of concerns about 
insufficient parking. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; HEALTH CONFERENCE TO AID THE ELDERLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Older people don't have to feel helpless or confused about the health 
challenges that often accompany aging. 
</P>
<P>
 With proper information they can prevent some illnesses, lessen the likelihood 
of others and ensure that doctors are receptive to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers of the upcoming "Celebrating Long Life and Good Health" 
gathering, an intergenerational conference sponsored by the Pacoima Senior 
Citizens Multipurpose Center, say they plan to provide seniors with this kind 
of information. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about menopause, before you reach menopause, a lot of times it 
can be scary," said the Rev. Alicia Broadous-Duncan, director of the center. 
"We want to give information that will lessen fears. We want to give 
information so men will know how to do preventative things as it relates to 
prostate cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, which is open to people of all ages, will also include 
workshops on stress management, high blood pressure, nutrition, diabetes and 
breast cancer, Broadous-Duncan said. A multiethnic panel will discuss the 
legacy of traditional healing or folk medicine in the Asian, African-American 
and Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists include Dr. Andrew Sanderson of Lancaster, Millie Holland, director 
of nursing for county health facilities in Pacoima, San Fernando and the 
Antelope Valley, and Angie Mejia, a licensed vocational nurse with the county 
Health Department in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Senior-to-Senior, the center's peer counseling group, will 
facilitate small group discussions in which conference participants will share 
ideas and experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seniors have not lived on this land this long without learning something," 
Broadous-Duncan said. "Seniors will be sharing and young people will be 
sharing. We know that out of that comes a bonding and a nurturing." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference will be held 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at the First United 
Methodist Church of San Fernando, 1525 Glenoaks Blvd. Registration is $5, 
scholarships available. The fee includes snacks and lunch. Call (818) 899-9548.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; POSTMASTER MEETS WITH CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Postmaster James Brouillard set up shop in his lobby with coffee and 
cookies Thursday morning, welcoming praise and criticism for the mail delivery 
which he has overseen for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that nine out of 10 people have been satisfied," Brouillard 
declared at the end of his three-hour session during which he met 150 to 200 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Handling complaints from the public has always been a big part of his job, but 
most are dealt with over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it surprises people to see a postmaster out here," Brouillard 
said. The questions centered on mail delivery, but some people asked about the 
changes going on at the main Glendale post office which is being renovated. The 
building, put up in the 1930s, is being restored to its original look. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who do have anything positive or negative to say often don't 
take the time to call me," Brouillard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenda Womack complained to Brouillard that she had stopped mail delivery 
while on vacation last year and picked up her mail at the post office when she 
returned. But then a couple of months later she was delivered mail that had 
been sent to her in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Bills and get-well cards sent to her for time she had earlier spent in a 
hospital came months late, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Did it help to talk to the postmaster? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not really," she said. "He said if it happens anymore to let him know, 
but that's after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that that is a very unusual situation," Brouillard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacia Crane, manager of consumers for the field district of Van Nuys, said 
that two more similar informal sessions are being scheduled for next week in 
Studio City and at Valley Village in North Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 The talks, which have been used more heavily on the East Coast, are intended 
to break the image of the Postal Service being an impersonal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the friendly post office," she said. ED BOND

 Ever since Humberto Cuentas was a baby, his mother tried to instill the idea 
that he should go to college. Now, the O'Melveny & Myers law firm is going to 
make sure that can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuentas and seven other sixth-graders at O'Melveny Elementary School in San 
Fernando were each awarded $12,000 scholarships toward their college tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so proud. I feel like I'm floating on clouds," beamed O'Melveny 
Principal Lucky Hemphill, who masterminded the scholarship program four years 
ago when Hemphill met with Warren Christopher and Gordon Krischer of the law 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year since the program's inception, eight O'Melveny sixth-graders and 
four San Fernando High School seniors have received the $12,000 scholarships 
based on their test scores, academic performance and, for the elementary 
students, "a gut feeling the kid will be successful," according to Hemphill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out as a tiny little table of students. Tonight, I brought 45 
people on a bus," said Hemphill as almost every one of the O'Melveny scholars 
gathered at a banquet Wednesday to honor this year's recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Rubalcava, who is in the two-year radiology technician training program 
at Childrens Hospital, was among the first seniors to receive $12,000 in 1991. 
He was accepted into the internship after he completed his general education 
requirements at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all because of O'Melveny & Myers," said Rubalcava. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the money, each elementary student is assigned a mentor, a 
member of the law firm, to encourage the student to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a resource available to them for whatever they choose it to be," said 
Mark Easton, who will be Cuentas' mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very excited. It will help me a lot," said Lourdes Munoz, another 
O'Melveny scholar, who wants to study science or social studies and later 
pursue a career as a nurse or teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put it in their minds that the scholarship program can make a difference, 
and it does make a difference," said Krischer, who noted the program has so far 
had a 100% success rate -- all recipients are still in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The other scholars from elementary school are Janea Daniels, Carmen Gutierrez, 
Francisco Lopez, Edgar Ibarra, Adrian Perez and Crystal Suniga. This year's 
senior scholars are Angie Brown, Jessica Calderon, Manuel Reyes and Ernesto and 
Roberto Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodriguez brothers are twins and the law firm added a scholarship so both 
boys could go to college. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FUND LAUNCHED TO AID EX-PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A group of private citizens have organized a fund to aid former Burbank high 
school principal Keiko Hentell in her discrimination suit against the Burbank 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't take any position other than the fact that we believe in and support 
Keiko Hentell," said Christopher Spencer, president of the Dreams to Reality 
Foundation in Burbank, which hopes to raise $10,000 to help pay Hentell's 
lawyer and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer and Hentell became acquainted last year when Spencer organized a 
fund-raiser for the performing arts program at Burbank High. The foundation has 
funded other projects, such as delivering meals to the homes of AIDS patients 
after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank school board announced in February that it was not going to renew 
Hentell's contract as principal when it expires at the end of June. The board 
gave no reason for its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell was later reassigned to write grants for the district and is to start 
work as an English teacher in the district next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell filed the discrimination suit last week, charging she was removed from 
the job because she is a Japanese-American woman who tried to encourage 
minority groups at Burbank High School. She sanctioned the fund earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides getting her job back as principal, Hentell's suit also seeks an 
unspecified amount of monetary damages.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to see her struggle financially while she pursues this case," 
said Spencer, who said he has already been promised donations from several 
people who support her. He added that he will contribute $100 to the fund 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell said she was grateful for the help. ED BOND

27 ADMINISTRATORS NAMED IN DISTRICT REORGANIZATION; SCHOOLS: EIGHT OF THE 
APPOINTMENTS WILL OVERSEE THE TRANSITION IN THE VALLEY, WITH EACH LEADING A 
COMPLEX OF CAMPUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Opening the way for the massive reorganization of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, Supt. Sid Thompson announced his appointments Thursday for 27 
administrators -- including eight in the San Fernando Valley -- to oversee the 
major transition. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrators, who will make $84,550 annually, will oversee the new 
complexes of elementary, middle and senior high schools. The reorganization is 
intended to bring decision-making closer to the schools and eliminate orders 
from the bureaucracies of the Downtown district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thompson's choices, which were made without a board of education vote, are 
coming under fire from the teachers' union. "Most of these people . . . have 
been seen as a hindrance rather than a help to schools," said Helen Bernstein, 
the United Teachers -- Los Angeles president. "There were a few people who were 
effective in their jobs, but . . . it seems like a waste of resources and 
energy." 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials said the administrators are experienced leaders who 
will help the school system shift power to local campuses. The so-called 
cluster leaders will be responsible for evaluating principals, implementing new 
reform and curricular programs, and improving community and parent 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very experienced leaders," said Bill Rivera, the district's 
spokesman. "They will be in the line position." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson received about 100 applications for the jobs. Rivera said Thompson 
made his selections based on a variety of factors, including experience and 
ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cluster leader will be responsible for one to three high schools and the 
local "feeder" elementary and middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley schools have been organized into eight complexes. The following are the 
high school complexes and their newly appointed leaders: 
</P>
<P>
 * San Fernando -- Maria Reza, currently the principal at San Fernando Middle 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 * Francis Polytechnic/North Hollywood -- Carmen Schroeder, a region 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grant/Van Nuys -- Yvonne Davis, a region administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kennedy/Monroe -- Gene McCallum, a middle schools unit administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Birmingham/Cleveland/Reseda -- Deborah Leidner, on leave from being 
principal at Marshall High. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sylmar/Verdugo Hills -- Jeanne Yamamoto, region administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taft/Canoga Park/El Camino Real -- Joseph Luskin, a region administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chatsworth/Granada Hills -- Lawrence Moore, a region administrator.

ACTOR USES HIS CHOPS TO FOIL CARJACKING; CRIME: IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS LIFE, 
STEPHEN PENNER DISARMS ATTACKER ON THE STREET AND THEN RETURNS TO HIS DRAMA 
CLASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The part of a street tough in this article is played by Stephen Penner, a 
mild-mannered Santa Barbara attorney and aspiring actor who unwittingly earned 
the lead role in a bit of Los Angeles street theater Tuesday night as he 
single-handedly foiled a carjacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Penner, 46, on a break from his once-a-week acting class, had bent down to put 
his checkbook back in his white Porsche 928 when he felt the cold steel of a 
.357 magnum revolver, the kind Dirty Harry used in the movies, pressing against 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I bent over, someone grabbed my right arm and said something, but I didn't 
hear it and I thought it was my scene partner," Penner said. "When I stood up I 
saw a .357 held to my right temple and the guy said, 'Get in the car.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The man on the other end of the barrel wasn't Clint Eastwood either, it was 
Raul Montoya, 21, of Los Angeles, and he wasn't play-acting at all, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that moment, Penner said, he decided to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hesitated for a moment and he repeated it, the barrel pressed against my 
temple. What flashed through my mind is, 'If I get in the car, I'm dead. If I 
run, I'm probably dead. I made a decision and I went with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Penner grabbed Montoya's right wrist, forcing the gun first up into the air 
and then straight down as the men wrestled, kicked and clawed each other for 
control of the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was wrestling the gun from his right hand, he tried to turn it toward me 
and shoot me," Penner said. "For a minute, I thought about running, but he 
would have shot me in the back." 
</P>
<P>
 Penner got both hands on the gun and pulled it away from Montoya, whom he 
described as about his own size. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked it free and turned it on him," he said. "He started to come at me 
and I screamed for him to get away from me, and then he took off running." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Bill Speer of the Los Angeles Police Department understands why 
Penner risked his life and said it was probably the right thing for Penner to 
do because he was prepared to act. But he would not prescribe that course of 
action for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on a person's mental outlook, physical conditioning," Speer said. 
"Every situation is different and everyone will evaluate their own situation." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the more than 8,000 carjacking victims in Los Angeles over the 
last two years, the right move has been to comply with the person sticking a 
gun in your face. 
</P>
<P>
 "What answer might be right for him, might be wrong for a different person," 
Speer said. "As a general rule, it is very wrong to tangle with someone with a 
gun when you are unarmed." 
</P>
<P>
 When Penner returned to his class at Chelsea Studios, the teacher, veteran 
actress Arlene Golonka, said she was at first horrified by his story. Then she 
turned it into an acting lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He acted the whole thing out for us," Golonka said. "I said, 'Use it, use 
it,' because it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a mild, adorable person, and of all my students, I would never expect 
him to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya was picked up by police about an hour after the attempted carjacking 
on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood, authorities said, because he fit 
the description given by Penner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya confessed to the crime, according to Detective James Gerardi of the 
North Hollywood station. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday night's ordeal, Penner's wife, Lii, asked her husband to get rid 
of the Porsche. And she said she was not happy about his weekly sojourns to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have three kids, but he's just like that, he wants to be active, be out 
there," she said, speaking from their home. "Unfortunately, Los Angeles is like 
that too, and that's why we live in Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Penner was back in Los Angeles, seemingly unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, as long as I'm going to continue to go down to Hollywood," Penner said 
before driving off to a commercial audition in Hollywood, "I'm going to need 
this car."

CRACKDOWN ON HATE CRIMES URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A spray-painted swastika and pentagram recently found on a building for 
Armenian-American Boy and Girl Scouts has leaders of the community demanding 
that Glendale officials take tougher action against hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 A Scout official discovered the symbols Saturday on a wall of the Homenetmen 
Armenian General Athletics Union and Scouts building at 544 W. Broadway.Two 
vans parked near the building were also defaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, still under investigation, has not yet been classified as a hate 
crime, said Officer Rodney Brooks of the Glendale Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, more than a dozen Armenian-American groups will hold a news 
conference today asking city officials to form a high-profile human relations 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism "is a sign of discord within a minority," said Raffi Hamparian, 
government affairs director for the Armenian National Committee of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many people, there is great sadness and disappointment. . . . This, in a 
way, has shaken their faith. This is a signal that you're not welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The Armenian National Committee, based in Washington, is a grass-roots group 
that acts as a liaison between the Armenian-American community and local 
governments nationwide.

GUNMEN ROB COUPLE AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two masked gunmen entered a Northridge home while the residents were watching 
television and robbed them of an undetermined amount of cash and jewelry, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the robbery, which occurred about 11 p.m. Wednesday in 
the 17000 block of Halstead Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the gunmen, who wore nylon over their heads, entered the 
single-story home through a rear door. They pointed their guns and demanded 
valuables from the husband and wife, who were in bed watching television. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers, who were in the house for about three minutes, escaped on foot 
with a small amount of cash and jewelry from a dresser, said Detective Michael 
Brandt of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a home invasion in quite some time -- at least six months," 
Brandt said. "It's unusual, and we are going to monitor the situation to see 
that it's not repeated." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the robbers wore dark clothing and described them as having medium 
height and weight. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no suspects late Thursday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 NEW SCHOOLS TO OPEN DESPITE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District opens two new schools this fall 
but faces a $2-million deficit for the 1994-95 school year, and that's assuming 
teachers accept a plan to save $1 million by keeping class sizes larger than 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 During a special meeting Wednesday when a $51.1-million budget was presented 
to the district's board of trustees, William Maddigan, director of business and 
financial services, said the operating and starting costs for Valencia High 
School and La Mesa Junior High School have been estimated at $2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Maddigan said revenue from student enrollment is likely to be 
less than expected, largely because of people moving away after the Northridge 
earthquake. Trustees expressed displeasure at the size of the deficit, but he 
said there is nothing additional to cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's very good, (but) the administration is not advocating any 
more cuts than what's been proposed at this point," Maddigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget will be submitted to the board for approval June 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The original 1994-95 budget contained a $3.9-million deficit, but $850,000 in 
savings has been proposed by eliminating the purchase of a new bus, laying off 
one district employee, cutting the working hours at the new schools and making 
other cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddigan said the toughest cut will be persuading teachers to extend an 
agreement placing two more students in each classroom, saving the district $1 
million by not having to hire 24 teachers. The temporary agreement signed two 
years ago placed an average of 34 students in high school classes and 33 in 
junior high classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Walter Swanson said extra revenue may be sought by starting a 
community-based Medicaid program, allowing the district to receive federal 
funds for health care services it already provides. In addition, a bond of up 
to $24 million, which would cost a person with a $100,000 home an average of 
$42 a year, to pay for equipment and new facilities is being suggested to go 
before the voters this fall or next spring.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 RACIAL FIGHTS LEAVE 9 PRISONERS INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two racially motivated fights in separate dorms at Peter J. Pitchess Honor 
Rancho broke out between inmates Thursday, leaving nine prisoners with minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The scuffles happened within minutes of one another but were unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 The first fight, involving about 60 black and Hispanic inmates -- some 
brandishing broom handles and metal shank weapons -- began at 10:18 a.m. at a 
maximum-security dorm. A prison emergency response team broke it up within a 
few minutes, prison officials said. Four inmates were treated for cuts and 
bruises and two were treated for puncture wounds. Two shanks were recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 black and Hispanic inmates began fighting at 10:30 a.m. at another 
dorm, using similar weapons. That altercation was also quickly broken up by an 
emergency response team. Three inmates were injured, including one who suffered 
a broken nose. One shank weapon was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "No force was used in either disturbance and no deputies were injured," said 
Deputy Rich Erickson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Information Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials are investigating what started the fights and will relocate 
prisoners to try to reduce the chance of another fight, Erickson said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SEARCH FOR GRAFFITI; VOLUNTEERS WILL CLEAN IT 
UP -- IF THEY CAN FIND ANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a problem other cities would certainly like to have: too little 
graffiti.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of Santa Clarita's fourth annual Teen Spring Clean are struggling 
to find enough graffiti to keep volunteers busy for a few hours Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Although activities have been planned for the afternoon -- planting 20 
Australian willow trees along Soledad Canyon Road between Whites Canyon Road 
and Crossglade Avenue in Canyon Country -- there may not be enough markings to 
occupy the 60 or so youths who've pledged to help remove them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for the city," said Jonathan Skinner, city recreation coordinator 
planning the beautification effort. "It sort of makes graffiti cleanup an iffy 
type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner said his co-workers have jokingly asked him and fellow organizer Kevin 
Tonoian if they are going to be out Friday night with spray cans of their own 
to make work for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner attributes his dilemma to Santa Clarita's Pride Committee, a squad of 
local volunteers who are vigilant about removing graffiti before most citizens 
here ever see it. The city sometimes provides the paint, but expenses are often 
covered -- just like the markings -- by committee members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation prompts a smile from Capt. Mike Quinn of the Santa Clarita 
Valley sheriff's station. "I think (the lack of graffiti) says exactly what we 
want to be said about the city," said Quinn. "The citizens here are so aware of 
the problem they're taking the steps to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Untended graffiti leads to the "broken window syndrome," in which evidence of 
vandalism draws more vandalism, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not overemphasize the importance of removing graffiti the minute it 
appears," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are pleased that volunteers have made graffiti scarce here, but 
believe the problem still lurks around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hesitate to say we're winning the war, but I do think it means the program 
is effective," said Mayor George Pederson, who plans to address volunteers at 
the start of Saturday's cleanup. "One piece of graffiti is too much." 
</P>
<P>
 There's also concern about a backlash of vandalism if anyone starts bragging 
about the city's cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
 If graffiti isn't discovered in enough city nooks and crannies before Saturday 
morning, volunteers will be put to work painting a flood control channel -- 
covering mismatched paint blotches used to hide earlier graffiti -- and picking 
up litter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared for rain. We're prepared for a lack of graffiti," said 
Skinner. "We've got plenty of trees for them to plant."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EX-CONVICT GETS 20 YEARS TO LIFE IN FATAL CLUB 
SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An ex-convict found guilty of murder in a deadly shootout at a popular 
Palmdale nightclub was sentenced Thursday to 20 years to life in state prison, 
despite a last-minute effort by his attorney to get a second-degree murder 
conviction reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Dwayne Bernard Davis, 25, asked that the conviction be 
reduced to manslaughter because he said Davis was provoked by the man he shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're provoked that's manslaughter, not murder," said Santa Monica 
attorney Douglas E. McCann. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Superior Court Judge Haig Kehiayan rejected McCann's request, saying 
that when Davis fired the fatal shot, he first disarmed his victim, 30-year-old 
Brently Eugene Young of Lancaster, who was lying wounded on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's murder, that's malice," Kehiayan said. "The evidence supports a 
second-degree murder conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, McCann said even though his motion for a reduced conviction was 
denied, it gives Davis, a San Fernando Valley resident, valid reason for an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' conviction -- which besides second-degree murder, also includes using a 
firearm in the commission of a felony and being an ex-convict possessing a gun 
-- stems from an Aug. 23 shootout in the parking lot at The Old Firehouse, a 
Palmdale Boulevard restaurant and dance club that has since closed. He and 
Young began shooting at each other with semi-automatic pistols shortly after 2 
a.m. as about 200 people left the restaurant following a party. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting started after Young threatened to "smoke" Davis, who was in a 
pickup truck preparing to drive away, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was left dead and five others, including a pregnant teen-ager, were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for the first time in court about the shootout, Davis gave a brief 
explanation Thursday before his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was acting off impulse," he said. "That guy (Young) was shooting at me. I 
was scared for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for four days, the jury in late April rejected Davis' 
claims of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had kids, I had a business out there," Davis said Thursday. "Everything is 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Young's aunt, Ella Lane, said she had come to the court on behalf of Young's 
mother, who is suffering from terminal lung cancer that had been in remission 
until the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took away her most loved person, her only son," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has twice previously been sentenced to prison, according to court 
records. The two- and three-year sentences were for separate convictions 
involving the possession of narcotics for sale.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STATE THREATENS DISTRICT WITH LAWSUIT OVER 
CLAS TEST; EDUCATION: ACTON-AGUA DULCE BOARD IS ASKED TO RECONSIDER A DECISION 
NOT TO GIVE THE EXAM. A RESPONSE IS DUE WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 State education officials threatened the Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School 
District with legal action if it does not administer the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page letter, William D. Dawson, acting state superintendent of 
public instruction, asked the district to reconsider its decision not to give 
the California Learning Assessment System test. Dawson requested a response by 
next Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Although I do not relish the thought, the department will pursue whatever 
action is possible, within the constraints of time and resources, if you 
continue to refuse to give the 1994 CLAS tests," Dawson wrote. The Acton-Agua 
Dulce district received the letter Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also went this week to four other California school districts that 
have decided against administering the CLAS test. But the tone of the letter 
was a far cry from the harsh order state education officials sent to the 
Antelope Valley Union High School District last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things have happened since we originally wrote to Antelope Valley," 
said Allan Keown, a Department of Education attorney. "It seemed more 
appropriate to write this kind of a letter under these circumstances than the 
letter we wrote a month ago." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bottom line is still the same: Give the CLAS test or the Department of 
Education will file suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention is to go to court" if necessary, Keown said, noting the 
department's legal resources are stretched quite thin because of all the 
lawsuits that conservative groups have filed against school districts who are 
giving the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The department last week filed suit against the Antelope Valley district. It 
is the first suit the state has filed against a school district over CLAS. A 
hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court is scheduled for June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Acton-Ague Dulce board member Bruce Nahin on Thursday said that despite the 
state's veiled threat, he remains committed to his position to not give the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I would suggest to my board is we agree to be bound by whatever the 
court orders Antelope Valley to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Becky Small declined to discuss the letter, saying she had not 
yet seen it, but stated, "I still believe in my position." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Acton-Agua Dulce board, in a 4-1 vote, decided April 28 to not administer 
the test, following the lead of the Antelope Valley district. There are six 
school districts, including Acton-Agua Dulce and Antelope Valley, in the state 
who have decided against administering the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Acton-Agua Dulce board member Peg Spry, who cast the sole dissenting vote, 
said she is hopeful the board will reverse its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the board will change its minds and come into alignment with the 
state's requirement," Spry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Education officials have repeatedly said the law requires every 
district in the state to administer the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS has been hailed by supporters as a revolutionary method of testing 
students' critical thinking skills, but has been attacked by others for asking 
students personal questions, containing reading selections that denigrate the 
family and being shrouded in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Acton-Agua Dulce board is scheduled to meet Thursday, one day after the 
state is expecting a decision, and district officials were unsure if a special 
meeting would be called to discuss CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need for all of the board members to read this thing and react to it," said 
Supt. Tom Brown. "We could have a special meeting or ask for a two-day 
extension so we can decide at our regular board meeting on May 26." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Field, a board member who also voted to not administer the test, said 
earlier she would consider reversing her position only if the state forced such 
a move. "If the state threatens legal action, we'll have to take it back to the 
table and look at it."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BAIL SET AT $100,000 FOR SUSPECTED 
SUPREMACIST; CRIME: JACE EDWARDS, CHARGED WITH A DRIVING OFFENSE, ALSO MAY BE 
LINKED TO RACIAL TENSIONS AT CANYON HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Canyon Country man suspected of being a white supremacist was in jail 
Thursday in lieu of $100,000 bail on a charge of committing a misdemeanor 
driving offense while on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of Jace Edwards, 18, said their son, who pleaded not guilty, was given 
a high bail because prosecutors are too embarrassed to release him following 
heavy media coverage of accusations that he was part of a "white power" group 
that ignited racial tensions at Canyon High School last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've picked him as a scapegoat," said Edwards' father, Robert. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Damon said accusations that Jace Edwards belongs to an 
extremist group have nothing to do with the current charges filed against him. 
Damon also said the high bail was requested because the youth failed to show at 
court hearings on previous cases and appeared to have the means to post the 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bragged to the arresting officers that he recently got $600,000 in a 
traffic accident settlement and he would easily be able to make bail," Damon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Edwards said the settlement is being paid over a 20-year time span, and 
his son is currently broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Municipal Court Judge Keith Byram set a bail review hearing for 
Monday. A jury trial on the charges is scheduled June 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The extremist group, known informally at the school as the "white power" 
group, is accused of sparking two racially motivated fights involving 20 to 30 
students near Canyon High School on May 10. Deputies with the Santa Clarita 
Valley sheriff's station showed up in force the next day to break up an 
apparently impending fight involving about 80 students, and patrolled the area 
around the campus for several days afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Jace Edwards was arrested near the school Tuesday on suspicion of driving with 
a suspended license and carrying three knives in his car. He was suspected of 
helping to ignite racial tensions at the school during a period of several 
days, although he did not participate in the fights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He was booked into custody in lieu of $500,000 bail after his arrest because 
deputies argued that he was a flight risk because he was on probation. In 
addition, youths were looking to confront Edwards, said Sgt. Lee White, head of 
the Career Offenders Burglary Robbery Apprehension (COBRA) team, which 
investigates gang crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not necessarily just for his protection," he said. "It's to keep the 
peace in the community. There's a lot of tension out there and it could be 
aggravated by this individual and his friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender James Racusin said Jace Edwards is a developmentally 
disabled youth who joined the extremist group for the companionship, but 
dropped out of it before the incidents at Canyon High School.

ESPARZA HURDLING BARRIER AFTER BARRIER; RETURNING TO TRACK IN STEEPLECHASE, 
MOORPARK RUNNER SURPRISES SKEPTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good thing Mike Esparza ignored the advice of family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the Moorpark College sophomore might not have qualified for the 
state junior college track and field championships that begin today at Cerritos 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza had given up the sport in 1990 when nagging back pain forced the 1989 
graduate of Newbury Park High to quit the Moorpark team. 
</P>
<P>
 After working full time at an athletic shoe store and attending school part 
time at Moorpark for 2 1/2 years, he decided to make a comeback this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends who knew how much running meant to him supported Esparza. 
But they all questioned his sanity when they realized he planned to specialize 
in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, a rugged event in which competitors are 
required to hurdle 28 three-foot barriers and seven 12-foot-wide water jumps 
during the course of a race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he was crazy," said Mike Stewart, Esparza's high school coach. "I 
told him, 'That's about the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Why don't you 
concentrate on a race like the 1,500, which isn't as hard on your body?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Esparza clan -- Mike is the youngest of seven children -- also 
thought the decision foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Let's see. You've had back surgery and knee surgery and you want 
to run the steeplechase,' " Esparza said, laughing. " 'Why not take up the 
javelin and tear up your shoulder too?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Trevino, director of track and field at Moorpark, expressed similar 
sentiments, telling Esparza the most important goal was to "get you through the 
season in one piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Esparza held firm, saying he wanted to compete in "the most 
challenging thing out there and that was the steeplechase." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his perseverance paid off Saturday when he ran a personal best of 9 
minutes 28.18 seconds to finish second in the Southern California championships 
at UC San Diego, Esparza has sustained his share of bumps and bruises this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The most painful occurred at the Southern California preliminaries May 7 when 
he hit his left foot on a hurdle midway through the race and severed the tendon 
on the second toe. 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza was so focused on the race -- which he won in a then-personal best of 
9:35.18 -- he didn't realize the severity of the injury until he took off his 
spikes and noticed his blood-stained sock. 
</P>
<P>
 His toe was just kind of "hanging there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury will require surgery after the season, but Esparza never thought 
about quitting. Instead, he figured out a way to tape the toe so he could still 
train and race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his toughness is his greatest strength," Trevino said. "That and the 
fact that he's one of the few people we've had here who doesn't get 
discouraged, no matter what happens to him." 
</P>
<P>
 That determination seems linked to the fact that Esparza is close to 
completing his first full athletic season since 1988 and is once again part of 
a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The camaraderie of the team and training have been the most enjoyable things 
about this season," he said. "I really enjoy being out there training with the 
guys and joking around with them and talking about girls, cars, or whatever. 
That's something I really missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza's outgoing personality and quick sense of humor have made him the most 
popular member of the team, according to Trevino. Esparza is particularly close 
to the weight-event athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like me because they've seen me (bench-press 225 pounds) twice," Esparza 
quipped. "They think I'm one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1 1/2, 170-pound Esparza more closely resembled a javelin thrower 
than a distance runner at the start of the year. He weighed 190 pounds back 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people took a look at me before the season, and said, 'You want to be a 
runner? Hah!' " he said. "I have to admit that (teammate Ryan Luce), who's 
about 5-8 and 125 pounds, and I were quite the odd couple when we were running 
on the roads." 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza's best moments in high school came on rugged roads. Esparza's 
brothers, Gilbert and Danny, won Marmonte League cross-country titles in 1971 
and '78, and Mike continued the family tradition with league titles in '86 and 
'87. Esparza placed fourth in the Southern Section 4-A Division championships 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of '88, he ran 1:57.6 in the 800 and 9:15.0 in the 3,200 -- but 
finished a disappointing seventh in the 1988 league cross-country finals as a 
senior after being plagued by back pain all season. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain eventually was traced to a herniated disk, which prevented him from 
running track in 1989 and required surgery in April of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 He enrolled at Moorpark in the fall of 1989 but did not run cross-country so 
he could give his back more time to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran promising early-season times of 1:57 in the 800 and 3:59 in the 1,500 
in 1990 before more back problems curtailed his season. 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza wound up in the operating room again, undergoing an emergency 
appendectomy in August, 1992, and ligament repair three months later. With that 
medical history, it's no wonder those close to him questioned his decision to 
run the steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran 10:18.65 in his first steeplechase at Bakersfield on March 19 and has 
set personal bests in each of his five races since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had two goals at the start of the season," Esparza said. "One was to run 
under 9:30, and the other was to qualify for the state meet. . . . Now I'd like 
to run under 9:20 and take a shot at the school record." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Ingram set the Moorpark record of 9:17.89 in wining the 1986 state 
title, but Esparza realizes a victory Saturday is an unrealistic goal. 
Australian Neil Smart of Riverside has a personal best of 8:48. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how he finishes in the state meet, Esparza will call his 1994 
season a success. It's a trend he hopes continues. Next fall, he will attend 
San Diego State, which has no men's cross-country program. Esparza will compete 
at the club level, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, I'm probably not going to win (at the state meet), but that's 
OK," he said. "As long as I give it my best shot, I'll be satisfied. This is 
not the end of the road for me. I plan to run for a long time."

IT'S ALL RELATIVE FOR ZELENOVIC IN NATIONAL FINALS; COLLEGE TENNIS: CAL 
LUTHERAN STANDOUT HAS BEEN ON CLOUD NINE SINCE HIS MOTHER AND BROTHER ARRIVED 
FROM WAR-TORN CROATIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Cal Lutheran's Tomislav Zelenovic, the excitement of competing in this 
weekend's NCAA Division III tennis championships has been overshadowed by a 
friend's graduation present. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift consisted of uniting Zelenovic, a Croatian native, with his mother 
and younger brother after four years. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Ana, and 9-year-old brother, Aleksandar, arrived from Rijeka, 
Croatia, on the Adriatic coast on Friday and watched Zelenovic graduate with 
honors on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride to the airport was full of anxiety for Zelenovic, who became somewhat 
nervous upon arriving to meet the flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very emotional at the airport," said Zelenovic, 22. "It's very hard to 
describe. It's unbelievable to think that all these years have passed without 
seeing someone so close to me. We look back and find it hard to believe we made 
it through the years." 
</P>
<P>
 After attending his senior year of high school at La Canada in 1990 as part of 
an exchange program, Zelenovic went home for the summer. He hasn't been back 
since.  
</P>
<P>
 He was granted an academic scholarship at Cal Lutheran, where he majored in 
biology and sociology, and graduated with a 3.8 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 So Zelenovic's friend, John Grace, brainstormed for the perfect graduation 
gift. Zelenovic and Grace met four years ago through a student exchange program 
and have been close since. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Grace who introduced Zelenovic to officials at Cal Lutheran and 
subsequently helped him get a scholarship at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I wanted to surprise him, but I had to tell him so that he could 
help out with the documents," said Grace, who is an investment adviser. 
"Initially he didn't want to believe it because he didn't want his hopes 
smashed." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace convinced some of his clients at Delta Airlines to contribute to the 
plane fares, and a friend who is an attorney helped with the legal documents 
required to obtain the visas. 
</P>
<P>
 The process was a tedious one, Grace said. Initially, Croatian officials would 
not grant Ana, a literature teacher, a visa because they feared she would not 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was so great to see a family reunited," Grace said. "There weren't 
many words spoken. Just a lot of tears.". 
</P>
<P>
 Zelenovic communicates with his family through letters and telephone calls. 
His father, who is a sailor, also lives in Croatia but was unable to make the 
trip because of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often I can't get through and I get real worried because there's a war going 
on," Zelenovic said. "It's very difficult for them to get visas to come here 
and I can't go back because there's a good chance I would go straight into the 
army. It's mandatory there. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my childhood friends are in the military and some, I don't know if 
they're alive. I've really come to appreciate the peace here." 
</P>
<P>
 Zelenovic's consolation is seeing his 23-year-old brother, Marko, frequently. 
Marko attends Montana State on a tennis scholarship, so the brothers talk often 
and visit every few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis was a big part of their lives while growing up. Zelenovic started 
playing when he was 8. He has competed at Cal Lutheran for four years. This 
season, he is the Kingsmen's top singles and doubles player.  
</P>
<P>
 Zelenovic is ranked 17th nationally in Division III heading into this 
weekend's tournament at the University of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a 7-3 singles record and is 8-1 in doubles with partner Tony Cohen. 
Zelenovic and Cohen are ranked 17th in the nation in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomislav is a super aggressive competitor," Cal Lutheran Coach Mike Gennette 
said. "His presence on the court is intimidating alone. He's 6-foot-3 and he 
has the deepest voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Gennette is confident Zelenovic will win at least one national title, though 
he might feel a bit nervous with his mother and brother watching.  
</P>
<P>
 While he spent ample time at tennis this week, Zelenovic devoted as much time 
as possible with his mother and brother, who will be in California for two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he got a job as a biologist with a company that makes heart valves and 
he plans to attend medical school eventually, Zelenovic knows it may be another 
four years before he sees them again. 
</P>
<P>
 And as long as his country is at war, he says, he will not return. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what I really wish I could do?" Zelenovic said. "I wish I could walk 
down my old street and see all my neighbors. What's happening there is really 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
 But with his mother and brother present at his college graduation, the sadness 
melted away temporarily. So far, it's been the happiest day of his life.

MAINE COMPETITION FIRST FOR NORTHRIDGE; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: MATADORS ARE FAVORED

 As odd as it sounds, Cal State Northridge's toughest opponent in this 
weekend's four-team NCAA Division I softball regional could be its first -- 
unranked Maine, a team making its first postseason appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (46-7), ranked third in the country, tends to be lackadaisical in 
openers.The team has trouble with firsts, losing its first game of the season, 
the first game of four doubleheaders and the first game of a midseason 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to overcome a couple of things," Northridge Coach Gary Torgeson 
said. "We still gotta be able to put the bunt down occasionally and learn how 
to play first games." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which is playing host to one of eight regional tournaments, will 
face Maine (32-15) today at 3 p.m., following the regional opener between No. 
10 Washington (43-19) and No. 20 Cal State Fullerton (32-27) at 12:30. 
</P>
<P>
 The double-elimination tournament continues Saturday, with the winners of 
today's games facing off at 10 a.m. and the losers at 1 p.m. By Sunday, two 
teams will remain. The championship game is at 1 p.m. and the winner will 
advance to the College World Series at Oklahoma City, May 26-30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, making their third postseason appearance since moving up to the 
Division I level four years ago, played Washington and Fullerton earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge beat Washington, 1-0, on Feb. 19 in the San Diego State tournament. 
The game was decided on the basis of the international tiebreaker rule in the 
bottom of the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which finished third in the Pacific 10 Conference, is in its 
second season of competition and is making its first postseason appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton beat Northridge in the Matadors' opener, 1-0, but dropped the next 
two games, 4-0 and 1-0.

MUSTAFA POINTING FOR TITLE; COLLEGE TRACK: MOORPARK DECATHLETE HOPES TO SCORE 
7,000 AND WIN STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>

<P>
 Tallying 7,000 points in the decathlon might seem far-fetched for someone who 
has yet to top 6,500, but Moorpark College Coach Doni Green figures sophomore 
Isaiah Mustafa is ready for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa will shoot for 7,000 at the state junior college track and field 
championships that start today at Cerritos College.  
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark sophomore, runner-up in last year's state championships, totaled 
a personal best of 6,417 points to finish second in the Southern California 
championships last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Kanowsky of Long Beach City trailed Mustafa by 393 points after six of 
10 events, but finished strongly to win with 6,557 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa's fall to second began in the discus -- the decathlon's seventh event 
-- when he threw 102 feet 3 inches to Kanowsky's 117-0, and continued in the 
pole vault (11-7 3/4 to 13-3 1/2) and javelin (138-1 to 183-9), but Green says 
Mustafa has improved dramatically in the discus, pole vault and 110-meter high 
hurdles since. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the potential to score at least 6,800 points if he hits all his 
events," Green said. "And 7,000 is possible with someone like him." 
</P>
<P>
 A score of 6,800 might be needed to win the decathlon. Alphonso Davis of 
Sacramento City totaled 6,698 points to win the Northern California 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa also will compete in the long jump, an event in which he finished 
third in the Southern California championships with a personal best of 23-6 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean McKeown (shotput, discus) and Mike Esparza (3,000-meter steeplechase) of 
Moorpark, Isaac Turner (800) of Glendale and Amy Blackburn (discus) of Ventura 
are also expected to contend for top-three finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meet begins at 2 p.m. with the men's hammer throw, followed by the 
heptathlon 100 hurdles at 2:30. The meet starts at 1 p.m. Saturday with the 
decathlon 110 high hurdles.

OAK PARK GETS LITTLE SHOT IN ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak Park High Coach Mike Bolyog feared that his baseball team would sputter 
into postseason play today without its spark plug -- 5-foot-3, 125-pound right 
fielder Tyler Blondi. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' oft-injured leadoff hitter underwent surgery two weeks ago to 
repair a torn tendon in his throwing shoulder -- a procedure that would require 
six months to a year of rehabilitation. But when Dr. Stephen Snyder probed 
Blondi's arm with an arthroscope, he found not a torn tendon but too much 
tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called Buford's Syndrome," said Blondi, a junior. "Less than 1% of the 
world has it. My ligaments are a lot bigger and there are a lot more of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Blondi said his shoulder pops out of joint sometimes when he dives for a ball 
or cocks his arm to throw. But plagued by nothing more than a congenital 
abnormality, Blondi was cleared by Snyder to play, provided he faithfully 
performs special exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 After missing six games, Blondi last week got a warm greeting from Bolyog and 
Oak Park when he returned to the lineup. He helped lead the Eagles (13-5-1) to 
a share of the Tri-Valley League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park plays host to Templeton today in the first round of the Southern 
Section Division V playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's suburb defensive player and he makes things happen on offense," Bolyog 
said. "He's a throwback to 1965, when dudes played real ball. He will do 
whatever you ask. He'll run through a wall for you. He reminds me of (former 
Dodger shortstop) Maury Wills." 
</P>
<P>
 Blondi is batting only .237 but has stolen 19 bases in 21 attempts and has an 
on-base percentage of .491. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries have hampered his athletic career. His role as a defensive back and 
kick returner on the football team was limited because of a broken left ankle 
that required pins and two surgeries last summer. He suffered torn ligaments in 
his right ankle during soccer season but rushed back to play in a league 
championship match against Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Blondi is still hobbled by those injuries and must wear ankle braces when he 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always the smallest guy out there, but he makes up for it with speed and 
attitude," said Tom Blondi, Tyler's father. "It breaks my heart that he works 
so hard and he gets hurt all the time. But he never gets down." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tyler: "I go for everything I can. I dive a lot. I do anything I can to 
make a play. I've been getting injured since my freshman year. But when I get 
injured, sometimes it makes me play better. I hate slacking off. It's not my 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 When Tyler awoke from his anesthesia-induced sleep in the hospital not knowing 
the condition of his shoulder, the first thing his mother, Barbara, said was, 
"Guess what. You get to play football next fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler, still groggy, leaned forward a little and said: "Let's go."

 Cal State Northridge baseball standouts Eric Gillespie and Jason Shanahan, who 
tied for the team lead in batting with a .342 average, were selected to the 
All-Western Athletic Conference West Division team. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan, a junior first baseman, won the conference triple crown, batting 
.416 in WAC play with six home runs and 30 runs batted in.He led the Matadors 
in homers (nine), RBIs (50) and stolen bases (seven). Shanahan, a switch-hitter 
from Missoula, Mont., homered against each West Division foe. He hit .394 
against left-handers and .318 against right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie, a freshman catcher from Long Beach Millikan High, hit six homers 
and had 42 RBIs, despite spending most of the season batting leadoff. He hit 
safely in 47 of 55 games and led the team with 80 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie, who bats left-handed, had 22 multihit games and never went two 
consecutive games without a hit. He struck out only 17 times in 234 at-bats and 
hit safely in 21 of 24 WAC games. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie and Shanahan are expected to play this summer for the Mat-su Miners 
of the Alaskan Summer League. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming's Jim Gattis, a North Hollywood product, was named the WAC East 
Division coach of the year. STEVE ELLING

CHAMINADE'S DESMOND TAKES JOB AT VALLEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Desmond has resigned as Chaminade High baseball coach to become an 
assistant coach at Valley College, he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I no longer wanted to be a head coach," Desmond said."I wanted to learn under 
a good, solid head coach (Chris Johnson)." 
</P>
<P>
 Desmond led the Eagles to a 17-10 record and a berth in the Division I 
playoffs this season, their first appearance in the playoffs since they began 
playing at the Division I level in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the season ended Tuesday with a 12-2 loss to Channel Islands in the 
wild-card game, Desmond said he was not disappointed in his team, which some 
picked to win the Mission League. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are 12 years old and dream of having Farrah Fawcett as your wife, 
does that mean that now you are disappointed with the wife you have? No," 
Desmond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Desmond was 30-23 in two seasons at Chaminade. The Eagles were 4-22 the year 
before Desmond took over the team. Desmond, 30, also coached for five seasons 
at Highland Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to miss the players at Chaminade because they gave me an awful 
lot," he said. JEFF FLETCHER

POP REVIEW; SUBDUDES THEY ARE NOT IN SOULFUL SETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subdudes may belong to the k.d. lang we-spell-our-name-with-small-letters 
club, but this New Orleans R & B band's talent is writ large enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing at the Coach House on Wednesday, the subdudes had no more use for 
slick and fancy trappings than they did for that discarded capital S. Instead, 
these four unassuming fellows offered good singin' and good playin' in settings 
soulful, bluesy or funky. 
</P>
<P>
 Soulfulness comes almost too easily to the subdudes. Tommy Malone, the 
guitarist and main singer, showed a natural proclivity for a high, plaintive, 
well-controlled cry in which the airways fill with so much emotion that the 
vocalist seems about to choke. 
</P>
<P>
 Think Steve Winwood, and you'll have a pretty close idea of the effect. Add to 
that Malone's sweet touch on acoustic lead guitar and occasional rougher 
sallies with electric guitar, and, voila -- the subdudes had a somewhat smaller 
version (in physical size as well as talent) of Los Lobos' wondrous 
singer-guitarist, David Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 The subdudes surrounded their point man with fine harmonies and lots of 
mellifluous accordion and keyboard work from John Magnie. Percussionist Steve 
Amedee added an idiosyncratic, back-to-basics approach by keeping the beat 
mainly by whacking a tambourine with a stick, somehow generating a thick, 
muffled thwack that made you look around futilely to see where he had hidden 
that bass drum you were hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The subdudes also brought along a couple of very helpful guests: guitarist 
Willie Williams, of New Orleans' Zion Harmonizers gospel group, jolted the 
rhythm section whenever he jumped in. And hand-picked opening act Pat 
McLaughlin, one of the best roots-music singer-guitarists around, lent his 
robust voice to a couple of songs. 
</P>
<P>
 All these elements combined in a two-hour set full of interactive playing and 
an easy, closely attuned interchange between the players. At times, the 
subdudes, who have been together for 10 years, gathered tightly behind the 
seated Amedee, looking like a family posing for its portrait as they sought a 
close-in musical connection. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing lacking in the two-hour show was striking original 
material -- a flaw that keeps the subdudes from being major dudes, despite 
their first-class abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The band makes the most of Malone's freely emotional voice by injecting a 
subtle humor or affirmative rhythms into songs that are fundamentally yearning 
or hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the songs that painted the sorrow in life also could point 
toward ways of coping with it ("Poverty," a burdened-but-surging social 
commentary from the band's new album, "Annunciation," was a good example). 
</P>
<P>
 That many-dimensioned portrayal of emotions, a key to good songwriting, was 
abundant, but indelible melodies and grabbing arrangements were harder to come 
by. That meant the subdudes' instrumental workouts and extended vocal vamps 
were the gist of their set. They stretched out like '70s vintage Van Morrison 
or Little Feat, but without the same songwriting flair. 
</P>
<P>
 While the band carefully regulated the mood between dark and light, easygoing 
and charged, a certain sameness settled in. The unorthodox percussion approach 
had the virtue of simplicity and ingenuity, but one wished for the sharp, 
syncopating crack of a snare drum or the snaky shiver of a high-hat cymbal to 
accent the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Malone, as soulful as he was, his vocal hue changed too little from 
song to song. 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, the subdudes' friend, McLaughlin, was more involving, even if 
he doesn't have as pure a tone as Malone. Besides R & B influences, McLaughlin 
had a lot of country in his voice. He could sound like John Hiatt, or like some 
combination of the Band's great vocal triumvirate of Levon Helm, Rick Danko and 
Richard Manuel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He played his solo acoustic set at a passionate peak, oblivious to an 
obnoxious minority in the house that preferred to spend 38 minutes in 
bothersome chatter rather than open up and let something new and rewarding seep 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin, whose recently released "Unglued" is his first album in six years, 
didn't let that resistance stop him from playing as vigorous a solo set as 
anybody this side of Neil Young. 
</P>
<P>
 His guitar chops were literally that: He chopped at his strings with a firm 
right hand, laying down a rumbling rhythm fat enough to dance to. McLaughlin 
didn't hesitate, stomping his feet and lumbering about as his own music led him 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin's songs had that double edge as well. It enabled hangdog humor to 
intrude upon songs like "Knockin' Around Nashville," a country ballad that was 
primarily a George Jones-style confession of defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin did get through to most of the house, judging from the strong 
applause he drew. Here's hoping he finds his way back here before long, perhaps 
with a band that will showcase his talents as an electric rocker. We got an 
appetizing taste of that in the handful of songs he sang during guest spots 
with the subdudes, including a cover of the Temptations' "I Wish It Would 
Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 On a night of roots-rock and soul experts, the opening act, 9 Days Wonder, 
played edgy garage rock that was ill-matched to what came after. But the 
hard-charging home stretch of its set carried an atypical sense of hopefulness 
and suggested that the Tustin-area band would be worth hearing out in the right 
setting.

THE COMICS CRUSADE; ORANGE COUNTY PARENTS ARE PROTESTING MATERIAL THEY SAY IS 
INAPPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN. RETAILERS AND INDUSTRY OFFICIALS SAY CENSORSHIP IS 
NOT THE ANSWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Candy Kanney of Tustin didn't have much time. Her kids would be home from 
school soon. Pushing the documents across the table, her nice-to-meet-you face 
turned serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Comic books, six of them, purchased at the grocery store, toy stores and 
specialty shops. She used to let her boys buy them to encourage reading -- but 
that, she says, was before she took a good look inside. 
</P>
<P>
 After actually reading them, Kanney says she found the dialogue dark -- to say 
the least. The passage from an issue of "Saint Sinner" she picked up a few 
months ago in the supermarket was highlighted in florescent marker as an 
example of comic book conversation most parents are unaware of. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gods kill their parents," says a sorcerer to a young boy. "Their deaths will 
make you a god." 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe that children can buy these things?" she asked, thumbing 
through a copy of "Evil Ernie," its pages filled with decapitated bodies, women 
in G-strings and lots of blood. "Parents aren't aware of what's in them; they 
just give their kid the money, thinking all comics are appropriate for 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Some have been banned from the classroom and taken from the bedroom, yet the 
staple-bound books and their young consumers continue to feed a billion-dollar 
business. Not all of the books are violent, but there's enough concern among 
Orange County parents to generate a small crusade against material they don't 
think should be available to children. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the camps are divided. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents such as Kanney say their pleas for "accountability" and some sort of 
rating system have been casually dismissed by retailers and comic book 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic book companies, however, say the more violent books are aimed toward 
teen-agers and young adults -- not children. They say their system of 
"self-censorship" is sufficient, and that it's not their responsibility to 
baby-sit the nation's children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have to monitor what their children read, listen to and watch," says 
Detective Comics spokeswoman Martha Thomases. "I don't think you get a day 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Several comic book industry officials cite the First Amendment as protection 
from censorship. And Comics Magazine Assn. of America president Michael 
Silberkleit reminds concerned parents that members of the national association 
are regulated by the watch-dog Comics Code Authority, a body of American 
publishers who monitor the books before sale. The guidelines of the code 
restrict the depiction of violence and adult situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was developed in the early 1950s after a Senate subcommittee urged 
the industry to clean up its act. Now, if the books adhere to the guidelines of 
the code, a small stamp is placed on the upper right corner of the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents up in arms about comic book violence are not impressed with the stamp 
of approval, saying self-regulation is not enough. They say that even the books 
with the Comic Code stamp contain excessive violence and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers in Orange County say they are busiest Wednesday and Thursday 
afternoons when the new issues arrive. A steady flow of children, teen-agers 
and adults lines the counters for the latest installments of their continuing 
sagas. 
</P>
<P>
 Will, a Costa Mesa 10-year-old, was leafing through the stacks of comics at 
Superior Comics in Costa Mesa one Saturday when his mother walked in with a $30 
gift certificate her son had received for his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she's never actually examined Will's three cardboard boxes of comics 
but added that she trusts her boy's taste. Looking around the store, however, 
she says the sex and depiction of women in some of today's comics bothers her 
more than the violence. Like many kids his age, her son often tries to 
duplicate the drawings in the books -- right down to overdeveloped women in 
next-to-nothing attire -- and Mom often doesn't like the result. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the women in them . . . with these huge (breasts) . . . I try to tell 
him that women don't look like that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the encouragement of Tustin Unified School District Supt. David Andrews, 
Kanney began speaking in February at local PTA and PTO meetings about what she 
calls the increasingly darker side of today's comic books -- a parental 
awareness crusade she hopes to take nationwide. The victims, she says, are good 
parents with good intentions who simply want Junior to read. A lot of them 
haven't even been inside a comic book store, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want people to know what's out there," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Prietto of Santa Ana says she found a comic portraying human sacrifice in 
her 12-year-old son's closet last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really shocked," she says. "I was totally unaware; you could have 
knocked me over with a feather." 
</P>
<P>
 Silberkleit says he is concerned that parents such as Kanney are painting the 
industry with a broad brush, suggesting that all comics are violent and 
sexually explicit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should know that not all comics are bad," says Silberkleit, who is 
also chairman of Archie Comics. "I can't account for all my fellow publishers, 
but their are there are many of us that wouldn't touch that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Silberkleit defends his characters as "still good and wholesome," and says he 
has big plans for Archie in the future, including a movie deal. But he also 
defends the right of comic book store owners to choose what they want to sell 
from their stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't stop the retailer from selling something that's going to make 
him some money," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Archie Comics sells about a 1.5 million copies a month, with a dozen different 
titles. Larger companies such as Marvel Comics sell about 12 million comic 
books a month, Silberkleit says. The industry crashed early last year, when too 
many titles and investors saturated the market, he says, but business is 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 John Beck, owner of Comicmania in Fullerton, says that the violence in many of 
today's cartoon books is simply a reflection of a violent society. He and other 
retailers contend that violence is on television, in the movies and on the 
street, so they aren't surprised that it's made its way into comic books. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the books are marked "for the mature reader," a designation that 
confines them to a special section in his Fullerton store for customers over 
age 18. But like the Comic Code stamp of approval, the "mature reader" stamp is 
a self-regulation measure, not a federal law restricting their sale to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck says he will fire any employee who sells a comic book with a 
mature-reader label to an (under 18) . . . patron but added that it's a 
judgment call, and that not all comic book store owners follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we refuse to sell a kid a book, he just brings back one of his parents, 
usually Dad, to buy it for him. . . .There's nothing you can do when they do 
that," he says. Kids also pick up copies of comics at swap meets and garage 
sales, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews, the Tustin Unified School District superintendent, says he was 
surprised by the availability of comics with violent content and has encouraged 
parental education on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was somewhat shocked," Andrews says. "I didn't realize that kids could buy 
these things at the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews says that he talks to parents at school meetings, urging them to start 
letter-writing campaigns and other measures aimed at comic book violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that we have to do something to manage what kids can buy in the 
market," he says. "There's too much violence in our society. I personally, from 
an objective standpoint, believe that children are learning violent behavior 
from what they see and read." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavilions General Manager Bob Johnson, who oversees 33 stores in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties, says he decided not to purchase three comic book titles 
six months ago after he saw the violence they contained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked that (the violence) was to that degree," he says, explaining 
that the "Saint Sinner," "Sabre Tooth" and "Maxx" comics he saw contained 
"overt expressions of violence and comments about suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just saw no redeeming qualities in carrying these particular products," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 A Marvel Comics spokesman says "Saint Sinner" was canceled about six months 
ago, and "Sabre Tooth" was a limited edition series that ran out about the same 
time. Executives at Image Comics of Anaheim, which publishes the "Maxx" title, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comics are also unwelcome at W.R. Nelson Elementary School in Tustin, 
says principal Connie Smith. She says last year several students, mostly boys, 
began bringing comic book trading cards to class, swapping them at lunchtime 
and recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first assumption was that they were like baseball cards, harmless, not a 
problem," she recalled. "But I couldn't believe what was on the cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who keeps the confiscated cards in the desk drawer of her office, says 
she is shocked by the transformation of yesterday's super-heroes into today's 
anti-heroes. Now the good guys scowl and pose with scantily dressed women 
toting semi-automatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the teachers were from the era I was, when there was Archie, Superman 
and Catwoman," Smith says, "It's not the same; they've changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Marjee Ellis of Tustin says she was introduced to the changing world of comic 
books last year, when she didn't think to look through a generous donation of 
comics she received for her school district's "Dinosaur Dash" fund-raiser. 
After all, comic books have always been a fun reading incentive, she remembered 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I started getting calls from parents," says the 42-year-old mother of 
two. "They looked at them and were concerned about the violence. . . . I still 
feel bad when I talk about it. It was an innocent thing, but I was the one who 
solicited them; I stuffed them into 3,000 goody bags." 
</P>
<P>
 Says comic store owner Beck of the young readers: "They want the violence. The 
more violent books, that's what the kids want."

'I'M STILL FIGHTING'; HE SUFFERED THE DEVASTATION OF A JAILHOUSE GANG RAPE. 
NOW, STEPHEN DONALDSON RESOLVES TO STOP A CRIME THAT OTHERS WOULD RATHER KEEP 
QUIET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was only trying to protest the Vietnam War and follow a creed of nonviolent 
resistance. But after he was gang-raped 50 times in the Washington, D.C., jail, 
Stephen Donaldson started a war of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began on a hot August afternoon in 1973, when he was arrested at a 
White House pray-in. For reasons of conscience, the Quaker activist refused to 
post $10 bail and was placed in a cell with other first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, without warning, he was sent to a wing with hardened criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that some inmates wanted to meet him, Donaldson went to their cell. 
Within seconds, the men beat him savagely, tore off his clothes and repeatedly 
assaulted him. He managed to escape two days later, and only after his 
attackers whispered that a guard was coming down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands before him, Donaldson was physically and emotionally 
traumatized by prison rape. It would take him years to recover. Unlike most 
victims, however, he was determined to speak out against a crime that has 
reached epidemic proportions in some U.S. prisons -- and is rarely discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't pretend it never happened," he says. "Some prison officials figure 
people will keep quiet, and I'm convinced the D.C. jail set me up, to teach me 
a political lesson. But they miscalculated with me. I was just beginning to 
fight back, and I'm still fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Donaldson is president of Stop Prison Rape, the only national advocacy 
group focused solely on the problem. He debates the issue in public forums and 
helped draft a friend of the court brief in Farmer vs. Brennan, a watershed 
prison rape case awaiting a Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, he's scheduled to testify in a hearing on prison rape before the 
Massachusetts Legislature, and he'll deliver a shocking estimate: Based on 
several decades of studies, Donaldson says, there are more than a 
quarter-million sexual assaults on inmates each year in American correctional 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, a handful of prosecutors, attorneys, psychologists, 
religious leaders and politicians are trying to root out a cancer that is 
deeply ingrained in the criminal justice system, yet traditionally rouses 
little concern. Indeed, at a time when anger over crime is escalating, many 
find it hard to feel compassion for men who are abused behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican and member of the U.S. Senate 
Judiciary Committee, says society pays a heavy price for such attitudes: "We 
ignore this prison-rape problem at our peril, because there is a great 
potential for these victims to commit worse crimes when they get out of jail. 
For anyone who cares about safety, it's a matter of common sense as well as 
compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 Specter speaks from experience; he was district attorney of Philadelphia in 
1968 when a pioneering study was done of prison rape in that city's jail 
system. The conclusions were devastating: Nearly 1,000 men were raped each year 
in custody, and there were no programs to control the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, studies in other states have found similar horrors, as well as 
evidence that many inmates are coerced into long-term sexual "coupling" with 
stronger prisoners simply to ward off the possibility of repeated gang rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been little national response. Meanwhile, AIDS is spreading 
rapidly in prisons and jails. In 1989, there were 14.65 AIDS cases per 100,000 
in the general population, but the rate for state and federal prisons was 202 
cases per 100,000, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Vermont and Mississippi provide condoms to inmates who request them, as 
do jails in Philadelphia, San Francisco and New York City. Nationwide, there 
are an estimated 50,000 prisoners infected with HIV and the numbers are growing 
each year, says Nancy Mahon, director of the New York-based AIDS in Prison 
Project. There are few HIV counseling programs for those in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a powder keg waiting to explode," she says. "As we put more people in 
jail, you have to wonder about the medical consequences, and AIDS is one of 
them. If you put a kid in jail for petty theft and then he gets raped, there's 
a whole downward cycle for him. And HIV could be the final insult." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a nightmare without end for victims, and every so often a gruesome prison 
rape story finds its way into the media. Then it's forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days after his trauma, Donaldson held a news conference in Washington 
and later appeared on talk shows. He was the first American to personally 
describe such sexual terror, and he hoped reforms would follow. By year's end, 
however, his story had faded from view. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public indifference on this is staggering," Donaldson says. "And it's 
harder for someone like me, because the trauma continues to haunt you. You can 
be tormented by this. So often, there's just nowhere to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once a newspaper journalist, Donaldson's life changed radically after 1973. He 
now spends much of his time corresponding with inmates across the country and 
pestering public officials to focus on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a thankless task: Stop Prison Rape has little funding and only several 
hundred members nationwide. Donaldson, 47, fights to keep it afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 A complex and thoughtful man, he speaks bitterly about the past but never 
lapses into self-pity. His black jeans, long sideburns and fatigue jackets set 
him apart from the pin-striped world he once seemed destined to enter, and the 
harsh, unforgiving stories he tells distance him even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson can be a jarring character at first glance. Visitors gape at his 
Stop Prison Rape baseball cap and he raises eyebrows with a belt buckle reading 
"Punk." The word is more than a referral to his taste in rock music. It's also 
prison slang for the passive sexual role he was forced into behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet shock value is only part of his persona. Once Donaldson starts talking 
about rape, there's no doubting his gravitas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy knocked me off my feet," says Deborah Denno, a Fordham University 
law professor, who invited Donaldson to address her seminar on rape. "He was 
very smart and there was a depth of human emotion and feeling to what he said. 
. . . His message is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Norfolk, Va., to a military family, Donaldson's given name was Robert 
Martin. He was high school valedictorian and attended Columbia University. 
Friends and family members recall him as a smart, outgoing person who seemed to 
have a golden future as a reporter, a lawyer or just about anything else he 
wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had tremendous promise. He thought he might conquer the world, but after 
what happened I don't think he looks at the world that way," says his 
stepmother, Brigitta Martin. "It altered his life forever. He's not the same 
driven person I used to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson describes himself as a survivor, but he's been wrestling with the 
demons of self-confidence and his own sexuality for nearly 21 years, largely as 
the result of his prison experience. Personal justice has also proved elusive: 
Angered that prosecutors declined to investigate corrections officers for what 
he says was their role in his rape, he refused to cooperate with a grand jury 
and the D.C. jail case was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent years, Donaldson's personal and professional life spun out of 
control. He was briefly homeless, struggled to establish a literary career and 
was arrested twice for drug possession. Although both charges were dropped, he 
was jailed in North Carolina and Virginia facilities and, he says, again raped. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youth, Donaldson thought himself bisexual. But the D.C. assaults 
shattered his self-image. He changed his name, tried to lose himself in the 
world of punk rock music and sought relief in Far Eastern spiritualism. 
</P>
<P>
 The cracking point for the Navy veteran came in 1980, when he demanded 
treatment for a badly cut hand at the Veterans Hospital in the Bronx and was 
told to come back later. Enraged, he pulled a handgun and shot out the window 
in a hospital door. He served four years in federal prison, where Donaldson 
says he was yet again assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most parolees, Donaldson got counseling after his release and learned 
to deal with rape trauma survivors syndrome. He's since been trained as a rape 
counselor and has produced a pioneering set of audio tapes to help prisoners 
cope with the experience. A New York resident, he's working on an encyclopedia 
of homosexuality and is a well-known punk rock journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might wonder, how did a pacifist like me, a Quaker, go from nonviolent 
resistance to being a gunman?" he asks. "And the answer is very simple. What 
happened to me during and after the D.C. jail is an old story." 
</P>
<P>
 And as American as apple pie. Take a gullible kid, put him through the hell of 
prison rape, then set him loose on the streets. Watch the rage build, until he 
explodes in violence and returns to jail. The cycle is endless. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In the United States, it goes back at least 170 years. In 1824, the Rev. Louis 
Dwight, a New England prison reformer, toured many jails and lamented a 
barbaric culture where stronger, older prisoners repeatedly raped younger 
inmates, turning them into sexual slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since October, 1824, I have visited most of the prisons on two routes, 
between Massachusetts and Georgia, and (in) the New England States and New 
York," Dwight wrote. "And I have found melancholy testimony to establish one 
general fact . . . that boys are prostituted to the lust of old convicts. 
Nature and humanity cry aloud for redemption from this dreadful degradation." 
</P>
<P>
 It's gotten worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no statistics documenting the prevalence, scores of court 
cases brought by victims and a handful of studies suggest that sexual attacks 
behind bars are widespread. Yet they are rarely reported because of a code of 
silence that threatens informers with death. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, corrections officials are reluctant to probe such behavior because 
it suggests that they've lost control of their institutions. As a result, the 
overwhelming number of cases rarely make it to court. 
</P>
<P>
 One typical administrative response is to place victims in protective custody, 
away from other convicts. But the solitude drives many men mad, and there have 
been documented cases of victims raped in seclusion. For the most part, 
thousands of vulnerable prisoners continue to be placed in cells or large 
holding areas with seasoned sexual offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1968 Philadelphia study, only 3% of the estimated 1,000 yearly attacks 
were reported to officials. In 1982, researchers at a California prison found 
that 14% of inmates had been assaulted. Yet the real number was thought to be 
higher, because many men were reluctant to admit being raped. A New York study 
found that 28% of prisoners had been sexually attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The only current study of jailhouse rape is being conducted in the Nebraska 
prison system by Cindy Struckman-Johnson, a professor at the University of 
South Dakota. Her preliminary data, based on confidential questionnaires, 
confirms the 14% sexual assault rate found in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the answers we get are truly heartbreaking," Johnson reports. "Young 
prisoners say they either fight off a guy, or they're destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, one witness described a young man's gang rape: 
</P>
<P>
 "They had the kid on the floor. About 12 fellows took turns with him. This 
went on for two hours. . . . He lay there for about 20 minutes and (one) came 
over and pulled his pants down and raped him again. When he got done, (another) 
did it again, and about four or five others got on him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why does it happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Many criminologists believe prison rape mirrors crime in the outside world. 
It's a symbol of power for the attacker, a vehicle for aggression. Inmates 
battle for dominance in the racially tense, overcrowded worlds of most jails 
and prisons, and, for many, rape is synonymous with strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't many weapons in a prison, and so the penis becomes a weapon of 
control," says Wayne Wooden, coordinator of the Criminal Justice and 
Corrections program at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. "It's 
how prisoners assert themselves and show others that they're unassailable." 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden, who co-authored the 1982 study of sexual abuse in a California prison, 
adds that many men are targeted for attack the minute they enter confinement. 
Typical victims are young, slightly built males without knowledge of prison 
culture or street-fighting techniques. Although homosexuals are obvious 
targets, most victims are heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Once behind bars, predators compete to see who will be the first to attack 
them -- or "turn them out," in prison parlance. After a man is assaulted, word 
spreads rapidly through the institution and he's identified as a punk. His body 
belongs to someone else as long as he is in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few female rape victims must repay their rapist for the violence he inflicted 
upon them by devoting their existence to servicing his every need," write 
Louisiana prison inmates Wilbert Rideau and Ron Wikberg in their book, "Life 
Sentences." 
</P>
<P>
 "But rape victims in the world of prison must." 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate consequences of jailhouse rape are devastating. Many victims are 
pressured into believing they have been turned into women, that their 
masculinity is gone. They frequently go into shock and some attempt suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your biggest problem is that few prisoners who are raped get prompt 
psychological counseling," says Maud Easter, who chairs the New York State 
Coalition Against Sexual Assault. "Someone who has experienced this needs 
counseling immediately . They're in pain, and they've got nowhere to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Donaldson felt after his gang rape: stunned, bloodied and utterly 
alone. He relives these memories in the wrenching letters sent to him by 
prisoners across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these inmates committed serious crimes, while others protest their 
innocence. None expected that sexual trauma would be part of their punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Writes "Michael," from an Arizona prison: 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1974, I was 18 years old, youthfully dumb and full of fun. Charged 
with four counts of petty forgery, I landed in the Pima Co. jail in Tucson, 
Arizona. I was brutally beaten, savagely and repeatedly raped.  
</P>
<P>
 For LeShawn Cummings, at the state prison in Tehachapi, Calif., the trauma is 
heightened by the belief that authorities don't believe him: 
</P>
<P>
 Between 10-18-93 and 11-3-93, I was sodomized and forced to commit oral 
copulation against my will in my cell. My cellmate would threaten to beat me up 
if I did not have sex with him. I told the correctional officers but they did 
not believe me and sent me back to the cell to endure more pain.  
</P>
<P>
 Another Arizona convict writes that, at 23, he was gang-raped. After a 
hospital stay, officials put him in protective custody: 
</P>
<P>
 It's been 18 months now. I don't talk to no prisoners at all to this day. I 
don't have no money. Nothing. No TV or stereo. I sit in my cell and cry a lot. 
I've cut my wrists three times. The state didn't do anything. * 
</P>
<P>
 That's a common complaint. Yet many correctional officials say the problem is 
either overblown or impossible to document. They suggest that U.S. jails and 
prisons do a much better job controlling rape than is generally believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy Rauch, an officer with the American Corrections Assn., argues that 
sexual assaults are more prevalent in society than in prisons. It would be 
impossible to guarantee complete security, he says, because that would mean 
hiring a guard for each of the nation's 1.2 million inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACA, an accrediting organization that includes prisons and jails in all 50 
states, is aware of the issue, Rauch says, but adds: "It's not considered to be 
a nationwide problem. And I'd ask you: Is a warden more culpable when someone 
is attacked in prison than the mayor of Los Angeles is if a policeman isn't 
watching your house when it's robbed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials say rape isn't a problem in their institutions. At Rikers 
Island in New York, the nation's largest municipal jail complex, spokesman Tom 
Antenen says sexual assaults are few. At the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which 
houses 84,000 prisoners in 75 facilities, spokesman Dan Dunne suggests that 
rape is "relatively low." Neither offers statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Corrections does not keep specific records of 
sexual assaults in its 28 prisons. Records were logged from 1970 to 1988, 
however, and they ranged from a low of four in 1973 to a high of 64 in 1987. 
Currently, there are 121,800 inmates in the system, the nation's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the sprawling county jail system reported 52 sexual assaults 
last year, says Jake Katz, custody management specialist with the Sheriff's 
Department. The system holds a daily average of 21,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 On rare occasions, prosecutors file charges against prison rapists. But even 
when victims win, the victory is a Pyrrhic one. Michael Wheat, an assistant 
U.S. attorney in San Diego, believes that he is the first federal prosecutor to 
successfully bring charges against one prisoner accused of raping another. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1993 case, inmate Gary Gonzaga told a U.S. District Court that he had 
been attacked by Frederick Garcia-Cruz while both were in custody at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. The defendant eventually pleaded guilty to 
aggravated assault, adding five years to his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased with the outcome, but it's only a drop in the bucket," says 
Wheat, who had to persuade Gonzaga to participate in the case. "You're dealing 
with inmates, and juries aren't likely to find either side sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a play is set in hell, you can't cast it with angels." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most inmates never get as far as a courtroom, and protection comes at a price. 
Donaldson, like thousands of other prisoners, took on the role of a punk and 
serviced stronger men to avoid further gang rapes. While corrections officials 
usually forbid any sexual activity, many passively permit such relationships 
because they promote stability in their institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Donaldson says life as a punk deepened his self-awareness. He 
believes that he's become more sensitive to the brutalization of women, and 
suggests that some prison relationships made him feel wanted and loved. 
</P>
<P>
 The war still rages in his head. 
</P>
<P>
 It erupts when he addresses a recent lunch seminar at New York University Law 
School. Bearing an armful of Stop Prison Rape literature, he sits quietly at 
the head of a table and watches while students munch cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Donaldson grabs their attention. He plays the beginning of a cassette he 
produced, "An Ounce of Prevention," which dramatizes a prison rape: 40 seconds 
of terror, pleading, muffled screams and sobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience looks shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all of you were male, that could be you as a victim," he tells the crowd, 
his eyes sweeping the room. "You'd be meat on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next hour, there's silence as Donaldson tells his story and criticizes 
many groups -- feminists, gays, victims' rights organizers, politicians, 
judges, attorneys and the general public -- for what he calls a cruel 
indifference to the trauma of men in U.S. prisons and jails. 
</P>
<P>
 There's applause, but then a hostile questioner shatters the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't fear of rape a good deterrent to crime?" the student asks. "And aren't 
prisons supposed to be terrible places? When you talk about using taxpayers' 
money for these programs . . . I couldn't justify that." 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson fixes the questioner with a hard, penetrating stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you been in prison?" he asks. "Do you know anyone in prison?" 
</P>
<P>
 The student shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then how can you say such a thing?" Donaldson demands with a look of pain and 
incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could you possibly understand?"

 "If the test has such a large cloud of controversy surrounding it, then why 
are we taking it? I would take the test only if it is going to be graded 
carefully and fairly, and if there is a legitimate point to the test. I would 
not want a person to read about my personal life. I think the people

 "I didn't take the test, but I had to help (an administrator) organize it and

 "Personally, I thought that the test was a waste of time. It's nice to know 
how our school would compare to others, and I think that it is necessary to 
have a test like that, but the questions asked were nothing like I have ever 
done in class. If they wanted to test us, they should have done it on something 
we were familiar with. I don't think it should have taken five days, since they 
don't look at everyone's results anyway. A simple essay would have been fine."

 "I don't think the CLAS test is a real indicator of a student's writing 
ability. The prompts are not as such that a 'full' essay can be written. When I 
took the test, my essay prompt was based on an excerpt from the novel 'Woman 
Warrior' by Maxine Hong Kingston. The essay was a judgment call on whether or 
not something taking place before the excerpt had really happened. Since it was 
a matter of opinion and there were hardly any facts supporting either side, you 
had nothing to work with. With all the other 'necessary' tests we're forced to 
take, this one was pointless."

 "The test seems pretty good for the most part, but some of the questions I

</P>
<P>
 Desi Nothdorft, 17, senior, Ocean View What Is CLAS? 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System -- known as the CLAS test -- 
attempts to evaluate students' critical thinking skills as well as knowledge 
and to measure performance against statewide standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Board of Education requires schools to administer the test to 
fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-graders by May 31. Not everyone is taking the 
test, however. The Newport-Mesa school district decided to test only students 
who had a permission slip signed by parents; the Fullerton district said it 
would not administer the test by the deadline because it was received too late 
to prepare students. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was introduced last year, the test has been plagued by controversy 
over inaccuracies in scoring and charges that it intrudes on the privacy of 
students by asking them to relate questions to their personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled this month that the test does not 
violate the privacy provisions of the state Education Code.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; CURFEW: MINOR INCONVENIENCE?; LAWS: MANY 
COMMUNITIES ARE TRYING TO KEEP UNSUPERVISED TEENS OFF THE STREETS AT NIGHT, BUT 
INCONSISTENCIES CONFUSE SOME YOUTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Friday night, and you're heading to the coffee shop with friends. Nothing 
sounds better than a cup of steamy hot chocolate with whipped cream and 
chocolate sprinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 You approach the counter and order your drink. You pull out your wallet. No, 
not for money -- for ID. Order denied. It's 10:03 p.m., and because you are 
only 17, you cannot pass go, you cannot collect your hot chocolate, you must go 
directly home. 
</P>
<P>
 Curfew strikes again. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a scenario faced by teens under 18 who are restricted by curfew laws from 
being out and about from 10 p.m. to 5 or 6 a.m. in most communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities seem to pay no attention to curfews, while others are 
responding in force to complaints about teens loitering after hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, police last week began a more aggressive approach to 
enforcing the curfew, particularly in the downtown area. Police announced they 
would make sweeps of areas where minors have been congregating and take 
violators of the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew into custody, holding them for 
release to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said media coverage of the first sweep, announced ahead of time, 
created a situation more rowdy than the one the sweep was intended to stop. To 
prevent that from happening again, police say, future sweeps won't be 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, depending on where they are and what they are doing, teens are left 
scratching their heads -- wondering what they can and cannot do under the 
curfew laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Although policies vary slightly, communities throughout Orange County 
generally have 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfews for minors, to deter them from being 
on the streets at night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mission Viejo, for example, the policy states: "(I)t shall be unlawful for 
any minor under the age of 18 years to loiter, idle, wander, stroll, or play in 
or upon the public streets, highways, roads, alleys, parks, playgrounds, or 
other public grounds, public places and public buildings, places of amusement 
and entertainment, vacant lots, or other unsupervised places, or trespass on 
private property between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. of the following day." 
</P>
<P>
 Whew. Did they leave out any possibilities? 
</P>
<P>
 Often, enforcement of curfew laws has been lax and usually left up to 
individual police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is at the officer's discretion as far as issuing curfew ticket 
violations," Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Fred Lasani said. "We have confidence 
in the officers to fairly interpret the intent of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The intent is to curb unsupervised gatherings of youths -- at parking lots, 
the beach, on the streets, outside businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a teen to do when policies state that it is unlawful to be in places of 
amusement and entertainment between those hours? Does that mean the movies, a 
high school football game or even Disneyland is off-limits past 10 p.m.? 
</P>
<P>
 No. Those events are supervised, Lasani said. It's the unsupervised gatherings 
that are in violation. Deputies try to judicially enforce the curfew in areas 
where there have been complaints, such as from businesses or property owners, 
Lasani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the coffee shop. Maybe 10 teens go inside to have coffee. Friends 
strolling by see them and decide hop in to shoot the breeze. Pretty soon more 
acquaintances are hanging out there, many not purchasing anything. That kind of 
congregation of juveniles can be threatening to a business owner, who sees it 
as scaring away older customers. 
</P>
<P>
 So a business has the option to refuse service to minors after 10 p.m. That 
decision, it seems, is based on what problems there have been in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officers often just give warnings, they have the option of giving a 
citation. A teen who gets a ticket must appear in court with a parent. If found 
guilty, first-offenders are fined from $25 to $50; repeat offenders face 
stiffer penalties. A judge can also require community service. And, no doubt, 
many teens will face grounding by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents aren't off the hook, either. Curfew policies state that it is 
"unlawful for parents to knowingly permit their minors to be on public 
property, vacant lots or places of entertainment after 10 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, police say, unsupervised is the key issue. Lasani advises parents to 
make sure their children are going somewhere that is supervised and are not 
just hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinions about curfews vary. Some people say it is unconstitutional. Others 
say it should be up to parents to decide when their kids should come home, 
rather than having police act as pseudo-parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo High School senior Matt Denny, 18, says the curfew law is all 
right but shouldn't go into effect until midnight. "Taggers aren't going to 
spray-paint before midnight anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Blaisdell, 17, also a senior at Mission Viejo, said, "I think the curfew 
law is a joke. The kids know what's legal and what's not legal to do. If people 
are staying within the law, there should be no reason why they can't stay out 
late." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Linda Blaisdell, said curfew regulations are "good for the most 
part, but it is too restrictive on non-school nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Davis, the mother of another high school student, said she sees the curfew 
as "a short-term solution to show people we are serious about crime, as long as 
the police follow through." 
</P>
<P>
 For teens and parents frustrated by the curfew law, there is this consolation: 
Everyone turns 18 eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Hsiao and Laurel Gorman are both seniors at Mission Viejo High School. 
Bill Would Fine Parents of Scofflaws 
</P>
<P>
 Even though a majority of California cities and counties have 10 p.m. to 6 
a.m. curfews for minors, the State Legislature is considering ways to 
strengthen curfew laws and make parents more responsible for their children's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Safety Committee is considering a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Tom 
Umberg (D-Garden Grove) that would place a "financial burden" on parents whose 
children are caught violating curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's bill would allow cities and counties to charge parents $50 each time 
a law enforcement officer takes home a curfew violator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will encourage parents to take a stronger hand with juveniles who are 
current or potential gang members," said Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder, who is supporting the bill. "It's an additional tool in the battle 
against street gangs."

THE GOODS; CYBURBIA; A DATE WITH CLAIRE IS HARMONIOUS FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At my last singing lesson, my vocal coach told me that my diatonic scales were 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 My intonation was "much better," and overall I was doing a "great job." 
</P>
<P>
 My coach is a computer program. No human could lie that sincerely. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire: the Personal Music Coach is a program you sing to in the privacy of 
your home, a kind of karaoke for one, but with a serious purpose. As you 
repetitively sing scales into the microphone that comes with most Macintosh 
computers (a version of the program for personal computers is due out later 
this year), the program uses "proprietary pitch recognition technology" to 
analyze your tones. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, Claire is supposed to help you learn to hit notes on pitch, 
develop "inner hearing" and improve sight-reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. Give it your best shot, Claire. I am your ultimate challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire is from Opcode Systems and costs $129.95 list, $80 "street" (software 
almost never retails for the manufacturer's list price). Once loaded onto the 
computer, Claire begins talking through the speaker in a pleasant, encouraging 
female voice that welcomes you and explains, "I am your teacher for intonation, 
ear training and solfege." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am strict but fair," she informs you, "and always available for you. I can 
talk, sing and hear you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of like a cross between Santa Claus and Chuckie the demon doll. 
</P>
<P>
 After putting you through a battery of tests to gauge the range of your voice 
(mine was a paltry 1 1/2 octaves), the exercises -- of which there are more 
than 500, according to the manual -- begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes appear on a music staff in the colorful "practice window," and Claire 
explains that you are to sing them after her. When the singing symbol -- a 
little computer with Dumbo-like ears -- appears, it's your turn. As you sing, 
red arrows show if you are singing the note too low (flat) or too high (sharp). 
A filled-in note means you hit it just right (within an adjustable tolerance). 
If the note turns into a square, you are way out of the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire gives you an encouraging "OK" even if you miss them all, then makes you 
do them over. If you get many of them correct, you get a "good job" or 
"excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 The exercises get harder as you go along, mixing in random note combinations 
and calling upon you to sight-read short passages without Claire singing them 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 The program keeps a running log and chart -- both of which can be printed -- 
to show your progress or lack thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 You can stop and take a breather anytime. If you go longer than about 17 
minutes at a stretch, Claire will start reminding you: "You might want to take 
a break now!" 
</P>
<P>
 Does it work? I did learn that if I concentrated, I could hit many of the 
notes Claire threw at me. Unfortunately, even when I was right on pitch, my 
singing voice still had all the timbre of a foghorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire can neither overcome an inherited lack of talent (I got my singing 
voice from my mother) nor train a voice in the qualities beyond pitch that go 
into making it a true musical instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more appropriate a tool for those who do have some singing talent and 
want to practice hitting notes on pitch. And it does offer tantalizing 
prospects for the future. Officials at Opcode, Claire's Palo Alto-based 
distributor, say they will soon add adaptations to the program to allow it to 
be used with a variety of musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to tell you more, but it's time for my lesson. One thing that is 
truly miraculous about Claire -- she never gets tired of hearing me sing.

THE GOODS; THE YOUNG AND THE RENTING; FLEDGLING APARTMENT SEEKERS CAN MAKE IT 
OUT OF THE NEST DESPITE BRIEF CREDIT HISTORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Rafael Carcamo, 20, and a friend first interviewed for a vacant 
apartment, Carcamo wore "ripped jeans with holes the size of Grand Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 "The owner was really hesitant about giving me information," Carcamo says. "I 
said, 'I don't think she's going to rent it to us,' and I was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they were also rejected for lack of credit history, Carcamo decided 
to spiff up his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandparents basically told me what to do," he says. "Dress normal, not 
outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift helped the Los Angeles Valley College sophomore rent his first 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, thousands of spring graduates of Carcamo's generation will leave the 
family nest.  
</P>
<P>
 But for most, finding an apartment won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to get your first apartment," says Mark Dolan, owner and 
president of Dolan & Knight Property Management of Pasadena, which oversees 
about 1,200 units. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every landlord is looking for, number one, stability and ability to pay that 
rent. Most of these people do not have substantial credit history. A lot are 
leaving home for first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing that turns me off is when they come through the door and 
can't pay," he says. "Maybe they go to school part time and work part time. 
Their income is $750 a month and rent is $400. They beg for that apartment. But 
when you sit down and do the math, there's no way they can make that rent." 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome a lack of a credit or employment history, says Michael Lambert, 
president of de Miranda Management of Torrance, the applicants' "biggest asset 
is themselves, just as when they'd go interview for a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants without credit should have their parents co-sign the lease, 
suggests Lambert, whose firm manages nearly 3,000 apartment units from Glendale 
to the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't lie on the rental application, advises Debbie Rodriguez, executive 
director of the Fair Housing Opportunities Center in Hollywood, an advocacy 
group for tenants and prospective renters. "The landlord will find out," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez also says fledgling renters can establish at least a little credit 
by getting any low-limit credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing to rent to a single adult because he or she hasn't established credit 
or is too young may be illegal discrimination if the same landlord rents to 
married people without credit. It is also illegal to discriminate on the basis 
of race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, or physical or mental 
handicap. A renter who suspects discrimination may contact a legal aid society, 
local government agencies, the Department of Consumer Affairs in Sacramento or 
local fair housing organizations such as the Fair Housing Opportunities Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional ways to locate an apartment are through newspaper want ads, free 
magazine guides, telephone services, bulletin boards or word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The initial charge for a new apartment is often steep, almost always requiring 
that the tenant ante up more than one month's rent. Applicants should know that 
landlords can charge no more than three times the first month's rent to move 
into an unfurnished apartment, or four times for a furnished unit. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the sluggish economy, bargain hunters may find landlords 
willing to settle for one month's rent plus a security deposit of a month's 
rent or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a high vacancy factor of about 12% in the city of Los Angeles," says 
Charles Isham, executive vice president of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los 
Angeles. "Rents have declined approximately 15% from 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors in apartment hunting include choosing a neighborhood and, for 
many young people, choosing a roommate to share expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lamb, senior staff counsel for the state Department of Consumer Affairs, 
advises prospective tenants looking in an unfamiliar neighborhood to check it 
out at different hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "See if it's noisy, or if there are problems like drug dealing going on," he 
says. "As a prospective tenant, one of things I would do is go to that area at 
night and cruise around." 
</P>
<P>
 Before you commit to a roommate, it's wise to get to know the person as well 
as possible and to discuss in detail what conduct you're comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
 When you share, you are still responsible for all of the rent. "Under 
California law, if you make your share of the payment and he doesn't, both of 
you can be evicted and both of your credit reports can be impacted," Isham 
says. If only one person signs the lease, that person is responsible for making 
sure the entire rent gets paid each month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After choosing an apartment, the most problems arise over security deposits, 
according to the Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people do the thing on a handshake, and (later) there's a dispute on the 
amount of the deposit," Lamb says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common arguments arise when the landlord deducts from the deposit 
(when the tenant moves out). The landlord says there is a spot on carpet. The 
tenant says it was there when I moved in. Or there are arguments about what is 
ordinary wear and tear." 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid disputes, the renter and landlord should inspect the apartment 
together before the tenant moves in, checking the condition of appliances, 
electricity, lighting, plumbing and other items. Each should sign a checklist 
and keep a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the rental application is accepted and the move-in cost agreed upon, it 
is best for the tenant and landlord to sign a lease. "The disadvantage of 
month-to-month agreements is that the landlord can raise the rent during the 
tenancy or tell the tenant to move out at end of the rental term," Lamb says. 
</P>
<P>
 But long-term leases also pose problems. The tenant is responsible for the 
rent for the full term of the lease and if you must move, you usually cannot 
sublet unless the landlord approves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landlord can't be unreasonable, but he doesn't have to approve everyone," 
Lamb says. Also, if you do sublet, you may be liable if your substitute doesn't 
pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, you're in. Priority No. 1: Pay the rent on time. A court-ordered eviction 
stays on your record for seven years and is just cause for other owners to deny 
a rental application. Where to Find Help in Finding a Home

TRAINING, COMPASSION ARE KEY 
</P>

 Potential solutions to prison rape exist -- if inmates, corrections officials 
and society are willing to consider them. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, however, only a handful of U.S. penal institutions truly focus on 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florida, the Glades Correctional Institution (GCI) runs the most ambitious 
rape counseling program at any U.S. prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hardly voluntary: 
</P>
<P>
 The program was ordered by the U.S. Court of Appeals after inmates filed a 
trailblazing 1983 lawsuit alleging widespread sexual attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first began in corrections, we'd look at an inmate getting off the bus 
and say, 'That guy will get his butt busted before the night's over,' " recalls 
Sgt. Felix Stevens, GCI's institutional training chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't say that anymore. . . . Everybody knows that rapes happen in 
prison and we have to control it. We haven't done a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, GCI correctional officials take a comprehensive course in sexual 
violence. They're taught to weed out scared, vulnerable inmates from aggressive 
convicts and to segregate them. They're also trained to spot rape trauma and 
learn how to deal promptly with such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be everywhere, every second of the day, and you'll never control it 
all," Stevens says. "But there are certain areas that are prime for such 
attacks, like showers and television rooms. Those are areas an officer needs to 
check very frequently, and we need to patrol them more constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 If rape occurs, the key is to get an inmate into immediate counseling and 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts praise San Francisco for launching the nation's most progressive 
treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the so-called rape protocol, victims are segregated from other 
prisoners, given prompt medical checkups and put in touch with counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 If inmates request it, evidence is collected from the rape site to support a 
future prosecution. And the county is more than willing to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is improving because in the last six months we've had three to 
four cases of victims who came forward and said they were assaulted in jail," 
says Marilyn Lewis, who runs the rape treatment program at San Francisco 
General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell victims that rape is a violation, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the message of the "Prisoner Rape Education Tapes," which Donaldson and 
others made for the Safer Society Program and Press, a nonprofit project of the 
New York State Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the only resource of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the audio information is more than victims can bear. Some have 
reportedly wept after listening to the recording "Becoming a Survivor." A 
second tape, "An Ounce of Prevention," alerts inmates to the threat of rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The language can be raw and explicit," Donaldson says. "But inmates are on 
their own. They have to survive, and that's how you reach them." JOSH GETLIN

CASE RAISES CRUCIAL ISSUE: HOW VIGILANT MUST OFFICIALS BE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many lawsuits brought by prison rape victims, Farmer vs. Brennan -- now 
awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court decision -- invokes the Eighth Amendment's ban on 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 And it raises a crucial legal question: How vigilant must prison officials be 
in protecting inmates from attack? 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the court ruled that officials violate the ban if they show 
"deliberate indifference" to safety. Now, justices have been asked to expand 
that definition and decide whether it means overlooking specific knowledge of 
an impending attack -- or disregarding an obvious threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves Dee Farmer, a 27-year-old male transsexual awaiting sex 
change surgery. Farmer, who is serving a 20-year sentence for credit card 
fraud, alleges that he was raped in 1989 at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre 
Haute, Ind., two weeks after being placed in the general prison population. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer's lawyers argue that he should never have been placed in the general 
prison population, given the likelihood of rape. Lower courts ruled against 
him, but the Supreme Court granted a hearing in January. Thirty-five 35 states, 
including California, have filed amicus briefs siding with the federal 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If courts carve out a special exception for these individuals (transsexuals), 
there's no limit," says Andrew Baida, an assistant attorney general in 
Maryland. "How about prisoners with other sex orientation? And what about race? 
Do you give special status to prisoners in the minority?" 
</P>
<P>
 Baida notes that officials placed Farmer in the general population at other 
prisons without incident and that he didn't request special assignment in Terre 
Haute. Therefore, Baida says, officials aren't liable for what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 That's irrelevant, counters Ayesha Khan, an ACLU lawyer with the National 
Prison Project, which filed the case. Farmer was an obvious target for attack, 
Kahn says, and the mere decision to put him in the general population led to 
Farmer's rape; prison officials should have known better. 
</P>
<P>
 "These issues rarely surface in the debate over criminal justice because it's 
been reduced to idiocy," Khan says. "Prisoners are a throwaway class in this 
society . . . and the government would clearly sacrifice prisoner safety to 
protect a group of uncaring, lazy or incompetent corrections officials." 
</P>
<P>
 A court ruling that favors Farmer would reaffirm an existing standard that 
requires officials to weigh safety on a case-by-case basis, says Jonathan 
Smith, director of the Washington, D.C., Prisoners Legal Services Project. 
Should Farmer lose, he adds, the liability guidelines would be weakened, making 
it harder for victims to have their day in court. JOSH GETLIN

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times recently won first place for General Excellence in the 
1994 JCPenney-University of Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Awards, widely 
regarded as the most prestigious newspaper features prize. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Life & Style writer Roy Rivenburg won a first-place award in 
Fashion/Design for his Column One story, "The New Wrinkle of Polyester" about 
the comeback of "America's most frightening fabric." 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting The Times for this award in Class V, the largest-circulation 
category, one of the judges said several of the contenders were excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the Los Angeles Times stood out in this category because of the 
consistently high quality throughout its entry," said the judge, John Ginn, the 
Knight Professor of Journalism at the University of Kansas. "All of the 
reporting was thorough. The writing was energetic." He also cited the overall 
quality of the newspaper's layouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine sections included in the judging were View (now Life & Style), 
Calendar, Sunday Calendar, the Los Angeles Times Magazine, TV Times, Real 
Estate, Travel, Food and the Book Review. 
</P>
<P>
 General Excellence Awards include $1,000 and a trophy for first place.

SHE CAPTURED HEARTS -- AND SHAPED DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER and STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 She was, in life, the most private of citizens, the most public of American 
icons. And so it was in death that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was doubly 
mourned on Thursday -- both as the complex woman beloved by family and friends 
and as the womanly ideal revered by a generation of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "In times of hope, she captured our hearts," said Lady Bird Johnson, the 
former First Lady, from her home in Stonewall, Tex. "In tragedy, her courage 
helped salve a nation's grief. She was an image of beauty and romance and 
leaves an empty place in the world as I have known it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Rusk, secretary of state during the administrations of Presidents John F. 
Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, recalled her as "an extraordinary woman, 
beautiful, gracious. She carried with her all the pomp that was necessary and 
she was a great hostess at the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 But others chose to emphasize the less sweeping qualities of the slender 
brunette who -- in what seemed a more innocent time -- charmed America as a 
graceful First Lady and then eased its anguish as a stoic young widow. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 48 hours after the assassination (of President Kennedy), she went 
around to many of Jack's closest staff and presented them with mementos of his 
-- things she thought they would appreciate," recalled Pierre Salinger, 
Kennedy's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "But all the time, you know she was thinking: 'How am I going to get these two 
little kids through the rest of their lives?' The fact that she came and put 
her arms around me at that moment was stunning. There were lots of times when 
Jackie was not very public but, in private, she was extremely strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Her admirers, who rushed to extol her legacy and flocked to gather in silence 
around the luxurious Manhattan apartment where she died, were a cross section 
of America at its most mighty and mundane. 
</P>
<P>
 Millionaires and heads of state praised her courage and charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few women throughout history have touched the hearts and shaped the dreams of 
Americans more profoundly than Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis," former President 
Ronald Reagan said in a statement that was echoed by former President George 
Bush and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy and I have always admired this remarkable woman, not only for her grace 
and dignity, but also for her tremendous courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the chilly nighttime drizzle that cloaked her 5th Avenue 
apartment, well-dressed women and sanitation workers, grandmothers and 
schoolchildren, native New Yorkers and tourists from around the world gazed up 
in mournful respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't just a famous person dying," said Kitty Kelley, author of the 
biography, "Jackie Oh!" "It is our very last connection to the magic of the 
Kennedy era. . . . She didn't leave behind a great body of work but she did 
leave something quite intangible and magic -- a sense of style." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her public life, Onassis has been known as a shy woman who tried to 
shun reporters and cameras but never could escape the glare of the media as it 
tried to satisfy the curiosity of millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In her final hours as she fought her illness in the seclusion of her 
apartment, scores of journalists crowded outside the exclusive building. 
Television trucks and special antennas stretched to the edge of the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art a couple of blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Clinton said that he and his wife, First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton, had received updates on her condition up until the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, relatives and close friends entered the apartment to stand at her 
bedside and then take solace in each other. Her son, 33-year-old John F. 
Kennedy Jr., ran across 5th Avenue from Central Park in the morning so he could 
rush into the building without replying to questions from reporters. Daughter 
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, 36, and her husband, Edwin, came to the bedside 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 President Kennedy's last surviving brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
and his wife, Victoria, had arrived in the early evening after a flight from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who joined the vigil included Onassis' sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and 
two of President Kennedy's sisters -- Eunice Shriver and Patricia Kennedy 
Lawford. Her brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, arrived with Eunice. Their 
daughter, television reporter Maria Shriver, also stopped by. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Kennedy, after visiting his sister-in-law for 90 minutes, told reporters 
just before her death that Mrs. Onassis is "enormously grateful to all the 
people who have been kind enough to send her notes wishing her well." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her nephew, Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), the son of the late 
Robert F. Kennedy, stressed another side of the sad vigil. "There's a lot of 
love in her room and in her apartment," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The media outside chronicled all the comings and goings, not surprising since 
she was widely viewed as the most glamorous of American first ladies, a shy yet 
sophisticated woman who spoke French and immersed herself in the history of the 
White House.  
</P>
<P>
 Through the assassination of Kennedy in 1963; through her subsequent marriage 
to the older Greek millionaire Aristotle Onassis; through Onassis's subsequent 
death in 1975; through the maturity of her two children and her entry into the 
book publishing business in New York -- through all these phases of her 
adulthood, that aura of glamour survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Kennedy phenomena, as some of us refer to it who were not much 
younger than they were when they were in the White House, certainly had an 
influence on a generation -- my whole generation -- as well as myself," said 
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, a longtime Democrat and former 
activist during her college years at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the Kennedys as a family that was going to (address) the issues of 
quality of life, of preventing a war, of dealing with civil rights, of 
encouraging community service and encouraging looking out for fellow human 
beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's colleague, Zev Yaroslavsky, added that, as a parent himself, he 
"admired her in the way she has raised her two kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are two -- John Kennedy Jr. and Caroline Kennedy (Schlossberg -- who) 
are very obviously, normal, productive citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have not, as far as we know, had any of the problems that some of the 
kids of other prominent families have had. And what I admire most about her, 
and from what I know about her, (is that) she has invested more of her energy 
and time into raising those kids well than she has anything else. And it has 
shown." 
</P>
<P>

JACQUELINE ONASSIS DIES; FIRST LADY OF 'CAMELOT' WAS 64; LEGACY: PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY'S WIDOW CAPTIVATED THE NATION BY DEFINING ELEGANCE, AND BRAVING 
TRAGEDY. SHE LOSES HER MONTHS-LONG STRUGGLE WITH LYMPH CANCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, the most elegant, cultured yet tragic 
First Lady of the modern era, died Thursday night of cancer. She was 64. 
</P>
<P>
 At her side in her spacious 5th Avenue apartment were her daughter, Caroline 
Kennedy Schlossberg, 36; her son, John F. Kennedy Jr., 33, and her longtime 
companion Maurice Tempelsman, a New York financier and diamond dealer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was a model of courage and dignity for all 
Americans and all the world," President Clinton said in a statement. "More than 
any other woman of her time, she captivated our nation and the world with her 
intelligence, elegance and grace." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis had entered New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center on Monday 
for further treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But she asked to return to her 
apartment that faces Central Park on Wednesday after doctors decided that the 
disease could not be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing more to do for her," her close friend Nancy Tuckerman told 
reporters. As word of the gravity of her illness spread Thursday afternoon, 
crowds flocked to an exhibit in her honor at the John F. Kennedy Library in 
Boston to view, among other memorabilia, a film of her tour of the White House 
as First Lady and to gaze admiringly at the maroon-and-cream-colored gown she 
wore more than 30 years ago at a White House dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is, in fact, that vision of the First Lady -- in a satin ball gown or 
perhaps trim in a tailored suit and pillbox hat -- that most Americans will 
recall when they remember Mrs. Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 31-year-old wife of John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United 
States, she set a standard of elegance, and with her handsome husband enlivened 
the country with a sense of youth and beauty. She immediately made a mark by 
transforming the White House from the dowdy rec room of the Eisenhower years 
into a historic jewel that was important not only on state occasions but also 
on weekdays when it was open for public tours.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet so many indelible images remain of the lithe, dark-haired First Lady. 
There were the Life magazine pictures of her as a young mother at Hyannis Port, 
slender in Capri-style white pants and a striped shirt, chasing after her two 
small children on a warm summer's day. There was the desperate wife climbing 
over the back seat of the limousine where her husband lay mortally wounded in 
Dallas in 1963. And finally, there was The First Widow, standing in low heels, 
tears barely visible behind a black veil as her 3-year-old son saluted the 
riderless horse at her husband's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sake of fairy tale, the images should have ended there, with the 
34-year-old widow quietly moving into the countryside to ride horses, raise her 
children and preserve her husband's legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore H. White, in his memoir, "In Search of History," recalls the night in 
Hyannis Port when he talked with then-Mrs. Kennedy from 8:30 in the morning 
until midnight about her late husband's White House years. She purged herself 
of her husband's bloody assassination after the long day, he said. Then she 
found the thought she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her message was his message -- that one man, by trying, may change it all," 
White wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, he said, she tried to frame her husband's legacy as the legend of 
Camelot.  
</P>
<P>
 But Jackie Kennedy's fable did not quite stick. The myth was so often sullied 
by revelations of her husband's mistresses and manipulative behavior that 
periodic remembrances of Camelot are often tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the young widow, life also evolved.  
</P>
<P>
 She went on to live essentially two more lives. First, overseas with the 
wealthy and flamboyant Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who many said 
she married to escape a recklessly voyeuristic world. And later in a quiet, 
elite corner of Manhattan where she doted on her three grandchildren, worked as 
a book editor and made the social rounds for worthy causes. 
</P>
<P>
 And on occasion, much the way she did as recently as Sunday, Mrs. Onassis 
simply blended in with the other strollers in Central Park, usually holding 
hands with Tempelsman or trailing her toddling grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 She survived being among the greatest female icons of the 20th Century by 
behaving almost perfectly. She maintained a rare grace and composure, refused 
to give in to America's obsession with personal revelation and she not only 
outlived two husbands but prevailed over their disloyalty, achieving fame and 
fortune on her own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Known in later life for her trademark oversized sunglasses and by monikers 
such as "Jackie O," she has more entries in the Reader's Guide of Periodicals 
than almost anybody else (and that does not include the 32 books about her). 
Yet she almost never talked to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 While she may have been the most public "private" person in the world, to her 
colleagues in the publishing world where she toiled for 16 years, she was 
nothing less than intimate.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Golob, now a senior editor at Times Books who worked with Mrs. Onassis at 
Doubleday, said she took a genuine interest in young people in publishing and 
was often willing to take them under her wing. After Golob left Doubleday four 
years ago, they exchanged notes and she even invited him for tea and finger 
sandwiches in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, during a discussion on a book he was working on about 
politics, Golob recalled how "she got a faraway look and told me how Jack would 
take her into the Senate Gallery and point out Senators Russell and Mansfield. 
It was as if it were my mom telling me about what she and dad had done when 
they were first married. It was very personal and intimate." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was not uncommon for the people who worked with her, Golob added, to 
see her in typical editor motion: "sprinting down the hall to get something 
into someone's hands on deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 This incarnation of her -- happy, caught up in a workaday job -- is quite 
jarring considering the beginnings of Jacqueline Bouvier. She was born to an 
aristocratic family in Southampton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father was John Vernon Bouvier III, an exotically handsome bon vivant 
known as "Black Jack" who dwindled a $750,000 inheritance into a $100,000 
estate. He was a serial womanizer who could not even get through his honeymoon 
with Janet Lee -- daughter of a self-made millionaire -- without launching an 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 After having two daughters -- first Jacqueline and then Lee, 3 1/2 years later 
-- the Bouviers divorced. Jacqueline was only 10 years old. Though the girls 
lived with their mother, it was their father whom they adored and who continued 
to shape their sensibilities and direct their education. Their mother, 
meanwhile, plied them with a passion for social climbing -- and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline, who was studying ballet and taking riding lessons by the time she 
was 5, attended the best schools: Miss Porter's and Miss Chapin's, where she 
listed in her yearbook that her goal was "not to be a housewife." 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy at Vassar College, she rebelled by eating pastries and studying all 
night. After a junior year at the Sorbonne in Paris she returned to finish her 
degree in 1951 at George Washington University. Instead of taking the Prix de 
Paris essay prize that she won from Vogue magazine and spending a year in 
Paris, she accepted a $42.50-a-week job as an "inquiring photographer" at the 
Washington Times-Herald. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that the 23-year-old Bouvier met Jack Kennedy, 12 years her 
senior, at a dinner party at the home of his friend, journalist Charles 
Bartlett. At the time Bouvier was engaged to a New York stockbroker, but she 
apparently couldn't resist a dashing young man so much like her father. 
</P>
<P>
 From accounts in several books -- both learned and lurid -- the young Jackie 
comes across as a strong-minded, tough, yet sensitive woman who was attracted 
to the junior congressman from Massachusetts both for love and for his 
considerable family wealth. He was worth $10 million, so it was said, at the 
time of their meeting and her family's fortune was virtually dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 When they married in September, 1953, in front of 3,000 guests, there is 
sufficient evidence that Jackie Kennedy had been appropriately warned about her 
husband's womanizing, his boisterous if not overbearing family and the Kennedy 
obsession with athletics. (She broke an ankle early on trying to join in a game 
of touch football.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy sisters did not much take to Jackie, ridiculing her little-girl 
voice and pronouncing her name "Jacklean" to rhyme with queen. She didn't much 
like them either, calling them "the rah-rah girls." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first six years of their marriage, John Kennedy spent most of the time 
campaigning, traversing his home state, traveling the country. Mostly, his wife 
disdained the role of campaigning spouse, apparently out of shyness and a 
dislike of crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the White House, though, she fulfilled seemingly well the role of the 
pre-feminist First Lady: She was the epitome of womanhood. Hers was not the job 
to advise on health care and foreign policy; rather, she dressed like a 
princess, hosted extraordinary parties and oversaw the upbringing of her 
children with the help of a British nanny.  
</P>
<P>
 But America seemed willing to forgive such upper-class indulgences. Following 
in the footsteps of the matronly Mamie Eisenhower, Jackie, as the country came 
to think of her, was a glamorous model for women to pattern themselves after. 
When she made it a mission to bring art and culture to the White House, it was 
as if she were the country's chief docent. Televised evenings with performers 
such as cellist Pablo Casals made Midwestern housewives feel that, for a 
moment, the same thing might happen in their own shag-carpeted living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mrs. Kennedy, she was nearly universally adored -- even when she was 
impatient with questions about her clothes or when her eyes glazed over during 
her husband's speeches. She was so engaging that wherever her mind was 
drifting, the public was willing to slavishly follow. 
</P>
<P>
 When she undertook the $2-million renovation of the White House, then-Chief 
Usher J. Bernard West was astounded at her grasp of detail and at her ability 
to get things done at such a young age. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a will of iron," West later wrote, "with more determination than 
anyone I have ever met. Yet she was so soft-spoken, so deft and subtle that she 
could impose that will upon people without their ever knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while Jackie was said to have lived an oddly remote life in the White 
House, she got her husband's attention when he got the bills for her clothing 
expenditures. Yet he was unable to reform her and, though the President was 
only making $100,000 a year, the family expenses rose from $105,446 in 1961 to 
$121,462 in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 After the death of their infant son Patrick in the summer of 1963 -- following 
a miscarriage and the births of Caroline in 1957 and John in 1960 -- the First 
Lady took a long cruise with her sister on the yacht of Lee's then-boyfriend 
Aristotle Onassis. When the First Lady returned she was refreshed and relaxed. 
Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee wrote: "She greeted J.F.K. with the 
most affectionate embrace we'd ever seen them give one another." 
</P>
<P>
 In a month, the President was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still amazing to recall her presence of mind, of history and of theater 
in the hours and days after his assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 As she was returning from Dallas, Lady Bird Johnson asked her if she wanted to 
change out of her blood-caked suit. Jackie declined, saying: "I want them to 
see what they have done to Jack." Once back in Washington she had the Library 
of Congress research the details of Lincoln's funeral and immediately ordered 
the White House upholsterers to drape the black cambric that was usually used 
to cover the bottoms of chairs over the windows, mantels and chandeliers 
because that was how it was done for Lincoln's wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dignity at that time perhaps did the most to seal her persona -- she was 
frozen in that queenly pose, her face composed for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Jack was assassinated," said Michael Beschloss, presidential scholar and 
historian, "it was a time in which America's image in front of the world could 
have been badly damaged. That she carried off the next four days with such 
majesty not only retrieved American stature, but also increased it. Her place 
in history will probably pivot around those critical four days." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next phase of her life the widow found the kind of security that her 
first marriage did not provide. She wanted to be financially set and protected, 
so she became a rich man's adornment. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she had more appropriate suitors -- including Lord Harlech and Robert 
McNamara -- by the spring of 1968 she was becoming increasingly involved with 
Onassis, who seemed always to be cruising the Mediterranean in his yacht 
"Christina." 
</P>
<P>
 With its El Grecos and bar stools covered in leather, it was a far cry from 
the French vermeil candelabrum and satin draperies of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps that was the point. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Robert F. Kennedy, who was trying to follow his brother into the 
White House, urged her to wait to announce her engagement to Onassis. "For 
God's sake, Jackie," he reportedly said, "that could cost me five states." She 
agreed, for Bobby's sake, to wait, but he too was killed and his death changed 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Kennedy told friends: "I despise America and I don't want my children to 
live here anymore. If they're killing Kennedys, my kids are No. 1 targets."  
</P>
<P>
 As news of her engagement to Onassis reached the heartland, America wept that 
the woman they wanted to remember in a cloud of white chiffon and a tiara could 
end up with a Greek tycoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Oct. 10, 1968, on the island of Skorpios, Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy were 
married during a ceremony that was conducted mostly in Greek. She was 39; he 
was 62. 
</P>
<P>
 It rained that day -- which Greeks consider to be a good omen. 
</P>
<P>
 But a month later Onassis was photographed with his old flame, opera singer 
Maria Callas, and the new Mrs. Onassis again was embroiled with an unfaithful 
man -- though this time she was at least well-kept in privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though their marriage was long over -- Onassis had even hired Roy Cohn to 
begin divorce proceedings -- the shipping magnate's death in 1975 made any 
official separation a moot issue. Widowed a second time, she ended up with $26 
million after reaching an agreement with her stepdaughter, Christina, who had 
little affection for his father's American wife. 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting the dying Onassis in a New York hospital, she coolly summed up 
their life together: "Aristotle Onassis rescued me at a time when my life was 
engulfed in shadows. He meant a lot to me. He brought me into a world where one 
could find happiness and love." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, she was back in her 15-room New York apartment, working at 
Viking Press as a consulting editor for $200 a week. She worked there two years 
when the publisher, without consulting her, bought a Jeffrey Archer novel based 
on Edward M. Kennedy, who becomes President and then is the target of an 
assassination attempt. She immediately quit and later joined Doubleday, moving 
into a novice editor's windowless office. 
</P>
<P>
 During her tenure at Doubleday, Mrs. Onassis edited a wide variety of books 
reflecting her urbane mind and keen aesthetic and a devotion to the arts, 
particularly music, ballet and the visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
 A particular favorite, according to a rare interview she gave to Publishers 
Weekly a year ago, was the lavishly illustrated "A Second Paradise: Indian 
Courtly Life 1590-1947" by Naveen Patnaik. There have been many histories -- 
from the exotic to the painfully dry -- on her list, but her tastes were broad 
enough to include editing Michael Jackson's wildly popular "Moonwalk," 
children's books by Carly Simon and a history of cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm drawn to books that are out of our regular experience," Mrs. Onassis told 
Publishers Weekly. "Books of other cultures, ancient histories. I'm interested 
in the arts in general, especially the creative process. I'm fascinated by 
hearing artists talk about their craft. To me, a wonderful book is one that 
takes me on a journey into something I didn't know before." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, her legacy was so enormous it is hard to characterize. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of research to "get past the myth," celebrity biographer Kitty 
Kelley offered one of the first non-fawning sketches of the world's favorite 
widow with her 1978 best-seller, "Jackie Oh!"  
</P>
<P>
 Kelley wrote that Onassis indulged herself with handmade bed linens and 
extravagant silk lingerie, including underpants costing hundreds of dollars per 
pair. She was portrayed by employees and even some friends as a cold, 
pretentious, plotting woman whose chief virtue was her devotion to her 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the books there were made-for-TV-movies and songs by groups like Human 
Sexual Response with lyrics like "I want to be Jackie Onassis, oh yeah, oh 
yeah." A disco was named for her. Andy Warhol did a silk-screen of her. 
</P>
<P>
 But in all that is written and all that is said, the country will never 
penetrate the mystery. For she managed to keep the world at bay as she returned 
in the third phase of her life to the eternal verities -- family, books, and a 
quiet life with a kind, slightly pudgy man. 
</P>
<P>
 She remained that Mona Lisa face that you could look at endlessly and see 
flashes of all her past faces -- the sweet girl in riding jodhpurs, the First 
Lady in a tiara, the tear-smeared widow, the pampered wife. And finally the 
wide dark eyes, edged with fine wrinkles, watching a world that always was 
watching her.

AMES SAYS LAX CIA SYSTEM EASED HIS ACCESS TO SECRETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turncoat CIA agent Aldrich H. Ames said Thursday that it was "really easy" to 
get the top-secret information from the agency that he sold to the Russians in 
the most damaging espionage case in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody suspected what I was doing . . . and nobody protected me," Ames 
insisted in his first face-to-face interview since he pleaded guilty last 
month. "I never got anything I didn't have a real good reason to get. I never 
had to exert myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, 52, said that part of the reason he was able to traffic in classified 
data -- even after he was transferred out of the CIA's Soviet-East European 
division -- was a gradual breakdown of the highly vaunted "compartmentation" 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA officers are supposed to work in "compartments," limited to secret 
material only in their field of interest. But he indicated that the system is 
lax at best. He said that the advent of computers and databases and the growth 
of a CIA bureaucracy in which "everybody has to coordinate with everything," 
has left much of the old need-to-know rule outmoded. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames said that he "had access to a lot of things of high interest to the KGB" 
as chief of Soviet counterintelligence in his division in 1985 -- the year he 
began selling secrets over an eight-year period in return for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he continued to obtain additional sensitive data even after his 
transfer to anti-narcotics work in the early 1990s. But Ames said he could not 
disclose details of what he gave the Russians, citing ground rules for The 
Times interview established by government officials and his attorney, Plato 
Cacheris, who sat in on the hourlong session. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, dressed in loose-fitting khaki prison overalls, appeared affable and 
relaxed, speaking in a rich baritone voice and displaying a broad, occasionally 
sardonic sense of humor. His full head of dark hair was combed straight back 
and he wore a gray mustache that looked a bit shaggy. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat at a round wooden table in a small, windowless room at the Alexandria 
jail. He talked of his spying with great detachment, as if clinically examining 
the actions of a third person. Little in his manner suggested that he might be 
capable of such an enormous crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames noted that the closed-door government debriefings are zeroing in on "the 
kind of things I had access to." The interrogation sessions three days a week 
are conducted by a team of FBI, CIA and other intelligence community officials 
who are trying to learn precisely what U.S. operations or projects Ames has 
compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 The interrogations "are going quite well -- they're almost collegial," Ames 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He confessed that he often has trouble recalling exactly what he gave his 
Soviet and later Russian handlers but government officials jog his memory by 
showing him records of his CIA career, including periods when he traveled 
overseas and met his foreign contacts.  
</P>
<P>
 He is "working hard to put all the pieces together" to uphold his plea 
agreement to cooperate with government officials, Ames said. Under that 
agreement, Ames received a sentence of life in prison without chance of parole 
and pledged complete cooperation and truthfulness in exchange for a government 
recommendation of leniency for his wife, Rosario, when she is sentenced in late 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Ames, 41, whose role was described by the government as considerably 
smaller than her husband's, is expected to receive a sentence of about five 
years. She pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of "aiding, advising and 
encouraging" her husband's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quite happy that they seem satisfied with what I'm telling them," Ames 
said. "They basically held my wife hostage on this issue -- quite unfairly, I 
thought -- but I never felt my cooperation would be anything but full." 
</P>
<P>
 He added with a wry smile that so far none of his questioners have asked him 
to take a polygraph test. Ames managed to pass a CIA-administered test in the 
early 1990s when he was questioned about the source of his newfound wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Although smoking is prohibited in the jail, Ames said that the debriefing 
sessions enable him to indulge in his chain-smoking habit with cigarettes 
provided by his interrogators. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside of the interrogations, Ames said, "is constantly being reminded 
of how totally sloppy and even reckless I was" in carrying out his espionage, 
leaving more than 100 classified documents at his suburban Virginia home, 
including highly incriminating material on his home computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also have claimed that Ames and his wife were exceedingly reckless in 
paying cash for a new $540,000 home and acquiring a Jaguar, which he drove to 
work. Ames said that he still has trouble explaining his carelessness. In part, 
he said, it may have reflected fatalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that if suspicion ever centered on me and an actual 
investigation by the bureau (FBI) were to start, nothing would be proof against 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what I did, no matter how careful I was, no matter how assiduously 
I destroyed and concealed everything, it would still yield to what they would 
be able to prove."  
</P>
<P>
 His voice cracking, he seemed to exhibit remorse only when speaking of his 
wife and his 5-year-old son Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, why did I even tell Rosario in '92? The answer was she really 
seriously suspected me and the best way out seemed to be to confirm it. But you 
know, if I hadn't done that, she wouldn't be here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Ames is being held separately with women prisoners in Alexandria. The two 
see each other only once or twice a week during joint sessions with their 
lawyers "and we can't touch," Ames said.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his thoughts for the future, Ames said that he clings to hope of 
being set free before his life is over -- despite his sentence of life without 
possibility of parole. "Things could always change," he said, rubbing his palms 
together rapidly. Then, as his eyes began to water, he added: "Those thoughts 
revolve largely around my son." 
</P>
<P>
 As a CIA counterintelligence specialist on the Soviet Union, Ames took part in 
debriefing KGB Col. Vitaly Yurchenko, who defected in 1985 only to bolt back to 
Moscow three months later, raising grave doubts that his defection was 
authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames said he is convinced that Yurchenko was a "totally genuine" defector. "I 
never had any doubts then and haven't since." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he already was working for the Soviets when Yurchenko came to the 
United States, Ames said he did not have any particular qualms about being 
unmasked by Yurchenko as a Soviet mole. Yurchenko's job "was not such that he 
would have known about me," Ames said. Ames dismissed suggestions that 
Yurchenko had never stopped being a Soviet agent and had, in fact, been sent 
here to check on Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand there are some real zealots and merchants of 
fabrication running around in this counterintelligence business," Ames said. 
"The danger of being handed a line of total muck or totally fabricated stuff is 
very high." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames said he has mixed feelings about appearing before the House and Senate 
Intelligence committees, both of which have asked for his testimony. He said he 
is eager to present Congress with his critique of CIA operations but suspects 
that members of Congress would not give him "an easy ride."

LAPD TO REVISE RESTRAINING OF VIOLENT SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a series of deaths linked to hogtying, Los Angeles Police Department 
officials said Thursday that they will change the procedures and equipment to 
help minimize risks to violent suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of study, LAPD officials plan to begin training officers in the 
next few weeks on the use of a new hobbling device that permits greater freedom 
of movement for people who are arrested and reduces the danger of sudden death, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol officers hope to begin using the new device by late next month, after 
changes in department policies are formally adopted, said Sgt. Mark Conta of 
the LAPD's training division. 
</P>
<P>
 The strap-like device ties the feet together, but allows an individual to sit 
up in the patrol car, permitting easier breathing. The current policy allows 
suspects to be more tightly hogtied and transported while lying on their sides. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the change comes as members of the Police Commission scheduled a May 
31 review of the department's progress in revising the practice to make it 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners want to know "where we are, and to make it clear that we are 
hopeful . . . we can get away from restraining people (in a) way that could put 
the suspects in jeopardy," said the panel's president, Rabbi Gary Greenebaum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Monday that law enforcement hogtying policies are 
increasingly being challenged and reworked across Los Angeles County after a 
series of deaths partly linked to the practice, and mounting medical evidence 
of the method's potential hazards. Greenebaum said the story partly prompted 
the request for a progress report on restraint options. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogtying -- or hobbling in police terms -- is typically used against violent, 
often drug-intoxicated suspects who are difficult to control. It immobilizes an 
individual by tying the ankles to cuffed hands behind the back, usually with a 
strap or cord.  
</P>
<P>
 Recent medical studies have found that the procedure can interfere with 
breathing and increase the risk of sudden death, particularly when overweight, 
excited or drug-intoxicated individuals are placed on their stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office has partly attributed at least four 
deaths in less than a year to the technique, helping to fuel potentially costly 
wrongful death claims and a push by police watchdog groups to restrict use of 
hogtying. At least two of the recent deaths have led to multimillion-dollar 
claims against the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some police agencies -- including New York and Pasadena -- have banned 
hogtying, while others have been adjusting their use of the tactic in a variety 
of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 After a $1.1-million jury award to the parents of a man who died after being 
hogtied by LAPD officers, the department revised its policy in October, 1992, 
requiring officers to keep hobbled suspects on their side and constantly 
monitor their breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 But in March, 1993, controversy erupted after a Pasadena barber, James Michael 
Bryant, died after being hobbled by LAPD officers and placed on his stomach in 
the back seat of a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, LAPD officers still are permitted to hobble suspects and place them on 
their sides in the rear seat of a patrol car, a procedure that also has raised 
concerns. Seattle coroner Donald Reay, who has researched the issue, told The 
Times that transporting people in that mode also may be dangerous. LAPD had 
been testing a device -- similar to one the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department has used for nearly a year -- that permits a hobbled suspect to be 
controlled and transported sitting upright in the rear of the patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Legs are bound together and held in place by a wide strap that is several feet 
long. One end of the strap is attached to handcuffs behind an individual's 
back. The other end binds the ankles and can be adjusted to pull an 
individual's feet tightly behind his back, or loosened to allow him to stand or 
sit up. 
</P>
<P>
 When a person is seated in a patrol car, one end of the strap can be secured 
in the door jamb to prevent the suspect from thrashing about. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials could not explain why the LAPD had not moved more swiftly to change 
its policies and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why it hasn't come to fruition isn't clear," Police Commissioner Deirdre Hill 
said. "(It's) something we need to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 "(And) we need to hear from those experts who are identifying this issue as a 
contributing cause of death, as to how we can solve (it)." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to avoiding unnecessary deaths and ensuring officers' safety, Hill 
said, the LAPD must be sensitive about the appearances of the restraint tactics 
it uses, and the discomfort they may cause. The new hobbling device can allow 
people to walk to a patrol car, she noted, rather than be carried by officers 
while bound. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community relations issue is one of just as much importance as meeting 
our (other) objectives sometimes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California called on 
the Police Commission to initiate a broad review of LAPD hobbling practices, 
including how frequently the restraint is used and whether it is being removed 
as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU also is recommending that paramedics be summoned immediately when 
officers encounter violent or bizarre-acting suspects who are likely to require 
use of hobbles, pepper spray and other such tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, paramedics are not requested until hobbled suspects have gone into 
cardiac arrest, said Allan Parachini, an ACLU spokesman. "Medical aid (should 
be) standing by in those situations, as far as practical," he said. "(It's) a 
very prudent thing to call (paramedics) at the start . . . rather than at end 
of the call when the person is dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Garfield, a spokesman for Los Angeles Police Protective League, which 
represents rank-and-file officers, said the group has not yet taken a position 
on the proposed changes in hobbling practices.

 Here are some scenes from the black-and-white yesterday of an ancient land on 
the western rim of Europe: Portuguese literati traveling to Paris to see movies 
banned by government censors; thrill-seeking teen-agers crossing the Spanish 
border (closed at night) to taste Coca-Cola forbidden at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was another planet; a silent country where people were not allowed to 
speak and there was nothing to say," says Isabel Carlos, a 32-year-old art 
critic. "It was the Portugal of weeping women in black. Today, if we wear 
black, it's because black is fashionable." 
</P>
<P>
 In a single generation, Portugal has reversed four centuries of backwardness 
and isolation to become a democratic, getting-rich partner of the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, secret police files from the 46-year rule of Western Europe's 
longest-lived modern dictatorship drowse in cardboard rows two miles long at 
the national archives. The files, more voluminous than those compiled during 
three centuries of the Inquisition, were newly opened for inspection by their 
victims. But few come to examine them, says archivist Maria de Lourdes 
Henriques. 
</P>
<P>
 The past has passed. With considerable grace and a remarkable absence of 
rancor, Portugal has digested a peaceful revolution 20 years ago this spring 
that amounted to a change of century. 
</P>
<P>
 No Portuguese will ever forget how the audacious revolt by young officers 
triggered public jubilation: red carnations in rifle barrels. But what next? 
The revolution's anniversary is prompting reflection. Vaulted improbably into 
the hurly-burly of a consumer society that few imagined, Portuguese 
increasingly wonder where change will lead them. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiers that have preserved the wholeness of a culture for 900 years, longer 
than any other land borders on Earth, are increasingly just lines on the map of 
a united Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Can grilled sardinhas and vinho verde outpoint hot dogs and Gatorade? 
Portugal's rush from oppression to modernity to perplexity, like that of 
Iberian neighbor Spain, may prove an object lesson to the rapidly transforming 
nations of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 How much of a singular national character, how many traditions of a small, 
long-isolated country, can survive the swift, steady onslaught of international 
values and culture? 
</P>
<P>
 Such unsettling questions are part of the price for foreign investment and 
influence that includes $10 million a day in economic aid to Portugal from its 
European Union partners through the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Portugal risks losing its political identity, and the very essence of 
its "Portuguese-ness," is an agenda-setting issue for next month's elections to 
the European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not many Lisboners strolling the streets of a capital that remains more 
Old World than high-tech would happily turn back pages in the national diary. 
</P>
<P>
 "How lucky we are. We've lived 200 years in the last 20," muses Felipe La 
Feria, a theater impresario who remembers how censors once scissored his lines 
when he was a young actor. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, it is hard to overstate the backwardness of Portugal 
under dictator Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, who took power in 1928 and ruled in 
high-polished boots until he was replaced because of illness in 1968. By 1974, 
when Salazar's heirs were toppled by the armed forces, Portugal was a rural 
society, isolated, insular and dirt poor: Per capita income was about $2 per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a heavy, closed place. Very codified. There was hardly any contact 
with the outside world. Nothing happened in Lisbon, and if you wanted something 
to happen, they wouldn't let it," said Paulo Pereira, a 36-year-old museum 
curator who spent his early teen years worrying about being drafted to fight 
colonial wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignored by the world, Portugal huddled by the Atlantic with its back to 
Europe, preoccupied with a sapping, bloody struggle to preserve a chimerical 
empire of African colonies: Salazar and his heirs dispatched more than 800,000 
young men to Africa to fight in 13 years of colonial conflict that claimed the 
lives of nearly 9,000 Portuguese soldiers, a loss about four times greater with 
respect to population than that suffered by the United States in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "War ended the isolation of we military officers from the realities of our 
country," said Vasco Lourenco, 51, a leader among the rebellious captains who 
staged the 1974 revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Political and economic tumult after the April Revolution brought Communists to 
within an ace of power in 1975. But when socialist Mario Soares, a fierce, 
indomitable democrat, emerged as prime minister, passions began to ebb. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the Portuguese themselves seem certain why they have been able to 
absorb the revolution so coolly. Perhaps it is because where Portugal is today 
is so much better for almost everyone than where it lingered so long.  
</P>
<P>
 Then too, Portuguese are fond of pointing out that while they are as rabidly 
enamored of bullfighting as their neighbors in Spain, they are also different: 
In Portugal, the bull lives -- symbolic, perhaps, of a country in which 
extremism has fallen from fashion.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ours was a generous revolution. There were no trials, but there was a moral 
judgment," Soares recently told a group of reporters in explaining the success 
of Portugal's political transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as president and graying elder statesman, the 68-year-old Soares is a 
restive liberal counterpoint to Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, a 
free-market moderate who since the mid-1980s has directed landmark growth and 
Portugal's integration into the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, intellectual and commercial life languidly unfolded in Lisbon coffee 
bars. Today, the coffee drinker at the next table is apt to be sipping past her 
cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Capelo, a former self-described Stalinist "professor of revolution," 
is symbolic of a once feisty but now waning left. These days, Capelo is an 
art-collecting businessman and director of a new private "cheaply commercial" 
television channel that has won a 30% audience share in its first 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still vote Socialist," Capelo confided over an expensive bottle of 
Portuguese wine, "but times have changed. In foreign newspapers I've switched 
from (the French intellectual) Le Monde to the (British business) Financial 
Times. I no longer have time for theories. I need facts." 
</P>
<P>
 A child of change, the old-fashioned Portuguese language of Salazar's day now 
sambas with lively words and images imported from Brazil, to the dismay of the 
same sort of well-spoken folk who decry the undermining of the Queen's English 
by Americanisms. English, in fact, has replaced French as the first foreign 
language of educated Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as an epitaph to Salazar's portrayal of Portugal as a country that 
"stands proudly alone," Lisbon not long ago became the last capital in Western 
Europe to get a McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by booming private investment and huge transfusions of European Union 
cash, Portuguese living standards have increased dramatically over the last 20 
years. Per capita income, about $700 at the time of the revolution, is more 
than $8,000, and Portugal has vaulted past Greece off the bottom rung of the 
European Union ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 In a single generation, infant mortality has fallen from 41 to 6 per 1,000. 
There are three times as many doctors and university students in Portugal today 
as there were 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Socially, a rock-ribbed society has become less conservative. The birthrate 
halved between 1973 and 1993, while divorces jumped from 509 to 12,429. There 
was one priest for every 4,968 inhabitants in 1973, one for every 12,663 last 
year, according to a study by Sergio Figueiredo for the Lisbon newspaper 
Expresso. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the Portuguese live in cities today; 20 years ago, three of four 
still lived on the land. Metropolitan Lisbon, with about 3 million people -- 
nearly a third of the national population -- is not much smaller than Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapid growth has also brought unwanted change: Massive internal migration from 
the countryside to cities and the coast has aggravated a profound agricultural 
crisis and created Latin American-like shantytowns of poor new settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday's revolutionaries such as Lourenco say they are generally satisfied 
with the 20-year result of their handiwork but point to disappointing 
shortcomings in the rush to join Western Europe's consumer wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bet on democracy, and I think we have won. We've made huge transformations 
and avoided falling into new dictatorships, but our ideas went beyond formal 
democracy," said Lourenco, who runs a small import-export business. "They had a 
lot to do with social justice, and over time, it must be said, there has been a 
regression. There is a growing gap between rich and poor. The middle class is 
shrinking. Social and economic problems are growing. We see the face of racism 
and xenophobia." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Portuguese are richer than ever, they are still far behind their 
continental partners economically. National programs of health, welfare, 
unemployment compensation and retirement pensions are all in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, trifling by American standards, is higher than ever. AIDS and drugs are 
unwelcome signposts of the new consumer society. A three-month campaign to 
exchange old syringes for new, sterilized ones has netted half a million 
needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men are no longer killed in distant wars, but with five times as many 
cars on the roads as in 1974, highway carnage is a matter of national alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of integration with larger partners is making the Portuguese 
wonder about their future as a small fish in the big European pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portugal risks becoming Europe's favorite busboy," Soares warned at a 
conference this month on the nation's future. "How are we to begin to live as a 
nation when the European funds run out or decrease significantly? . . . We 
cannot disguise or ignore the certain sense of anguish gnawing within so many 
Portuguese as they are faced with growing uncertainty and insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquim Vieira, 43, spent 18 months in jail as a teen-age student leader under 
Salazar and is now a thoughtful Lisbon newspaperman. He says questions about 
the future color the way politicians are addressing voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody talks about federalism, or pushing the European Union," he says. 
"Rather, some people wonder if we'll become a wholly owned subsidiary of Spain 
or some multinational corporation. Or perhaps a game reserve where rich Europe 
comes for sun and beaches." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a realization, Vieira says, that a certain surrender of national 
individuality is inevitable: "When you open a country to the world it becomes 
different. The essence of a people remains, but some things become universal -- 
like the use of satellites." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationalists such as Lourenco believe there is no chance that proud, old 
Portugal will find itself swallowed by Europe. Even after hundreds of years, 
traditions endure among the descendants of Portuguese settlers in North and 
South America, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 National traits, such as the love of cod fish -- bacalhau -- and the haunting 
fado -- love poetry set to music -- are indelible, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the changes, our culture is very strong. We're a bit like Jews 
the way we retain our traditions and sense of nationhood," Lourenco says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, our kids will go and eat hamburgers, but they'll always come home to 
the bacalhau -- they're Portuguese." Portugal Fact Sheet

RIORDAN BUDGET OKD WITH POLICE BUILDUP INTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an acknowledgment of the city's preoccupation with crime, the Los Angeles 
City Council on Thursday approved a budget that embraces Mayor Richard 
Riordan's plan for expansion of the Police Department and increases programs to 
keep young people out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The council made some changes to Riordan's proposed 1994-95 budget but left 
intact the heart of the plan -- the addition of 450 officers to the LAPD. The 
buildup is striking in that it comes with the city mired in its fourth year of 
recession. Previous police expansions were financed during the boom times of 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan found the $83 million for the expansion without raising taxes. He did 
it largely through an aggressive foray into the treasuries of the airport, 
harbor and water and power departments. 
</P>
<P>
 In three weeks of deliberations, no City Council member was willing to buck 
the pro-police groundswell. 
</P>
<P>
 But several advocated a broader attack on the conditions that lead to crime 
and violence. They spent much of the last week adding social, cultural and 
recreational programs that they said will be even more helpful than the police 
in keeping troubled youths off the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger reconstruction of the city bureaucracy that Riordan had proposed 
was relegated to the "needs more study" files at City Hall. Plans to unite 
eight departments and commissions under two super-agencies were postponed and a 
plan to eliminate the Board of Public Works was submitted to a blue ribbon 
committee for more study. 
</P>
<P>
 To the mayor's deputies and supporters on the City Council, the mere 
discussion of the issues was confirmation that Riordan had prodded a hidebound 
bureaucracy to examine itself. But to other council members and city officials, 
the delays were evidence of poor preparation by the mayor's staff or of 
proposals that were more symbolic than substantive. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, as amended by the City Council, must be formally adopted next 
week. Riordan will then have five days to veto any changes he does not like and 
the council will have five days after that to override him, if it can muster a 
two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 After four long days deliberating the $4.3-billion spending plan, all sides 
agreed that the mayor's position on a larger Police Department was largely 
unassailable. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you have to do is read the papers and the polls, and public safety is 
clearly an issue with everyone," said Bill McCarley, Riordan's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, a frequent critic of Riordan, said that 
the hiring of more police will be the "one clear accomplishment" of the mayor's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To drive the message home, Riordan campaigned around the city for his budget 
in a way that Mayor Tom Bradley never did. He distributed pamphlets summarizing 
the plan to community groups all over the city. Several hundred postcards that 
the mayor provided were returned by residents to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD expansion is known as Project Safety Los Angeles. Launched with the 
help of Police Chief Willie L. Williams last fall, the plan is designed to add 
nearly 3,000 officers over five years to push the LAPD from its current force 
of 7,700 officers to 10,455. It also suggests that the equivalent of hundreds 
more officers can be put on the streets by shifting officers from desk jobs to 
patrols and by increasing the pool of money to pay police for overtime and 
working on days off. 
</P>
<P>
 While the council embraced those ideas, Police Department officials struck a 
cautionary note on one aspect of the plan. They noted that they have no way of 
knowing if police officers will work holidays and days off. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Safety Los Angeles anticipates that so many officers will be coming in 
on their days off that the equivalent of 431 full-time officers will be put on 
the street in the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But police officials said the theory is untested and there may not be many 
takers for the extra duty because police are required to take overtime pay 
instead of compensatory time for extra hours worked. Most officers will 
probably be on the beat at least 10 extra days a year, because of reduced 
compensatory time -- making them less likely to sign up to work holidays and 
days off, said Police Department financial experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Police Department said it will aggressively encourage officers to 
work extra days to increase their presence in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only difference will be we would have the equivalent of 1,100 more 
officers in the street, instead of 1,500," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. 
"You can't fault the mayor. The mayor produced the money for 1,500 more 
officers and if the Police Department can't spend it for that, it will go for 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's budget also made road repairs a high priority, after a report from a 
blue ribbon business panel that poor maintenance would lead to higher 
reconstruction costs in the future. A total of 200 miles of streets will be 
resurfaced in the coming year, double the number this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another budget provision doubled the modest expenditure for graffiti removal 
and provided seed money for a project to promote business and tourism in Los 
Angeles. Removal of a 2-year-old surcharge on business taxes of 7.5% was also 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the road repairs, graffiti removal and promotional 
campaign, but it modified the last proposal with a tax cut of its own. The city 
lawmakers approved a removal of half the business surcharge and a reduction in 
the fees that residents pay for trash collection. For homeowners, that cut will 
be from $72 to $54 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and council agreed that the business tax reduction is an incentive 
for economic growth, although council members said that residents deserved a 
tax break too. 
</P>
<P>
 The council and mayor also put libraries and parks into a special category, 
among the few services in the city that will not be cut under a continuation of 
the city's 3-year-old hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members suggested that those departments should play even a larger 
role in improving public safety and the atmosphere of the city. The council 
reduced reserve accounts by more than $7 million to increase staffing at 
libraries and parks to levels of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that 35 recreation centers will remain open 38 hours a week, 
instead of just 25 hours, and that libraries can maintain current services and 
even expand a program that teaches schoolchildren how to use libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The council added funding for a basketball league for hard-core gang members, 
for a coordinator to handle domestic violence complaints and for a job 
mentoring program for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot just deliver one service, more police, as important as that is," 
said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who led the charge for much of the social 
service funding. "I think we need to deliver services that make life more 
livable in the city of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The money for most of the council's amendments would come from reducing the 
$38-million reserve fund that Riordan had proposed to $26 million. The mayor's 
office declined to say whether it would veto the additions. 
</P>
<P>
 While Riordan was praised by many for his inventiveness in wiping away a 
projected $200-million deficit and finding $83 million more for the police 
expansion, some council members cautioned that all of the budget's assumptions 
may not pan out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a high-risk budget," Councilman Marvin Braude said, "but we have 
decided it is worth the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sources of money that may not materialize, some lawmakers predicted, 
are the $17 million that Riordan said he could get this year from a city 
employee pension fund. That reduction has not been approved by the pension 
board. The mayor also projected taking in $9 million more from a new private 
parking enforcement operation on the city's Westside, but that program will not 
be running by the start of the fiscal year, as projected. 
</P>
<P>
 And, on Thursday, the council had a protracted discussion about the legality 
of using $25 million from the city's Community Redevelopment Agency to pay 
expenses that had traditionally been paid from the city treasury. The council 
ultimately approved the transfer, as long as the city attorney says it is on 
solid legal ground.

SCIENTIST LEARNS TOXIC ALGAE HEALTH THREAT FIRSTHAND; RESEARCH: HE SUFFERS 
SERIOUS MENTAL IMPAIRMENT WHILE STUDYING ORGANISM. HEALTH RETURNS AFTER ENDING 
EXPOSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Howard Glasgow's mental collapse began one night last December when he nudged 
his wife awake and flew into a rage about how she had left the vacuum cleaner 
cord draped loosely over the handle. "Why didn't you coil it?" he screamed. 
When he awoke the next morning, Glasgow refused to believe his outburst had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Glasgow got lost for two hours on his way home from work -- 
even though he has lived in the same house for seven years. When he tried to 
call his wife for help, he couldn't remember his phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 At work, the 37-year-old scientist started missing appointments and then 
insisted he never made them. He had long conversations with co-workers he 
instantly forgot. In time, he couldn't complete a short sentence without losing 
his train of thought and, although he had never suffered a speech impediment 
before, started to stutter so severely that he quit talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most painful of all, Glasgow -- who has college degrees in biology and 
chemistry and is a whiz at complex math formulas -- saw his reading 
comprehension plummet to match his 6-year-old daughter's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would start reading something and I couldn't retain it. Absolutely none of 
it," said Glasgow, a research associate at North Carolina State University's 
aquatic ecology laboratory in Raleigh. "It was like I was looking at Chinese 
writing and couldn't make any sense of it. And this was pretty simple stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 After a barrage of medical tests in December and January, Glasgow learned his 
body was under siege. His heartbeat and blood pressure were wildly erratic, his 
liver enzymes had shot up, he was prone to infections and his kidneys were 
excreting unusual amounts of phosphate. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians and marine scientists who studied Glasgow's case now suspect toxic 
marine algae, known for killing millions of fish off the Atlantic Coast, had 
slowly poisoned Glasgow while he worked in the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Invisible to the naked eye, the dinoflagellate -- a phantom-like half-plant, 
half-animal microorganism -- thrives in shallow bay waters along the East Coast 
that are polluted with phosphates, a widely dispersed nutrient in sewage and 
farm runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Glasgow studied the one-celled creature, mostly working alone 
in the lab next to rows of 2 1/2-gallon fish tanks containing water from North 
Carolina's Pamlico Estuary, a coastal bay inhabited by the organism. 
</P>
<P>
 The creatures apparently excreted a powerful toxin into the aquarium water -- 
and eventually the laboratory air -- that jumbled Glasgow's brain simply by 
sharing the same room with him, scientists and physicians believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasgow, who took two months off to recover, now seems nearly normal and has 
returned to work. Apparently, the damage to his brain was gradually reversed 
once he distanced himself from the organism.  
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State aquatic botanist JoAnn Burkholder, who directs the 
laboratory, called her research associate's ordeal an amazing story about "an 
organism that seems to have dropped out of some Stephen King movie."  
</P>
<P>
 Although some marine algae, including red tides, are known to be toxic to fish 
and contaminate shellfish, this is the first known instance of a human poisoned 
directly by them. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasgow's ordeal is especially alarming because the dinoflagellate has been 
found in large concentrations from Delaware to Florida in bay waters that are 
popular with millions of swimmers, fishermen and boaters. No one knows yet if 
the organism inhabits estuaries along the Pacific coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkholder and other scientists and neurologists caution that research into 
Glasgow's syndrome is in the fledgling stages and that they cannot prove the 
organism was to blame until the damaging toxin is isolated. Even so, they call 
the medical evidence overwhelming, and Burkholder says she is "personally dead 
certain." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other researchers who worked with the organism reported similar but less 
severe symptoms, including Burkholder, who said she suffered an eight-day bout 
of disorientation and short-term memory loss last year. Others reported vague 
problems such as nausea, eye irritation and breathing difficulties that may be 
related. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say for sure there are chronic, insidious effects on human health, 
but I think there are," said Burkholder, who discovered the dinoflagellate in 
1988 after striped bass died in a colleague's aquarium. "I think it's real, 
considering everything that's happened to people who work with it. We have a 
lot of strange, anecdotal information. Everyone who works with this organism 
seems to have problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Donald Schmechel, a neurologist who heads Duke University Medical Center's 
Memory Disorders Clinic, declined to talk about Glasgow's case because of 
patient confidentiality. But in March 31 medical records, Schmechel said 
Glasgow seems to have suffered a "toxic encephalopathy," or brain disorder, 
apparently caused by "exposures in the workplace due to biological toxin." 
</P>
<P>
 The part of his brain deep within the left temporal lobe was damaged, wiping 
out his memory, especially his verbal memory -- which means he could not recall 
what he said or what was said to him -- and triggering "episodic rage as well 
as depression," according to the medical records. The toxin also may have 
suppressed his immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a functional or psychiatric disorder but was clearly organic, 
and apparently a mostly reversible injury presumably secondary to marine 
biological toxin based on your exposure and symptoms," Schmechel reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasgow's syndrome adds a bizarre twist to a new phenomenon of poisonous algae 
blooms that have been found in increasing numbers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the mid-1980s, only a handful of poisonous algae species were known to 
kill fish. But since then marine researchers have discovered 10 species around 
the world, including one in 1987 that killed sea birds in California's Monterey 
Bay and sickened people who ate shellfish in Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkholder has found the dinoflagellate that apparently poisoned Glasgow in 
every state she has looked -- North Carolina, Delaware, Alabama, Virginia, 
South Carolina, Maryland and Florida. In 1991, it was linked to a massive fish 
kill in North Carolina's Pamlico Estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about public health, North Carolina environmental officials last month 
began exploring whether shrimpers and other fishermen who frequent Pamlico 
Estuary are suffering unusual neurological symptoms and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fishermen have told researchers about periodic memory lapses and sores 
that don't heal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people need to be scared, but they need to be made aware that 
there is a potential for human health problems as far as the estuary goes," 
Glasgow said. "Along the Atlantic seaboard, at this point, everywhere we've had 
fish kills, we've had these organisms present." 
</P>
<P>
 The health worries are a legitimate concern, said Don Anderson, a senior 
scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute who specializes in toxic algae. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got so many big fish kills caused by this organism, it is very 
possible there is a danger to a fisherman or a passerby or scientist sampling 
the water," Anderson said. "If the winds blow over the dead fish and there are 
all these (toxic) cells there, you could imagine (someone being harmed)." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Baden, a marine toxicologist at the University of Miami who is trying 
to isolate and identify the poisonous substance in the dinoflagellate, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have acute problems in the laboratory, you probably have chronic 
effects in the environment where people are exposed naturally," Baden said.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest mystery is how the creature poisons humans and fish.  
</P>
<P>
 Baden is trying to isolate the toxin by extracting bits of matter from the 
organism and testing each one for toxicity to fish. Then researchers can 
explore how the culprit interacts with fish and humans. Does it attack through 
the respiratory system or the skin? Does it target certain nerves? 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, little has been known about how toxic forms of algae function. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a consensus that this whole problem of red tides and what we are now 
calling harmful algae is worse all over the U.S.," Anderson said. "Where the 
line is starting to split, though, is whether this is a reflection of some 
fundamental coastal change such as pollution, or whether it is many different 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers suspect that the surge in toxic algae is related to nitrogen and 
phosphorus, nutrients in sewage and farm runoff that feed algae blooms and 
deplete oxygen in a process called eutrophication. Many marine experts believe 
the nutrients are causing a slow environmental shift in coastal waters to make 
them more hospitable to toxic organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, say some of the new toxic species may be turning up because 
of more sophisticated research techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an open question of how many of the blooms are new and how many just 
hadn't been discovered before. It makes good sense that nutrients have 
something to do with it, but that is hard to prove," said David Garrison, a 
National Science Foundation oceanographer who studied toxic blooms in Monterey 
Bay and the Pacific Northwest and found no link to nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 The creatures in Glasgow's case act like phantoms in the sea, hiding in 
sediments and waiting for fish or shellfish -- any species or size -- before 
they attack. They excrete a toxin that attacks the fish's nervous system, 
devour the fish, then quickly mutate into 15 other stages and retreat to the 
sediments to await their next prey. They often wait for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the worst-behaved dinoflagellate we have seen," Burkholder said. "It 
absolutely zeros in on fish. We shove a piece of fish tissue toward it and it 
starts to go crazy. It is more sneaky, more insidious and we don't really know 
how much damage it is causing yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Burkholder said the organism is probably expanding in scope because nutrient 
contamination that feeds algae blooms is worsening due to population growth 
along the shoreline. The highest algae concentrations are found near sewage 
outfalls, and laboratory tests show the algae grow rapidly in waters containing 
phosphates but not other pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine experts suspect the organism inhabits coastal estuaries worldwide, 
particularly shallow, turbid bays with warm water that are prone to algae 
buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 "You probably have fish kills all over the place because of this organism," 
said Karen Steidinger, a senior research scientist at Florida Marine Research 
Institute. "My gut feeling is these things are fairly common in back bay 
shallow areas which tend to be high in nutrients." 
</P>
<P>
 The creature's habit of altering its appearance and lying in wait for prey is 
so unusual that few marine researchers believed it existed until Burkholder 
filmed it and Steidinger, a nationally known algae expert, confirmed her 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a 'Star Wars,' alien scenario," said Raymond Alden, director of a 
marine research laboratory at Old Dominion University in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasgow's first hint of something wrong dates back to 1991, just a few months 
after he began working with cultures of the organism. He was reaching toward a 
tall shelf to gather materials when he realized his mind was racing but his 
hand was moving in slow motion. He went outside for fresh air and the feeling 
quickly passed. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, bouts of dizziness, moodiness and forgetfulness occurred off and 
on, even after his research was switched twice to different sites. The signs 
were so subtle that his wife and friends wrote it off to the vagaries of a 
scientist under stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the Monday after last Thanksgiving, Glasgow accidentally dropped some 
cultures on his arm, producing a huge, festering sore that quickly became 
infected. His wife Aileen, watched her good-natured and intelligent husband of 
20 years fall apart before her eyes within two weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 "Howard got worse and worse," Aileen Glasgow said. "There were times where he 
would virtually give up speaking at all. He would get one word out, and then 
stutter, then forget what he was saying. Bless his heart. He was very 
frustrated, because he realized something was happening." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she feared her husband was suffering from Alzheimer's disease or a 
brain tumor. But Duke University neurologists quickly linked his symptoms to 
exposure to some type of biological toxin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really concerned because he was forgetting literally everything that 
was said to him. He would go absolutely berserk about trivial things," Aileen 
Glasgow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasgow, who took off work from mid-December until late March, now seems 
nearly normal mentally and physically, although no one knows whether he will 
suffer further problems such as liver damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has cleared up so remarkably, but they don't think he will ever have his 
memory back," Aileen Glasgow said. "The memories during that period simply 
didn't imprint on his brain, just like you took a photograph that didn't turn 
out."  
</P>
<P>
 Although he has returned to his research lab, Glasgow will never again be able 
to work directly with the organism because doctors fear his exposure has left 
him ultra-sensitive to its toxin. Worst of all, he says, is the knowledge that 
the organism is still out in the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to concentrate on the science and what we can do about it from an 
environmental standpoint," Howard Glasgow said. "If something can be learned 
from my exposure, all the better."

NEXT INSURANCE CHIEF WILL FACE POLITICIAN'S NIGHTMARE; ELECTIONS: WINNER OF 
RACE TO REPLACE GARAMENDI WILL INHERIT 20 MAJOR SUITS AND 600 FRAUD 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The candidates for California insurance commissioner in the June 7 primary 
call the job a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more like a politician's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Commissioner John Garamendi is bequeathing his replacement 20 major 
lawsuits, 600 open fraud investigations and 70 requests by insurance companies 
for rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Garamendi runs for the Democratic nomination for governor, the 
Insurance Department is defending itself in the state Supreme Court, where the 
industry has mounted a major challenge to the commissioner's basic authority to 
limit its profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, the California Supreme Court will decide whether the 
Legislature can weaken Proposition 103, the 1988 initiative that made insurance 
commissioner an elective office and created the current regulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the policy issues awaiting the next commissioner: How to 
overhaul the health insurance system, limit auto insurance costs, provide 
coverage for the millions of Californians who have no insurance, and see to it 
that insurance companies offer coverage against the disasters that routinely 
strike California. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, the commissioner is responsible for analyzing the financial 
health of insurers, and must seize them if they become insolvent. Garamendi, 
the state's first elected commissioner, took over several companies, including 
the massive Executive Life, and litigation over them continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the governor, the insurance commissioner is the one statewide 
officeholder who most directly affects the wallet of every consumer in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians spend $60 billion a year to insure their cars, homes, health, 
life and businesses. It is the insurance commissioner who decides whether rates 
will rise and whether consumer complaints are heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the headaches that await the next commissioner, an intense fight is 
under way in both major parties for the right to take on the $95,052-a-year 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 The three main Republican candidates in the primary are Jim Conran, Gov. Pete 
Wilson's former Department of Consumer Affairs director; Assemblyman Chuck 
Quackenbush of Cupertino, and Wes Bannister, an Orange County insurance broker 
who was the party's nominee in 1990 against Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 The two main Democrats are state Sen. Art Torres, who has represented the 
Eastside of Los Angeles in the Legislature for 20 years, and Assemblyman Burt 
Margolin, who has represented the Westside for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Democrats vow to pressure companies into granting rebates ordered by 
Proposition 103, and say they will consider withholding decisions on rate 
increases for companies that have refused to issue rebates. Garamendi used that 
tactic, but it has been challenged in court by insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican candidates acknowledge that they opposed the initiative, but 
pledge to enforce its provisions. They say they intend to hold down rates by 
being tough on insurance fraud, a point Torres also makes. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance industry is vitally interested in the outcome of this campaign. 
But so far, its public involvement is limited to convening candidate forums and 
reporting on the race in trade journals. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance executives have shied away from contributing the tens of millions 
they spent trying to defeat Proposition 103 and promote competing alternatives 
six years ago. They contribute little now, believing voters would reject any 
candidate who is perceived as being close to the industry -- a view supported 
by the Democratic candidates and Republican Quackenbush, all of whom pledge to 
take no money from insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Conran and Bannister accept money from the industry in their low-budget 
campaigns. The Assn. of California Insurance Companies has donated $10,000 to 
Conran, and a few insurers have donated up to $2,500 to Conran and Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the office's consumer bent, Democratic Party leaders believe their 
candidate has a natural advantage over the Republican nominee in the November 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, 43, and Torres, 47, are liberal on social and consumer issues but 
differ markedly in their styles. Torres is a part of the Senate power 
structure, and chairman of the Insurance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 He is among the Capitol's best orators, and often takes his committees on the 
road for headline-attracting hearings. This year, he drew attention by 
traveling to the site of the 1991 Oakland fire, where he announced that he was 
introducing "the homeowners bill of rights." The bill would streamline 
homeowner insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he held widely publicized hearings on a pay-at-the-pump proposal in 
which motorists would pay more for gasoline in exchange for lower-cost auto 
insurance. He concluded that the idea lacked support and quickly dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, by contrast, is a loner who is not known for sharp-tongued sound 
bites. The Assembly Health Committee chairman, he has spent years toiling on 
the intricacies of workers' compensation and health insurance -- issues that do 
not lend themselves to brevity. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Margolin's legislative victories came in 1992, when he won passage of a 
law that helps small businesses provide health insurance to workers. Other 
legislators might have trumpeted its passage to the news media as a major 
event. Margolin called the bill modest, and it garnered virtually no publicity 
until Wilson signed it into law and took credit for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the Capitol, Torres is viewed as being willing to negotiate and strike 
compromises. Margolin is less ready to compromise, and is campaigning as an 
unreconstructed consumer advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry has too much power," Margolin said. "The average consumer gets 
crushed when an insurance carrier says, 'We're going to object to your claim.' 
The leveler, the one person who can equalize the odds for the consumer, is the 
insurance commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres also says he would bring a strong consumer orientation to the office, 
but criticizes Garamendi for his rhetorical attacks on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first duty is to the consumer," Torres said, pledging to be tough on "bad 
actors" in the industry. But he added, "In most areas, if there is a way to 
strike a balance, and still maintain a priority to consumers, then I'm going to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres has won several endorsements, including one from the Democratic Party. 
But in the most recent campaign statements, Margolin had $454,000, compared to 
Torres' $115,000. Margolin began his career as an aide to Los Angeles Reps. 
Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, when Berman was in the Assembly. Berman, Waxman 
and their allies have given Margolin's campaign $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres is likely to close the money gap. He is a proven fund-raiser who spent 
more than $1 million in his unsuccessful race against Gloria Molina to become 
Los Angeles County supervisor in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres began his life in politics by working for Cesar Chavez, founder of the 
United Farm Workers. He and Chavez had a falling out in the 1980 fight for the 
Assembly speakership, when Torres, then an assemblyman, sided against Berman, 
Chavez's choice to become Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Torres has been mentioned as one who could win statewide office. 
But he slipped up in his personal life and was convicted twice of drunk 
driving. After the second conviction, in 1990, his driver's license was 
revoked. His license has since been returned, but he says he continues to pay 
high auto insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to hide from the truth. I've made some mistakes. I've overcome 
them," said Torres, who has quit drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush, 40, probably the wealthiest of the five major candidates, has 
loaned his campaign $350,000. A telegenic moderate, he is close to Wilson. 
Quackenbush is critical of Garamendi, charging that he created a very hostile 
environment for the industry that drove some insurance companies out of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush views himself as a free-market advocate who argues that insurance 
companies that have left the state can be lured back. Once they return, he 
said, "there will be an insurance price war," resulting in lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Conran and Bannister, who will not have money to spend on television 
commercials, Quackenbush intends to run a series of 30-second spots in some of 
California's 11 media markets. Although he is taking no money from insurance 
companies, he is accepting it from independent agents and brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush made his money when he and his wife founded a company called 
Q-Tech, which supplied temporary workers to Silicon Valley firms. The couple 
are now venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Conran, 42, went to work for Wilson as director of the Department of Consumer 
Affairs in 1991 after working as a Pacific Bell executive for 13 years. As 
director, he oversaw boards and commissions that regulate businesses and 
professions. He quit the agency to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of the agency, Conran quickly gained a reputation as a tough, 
effective administrator. He ordered an investigation of the state Medical 
Board's handling of patients' complaints, finding that the board dismissed or 
destroyed hundreds of complaints against doctors in 1990 in an attempt to erase 
a backlog. 
</P>
<P>
 He also investigated Sears auto repair shops, finding fraud in the operation 
and reaching an $8-million settlement with the giant retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand how the regulatory process should work, and how to make it 
better, and I don't know that other candidates know that," Conran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bannister, 57, owns an independent insurance agency in Huntington Beach, where 
he served on the City Council for four years. He was the GOP nominee in 1990, 
and received 37% of the vote against Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he decided to run again because no other candidate stepped forward who 
understands how insurance works. The June 7 primary will mark the third time he 
has been on a statewide ballot, which suggests that more voters will recognize 
his name. But he is running a low-cost campaign and expects to raise about 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do is solve the problems of consumers," Bannister said. "The consumers 
are my clients. I'm not a fan of the industry."

NEWS ANALYSIS; STAKE IN STATE'S FUTURE LINKS CLINTON, FEINSTEIN; POLITICS: 
CALIFORNIA'S IMPORTANCE IMPROVES HER ACCESS TO PRESIDENT, WHO IS VISITING L.A. 
TO BOOST HER CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein and President Clinton share a powerful political bond: 
If California is in trouble, they are both in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when things were going badly in the Golden State, there seemed to 
be plenty for the two to disagree about. Feinstein (D-Calif.) harangued the new 
Administration for closing California military bases and for suggesting 
environmental sanctions against the state; she threatened to vote against the 
President's budget unless there were changes and she opposed a landmark trade 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Clinton arrives in Los Angeles today for a second visit to help 
Feinstein's reelection campaign, there are signs of improvement in the 
California economy and, at the same time, relations between the two lawmakers 
are as good as ever. Clinton and Feinstein both played played major roles in 
getting congressional support for California's Desert Protection Act and the 
assault weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in a situation right now that is the best of all worlds in politics, 
where you are both helping each other and nobody is dragging each other down," 
said Susan Estrich, a USC law professor and former campaign manager for 
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. "Those are the rare moments 
when you can be embracing. . . . It helps her clout that the President of the 
United States has come in twice for her and it helps him to be in the state 
with the most popular politician in California." 
</P>
<P>
 California's high place on the White House priority list -- due to its 
substantial impact on the national economy and on the 1996 presidential 
election -- has helped give Feinstein extraordinary access to the President and 
the Administration for a freshman legislator.  
</P>
<P>
 She was the first rank-and-file member of Congress to talk privately with 
Clinton just days after he was inaugurated. And even though Democrats consider 
Feinstein a favorite for reelection, she is one of only four senators to 
benefit from a presidential campaign visit in this election cycle, and she is 
the only one to host Clinton twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, about 700 contributors, including many from Hollywood's entertainment 
industry, will join Clinton and Feinstein in Beverly Hills for dinner and a 
performance by singers Ray Charles and Natalie Cole. Combined with another 
event in San Francisco last December, Clinton's two visits are expected to 
generate about $1.4 million for Feinstein -- more than 15% of her campaign's 
total budget goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein believes her campaign will need a lot of money. The front-runner in 
the Republican primary, Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), is a wealthy 
former Texas oilman who is spending his own money on a race that is sure to be 
one of the nation's most expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the independent Field Poll reported that Huffington trails the 
incumbent by just 7 points, 48-41. Feinstein's 26-point edge in an earlier 
Field Poll has shrunk as Huffington's campaign has blitzed statewide television 
stations with about $4 million worth of commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also led his closest Republican rival, ex-Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), 37-21. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shifted the perception of a contest that had seemed heavily lopsided 
in Feinstein's favor. Coming just as the President arrives in Los Angeles, it 
also underscores the mutual reasons he and Feinstein have for this California 
visit -- Clinton's 12th since he was inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the size of the state, the importance of the state in the national 
perspective and, obviously, the President holds her in high regard," said Ken 
Klein, deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Feinstein is largely supportive of the President's initiatives 
in Congress, where the Congressional Quarterly reports that she has backed 
Clinton with her votes 89% of the time. Still, she is far from his best 
supporter; 28 senators -- half of the chamber's Democrats -- have voted even 
more consistently with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a priority for this Administration," said Tom Epstein, the White House 
director for California affairs. "Sometimes, for us, it was a little 
uncomfortable when she would challenge the Administration publicly. But 
politically, it's what she needed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was under pressure to quickly prove herself when she arrived in 
Washington since she had barely 19 months until she would be tested on the 
California ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 When she first met Clinton in the Oval Office on Feb. 4, 1993, she recalled 
saying: "Mr. President, I must tell you California is in trouble and needs your 
help." Feinstein later sent Clinton an eight-page outline for a "specific 
Administration-wide strategy for the California economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The former San Francisco mayor said she received a commitment for help from 
the President, but at times it still appeared the senator and the 
Administration were headed in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration targeted eight military bases for closure shortly after 
California's unemployment rate hit a nine-year high of 10.1%. After state 
legislators wrestled with a $3-billion budget shortfall, Feinstein criticized a 
"Draconian" threat by federal environmental regulators to withhold $700 million 
in highway funds unless the state complied with strict clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
 By summer, when the Administration unveiled its plan to fix the nation's 
economic engine with a controversial $241-billion tax increase, Feinstein was 
well entrenched in the negotiations. She fought with the Administration to win 
tax breaks for California oil companies and real estate developers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the budget package finally passed by one vote, she and the Administration 
defended the tax increase by saying it was targeted largely at the richest 
Americans. Still, it is a vote Republicans want her to defend in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said the budget vote was the deciding factor that led him to 
announce his Senate campaign, and last month, his commercials targeted the 
issue, saying: "In business, you learn that higher taxes destroy jobs. In 
government, they never learn that lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said, however, she is ready to defend the vote. She also said she is 
confident voters will see that she and the White House have repeatedly 
demonstrated their dedication to California through earthquake relief, defense 
conversion funds, tougher immigration enforcement, targeted investment tax 
credits and the Desert Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my relationship with the White House has been super," she said this 
week. "It's impossible to agree on all things, but this is a President who 
knows domestic policy. . . . I am still pressing for more . . . but I think 
I've had a good response."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / FAYE FIORE: KEEPING LID ON WHITE HOUSE WEDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are few things this country loves more than a good White House wedding. 
When Nellie Grant, daughter of Ulysses S., married Angerton Sartoris in 1874, 
throngs massed outside the mansion to glimpse the horse-drawn nuptial carriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of a misty-eyed Lynda Bird Johnson on the arm of strapping Marine 
Capt. Charles Robb in 1967 briefly took the nation's mind off Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 And who could forget those historical empty calories upon which the nation 
feasted in the form of a 400-egg, white cake baked in 1971 for Tricia Nixon? 
</P>
<P>
 But it's been 23 long years since matrimonial bliss descended upon the White 
House, and America is itching for a hitching. Well, wait no more. On May 28, a 
happy couple is tying the knot at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Nicole Boxer and Anthony Rodham. 
</P>
<P>
 Who? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So they're not exactly Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom, but they do have 
some powerful Washington connections: She's the 26-year-old daughter of 
California Sen. Barbara Boxer. He's the 39-year-old younger brother of First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still a White House wedding, and that's as good as it's gonna get for 
awhile. Besides, it's not like people have been lining up for a chance to say 
"I do" in the East Room. In 1992, Dorothy Bush LeBlond chose to hold her second 
marriage at remote Camp David. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Roger Clinton -- a First Brother who has never been called shy, an 
aspiring singer with a movie venture called "Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings" -- 
even he turned down an invitation to wed in the presidential mansion. And it 
had nothing to do with the bride being eight months pregnant. Roger was "afraid 
it would turn into a media event." 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came Tony and Nicole. Apparently they don't share Roger's fear. For 
one thing, they want a private wedding in the mother of all public houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The groom would not return phone calls. Ditto the bride. (Although she did 
tell the Marin Independent Journal she thought the whole thing was "going to be 
a kick.") 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Boxer's office refers all wedding calls to the White House. The White 
House fellow who knows all about it is in Europe and his colleagues seem 
annoyed by the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why choose the White House if you don't want public inquiry?  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to see it from their side: This is their wedding day, " one aide 
scolds. "Some people consider this the most important day of their lives ." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute! All we want to know is who's making the dress? What flavor 
is the cake? Who's on the guest list? "That's private," another aide barks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So we brave a stiff wind on Capitol Hill to find Sen. Boxer, fresh from a news 
conference with actor Ted Danson. She agrees, reluctantly, to talk wedding, but 
only while walking briskly toward something more important at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like any other mom, I want her to be happy," Boxer allows. "There are 
lots of nice places to get married, but I can't imagine a nicer place than the 
White House." 
</P>
<P>
 It is here that we make an apparent faux pas: "What will the mother of the 
bride be wearing?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Ugh," Boxer groans, shooting a look that suggests she would rather spend a 
year in a small room with Rush Limbaugh than discuss tea-length, knee-length or 
to-the-floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Just then Boxer bumps into Supreme Court Justice nominee Stephen Breyer, who 
is strolling to the Capitol, where he'll be seeking confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations!" she gushes, pumping his hand. End of wedding talk. The 
reporter -- a "Who will act as best man?" query still forming on the lips -- is 
given the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 "You better drop this," Boxer's assistant snaps, glowering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What have we come to? Weren't we treated the last time around to such 
tantalizing details as Tricia's "super-special Priscilla of Boston" dress? Her 
bridesmaids' "opalescent layered gowns of mint green and lilac with fluttery 
necklines and hems"? 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, there is more to this than gray swallow-tailed cutaways and 
organdy. Boxer's daughter is about to become the sister-in-law of the President 
of the United States. Doesn't that afford the senator a certain leverage held 
by no other? 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing to take him on, as she says she did on NAFTA, when he's just 
the President. It's another thing when it means a seat at the card table in the 
kitchen next Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officially, there isn't any relationship," Boxer says. "It doesn't enter in 
when you are professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles political consultant Joe Cerrell saw it another way: "That sends a 
signal that the freshman junior senator from California might have more going 
with the White House than some of her senior colleagues. More credit to her!" 
</P>
<P>
 Just one other thing. Who's paying for this shindig? 
</P>
<P>
 "The families are taking care of all costs," the Boxer aide says icily. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, some things you can't keep secret: They're registered at Macy's. For 
those inclined to send a gift, the happy couple desires a Vitantonia Belgian 
waffle maker, a white, wood, tile-topped table and an ice bucket. Cash will 
also be "happily accepted."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; ADVISER CRITICIZES BROWN'S PORTRAYAL OF STATE 
ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown's gubernatorial campaign theme of scoring California's 
economy as the worst in the country was sharply criticized Thursday by one of 
her informal economics advisers, Joel Kotkin, who said he was disassociating 
himself from the Brown effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotkin, a journalist and commentator who believes in the economic power of 
emerging industries, said that the "America's worst economy" line in Brown's 
literature and television ads is damaging California's business allure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California's unemployment rate remains high, for a variety of 
reasons, California's "is not remotely the worst economy in the country," 
Kotkin said, noting that a third of the nation's 100 fastest-growing companies 
are located in California, according to Inc. magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really bad strategy," Kotkin said, adding that there was 
considerable dismay within the Brown camp and among some of Brown's business 
supporters about the economic thrust of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A response from the Brown campaign late Thursday said: "Kathleen Brown 
understands that the California economy has many underlying strengths, but 
under Pete Wilson this state and the economy have suffered four years of 
decline and neglect. The facts are clear that California has the worst-managed 
economy in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement by policy adviser Ben Sherwood went on to cite a litany of 
unemployment and business-failure statistics and said that Brown has developed 
a strategy supported by leading economists and business leaders to build on 
California's strengths and create a million jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown officials described Kotkin as one of a number of experts Brown 
consulted. But he held no formal role in the campaign and, although he is a 
longtime friend of Brown, he was not considered part of her inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotkin said he has spent "a huge amount of time" explaining his economic 
theories to Brown and had expressed his objections to the campaign theme 
repeatedly in conversations with her. He said speaking out publicly "is really 
painful for me because I really like Kathleen Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Kotkin is a proponent of a theory known as the New Economy that embraces the 
importance of emerging industries. Real economic growth, the theory goes, rests 
with small entrepreneurial firms in industries such as biomedicine, apparel, 
consumer economics, computer hardware and software and a variety of service 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotkin also is a journalist and commentator on economic matters who has 
written for the Los Angeles Times Sunday opinion section and occasionally 
appears on the Los Angeles outlet of the Fox Television Network. Brown's 
husband, Van Gordon Sauter, is an executive of Fox Television. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has been criticized since the Democratic State Convention in mid-April 
when she adopted the new campaign slogan, "America's Best Treasurer to Revive 
America's Worst Economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Brown campaign insiders, who declined to be identified, said that 
changes are likely to be made in the campaign theme before the general election 
campaign gets under way this summer and that the slogan may be dropped. All of 
those contacted were convinced that she will defeat Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi and state Sen. Tom Hayden in the June 7 Democratic primary.

U.S. DROPS BID TO TRY ALLEGED RAPIST; COURTS: ATTY. GEN. RENO SAYS 
DOUBLE-JEOPARDY PROTECTION BARS CHARGING THE MEXICAN IN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States is abandoning efforts to extradite a Mexican national in the 
rape of a 4-year-old Riverside County girl after concluding that the protection 
against double jeopardy bars trying him in California, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Reno said she understands that Mexico is appealing to toughen the 31 
1/2-year sentence Serapio Zuniga Rios received from a Mexican court. Mexico 
refused to extradite Zuniga, who fled to his homeland and was arrested there in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have checked and double-checked and have concluded that double jeopardy 
would prevent the extradition and trial in California," Reno said at her weekly 
meeting with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department spokesman said that attorneys from the Office of 
International Affairs had been told by Riverside prosecutors that California 
bars double jeopardy and that Zuniga could not be prosecuted under state law if 
he were brought back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, Zuniga allegedly kidnaped the child from her parents' 
ranch and sexually assaulted her, then wrapped her in a blanket that he hung 
from a tree. In addition to the brutality of the crime, the case became 
involved in the NAFTA vote and was a sore point in U.S.-Mexican relations. 
Zuniga was allegedly enraged over being fired from the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has never extradited one of its citizens to the United States for 
trial, and late last month, the Mexican government notified the U.S. Embassy in 
Mexico City that Zuniga had been tried in secret and convicted of sexual 
assault, abduction, burglary and imprisoned there. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. Gelbard of the State Department said on the eve of a two-day meeting 
between U.S. and Mexican officials May 9 that "we are deeply shocked and 
disappointed by the Mexican government's actions." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican government has known from the beginning that we have considered 
the Zuniga Rios case to be of fundamental importance," he said. "We thought we 
had complete assurances from the Mexican government . . . that this man would 
be extradited. . . . If they are not prepared to extradite Zuniga Rios under 
the assurances we have gotten, under what circumstances are they going to 
extradite anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official, insisting on anonymity, went further. 
"They lied to us," he said. "There was amazement, horror and real anger when we 
learned what they had done." 
</P>
<P>
 The case became a NAFTA issue when Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.) said he had 
swung his vote to support the trade agreement in November only after Mexico's 
then-attorney general personally assured him that the suspect would be 
extradited. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno tried to downplay any problem with Mexico over the case, saying she 
had been told only that Zuniga would be extradited if a court ordered the 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've expressed concern to the government of Mexico and told them that it is 
important that we move on and develop action and move forward on matters of 
concern to us," she said.

RIVER-RUNNING WHALE DISAPPEARS; SEA LIFE: SCIENTISTS HOPE THE 25-FOOT ANIMAL 
HAS HEADED BACK OUT TO SAN FRANCISCO BAY. THEY WILL SEARCH PETALUMA WATERWAY 
TODAY BEFORE CALLING OFF RESCUE EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Phyllis the wandering whale abruptly vanished Thursday, raising hopes that the 
celebrity mammal has wearied of sightseeing and glided out of the Petaluma 
River toward the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the wily whale may have merely slipped undetected into a side slough 
for some rest, experts were cautiously optimistic that Phyllis -- who may, in 
fact, be a Pete -- had rejoined his or her migrating colleagues and plotted a 
proper course for Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no sign of the whale," said Peigin Barrett of the Marine Mammal 
Center, who organized efforts to coax the stubborn cetacean from the river. 
"We're not sure where it is, but we would all be delighted if it's heading 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 The whale, a baby gray 25 feet long, was last spotted Wednesday evening near a 
marina about seven miles north of the river mouth. It came to a halt there 
after a flotilla of boats armed with noisemakers spent the day in a mostly 
futile effort to herd it downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a team of scientists, veterinarians and acoustics experts had 
planned to observe the whale's behavior and devise a new plan to escort the 
six-ton animal from the river, a murky waterway that averages just 15 feet 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the squad spent the day searching for their missing patient, assisted 
by Coast Guard boats and a television news helicopter that hunted for telltale 
spouts on San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, the whale was still missing in action: "We don't know how it got 
in and we don't know how it got out," said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist 
with the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordaro said the team of scientists would make one more sweep of the river 
today before closing down the rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The whale, believed to be 1 or 2 years old, first surfaced in the Petaluma 
River on Saturday, puzzling experts, who say such side trips into inland 
waterways are extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, scientists aboard a flotilla of vessels have tried a carrot and 
stick approach -- attempting to lure the mammal seaward by broadcasting gray 
whale sounds underwater, and driving it downriver by clanging on steel pipes. 
Unperturbed, the whale mostly ignored the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although somewhat frustrating for scientists, Phyllis' odyssey thrilled 
hundreds of spectators, who trekked to Petaluma from all over Northern 
California for a glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whales are magnificent creatures," Jacqueline Birch, a tourist from 
Schenectady, N.Y., said after viewing the mammal from the Petaluma breakwater 
Wednesday. "This one stopped to say hello, so the least we can do is welcome 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The saga also sparked an outpouring of volunteerism from whale-lovers 
concerned about the baby cetacean's plight. Case Blazyk, for instance, donated 
his time and his 22-foot Boston Whaler boat to help get Phyllis back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "This little whale doesn't deserve to die at the end of a muddy brown river," 
Blazyk said. "Humans have done so many awful things to whales over the years. 
Maybe this is one small way of paying them back."

JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS: 1929-1994; RESPONSE TO TREATMENT IS KEY TO BATTLING 
LYMPHOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although non-Hodgkin's lymphoma like that contracted by Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis is normally considered one of the more curable cancers, nearly half of 
those who develop it die within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the best of (treatment) programs, one-third of patients don't respond 
well, and two-thirds ultimately die of the disease," said Dr. Rex Greene, chief 
of the cancer teaching program at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the initial treatment is not successful, the disease can progress 
rapidly. "That's the nature of lymphoma. It's especially aggressive," Greene 
said. Because chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cells, it is often 
successful against lymphomas, which are fast-growing cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if they don't respond to treatment, they can come roaring back," Greene 
said. "Some lymphomas can double in size in the space of a couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis' cancer was diagnosed in January and she was hospitalized most 
recently at the beginning of the week for what was described as complications 
of the therapy. A hospital spokesman announced Thursday that all treatment had 
been halted and she had returned home.  
</P>
<P>
 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer of the immune system -- specifically the 
lymph nodes and the lymphocytes, cells that protect the body against invading 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidence has been rising, reaching about 43,000 a year, because the 
disease is relatively common in AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients and 
other people whose immune systems have been suppressed. An estimated 21,200 
people will die of it this year, according to the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease most commonly strikes people over 50 and, for unknown reasons, is 
becoming increasingly common among those over 65. It is somewhat more common in 
men than in women. 
</P>
<P>
 The characteristic symptoms of lymphoma are enlarged lymph nodes, anemia, 
weight loss and fever. There is generally little pain. Among AIDS victims and 
transplant patients, the most common cause is the Epstein-Barr virus, which 
also causes mononucleosis. It is also believed to be caused by exposure to 
industrial chemicals and pesticides, which may be why it is more common among 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for any individual case, we generally don't know the exact cause," said 
Dr. Cary Presant, an oncologist who is president of the California section of 
the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The complications of lymphoma treatment include low white cell counts, 
bleeding, infections, nausea, diarrhea and general gastrointestinal discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very toxic medications we use to treat it," Greene said. "When they 
don't work, we have the side effects of chemotherapy on top of the direct 
effects of the tumor -- a potent combination. With a fast-growing cancer, it is 
hard to distinguish which is causing which problem."

JUSTICE DEPT. GIVES CLINTON RESEARCH ON LAWSUIT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department has sent the White House its legal research on the 
question of whether the President can be sued while in office but has not 
reached a conclusion on the matter, Administration officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will not 
write a formal legal opinion on the President's immunity from lawsuits.But they 
said the office is continuing to research the matter in preparation for filing 
a friend-of-the-court brief in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed earlier this 
month against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said the department may be asked by the court in the 
case to state its views on the immunity issue or may file a brief even without 
being asked, a common practice in cases where the government's interest is 
implicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit against Clinton by a former Arkansas state employee, Paula Corbin 
Jones, raises the unprecedented question of whether a President, while in 
office, can be subjected to a civil suit unrelated to his official duties. The 
Supreme Court has said the President cannot be sued for his official acts but 
has not resolved the question of whether that protection extends to his private 
activities.

LATEST WELFARE REFORM PLAN REFLECTS LIBERALS' PRIORITIES; CONGRESS: REP. MATSUI 
OUTLINES A BILL JOINING SEVERAL OTHER COMPETING BLUEPRINTS. THEY FILL A VOID 
LEFT BY CLINTON'S FAILURE TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In another sign of fragmenting congressional opinion on welfare, Rep. Robert 
T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) outlined his own reform bill Thursday, one that could 
become a rallying point for liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is formally introduced, Matsui's bill will join more than half a dozen 
other welfare reform plans put forward by legislators across the ideological 
spectrum. The proliferation of competing proposals testifies to the vacuum left 
by the Clinton Administration's failure to introduce its own plan. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated delays, the Administration again has pushed back the 
introduction date on its reform plan. Officials now say that the President will 
not unveil his welfare reform blueprint until after he returns from celebrating 
the 50th anniversary of D-day in June. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks to reporters Thursday, President Clinton said that welfare reform 
still "might catch fire -- we might get a bipartisan consensus to move the bill 
in a hurry and get it this year. I wouldn't write this off." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in fact, most close observers both in Congress and the Administration 
believe that the extended delay has virtually eliminated the possibility of 
final legislative action on welfare reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsui's legislation, which he said he will introduce after Congress returns 
from its Memorial Day break, shows just how wide a range of views Clinton must 
attempt to reconcile in forging a coalition for welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 While Matsui's bill shares the Administration's emphasis on encouraging work, 
it departs in most key particulars. At the core of Clinton's plan is a 
requirement that welfare recipients -- beginning with those 25 and younger -- 
accept public or private employment after two years on the rolls. Those who 
fail to work could eventually face the loss of all their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsui's bill rejects the time limit and would restrict penalties to the 
parent's share of a welfare grant -- about one-third of the typical payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with the strict time limit and the kind of penalties they are 
talking about is you basically make the mother homeless," Matsui said. "And you 
put the kids in a situation where they have to go into a foster family or 
become homeless with their mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Matsui builds his proposal on the training and work program, known as JOBS, 
that Congress established in the Family Support Act of 1988, the last major 
attempt to re-craft the welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that law, states are required by 1995 to enroll at least 20% of the 
eligible welfare caseload in the JOBS program, which provides training and 
public employment for recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsui's bill would require states to enroll in JOBS 50% of the eligible 
caseload by 1999. Half of that group would be required to be in work programs, 
rather than education or training. But he would impose no limit on how long a 
welfare recipient could hold such a publicly funded job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to shift the debates from time limits to work requirements," Matsui 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials said that simply expanding the existing JOBS 
program will not sufficiently reform the system, because it exempts too many 
recipients from work requirements. Current rules exempt from the JOBS program 
almost half of all welfare recipients, mostly those with children under the age 
of 3, according to government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because of state funding shortages, only about one in seven of those 
required to participate actually took part in JOBS in 1991 and almost all of 
those are in education and training, rather than work programs, government 
figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsui said that he would be willing to discuss narrowing the exemptions from 
the JOBS program during the legislative process. And he pointedly noted that 
the Administration's plan also would exempt much of the caseload by limiting 
its work requirement to younger recipients. "The Administration is not going to 
get everybody either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond its approach to requiring work, Matsui's bill illuminates two other 
potential dividing lines in the welfare debate. The bill proposes a major 
expansion of child care for the working poor -- a top priority for liberals in 
the welfare debate. The Administration scaled back its plan to expand such aid 
when Clinton recently decided against raising taxes to fund his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as importantly, the Matsui bill rejects proposals backed by Republicans 
and moderate Democrats to discourage out-of-wedlock births by denying 
additional benefits to women who have more children while already on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably absent from Matsui's bill is any recommendation on how to pay for his 
plan, which he estimates would cost $12 billion to $15 billion over five years. 
He said that it will not be necessary to explore funding options until the full 
Ways and Means Committee tackles welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the Administration plan has been so long delayed is the difficulty 
in finding offsetting cuts to pay for the package. In his remarks Thursday, 
Clinton again emphasized his opposition to a proposal from moderate Democrats 
and House Republicans to fund reform by cutting off all social welfare benefits 
to legal immigrants who are not yet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Some White House advisers, and the House Democratic leadership, have counseled 
Clinton to further delay the welfare bill to avoid a fight with congressional 
liberals whose support he needs to pass health care reform, his top legislative 
priority. But, Clinton said Thursday, "I don't believe that my introducing my 
plan will undermine our ability to achieve health care reform this year."

EUROPE; ARMED BOBBIES SPUR DEBATE AMONG BRITONS; THE CITIZENRY HAS PRIDED 
ITSELF ON CONSTABLES WHO KEEP ORDER WITH ONLY A BILLY CLUB AND A SMILE. BUT 
CRIMINALS' USE OF WEAPONS IS RISING, AND SOME POLICE CAN NOW CARRY GUNS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The British have long prided themselves on having a virtually unarmed police 
force -- a national symbol of civility and order. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional bobby in his funny helmet was armed only with a billy club and 
a smile -- in sharp contrast to the gunslinging cops in U.S. and continental 
European police forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, criminals -- particularly in Britain's inner cities -- 
increasingly have been using weapons. Public pressure to arm the police has 
mounted, and this week Scotland Yard provoked controversy by permitting some 
police to carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Police Force (Scotland Yard's official name), declared that 
members of specialist teams could wear guns in holsters and increased from five 
to 12 the number of its armed-response vehicles (ARVs). 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, police in ARVs needed authorization from a high-ranking officer 
before they could remove guns from a locked box, a process that often hindered 
the interception of criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Police authorities also announced that bobbies nationwide may soon abandon 
their traditional 19th-Century nightsticks in favor of U.S.-style telescoping 
batons, which with a flick of a wrist extend the reach of the weapon. The 
government hopes that introduction of the modern baton will dilute calls for 
the routine arming of Britain's police. 
</P>
<P>
 Some civil rights activists have opposed an increase in the number of armed 
police. Currently in London, only 1,888 of 28,000 police are armed and they 
mostly belong to diplomatic protection and other specialist groups, whose 
weapons are concealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Atiya Lockwood of the civil liberties group Liberty said the move was 
"dangerous and undemocratic." She added, "There is no evidence people will be 
safer. More innocent people will be shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Even many police officers believe that only highly trained specialists should 
be armed. An official of the Police Federation, which represents 126,000 
officers nationwide, explained: "The federation is against the routine arming 
of police and the open wearing of guns. It is in favor of limited specialist 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 The official cited a recent Gallup Poll of 1,000 members of the public and 
2,000 police constables showing that fewer than half the officers responding 
favored wider arming.  
</P>
<P>
 The sharpest difference of opinion arose between officers in the inner cities 
and their colleagues in rural areas. In London, 63% wanted ready access to 
guns, while in the countryside, two-thirds of those officers polled wanted no 
more armed police. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 31% of officers surveyed said they were not "psychologically" equipped 
to carry weapons. Many said they would not be trained well enough to handle 
weapons and might lose them in a confrontation with armed criminals, the Police 
Federation official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other objections ranged from the danger of accidents to the possibility the 
change would in turn give criminals a greater excuse to carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, according to the Assn. of Chief Police Officers, the number of armed 
assaults on police has remained fairly static, with only about two officers 
killed on duty annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotland Yard Commissioner Paul Watson says that routine arming of officers 
has not dramatically improved safety anywhere in the world. "If everyone has to 
wear a gun there would be no high standards," he said. "We have restricted the 
training and issue of firearms to highly trained and capable police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the slayings of two police officers and wounding of others in the 
London area in the past year prompted a public outcry for equipping constables 
with better protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of civilian respondents in the Gallup survey believed that officers 
should carry or have instant access to firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers, the public and politicians agree that officers should receive 
a wider range of protective equipment, including the longer batons and body 
armor. Some favor pepper-spray guns, which are not authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Broughton, chairman of the Police Federation's constables committee, 
declared: "We need better protection and we need it right now. The public is 
right behind us. They've seen us take unacceptable casualties over the course 
of the past few years and their message is the same as ours: Enough is enough. 
Protect the thin blue line; otherwise society will have no protection." 
</P>
<P>
 And Commissioner Watson, who has not ruled out eventual arming of all his 
officers if he can't get sufficient other defensive measures, added: "I think 
we all value the traditional image of the British bobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have to police the real world. Having had officers murdered, shot and 
stabbed, I am not prepared to ask my officers to carry out their duties without 
better protection." Law Enforcement's Armed Opponents

LATIN AMERICA; RULING LEGALIZING DRUGS LEAVES MANY COLOMBIANS IN A TIZZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN AMBRUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Colombian artists and students fired up joints to celebrate, a decision 
by the country's highest court to legalize consumption of marijuana and cocaine 
has thrown officials into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Government, business and Roman Catholic Church leaders in this drug-producing 
country have attacked the May 5 ruling as dangerous to youth and the family. 
And almost everyone has expressed alarm at the likely international 
repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 While nations such as the Netherlands, Spain and Germany have passed measures 
to decriminalize some drugs, the ruling puts Colombia on the spot. Colombia is 
one of the world's biggest producers of drugs, supplying more than 80% of the 
world's cocaine and exporting an increasing amount of marijuana and heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "With what authority can we ask the international community to try to reduce 
drug consumption when we are beginning to tolerate it ourselves?" asked Atty. 
Gen. Carlos Gustavo Arrieta in an interview with the newspaper El Tiempo. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 5-4 ruling, Colombia's Constitutional Court overturned a 1986 law that 
imposed fines and jail terms for possession or consumption of small amounts of 
drugs -- up to 20 grams of marijuana, five grams of hashish, one gram of 
cocaine and two grams of Mandrax, a barbiturate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling on an appeal by a private citizen, the court held that punishing drug 
use violates the right to privacy, an individual's autonomy and "the free 
development of personality." 
</P>
<P>
 An angry four-member minority called the decision "deplorable." The U.S. State 
Department condemned the ruling, and polls here have been largely negative, 
with one showing 69.9% of Colombians opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision," said Rodrigo Losada, an expert on drug trafficking at 
Javeriana University in Bogota, "though open-minded and liberal, will damage 
Colombia's reputation in the short run and feed its image as a 
narco-democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was a major setback for Colombia's government, which has been 
trying desperately to ease tensions with U.S. authorities already furious at 
the nation's top law enforcement officer, Gustavo de Greiff. A highly popular 
figure here, De Greiff has repeatedly angered American officials with his 
support for the legalization of drugs and his public comments that the drug war 
has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 De Greiff maintains that the war can never be won as long as demand in 
consumer countries is high, profits for smugglers astronomical, and evidence 
against many traffickers weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Those positions and his aggressive pursuit of plea-bargaining agreements with 
Colombia's biggest cocaine dealers, the Cali cartel, so outraged U.S. officials 
that Washington suspended a longstanding U.S. policy of evidence-sharing with 
the Colombian prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug use is widespread here, with recent studies showing that 31.1% of the 
population has tried marijuana and 11.5% basuco , a highly addictive and 
dangerous form of unrefined cocaine. University students and artists openly 
smoke marijuana on major boulevards of the capital. Poor children wander the 
streets smoking basuco to take their minds off hunger and cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Many writers and intellectuals, including Colombian novelist and Nobel 
laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez, argue that legalizing the drug trade could 
eliminate the corruption and violence that have claimed thousands of Colombian 
lives. And human rights activists argue that it could curb police abuses and 
shakedowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fear of an international backlash and the deeply conservative 
attitudes of mainstream Colombians make the legalization issue an emotional and 
divisive one. With the national reputation at stake, President Cesar Gaviria 
said Wednesday that he would launch a petition to gather signatures for a 
national referendum to change the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, he will issue a decree banning drug use in public 
places and offices; and banning drug use by minors, pregnant women, operators 
of cars, planes or boats, and doctors and dentists.

U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL RESIGNS POST; DIPLOMACY: EDWARD DJEREJIAN WILL HEAD 
NEW PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAM AT BAKER INSTITUTE IN HOUSTON. HE DENIES LEAVING WITH 
BITTER FEELINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward P. Djerejian announced Thursday that he will 
leave his post after only eight months to become director of a university 
institute founded by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
 Djerejian, 55, is one of the most experienced envoys in the foreign service, 
and his decision to quit surprised Israeli officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Several American officials in Israel said Djerejian resigned after telling 
associates he was dissatisfied with the way the United States was handling 
peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. They said Djerejian was frustrated 
in recent months by his relatively limited role in Syrian-Israeli peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Djerejian, reached in Houston, roundly denied those reports. "I'm doing 
this for personal and family reasons," he said. "This is not a resignation in 
protest. This is a career decision." 
</P>
<P>
 He will become the first director of the new Baker Institute for public policy 
at Rice University in Houston on Aug. 1. He worked closely with Baker on Middle 
East issues during the George Bush Administration, when Baker was secretary of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and timing is something people 
don't control," he said. "This is exactly the kind of second career I wanted to 
embark on." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he told Secretary of State Warren Christopher some months ago of his 
intention to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel's government was being formally notified of his decision only 
today, a senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher had no immediate public comment. In a written statement released 
in Houston, Baker called Djerejian "quite simply one of the finest diplomats I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Djerejian has told associates that after 33 years in the foreign service -- 
and with college tuition bills looming for several children -- he was eager to 
work in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ambassador's denials, several American officials in Israel said he 
had been visibly frustrated by his relatively limited role in the 
Syrian-Israeli talks. They have been handled largely by Christopher and two 
aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Djerejian "blew up" earlier this week when Christopher excluded him from a key 
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Djerejian did not address the issue of his overall 
role in the negotiations but dismissed the allegation that he was angry at 
being left out of meetings. "That's nonsense," he said. " . . . Ed Djerejian 
doesn't take a walk over something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Israel at the beginning of this year, Djerejian served as 
assistant secretary of state in both the Bush and Clinton administrations and 
as ambassador to Syria in the Ronald Reagan Administration.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Bush Administration, he played a major role in the Madrid conference 
that launched direct Arab-Israeli peace talks as well as the negotiations in 
Washington that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baker Institute, which Baker founded last year, is planned as a 
nonpartisan think tank with experts on both domestic and foreign affairs. Baker 
is considering running for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and 
could draw on the institute for policy advisers -- or, if he were to win the 
presidency, for top officials.

Robin Wright in Washington also contributed to this report.

U.S. WON'T PUNISH KEY CIVILIAN SUPPORTERS OF HAITIAN COUP; CARIBBEAN: WHITE 
HOUSE WILL NOT REVOKE VISAS OR FREEZE ASSETS OF WEALTHY FAMILIES. MOVE IS SEEN 
AS A MIXED SIGNAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has decided against punishing key civilian 
supporters of the military coup against Haitian President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide in what diplomats and Haitian experts say is yet another mixed signal 
about U.S. policy toward Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on the recommendation of U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing, the White 
House will not revoke visas nor seek to freeze assets of the wealthy, powerful 
families who supported the Sept. 30, 1991, ouster of Aristide and have opposed 
his return, U.S. Embassy sources here said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those considered but rejected for American punitive actions include the Mev, 
Brandt, Acra and Madsen families. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. Embassy source said that Washington was advised not to include these 
elite Haitians because "they still have a role to play." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same rationale used to exclude the same families from earlier 
sanctions, although American officials at the time of the coup and in the 
months after labeled them as supporters of the military rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 These elite "are seen as a way to reaching the military," one Haitian expert 
here said. Some U.S. diplomats in the embassy "still believe no settlement is 
possible without their direct participation," an American official said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, at least three Haitian senators who have led the 
anti-Aristide movement -- Thomas Eddy Dupiton, Dejean Belizaire and Bernard 
Sansari -- will not have to relinquish their permanent U.S. residence status, 
which enables them to live and travel freely in the United States, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three senators, particularly Sansari, played key roles in recently 
installing Haiti's civilian puppet government. He declared that Aristide had 
abandoned and betrayed his office and personally decreed that Supreme Court 
President Emile Jonassaint was the new president. The senators will not be 
challenged to give up their permanent residence status because it would require 
a long legal process in American courts with no guarantee of success, embassy 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A diplomat, who called the American decisions "a decidedly mixed signal," said 
they were bound to confuse Haitians. The Haitians face tough, new economic 
sanctions starting Sunday and repeated White House assertions that American 
military intervention remains an option. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are imposing sanctions designed to strangle the country into restoring 
Aristide at the same time they are telling the people who backed the coup and 
are in business with the military in keeping Aristide out that they are free to 
lead their privileged lives," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other diplomatic and business sources here said President Clinton is 
considering another potentially confusing decision: They said Clinton may issue 
an executive order banning all passenger flights and financial transactions 
between Haiti and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled flights have been among the exceptions to the embargo. U.S. Embassy 
officials have said a total flight ban and even an end to humanitarian aid 
remain possible, if not probable. "The banning of all flights would be a strong 
signal" to the military and its civilian henchmen, an anti-coup business leader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But cutting financial transactions between the two nations would ruin many 
ordinary Haitians who depend on payments -- which are called remittances here 
-- from relatives in the United States. "At best," the businessman said, "it 
will inconvenience the wealthy sector, but it will cut off the only supply of 
money many Haitians have." 
</P>
<P>
 The ambiguous American policy follows 2 1/2 years of shifting U.S. approaches 
toward Haiti -- from imposing and relaxing sanctions to asserting that both 
Aristide and army Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the coup's leader, were "extremes" who 
are blocking a resolution of the Haitian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Until just a few weeks ago, Aristide was under heavy American pressure to 
accept a compromise that would have removed Cedras but would have left in power 
another coup leader, Michel-Joseph Francois, the powerful police commander; 
under that approach, no date was set for Aristide to return. 
</P>
<P>
 That policy, however, was rejected vigorously by Aristide, leading Clinton to 
change his approach and seek U.N. support for tougher action in Haiti, 
including stiffer sanctions and the banning of travel for the military and its 
backers. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council voted for the more stringent economic sanctions and 
to require that all nations ban entry to "major participants in the 1991 coup 
and (those) . . . acting on behalf of the Haitian military." The Administration 
also promised to ban all participants in the provisional Jonassaint government, 
which took office under army auspices last week. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials here say that almost 600 names have been put on the banned 
list, with fewer than 40 of them civilians and their families; most were 
members of civilian front governments in the months after the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is puzzling," one Haitian political expert said, "since the Brandts 
particularly have made no effort to hide their efforts or support (of the coup 
and the military). It is just another confusing and conflicting sign from the 
Americans. We still don't know what they really want." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mev family, which initially supported the coup and provided at least 
indirect financial support to the military, has, in the words of a Haitian 
business source, "been playing both sides." He referred to the family's 
involvement in drafting a plan, briefly backed by the United States, that would 
have left Aristide with an indefinite date of return and seriously reduced 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their true attitude toward Aristide, the Brandts and Mevs, in 
particular, have used the time since the coup to expand their businesses to the 
point where they control most imports of products excluded from the embargo: 
food and propane gas used for cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can send in rice, sugar, wheat, corn or grocery products without going 
through those families, or without getting licenses from Haitian officials they 
control," one businessman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Haitian business leader, who opposed the coup and has worked for Aristide's 
return, observed: "Isn't it ironic? The Brandts and the others are allowed to

that killed 30 people at an overcrowded hospital in a government-held part of 
Kigali and rained shells on the airport and U.N. headquarters.Rebels denied 
having targeted the hospital. A Red Cross medical officer was wounded when his 
relief convoy was ambushed on the western edge of Kigali. He was later rescued.

DESIGN CHANGES URGED FOR PLASTIC BUCKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Industrial five-gallon plastic buckets that have been blamed for the drowning 
deaths of 40 toddlers a year could be redesigned as a result of action by the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-member panel voted Thursday to issue regulations governing the 
buckets and to force manufacturers to make them so it would be difficult for 
infants to climb inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims are children between the ages of 8 and 14 months who climb 
into a bucket of water or some other liquid and cannot get out, commission 
Chairwoman Ann Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five manufacturers that represent three-fourths of the industry already plan 
to put warning labels on buckets made after Jan. 1, 1995, spokesman Bill Roper 
said. They also plan to begin an educational and informational program by July 
1 to alert consumers to the drowning hazards, he said.

SENATE BACKS LOOSER RULES ON SAFE WATER; HEALTH: LAWMAKERS AIM TO BALANCE FEAR 
OF IMPURITY AGAINST ECONOMIC INTERESTS. NEITHER ENVIRONMENTALISTS NOR THEIR 
OPPONENTS ON THE ISSUE ARE SATISFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Senate, trying to balance environmental concerns with economic interests, 
overwhelmingly approved legislation Thursday that would loosen some of the 
regulations governing the safety of the nation's drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was largely in response to widespread criticism from water industry 
groups and state and local governments, which have complained that meeting the 
more stringent safety standards had become too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, said the outcome demonstrated that economic growth and environmental 
safeguards were not incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years now, there has been in essence a religious war between the business 
community and the environmental community. . . . It seemed like you were either 
for the environment or for the economy. . . . This bill is a striking break 
from that pattern," Baucus said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baucus' optimistic prediction that peace was at hand was not reflected in 
the reactions of either of the main combatants in the great 
economy-versus-the-environment debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of businesses and local governments, which had sought even 
greater relief from what they argued were unnecessary and costly federal 
regulations, were tepid in their support of the bill, endorsing the outcome but 
expressing concern that some of the regulatory relief could be reversed when 
the debate moves to the House, which has yet to consider the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, for their part, were outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate's action is a plague on the American public. . . . (It) plays 
roulette with the public's health, allowing dangerous levels of contamination 
to strike any system at any time," said Blake Early, director of environmental 
quality for the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the regulations came in a 95-3 vote in which the Senate 
reauthorized the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
 A key provision in the revised bill would establish a $1-billion annual 
revolving loan fund for use by local governments to help pay for removing 
pollutants from the nation's 200,000 public water systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill, the Environmental Protection Agency would be obliged to 
regulate fewer waterborne contaminants and to weigh the costs of removing them 
against the risks they pose to public health before developing new drinking 
water standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, small water suppliers serving communities of fewer than 10,000 
people would be exempt from some testing and technology requirements if they 
could not afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Philip Landrigan, chairman of community medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital in 
New York, said the changes "set a dangerous precedent" that could lead to less 
safe drinking water, "especially for infants and other vulnerable segments of 
the population." 
</P>
<P>
 "Flexibility becomes a code word for doing less," said Landrigan, who is a 
pediatrician and a member of the American Public Health Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they hope to stop the bill in the House, the environmentalists' anger 
reflected a deeper disappointment at losing what they saw as a bellwether vote 
on the Clinton Administration's commitment to defending environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, environmental issues are not a priority for Clinton," said Carolyn 
Hartmann, a lobbyist with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists had high praise for Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who 
pushed through two amendments that restored some of the safeguards in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 One would require the EPA to take into account the potential health risks of 
contaminants in drinking water on "the most vulnerable segments of the 
population," including children, the elderly and pregnant women. Boxer said 
more than 10 million Californians are included in those groups. The other would 
provide some special protections against lead contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamics of green politics have shifted so significantly during the past 
18 months that many environmentalists say they are finding, to their dismay, 
that they have less clout in Congress now than they did when George Bush was in 
the White House and environmental issues provided a popular platform for 
Democrats looking to attack a Republican President. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Clinton and (Vice President Al) Gore in the White House, Democrats are 
not lining up to fight" the Administration as they used to, Hartmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are deeply disappointed," Early said, "because we had expected the Clinton 
Administration to show more leadership" on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as the environmentalists see it, the field has been left open to an 
anti-regulatory backlash pressed by Republicans and moderate-to-conservative 
Democrats for whom pruning government bureaucracy and cutting spending are more 
popular issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The drinking water controversy, for instance, was treated on the Senate floor 
more as a question involving unfunded federal mandates than as an environmental 
or public health issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baucus and other architects of the Senate bill denied that public health 
standards would be compromised and said the revisions were needed to 
rationalize regulations so cumbersome and complex that they often were not 
enforced anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, we overdid it the last time," Baucus said. "We went too far and 
that's why we're here today, trying to make the system work. . . . The American 
people want us to take a practical, common-sense approach to our environmental 
problems, and that's what this bill does."

KEY PANEL BACKS NATIONAL HEALTH BOARD; MEDICINE: THE SENATE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS 
AN AGENCY THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TRIM BENEFITS OR RAISE THE AMOUNT CONSUMERS 
WOULD HAVE TO SPEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Senate committee with a key role in crafting health care legislation voted 
Thursday for a cost containment provision that would establish a national board 
with the authority to trim benefits and raise out-of-pocket spending by 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a bipartisan compromise approved by the Labor and Human Resources 
Committee, the board's actions could be reversed only if Congress acted within 
45 legislative days after receiving the board's "recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-0 committee vote, after nearly two days of partisan wrangling, left 
members elated -- but confused over whether such a national health board could 
also reduce medical providers' fees and insurance premiums if health spending 
had to be reined in. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators vowed to clarify the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the provision will survive the long legislative process still ahead 
and ever become part of a final health care reform measure remains far from 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 But that did little to dampen a can-do spirit that flowed from both sides of 
the aisle as members and their staffs congratulated one another for having 
produced the first bipartisan agreement on a difficult health care reform 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The action also raised hopes of breakthroughs on other, equally perplexing 
matters as the committee races toward the Clinton Administration's Memorial Day 
target for reporting out a comprehensive health care reform bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), the panel's ranking GOP member, called 
the vote "a victory for moderation . . . and fiscal responsibility." Chairman 
Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) called it "a small step for health care but a giant 
leap for bipartisanship." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.) who may prove the most prophetic, 
saying: "Without the ambiguity, there wouldn't have been unanimity." 
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan good feelings will be put to the test today when the Republican 
National Committee launches a $500,000 national television campaign attacking 
President Clinton for having proposed "a government-run system." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's surprise agreement on a cost control mechanism was significant and 
telling in several aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was important because finding a consensus on how to control costs has 
been one of the toughest challenges facing Congress as it goes about 
overhauling America's $1-trillion-a-year health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote also revealed the sort of individual compromises that members must 
make as they tackle the complex issues. 
</P>
<P>
 By voting to control costs as they did, conservative Republicans were at the 
same time endorsing a dramatic expansion of the powers of a new regulatory 
agency -- a prospect that clearly unsettled some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a deep and widespread fear that medical spending could rage out of 
control as the nation extends coverage to the estimated 38 million uninsured 
Americans -- while guaranteeing all a comprehensive set of benefits that could 
include, for the first time, coverage for prescription drugs, mental-health and 
substance-abuse treatment and the beginnings of home- and community-based 
long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor and Human Resources Committee is working on a bill drafted by 
Kennedy that is closely patterned after President Clinton's reform plan. But 
Kennedy proposes even broader benefits than Clinton, prompting Sen. Dan Coats 
(R-Ind.) to call Kennedy's benefits package "an extraordinary expansion" that 
he and Kassebaum said must be scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in that ensuing debate that a compromise to expand the cost containment 
authority of a national board was worked out between Kassebaum and Sen. Jeff 
Bingaman (D-N.M.). 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would require the board to conduct annual fiscal analyses of the 
nation's health care system.

MRS. ONASSIS: TO DEFINE HER IS TO APPRECIATE HER SENSE OF STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Start at the beginning. Jacqueline Bouvier's wedding day in September, 1953. 
The white lace veil, a long mantilla, belonged to her grandmother. The single 
strand of luminous pearls was perfect for a 24-year-old debutante of the year. 
But the dress was a zinger: yards of ivory silk faille made subtly daring by an 
off-the-shoulder neckline. 
</P>
<P>
 This was her first day as Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy and everything about her 
said that she could lead a nation with her sense of style. 
</P>
<P>
 The next image of her in a veil came on a dreadful day in November, 1963. This 
time it was black, banded in satin. It covered her shoulders, touched her 
narrow black suit, gave her the privacy a widow deserves. Yet the nation's 
women marveled at the drama of it -- and the glamour. Years later, in quick 
succession, Coretta Scott King and Ethel Kennedy wore similar versions to bury 
their husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 In exquisite as well as excruciating times, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis never 
let her country down. Clothes do not make the woman -- certainly not in this 
case. But an innate sense of style can have the unexpected power to make an 
event unforgettable. Mrs. Onassis did that countless times, without ever 
seeming to try. 
</P>
<P>
 The snapshot images of the former First Lady through the years click along to 
create a history of chic. There was a white column dress and opera-length 
gloves for the inaugural ball in 1960. Her pillbox hat was a trademark, from 
her first days in the White House until, literally, her last. Her bouffant 
pageboy was made immortal by Andy Warhol in "Red Jackie," a larger-than-life 
silkscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her hair started a trend in the '60s," recalled Eleanor Lambert, a New York 
publicist who issues a "best dressed" list each year. Mrs. Onassis made the 
list in '60, '61 and '62. In those years Oleg Cassini was declared the official 
White House fashion designer. His earlier claim to fame was designing movie 
costumes for Grace Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection was clear and accurate -- the two women the world considered 
"American royalty" wrapped in the same fashion label. His suits, with their 
short, boxy jackets and narrow skirts, were the First Lady's signature look in 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Mrs. Kennedy, her greatest influence was in daywear and sportswear," said 
Richard Martin, costume curator of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
"After Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower as first ladies, 
Jackie brought a young, elegant style to the White House. You never had the 
sense she was uncomfortable in her clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 After her White House years, the remarried Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis went a 
little wild, letting loose her Francophile passions. She had studied the 
language as a school girl and the early attraction was revived in a stream of 
Hubert de Givenchy gowns and Chanel suits. Does Italy's Valentino count as 
French, for his Paris address? She seemed to think so. 
</P>
<P>
 The American twist to her wardrobe was her loyalty to Halston, who created the 
pillbox hats she wore as First Lady. She could walk to his shop from her 5th 
Avenue apartment in New York. His design assistant, Akira, once commented on 
how she never wore prints, only solids. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, Mrs. Onassis was a jet-setting mother with two kids in boarding 
school and a house in Martha's Vineyard, Mass. She trekked to the Acropolis in 
a Pucci summer shift, trotted horses in her jodhpurs and boots, cruised Greek 
islands on husband Aristotle Onassis' yacht in Lili Pulitzer dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 She could still create a stir. One evening she dressed in palazzo pants and a 
long tunic for dinner at Le Pavillon, a top New York restaurant. It turned out 
the dress code barred women from wearing pants. "She simply excused herself, 
went into the ladies room and took the pants off," Lambert recalls. "She came 
back wearing just the long tunic. She could handle that sort of thing without 
making a scene." 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, tortoise-shell sunglasses -- vast orbs of darkness -- spoke of 
a wish for privacy, yet called attention to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis' wardrobe settled down in the '80s. She had turned 50, gone to 
work as an editor and had seen her children, John and Caroline, graduate from 
college. Then Caroline married. Jackie's look softened and solidified: long, 
bouffant pageboy by Kenneth, suits and cocktail dresses by Carolina Herrera of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask what Mrs. Onassis taught women about style and hear Diana Vreeland's voice 
bellowing in the background: "elegance is refusal." Mrs. Onassis edited 
Vreeland's book on the subject, "Allure." Obviously, she could have written it.

ISRAEL, PLO STEP UP TALKS ON FINAL PLANS; MIDEAST: BOTH SIDES HOPE TO 
ACCELERATE NEGOTIATIONS ON COMPLETE WEST BANK AUTONOMY AND OTHER ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho now under Palestinian 
rule, Israel and the PLO are planning to accelerate negotiations both on 
autonomy for the whole West Bank and on final relations between Israel and the 
Palestinians, sources close to the negotiations said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat agreed in talks that ended early Thursday in Oslo on 
immediate discussions on assumption by the new Palestinian Authority of 
responsibility for health, education, welfare and tourism and the local taxes 
needed to support these services throughout the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a discussion about the future agenda . . . and an agenda was agreed 
upon," Peres said as he left Oslo for Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the PLO must also agree on the structure and powers of the 
Palestinian Council that will become the government for the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank and set the date and rules for what will be the Palestinians' first 
national election. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is tentatively planned for mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 The most contentious element in this set of accelerated negotiations will 
undoubtedly be talks on what is termed the "permanent settlement" -- a topic 
that includes Palestinian independence, borders, Jewish settlers on the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian refugees and the future of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we could put off those talks (on a permanent settlement) for two 
years, the present sentiment is to press ahead now and maintain the momentum," 
a senior Israeli politician said Thursday. "We may not advertise this, but both 
sides are resolved to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 One factor, other Israeli sources said, is Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 
determination to achieve a comprehensive settlement with Israel's Arab 
neighbors -- Syria, Jordan and Lebanon as well as the Palestinians -- before 
the country's next parliamentary elections, due in June, 1996, but already 
looming on the political horizon here. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat also has important political considerations, starting with the need to 
demonstrate that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will lead, and quickly, to a full 
resolution of the Palestinian problem and is not, as his critics have charged, 
a partial deal that prolongs the problem, perhaps indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, the original declaration of principles signed by Israel and 
the PLO in September and the agreement on Israel's military withdrawal from 
Gaza and Jericho signed this month called for establishment of a popularly 
elected Palestinian Council and for partial Palestinian assumption of 
government responsibility on the West Bank even before then. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to feel the changes in their lives, and on the West Bank, not 
only in Gaza and Jericho," a Palestinian negotiator said. "To the extent we can 
bring forward our assumption of power and then broaden it, we can have that 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 In implementing the interim agreement, the Palestinians also anticipate 
difficulties -- such as the Jewish settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
-- that can be dealt with only in the framework of negotiations on the final 
stage. (The accord is scheduled to run for five years.) 
</P>
<P>
 The original approach of a step-by-step progression according to an agreed 
timetable gave way to what one Palestinian negotiator called "permanent 
engagement." 
</P>
<P>
 "The theory was breakthrough, implement and then consolidate before moving 
on," he said. "In practice, we found the negotiations were far more complex 
than we expected and that, as a result, we were continually engaged. We had 
serious, prolonged breakdowns in the negotiations, to be sure, and that 
convinced most of us that it is better to keep moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres and Arafat also agreed in Oslo to assess the economic situation in the 
Gaza Strip and to approach the donors, notably the United States, Japan, Saudi 
Arabia, the European Union and the World Bank, that had promised millions of 
dollars to underwrite Palestinian self-rule over the next five years, but which 
have provided little of what they pledged last September. FOREIGN RELATIONS

 Princess Diana is being hailed as a hero for aiding a drowning man. 
</P>
<P>
 The princess was on her way home from a jog in London's Regents Park on Sunday 
when tourists flagged her car and said someone had fallen into a nearby lake. 
Diana reportedly told her chauffeur to call police, then dashed to the bank of 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 She was joined by Kari Kotila, 29, a Finnish student living in London, who 
swam to the 42-year-old Irish vagrant, by then unconscious, and towed him to 
the bank.

GERMAN MAN DESCRIBES 3 ATTACKERS; SKETCH IS RELEASED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A German man who is unable to speak after a robbery attack that left his wife 
dead told authorities in writing that three teen-agers attacked him, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaus Pfleger, 64, of Emmerich, Germany, was able to describe one of the 
attackers well enough for authorities to release a composite sketch.Sketches of 
the other two are likely to be released within days, Riverside County sheriff's 
spokesman Mark Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman described the three assailants as male, 17 to 20 years old, and ranging 
in height from 5 feet, 8 inches to 5 feet, 10 inches. All had dark eyes and 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on interviews with witnesses who saw the attackers drive along scenic 
California 243, authorities said they were driving a late-model two-door coupe, 
possibly forest green. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfleger and his wife, Gisela, 62, were shot as they gazed out over the San 
Jacinto Mountains near Idyllwild on Monday. Gisela Pfleger was shot in the head 
several times and killed. Her husband was shot once in the shoulder and twice 
in the head.

 An 85-year-old woman who was badly hurt in a car wreck was robbed by two men 
who reached through a smashed window, stole her purse and coat and ran off, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Dorothy Albrightson lost control of her car Wednesday. 
The car flipped over, leaving the Sunnyvale woman trapped, bleeding and

 Albrightson suffered a fractured neck and was taken to Stanford University 
Hospital, where she was listed in fair condition.

SPACE STATION CHAMPION SAYS OUTLOOK 'GRIM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to save the space station from the scientific scrap heap, a 
spending bill was unveiled Thursday urging Congress to shave funds from other 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration programs and keep plans for the 
orbiting laboratory alive -- at least for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, authored by Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), would cut one space 
shuttle flight and delay several other programs to keep on track a space 
station that NASA has already spent $11 billion and a decade designing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is grim," Brown said as he presented to reporters the 
$14.1-billion NASA spending bill he intends to introduce in the House next 
week. "With fewer resources than this, I will oppose the space station program 
in its current form -- either by reducing funding for the station or by killing 
it outright." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of support by Brown -- chairman of the House Committee on Science, 
Space and Technology and long the champion of human exploration of space -- 
would almost certainly sound the death knell for the space station and for 
thousands of California jobs associated with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of its prime contractors -- McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach and the 
Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International in Canoga Park -- together hold 
space station contracts worth approximately $6 billion. The project supports 
1,500 jobs in Orange County alone. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA's budget has lost about $500 million a year for the past several years at 
the hands of a Congress increasingly unenthusiastic about American space study. 
The space station, long considered one of NASA's most illustrious efforts, 
squeaked through the House by a single vote last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget drain has infuriated Brown, who said this month he would recommend 
killing the station outright if Congress was not willing to adequately support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton requested $14.3 billion for NASA in 1995 -- $2.1 billion of 
that for the space station -- but members of a powerful appropriations 
subcommittee have made it clear they would not meet that entire request. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown countered with the spending bill that cuts $290 million from the 
President's request, his attempt to set a bare-bones agenda for NASA spending 
that leaves with the space station intact. The influential chairman delivered 
the bill with a vow that he will not agree to much less. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those of you who have been asking where I draw the line on the space 
station -- this is the line," said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to Brown's spending plan was already shaping up Thursday with Rep. 
Dick Zimmer (R-N.J.), one of the station's leading opponents, saying he would 
try to delete the lab from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This legislation provides more evidence that the space station has been 
cannibalizing the rest of NASA's programs. Once again, space science is being 
sacrificed to the space station," Zimmer said, referring to Brown's proposed 
scale-back of the Spacelab program and the elimination of the Mars Surveyor 
program, the only new space science effort NASA plans to start for the 
remainder of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 But the station still has some powerful allies. The Clinton Administration has 
refused to cut it and Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly emphasized its 
foreign policy advantages since the Russians joined the venture last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that Al Gore believes in his heart, as I do, that America would 
benefit greatly from a space station," Brown said. "But I do not know if the 
Administration's commitment -- however fervent -- will be enough to stop the 
Congress from treating NASA as a cash cow for other programs. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he continues to support it, Brown put the space station's chance of 
survival at 50-50. Worse, there is every indication that Congress will continue 
the same dance every year, with the space station's fate hanging in the 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed by the House, the bill would not reach the Senate until late this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the funding survive this year, Brown said, he is optimistic that 
support might increase for the floating lab in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will consider we reached the bottom of the pit this year," he said.

O.C. GIRL CHALLENGES POLICE PHOTO POLICY; LAWSUIT: ATTORNEYS CONTEND YOUTHS' 
ATTIRE, RACE MADE THEM TARGETS OF MUG SHOTS FOR GANG FILE. 
</P>

<P>
 Ordinarily this is the frantic time of year when Tustin High School honor 
student Quyen Pham is hunched over exams. But Thursday morning she stood 
outside a towering courthouse with a timid smile full of braces and cheeks 
stained by tears. 
</P>
<P>
 She was little taller than the television microphones before her, dressed in 
baggy, black hip-hop pants, with a crushed blue velvet ponytail band, and a 
vogue "MTV" fashion look that her lawyers argue has thrust her into a pitched 
legal battle over constitutional rights, challenging an Orange County police 
department's gang-busting strategy of photographing suspicious-looking youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to look up to police officers," said Pham, 16, whose photo, along with 
those of two of her girlfriends, is stored somewhere in a Garden Grove police 
file. "I thought they were here to protect us. But just because of the way we 
look and are dressed they're accusing us of being gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a good student," she said. "I care about the environment. Just because I 
dress baggy does not mean I am a bad person." 
</P>
<P>
 So Thursday, Pham's retinue of lawyers -- backed by the American Civil 
Liberties Union, the Alliance for Children's Rights and law firms from Los 
Angeles and Philadelphia -- took on the city of Garden Grove and its Police 
Department by filing a class-action federal lawsuit to halt the practice of 
snapping Polaroids of suspected gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also seeking the return of the girls' photographs, along with the 
destruction of all photos and information police collected during the disputed 
detentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Garden Grove police have gone too far," said Robin Toma, an ACLU staff 
attorney. "By treating Southeast Asian youngsters as gangbangers just because 
they're Asian and dress baggy, they rely on very dangerous racial stereotyping. 
. . . It teaches a civics lesson with the wrong message: Police can treat you 
as criminals and get away with it as long as they do it under the guise of 
fighting gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Orange County police departments have been photographing people they 
regard with suspicion since the 1970s, but the practice has become even more 
widespread as the estimated gang population has mushroomed to more than 16,800. 
</P>
<P>
 In Garden Grove's case, police officers are required to have some "reasonable 
suspicion" of criminal activity before taking photographs. Some photos have 
been used later to solve crimes, according to top police officials, who have 
declined to discuss Pham's complaint because of the pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove City Councilman Ho Chung, the only member of Asian descent on the 
council, said police officials have assured the city that they are not 
targeting Asians for photo stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "What police told me is that sometimes, parents do not know their children are 
involved in gang activity. Sometimes it's really hard to distinguish who's in a 
gang. There may be some cases where mistakes are made, and that is absolutely 
wrong. But in most cases that's just not true," Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quyen Pham's brush with Garden Grove police dates back to a July evening when 
she and her friend, Annie Lee, and fellow plaintiff, Minh Tram Tran, went to 
Garden Grove to take part in karaoke singing at the Cafe Chu Lun, a mini-mall 
restaurant that serves nothing stronger than fruit shakes and iced coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were quickly disappointed with the older crowd there. The girls said 
they left the cafe about 7 p.m., heading for a public telephone to call a 
friend while they waited for a ride home. In soft voices, they related what 
happened next as if reciting a history lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the police drove up in an unmarked car," recalled Tran. "They sat us 
down on the curb." 
</P>
<P>
 "And then they asked what were we doing there, what trouble did we want to 
cause," added Pham. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I asked them, 'Why are you detaining us?' " said Tran. "I mean, I was 
upset and I was like scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly, the girls said they denied they were gang members, but the answers 
were always treated with skepticism. "They said, 'Yeah, well, if you walk like 
a duck and talk like a duck, then you must be duck.' And we're like: We're not 
ducks," said Tran. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the encounter was through, the girls said they were ordered to stand 
against a wall where they were each photographed with a Polaroid camera. The 
police, they said, also took down information about their age, height, weight, 
eye color, hair color, home addresses and the schools they attended. None of 
the girls was ever charged with a crime or cited in connection with the stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Tran was stopped a second time -- at a Taco Bell in Garden Grove 
in January, when she said she was again accused of being a gang member. No 
charges were filed in connection with that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tran said she cannot forget the words of an officer who she said scoffed 
at her complaints that he had no right to rummage through her purse and page 
through her personal telephone book. "He goes: 'You have a problem with this?' 
And I said, 'Yeah, I do.' And he goes: 'If you have a problem with this, then 
don't come to my city.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said she replied: "This isn't your city. This is America."

NOT-GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN DRUG CASE LINKING RAMS PLAYER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former fugitive pleaded not guilty in federal court Thursday in the cocaine 
possession and conspiracy case involving Los Angeles Rams cornerback Darryl 
Henley and three others. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Haghey McGowan, 30, of Duarte was captured last month in San 
Diego.McGowan was indicted in December along with Henley, former Rams 
cheerleader Tracy Donaho and two others as part of an alleged conspiracy to 
transfer cocaine shipments from Henley's Brea home to drop-off points in 
Atlanta and Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the indictment, prosecutors allege that McGowan worked with Henley to 
distribute the cocaine, contending that he met with Donaho last July at 
Henley's home and asked her to carry a suitcase of cocaine on a flight to 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaho has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to smuggle cocaine and is expected to 
cooperate with prosecutors at trial later this summer.

CITY SUSPENDS CHARITY SOLICITOR'S PERMIT TO OPERATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials suspended the operations of a charity telemarketing 
firm Thursday for allegedly receiving funds on behalf of an organization it 
does not represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Burns, general manager of the Los Angeles Social Service Department, 
notified Valley Fundraisers -- a commercial business that seeks donations for 
charities -- that he had withdrawn the firm's permit to solicit in the city and 
was taking steps that could lead to permanent revocation of its fund-raising 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a Times investigation disclosing that Valley Fundraisers deposited 
thousands of dollars in checks to organizations it did not represent, Burns has 
ordered its president, Thomas Galambos, to produce all the firm's records. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said he planned to audit the records to determine if there is evidence 
to recommend that the Los Angeles Social Service Commission permanently revoke 
the firm's license to solicit in Los Angeles, or to press criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In is a misdemeanor in Los Angeles to commit fraud or deception in charitable 
solicitation or to solicit on behalf of another person or organization without 
authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos could not be reached for comment Thursday. The telephone in his 
Burbank headquarters had been disconnected. Galambos' attorney, Elliott Kajan, 
did not return a call from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times disclosed earlier this month that Valley Fundraisers, which has 
taken in more than $2.6 million in charitable donations in the last four years, 
has deposited dozens of checks made out to charities that do not exist and real 
charities that never received the money.  
</P>
<P>
 "In view of the extraordinary articles appearing in the Los Angeles Times, I 
suggest that you secure all books, records and papers relating to your 
solicitations," Burns wrote to Galambos in a May 11 letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter said those measures were necessary "to ensure that neither fire nor 
mysterious disappearance creates a credibility problem that would cause a 
reasonable person to conclude that Valley Fundraisers Inc., and its successors 
are not fit and suitable to perform the tasks associated with being a 
professional fund-raiser for charitable purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Galambos did not comply with the demand. In a second letter 
Thursday, Burns suspended the permit for Galambos' current fund-raising 
campaign, which was due to expire in August. If Galambos not respond to a 
demand for records by today, his permanent license to conduct professional fund 
raising in the city will be revoked, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Valley Fundraisers' office on Alameda Avenue in Burbank was locked 
and no one answered the door when he personally dropped off the May 11 letter. 
Burns' office said he hand delivered copies of Thursday's letter to Galambos' 
residence and to his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension of Valley Fundraisers' solicitation permit, which is subject to 
appeal by Galambos, bars the firm from calling residents of Los Angeles to ask 
for donations. It does not affect the firm's solicitations in other cities 
across the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 One of 121 commercial fund-raising firms in California, Valley Fundraisers is 
licensed by the attorney general's Registry of Charitable Trusts to solicit 
donations for three IRS-registered charities. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said he received a complaint from a Los Angeles man who wrote a check to 
"Foundation for Junior Blind" in response to a telephone solicitation, then 
became suspicious when he learned it was deposited by Valley Fundraisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foundation for the Junior Blind in Los Angeles told him it received no 
money from Valley Fundraisers and did not authorize the solicitation, Burns 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Galambos, in an earlier interview, acknowledged that mistakes had been made, 
but said he corrected every one that came to his attention by refunding the 
donor's money. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said that the refund of improperly received money is not an excuse for 
misrepresentation in the solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after The Times' articles, state charity regulators also announced 
investigations of Valley Fundraisers. Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi, who is 
heading the state's investigation, declined to comment Thursday on its 
progress.

GROCER WON'T BE CHARGED IN SHOOTING; INVESTIGATION: DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAYS THE 
EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO PROSECUTE THE LYNWOOD SHOP OWNER. HE WOUNDED A 
14-YEAR-OLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 No criminal charges will be filed against a Lynwood grocer who shot and 
critically wounded a teen-ager in an incident some activists called racially 
motivated, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 There is insufficient evidence to charge grocer Su Yong (Michael) Kim, who 
chased and shot 14-year-old Aldo Vega on April 2 after Vega and another youth 
ran from Kim's store, allegedly without paying for cookies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said his office declined to file charges because "no 
prosecutable crime occurred." No jury would convict Kim on the available 
evidence, Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Kim is Korean American and Vega is Latino, some community activists 
said the shooting was racially motivated. They compared the incident to the 
1991 fatal shooting of Latasha Harlins, 15, who was killed by a Korean American 
merchant in South-Central Los Angeles in a dispute over a $1.79 bottle of 
orange juice. Vega has recovered but walks with a cane. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision not to prosecute, Garcetti said, was made without regard to 
community activists who had demanded that Kim be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done what we thought was fair and proper given the law," Garcetti said. 
He called the Sheriff's Department investigation "very thorough, very fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood Mayor Paul Richards said Thursday that escalating violence in urban 
neighborhoods -- not the ethnic backgrounds of the grocer and the teen-ager -- 
was the real issue in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greater issue is violence," he said. "Why are we so quick to use 
violence? Assuming the (district attorney's) facts are correct, there is still 
something wrong when persons -- regardless of race -- feel comfortable using a 
gun as a response in this type of incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Angela Oh, an activist in the Korean American community, said 
Thursday that high racial tensions in the Los Angeles area make it 
"understandable that people want to attach a racial meaning" to the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I really do not believe that's what we have here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said in a report issued Thursday that "the most reasonable 
interpretation of the available evidence" indicates that Kim, armed with a 
handgun, drove his car to follow Vega and Miguel Torres, 18, who had taken 
cookies and potato chips from Kim's store without paying. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim confronted Vega and Torres on a nearby street, and said Torres pulled what 
he thought was a knife and threatened him, prosecutors said. About the same 
time, Kim told authorities, Vega raised his shirt as though he was pulling 
something from his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Kim originally claimed he fired in self-defense, believing 
Vega was reaching for a weapon. Kim changed his story to say the gun 
accidentally discharged as he steadied it with both hands, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega was hit by a single shot to the chest, and Kim drove him back to the 
store and called paramedics and sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kim told investigators that he initially did not realize he had shot Vega, 
Garcetti said, and that account is bolstered by the fact that Kim called police 
to make an arrest at the store. A short time later, he called back and asked 
for paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified, independent witness saw Torres and Vega eating cookies after 
they left the store and also saw Torres eating cookies at the site of the 
shooting, after Kim had left with Vega, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Garcetti said, his office is unlikely to file shoplifting 
charges against either youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega later said he made no threatening gestures toward Kim, but an 
unidentified "independent eyewitness" said Vega's pockets were pulled out and 
his shirt flipped up just before the shooting, prosecutors said. They added 
that Vega admitted to his relatives after the shooting that he had reached into 
his pocket to show Kim that he had no money. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim had the legal right to arm himself and make a citizen's arrest if he 
believed a crime had been committed, Garcetti said. He also had a right, 
according to Garcetti, to point the gun at Vega and Torres.

CLINTON ACCUSER SHUNS SPOTLIGHT; COURTS: LONG BEACH NEIGHBORHOOD IS ABUZZ OVER 
SIGHTINGS OF PAULA JONES, A FORMER ARKANSAS STATE GOVERNMENT WORKER WHO HAS 
TAKEN THE PRESIDENT TO COURT, ALLEGING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Paula Jones, a beachside apartment in Long Beach has become a self-imposed 
fortress, a place whose locked gates keep prying eyes away from the woman who 
has sued the President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice with a syrupy Southern drawl came over the intercom of the apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to say," said the voice from the box. "I can't say anything. 
You'll have to talk to my lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman behind the voice, despite her efforts at keeping a low profile, has 
not escaped the attention of neighbors and others titillated to have in their 
midst the central figure in the country's latest political morality play. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a Paula sighting at the Vons supermarket in nearby Belmont Shore 
earlier this week, where a checker saw her and made a positive I.D. when she 
heard her Southern accent. A manager brought over a copy of People magazine 
(Jones is on the cover) to double-check. 
</P>
<P>
 Barney Berlyn, a resident of Jones' apartment complex -- a modern, multistory 
building with a magnificent view of the Queen Mary -- said photographers with 
long lenses have now become a part of the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see all sorts of strange people looking around," added Ed Von Borstel, a 
chiropractor who lives in the apartment building just across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors ask if it is really That Paula Jones -- transplanted from Arkansas 
and living in Long Beach with her husband, son and pet pit bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' husband, Steve, an aspiring actor and ticket agent for Northwest 
Airlines, paused briefly Thursday, after a long morning of helping check in 
hundreds of passengers bound for South Korea and Guam, and offered the 
following assessment of his home life these days: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like living in a fish bowl. We even had a reporter on the roof. It's a 
real pain. This has been very painful for Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want is for Paula to have her day in court," he continued. "It's not 
about money. If you think it's about money, take a look at my bank account. 
It's black and white. It's a sexual harassment case. That's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. Suing the President brings with it a certain amount of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent poll said that 90% of the American public knows Jones has charged 
Clinton with making sexual advances. Unfortunately for her, though, another 
poll shows only 15% of the population believes her. 
</P>
<P>
 For the small percentage of the populace that is out of the loop, here is a 
quick summary: Jones says that Clinton, while governor of Arkansas in May, 
1991, invited her into a hotel room and asked her to perform oral sex. The 
White House says the encounter never happened and suggests that Jones, who was 
a state employee at the time of the alleged incident, is out for money. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Paula Jones was Paula Corbin, an obscure $10,527-a-year employee 
of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission. In all probability, she 
would have remained an unknown had not she filed a $700,000 civil rights 
lawsuit against Clinton on May 6, alleging sexual harassment. In short order, 
People magazine came knocking at her door, as did the tabloids. But her lawyers 
have counseled that now is not the time to talk. That will come later, in 
court, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are being upset and their privacy is being invaded," said one of 
her lawyers, Joseph L. Cammarata of Fairfax, Va. "It's just not our practice to 
have a litigant talking to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones may not be talking now, but that has not always been the case for this 
27-year-old former secretary and mother of a 21-month-old son named Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 11, for instance, she stood beside her lawyer at a Washington news 
conference and charged that Clinton had asked for "a type of sex." At the time, 
she said she was only asking for an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, too, the April 29 appearance on televangelist Pat Robertson's 700 
Club, when she left nothing to the imagination in her version of what Clinton 
allegedly did in the hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 If a job history is any indicator, the world of Paula Jones was not terribly 
exciting before she filed her suit. When she quit her Arkansas state position 
Feb. 22, 1993, just short of two years from the time she was hired, it was the 
longest stint by far on her resume. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the personnel information provided by the Industrial Development 
Commission, she worked as a secretary for a number of businesses, none of them 
for more than a year. She also attended secretarial school for six months after 
graduating from high school in 1984 in the tiny Arkansas town of Carlisle. 
</P>
<P>
 She quit her job, presumably because her husband was transferred to Los 
Angeles by Northwest Airlines last year. Cammarata, her lawyer, said Jones was 
not employed in California, but was instead caring for her son at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Jones moved into the spotlight early this year. Though she said nothing 
during Clinton's 1992 campaign, she claimed she recognized herself in an 
article published in January in the conservative American Spectator. The 
article quoted a state trooper as saying a woman named Paula spent about an 
hour with Clinton at Little Rock's Excelsior Hotel and then volunteered to be 
the then-governor's girlfriend. Jones, who was engaged to be married at the 
time of the alleged incident, said the trooper's statement was not true and 
that she needed to set the record straight to protect her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent her formative years in the tiny town of Lonoke, Ark., about 35 miles 
east of Little Rock. Lonoke Mayor Jack Wheat remembers Jones' parents as "hard 
working, religious, salt of the earth" people who were also very strict with 
their children and strict in their Nazarene beliefs, which included a ban on 
television in the house. And he said he remembered the three Corbin sisters 
coming to town wearing smocks and bonnets when they were young girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their dad died some years back," Wheat said. "Then the house caught on fire. 
It wasn't economically feasible to restore it, so they sold the property." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheat said he lost track of the Corbins until the lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 That suit has divided the Corbin family, with one side saying they believe 
her, the other saying they do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why Paula has let other people influence her like she 
has," said Mark Brown, her brother-in-law. "This is going to tear her mother 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really sad," he said. "I'm sorry my sister-in-law made those 
accusations. I know my sister-in-law really well and this is the wrong way to 
make money, very wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' sister, Charlotte Brown, said much the same thing.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked and told it until I can't sleep at night," said Charlotte Brown. 
"It's very stressful." 
</P>
<P>
 A telephone call to other family members who support Jones elicited a polite 
but firm "no comment." 
</P>
<P>
 Among old colleagues in state government, some did not remember Jones and 
others declined to discuss her. 
</P>
<P>
 One who does recall her is Mike Gauldin, who was Clinton's press secretary in 
Little Rock and is now a spokesman for the Department of Energy in Washington. 
He said she once worked as a courier, and would hang around the governor's 
outer office talking with the secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paula spent quite a bit of time by the reception desk gossiping," Gauldin 
said. "I thought she worked for a private (delivery) service. They talked about 
inane things, beauty shop kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, as elsewhere, Jones is suddenly under the microscope. One 
neighbor claims to have heard "angry voices" coming from her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Another voiced skepticism about her motive. "If she actually gives all the 
money to charity, then I believe her," said the neighbor. "If it turns out she 
just wants the money, then who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 One who puts in a good word is Mike Ojeda, a Coldwell Banker real estate agent 
who showed the Joneses the beachfront apartment that they eventually moved into 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a very nice couple," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just out looking for someplace to live," Ojeda said. "They'd been 
living in the Valley and they moved down here to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just came in one day when there was an open house and they asked if we 
had any leases. They liked it and they've been good tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that when he saw Jones on television, she looked familiar and at first 
he thought it was a woman he saw periodically working at a pizza shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it finally hit me," he said. "I leased out a place to that woman."

ANGRY OFFICERS APPARENTLY VOTING DOWN CONTRACT; JOB ACTION URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Denouncing the city's contract offer as a bum deal, angry Los Angeles police 
officers on Thursday appeared to vote down the pact amid calls for stronger job 
actions to pressure city leaders, including a mass sickout during the upcoming 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the final tally will not be released until today, sentiment against 
the proposed contract was so strong during three ratification sessions that the 
Police Protective League leaders who negotiated the deal began distancing 
themselves from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Ruff, a member of the union's board of directors, told officers gathered 
at one voting location that they should be prepared to "go all the way" if they 
vote the contract down. He suggested a mass sickout during the upcoming World 
Cup soccer tournament that would force Gov. Pete Wilson to call in the National 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion prompted wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
 The voting sessions were raucous affairs, full of harsh words for Mayor 
Richard Riordan and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, both of whom were active in the 
negotiations. Members also grilled their elected officers about how hard they 
fought for the membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, they are venting their anger, that's for sure," union President Danny 
Staggs said as he emerged from voting at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Union spokesman Geoffrey Garfield said it appeared the contract was being 
soundly defeated. "It's gone," he said. "Sinking fast -- like somebody put a 
rock in a bowl of pudding." 
</P>
<P>
 A rejection of the city's offer would send the parties back to the negotiating 
table in a labor dispute that has dragged on for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The union leadership fears that the city may declare an impasse and 
unilaterally impose a contract. But officers argued that they still had some 
leverage with the approach of the World Cup, which is expected to draw 
thousands of visitors to the area and require intense security. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that cooler heads will prevail, but if they don't, they don't," 
Yaroslavsky said. "I don't know what the rank-and-file expects." 
</P>
<P>
 The union staged a "blue flu" last fall, but it was called short by a judge 
who ruled that it was illegal. Instead, the union resorted to a controversial 
billboard campaign that depicted a carjacking in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said they are falling further and further behind their colleagues in 
neighboring cities. A study prepared by the city shows the salaries of rookie 
LAPD officers behind their counterparts' in San Diego, Anaheim, Long Beach, 
Glendale and Santa Ana. LAPD officers also lag behind sheriff's deputies in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years without a contract and now they're offering us crumbs," Newton 
Division Sgt. Frank Mena said after voting against the deal.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to support our families," added Pacific Division Officer Pete Llanes, 
who was carrying his 4-year-old son. "That's what this contract is all about. I 
consider their offer an insult." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the ballots were counted, the union leadership was planning to 
huddle this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract calls for a 3% cost-of-living increase for each of the next two 
years but no retroactive pay for the past two years. It also includes 
controversial changes in benefits and work rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the voting began Thursday morning, Officer Leslie Higgins sneaked his 
motorcycle into headquarters, rolled it into the retirement office and retired 
on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 What Higgins meant as a prank on his last day on the job became a rallying cry 
for the frustrated ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 A superior had insisted that Higgins turn in all his equipment in the Parker 
Center retirement office, so Higgins took him at his word. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he headed out the door, the 20-year veteran completed one last 
assignment -- he cast a no vote on the contract proposal.

2 DEADLY CRASHES PROMPT PARENTS' SAFETY CAMPAIGNS; ACCIDENTS: FATAL HIT-AND-RUN 
INCIDENTS IN WESTLAKE DISTRICT AND PACOIMA DEVASTATE TWO FAMILIES. BUT THE 
COMMUNITIES DRAW TOGETHER TO PRESS FOR CROSSING GUARDS AND TRAFFIC SIGNALS.

<P>
 An epidemic of deadly hit-and-run accidents in Los Angeles ripped apart two 
more families Thursday -- and at the same time drew hundreds of other families 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Westlake district west of Downtown, 7-year-old Kimberly Lopez died and 
her 11-year-old brother, Alan, was seriously injured after they were struck by 
a car while standing on a sidewalk. The accident was witnessed by dozens of 
children playing in a nearby schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a beautiful child, both inside and out," said Rita Caldera, the 
principal of Kimberly's school, who had the difficult task of informing the 
children's parents, Matilde and Irving Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents quickly responded by gathering Thursday at the intersection with 
homemade "stop" signs to form a squad of volunteer crossing guards, protecting 
youngsters crossing 7th Street and Union Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, in the northeastern San Fernando Valley, Maria Godoy, 48, and her 
11-year-old daughter, Amalia, were killed while crossing a street. The motorist 
sped away. Godoy's son, Marco, narrowly missed being hit because he stopped to 
tie his shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents there also reacted quickly. On Thursday, they were planning a 
showdown with officials over traffic signals they had been seeking for the 
accident site -- at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Montague Street -- until they 
learned that traffic controls would be installed next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police say 23-year-old Fernando Bengoechea of Arleta surrendered 3 
1/2 hours after Wednesday's 8:05 p.m. Pacoima accident. He apparently struck 
the Godoys when he tried to pass another car that had stopped to let them cross 
the street at an unmarked crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 But police were still searching late Thursday for the driver of the yellow or 
tan 1974 Toyota Corolla with license number 880 KEL that witnesses said caused 
another car to hit the Lopez children at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A witness started following him. We have a description," said Detective 
Richard Lopez, who is unrelated to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the Toyota was turning left when it broadsided an oncoming 1982 
Buick driven by Olga Rodriguez, 20, of Los Angeles. That collision sent the 
Buick careening over the curb, where it hit the sister and brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents in the neighborhood of apartment houses and tiny homes said they have 
been trying for months to get a crossing guard assigned to the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us in the past that there's a traffic signal here so we don't need 
a crossing guard," said Berta Saavedra, a neighborhood activist. "But if 
drivers knew a guard was here or saw an orange vest, they'd slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Thursday that is not necessarily true. "If a crossing guard 
had been standing there with a lot of kids, they all might have been hit," the 
LAPD's Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, angry residents complained that they have tried since 1990 to get 
traffic signals installed at Laurel Canyon and Montague. They were mapping 
plans to stage a sit-in at the office of City Councilman Richard Alarcon when 
officials disclosed that the long-sought signal system had previously been 
approved and, because of the accident, would be installed next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should have never gotten to this point," said Paula Aguilar, who led the 
effort to get a signal. "I called and called and they said, 'You have to wait 
your turn.' And now this." 
</P>
<P>
 City transportation engineers said Thursday it takes about two years to 
install traffic signals even after traffic patterns are studied and a signal is 
approved. A crosswalk also will be painted at the Pacoima site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a very high priority before (the accident)," said Tom Swire, a 
senior city transportation engineer. "There are other locations that have more 
prevalent accidents. . . . It is too bad it wasn't up a month ago." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Westlake area, school psychologists were summoned to counsel about 35 
children who were on the playground of Esparenza Elementary School, a few steps 
away from where the Lopez children were struck. Principal Rowena Lagrosa said 
parents and school leaders are not giving up on getting crossing guards 
assigned to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 parents working as do-it-yourself crossing guards Thursday afternoon 
said they plan to organize themselves on a rotating schedule to protect 
children at the intersection until officials take action. 
</P>
<P>
 "People drive too fast around here," said Adolfo Rivera, a garment worker who 
stood at the accident site holding a hand-printed sign that commanded in 
Spanish: "Stop for Schoolchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away at the Lopez children's campus, Union Avenue Elementary 
School, counselors were also called in to explain to second-graders that 
Kimberly would not be coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 The children attended Union Avenue School because a grandmother who lives 
nearby sometimes watched them after school, said Caldera, the principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kimberly loved to sing and dance," Caldera said. "She learned all the words 
to an upcoming musical performance we're having and taught them to her whole 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a carpenter, and his wife, who works in a family business, were at the 
little girl's side when she died about 12 hours after the accident, she said. 
Alan was reported in stable condition at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said Pacoima victim Maria Godoy worked at a nursing home. She 
is survived by her 13-year-old son, Marco, her husband and four other children. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say 18,317 people were killed or injured in hit-and-run accidents 
during 1992 in Los Angeles County. Last year, half of the 51,627 surface street 
accidents reported to Los Angeles police were hit and runs.

BODY FOUND, BUT IS IT MURDER OR AN ILLEGAL BURIAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 When 68-year-old John Sullivan Sr. disappeared from his home in Montclair 
about six months ago, neighbors figured that his sons had put him in a rest 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 John Sullivan Jr., 26, and Brian Sullivan, 29, never talked to anyone in the 
neighborhood, so no one bothered to ask them what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 No one gave it much thought until a few days ago, when Brian was arrested in 
Los Angeles on suspicion of forging a check. Detectives started checking with 
bank officials in Montclair to see if anyone there had had any problems with 
Brian. One of the places they visited was the local branch of First Interstate 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at First Interstate mentioned that they hadn't seen John Sullivan 
Sr. in quite a while. And when they looked at some of his Social Security 
checks that had been cashed there, they decided that some of the signatures 
looked a little odd. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, police went to the Sullivan home -- a foul-smelling, trash-strewn 
wreck of a place on an otherwise tidy residential street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sons told us they believed their father was in a rest home, but they 
didn't know which one," Lt. Kevin Piper of the Montclair Police Department said 
Thursday. "Obviously, any reasonable person would assume they knew more than 
they were telling us." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, a judge issued a search warrant and police investigators 
descended on the shabby little home on Saratoga Avenue. Finding nothing in the 
house, they began to dig in the back yard. About 3:30 p.m., they unearthed a 
human body. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains were severely decomposed, and it could not immediately be 
determined if the corpse was that of John Sullivan Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that obviously would be the logical assumption," Piper said. "We asked 
the sons about it, and they didn't have any explanation for the body unearthed 
in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper said there are only two possibilities as to what happened to John 
Sullivan Sr.: "Either he suffered a natural death and was buried, or he was 
murdered and he was buried." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, with no definitive evidence that a homicide has been committed, 
no arrests have been made. Brian, released after his arrest on the forgery 
charge that apparently is unrelated to his father's disappearance, and John Jr. 
remain free, although police say they are keeping in touch with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we have right now is a Health and Safety Code violation for an 
inappropriate burial," Piper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors, most of whom did not want to be quoted by name, generally 
favored the natural-death scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the old man just died and they buried him, so his Social Security 
checks would keep coming in," one neighbor speculated. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors said John Sullivan Sr., his wife and his two sons moved into the 
house about 15 years ago, and the place immediately fell into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept to themselves, so none of us got to know them," one neighbor said. 
"But I think the old man was an alcoholic. He'd stumble up to the 7-Eleven, get 
a jug of booze, bring it back and hide it by the garbage cans, so his sons 
wouldn't find it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sons would sleep all day and stay up all night," the neighbor added. 
"They'd stand out in the middle street and practice karate. I guess they wanted 
everyone to know they were real bad." 
</P>
<P>
 As the years passed, the sons married and their wives moved into the decaying 
house on Saratoga Avenue. The young couples had a total of four children, now 
ranging in age from about 2 to about 8. John Sr. and his wife became infirm, 
and about two years ago, she died. Money got scare, and water, gas and 
electrical service to the home were cut off. 
</P>
<P>
 "About six months ago, I was at First Interstate and the old man was there 
with his son, John," the neighbor said. "The old man withdrew about $700. I 
don't think he knew what was going on. It was right after that that he 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, about six weeks ago, the sons' wives and children moved out," he said. 
"After that, there was no one left but those two sons." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that a couple of weeks ago, Brian Sullivan moved to Los Angeles. 
His arrest a few days later led to the excavation in the back yard Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing they dug up was a dog," Piper said. "Some of the guys said 
they felt like idiots -- that the old guy would turn up in a rest home after 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 But they kept digging, eventually finding a spot beneath an old pine tree in 
one corner of the yard where the ground was a little soft. A few minutes later, 
they found the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no evident cause of death," Piper said. "That may be difficult to 
determine, with the body buried that long. And dental records (for establishing 
identification) may not be available." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper said the sons have remained in the area since the body was found, but 
neither is living in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 On the front door, a large official sign has been posted: 
</P>
<P>
 "Danger -- This Building Unsafe for Occupancy."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING 
JURORS WORK QUIETLY ON 3RD DAY OF DELIBERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors in the trial of Rodney G. King's federal lawsuit worked quietly through 
a third day of deliberations Thursday, giving no sign of any progress they 
might be making.  
</P>
<P>
 The panel adjourned late in the day, having apparently completed almost 19 
hours in the jury room without reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers in the case also made few appearances at the Roybal Federal Building, 
where a room full of reporters awaited the jury's decision.  
</P>
<P>
 The jurors, who awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages April 19, 
are being asked to award him millions of dollars more in punitive damages.  
</P>
<P>
 The defendants include former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and ex-Los Angeles police 
Officer Laurence M. Powell, who are serving 30-month terms for violating King's 
civil rights March 3, 1991.

SPEAKING UP: A LOOK AT NOTEWORTHY ADDRESSES IN THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Michael Parenti, author and political scientist, recently spoke about The 
Struggle for History: Dissident Truth and Official Deception. His remarks were 
sponsored by KPFK-FM. From his address: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the Function of History "The study of history is not only a discipline, it 
is itself a political act and part of the political struggle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The effort to define the past is part of the struggle to control society 
itself. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with historians, for better or worse, all sorts of people, including 
political leaders, publicists, press pundits, clergy, textbook publishers, 
school teachers and others, are involved in the manufacturing and marketing of 
a history whose function quite often is not to enlighten, but to indoctrinate. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who write history have an impact on it. They help control history's 
course by defining its dominant themes and influencing our understanding of 
what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conversely, those who make history, especially those who occupy elite policy 
positions, often manipulate the materials needed for recording it. They will 
destroy or repress information. They will introduce distortions at the point of 
production or at the point of origin well before the history is written or even 
played out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the fabrication at the point of origin . . . (with) the canonization 
of Richard Nixon. To see representation after representation, image after 
image, and not a mention of the fact that Richard Nixon carpet-bombed Cambodia 
and Laos and Vietnam, leading to the death of tens of thousands of people. . . 
. . (He) escalated that war. . . . But we heard, 'He wasn't perfect. He made 
mistakes at Watergate.' Mistakes? . . . So you see, right there, it's being 
filtered out. Fifty years from now any historian who consults the newspapers 
around Richard Nixon's death is not going to get an inkling of the whole 
dimension of his policies." 
</P>
<P>
 On Historical Perspective "Poor people have neither the time nor money to 
produce historical tomes. . . . If there is a variety of perspectives in a 
society, the one most likely to prevail is not necessarily one most 
representative of the people, but of the select few who are materially endowed. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "So we have what I call dominant history . . . the writing of history has been 
and still is principally an elitist undertaking. A privilege of the victor 
written from within the court, the church, the government, the academy. . . . 
It was the anonymous masses of people that gave us civilization, that gave us 
whatever productivity and comforts that we have. It wasn't the elite, it wasn't 
the rulers; they were too busy expropriating surplus value to build their 
castles, to wage their wars . . . whose goal is to expropriate the wealth, the 
labor, the land and the resources of people so that they could live better and 
better. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "To the princes and presidents we owe . . . the rapacious expropriation that 
has enriched the few and impoverished the many. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The successful control of history can be measured in the results. U.S. 
citizens seem to know very little about real history. . . . That's not a 
function of ignorance . . . it's a function of misinformation. . . . The powers 
that be understand the importance of inventing reality for the past as well as 
for the present. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are lied to with impunity, we are robbed of the first condition of a 
democratic citizenry: how the present can help us understand the past, and the 
past understand the present. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "History need not bore us, history need not imprison us, but it can liberate 
our understanding so that we can become not its victims, but its active 
agents."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: FAMILY OF MOTORIST 
SLAIN BY MTA OFFICER WINS $3.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles jury on Thursday awarded $3.5 million to the widow and three 
young daughters of a motorist who was shot and killed during a traffic stop by 
a transit police officer, opening the door to further damages by finding that 
the officer acted with malice. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 9-3 vote, the Los Angeles County Superior Court jury found that Officer 
Richard DeMartino, on active duty with the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority police, violated the civil rights of Alejandro Bodan, 24, when 
DeMartino shot him April 29, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was a high-profile one for transit authorities, who have faced harsh 
criticism about excessive force by transit officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodan, a Los Angeles marble installer who had been drinking heavily on the day 
of his death, was driving near Downtown Los Angeles with five teen-agers in the 
back of his pickup when DeMartino pulled him over, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMartino, a three-year veteran of the transit police, testified that Bodan 
had been driving erratically and that he ignored three commands to put his 
hands in plain view. The man also ignored a warning that DeMartino was about to 
shoot, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he said, Bodan reached for something under the driver's seat. 
Believing it might be a gun, DeMartino said, he shot the man twice. 
</P>
<P>
 But no gun was recovered, and accounts by other witnesses failed to square 
with the officer's testimony. An officer trainee who was riding with DeMartino 
said Bodan's driving was not especially erratic and that DeMartino spoke to 
Bodan in English, even though he knew the driver spoke only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMartino's account also varied from the one given to Los Angeles police 
officers, who found no wrongdoing. Meanwhile, a passenger in the truck -- who 
refused to come forward during the criminal investigation because he feared the 
police -- told the jury that DeMartino shot Bodan without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was the first fatal shooting in the history of the transit police. 
But it was held up by critics as a worst-case example of problems that had 
plagued the agency for some time. A 1991 Times investigation found that at 
least half a dozen of 192 transit officers either had troubled histories at 
other police agencies or had retired on disability pensions, saying they could 
no long perform police work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bodan shooting was at the time the third in three years for DeMartino. No 
one was injured in the earlier two incidents, records show, and in both cases, 
DeMartino reported seeing guns that were never found. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3.5 million will be assessed against the MTA. It is to be determined in 
the punitive phase of the trial, beginning today, whether DeMartino must pay 
further compensation. SHAWN HUBLER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LAPD 
REPORTS DETAIL CRIME TRENDS, PROFILE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its latest batch of reports analyzing recent crime trends, the Los Angeles 
Police Department released new statistics Thursday that identify clusters of 
violence and, in a few cases, highlight people who may be especially 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistical analyses are part of a training exercise and were prepared to 
hone the computer skills of police officials who are participating in the 
department's look at violent crime.They expand on an earlier set of LAPD 
reports, made public this month, which analyzed crime hot spots in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports are being prepared by each of the LAPD's 18 police stations and 
vary widely in thoroughness. But some, such as those prepared by the 
department's Wilshire and North Hollywood divisions, go into great detail. 
</P>
<P>
 In several reports, analysts probed the racial and gender breakdown of crime 
victims and perpetrators. In the Wilshire Division, for instance, analysts 
noted that Asian American residents were often victimized at night. "Our 
research has found that (Asians) often carry large sums of money and often wear 
expensive jewelry," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistical analyses were not intended to influence police deployments but 
will form the basis for the more complete reports now being written, according 
to department officials. Assistant Chief Bernard Parks has asked officials at 
each of the city's police stations to complete that work and submit it to him 
next month.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; 5 FACE 
CHARGES IN SLAYING OF WOMAN IN HER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five people are facing criminal charges in connection with the killing of a 
Long Beach woman who was beaten and stabbed in her Long Beach home last 
December, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were booked for murder in the Dec. 2 attack on Ruby Chong at her 
residence in the 2100 block of Baltic Avenue, Long Beach Police Detective Logan 
Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Wednesday arrested Tabitha Brown, 20, of Ontario. Their 
investigation led them to Brown's sister, Cindy Brown, 18, of Carson, and three 
other Carson teen-agers -- two 17-year-old-boys and a 16-year-old boy whose 
names were withheld because of their ages, said Detective John Boston. He said 
a break in the case came when detectives obtained a warrant for Tabitha Brown's 
arrest on charges of forging several of the victim's checks.

EPA EXTENDS RELOCATION AID TO RESIDENTS OF DDT AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials announced Thursday that 25 families in a Torrance-area 
neighborhood will be kept in temporary housing for up to six months at federal 
expense while investigators examine DDT soil contamination that is more 
extensive than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also will study whether families 
should be permanently moved from the neighborhood east of Torrance where chunks 
of DDT have been unearthed in two back yards, John Blevins, an EPA section 
chief, said at a Thursday night meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the first time that the agency has discussed permanent relocation as 
a possible response to the discovery of DDT behind two houses on West 204th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has more merit now because the DDT is more widespread than we thought," 
said Blevins, who cautioned the families present that any decision on permanent 
relocation is months away and that such a move would be highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 If officials find that the DDT can be cleaned up satisfactorily, families may 
be able to return home in less than six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 residents were moved into hotels as the cleanup began April 29. They 
were scheduled to return to the neighborhood late next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents expressed relief at the news that they will not be returning 
immediately to their neighborhood, particularly since some have complained of 
health problems such as rashes, nausea and vomiting that they fear could be 
related to the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist Cynthia Babich, who has criticized the EPA repeatedly in 
recent weeks, grinned and shook Blevins' hand after the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in shock," Babich said later. "It sounds like they are going to take the 
time to attack this problem logically and get it taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday meeting came almost two weeks after cleanup workers first 
uncovered chunks of light powder two to three feet underground that later tests 
found were largely DDT. EPA officials say the banned pesticide appears to be 
scattered in fill soil that may extend east under more homes. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the cleanup work and relocation have cost about $500,000. The source 
of the pesticide is unknown so far.

ATTORNEY SANCTIONED FOR CRITICIZING JUDGE; COURTS: PANEL FINDS THAT CIVIL 
RIGHTS LAWYER STEPHEN YAGMAN TRIED TO FORCE JURIST TO TAKE HIMSELF OFF CASES. 
HE COULD FACE REPRIMAND, SUSPENSION OR OTHER DISCIPLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special panel of three Los Angeles federal district court judges has ruled 
that Venice civil rights lawyer Stephen Yagman "impugned the integrity of the 
court" by accusing one of their colleagues of being anti-Semitic, drunk on the 
bench, "ignorant, dishonest . . . a bully and one of the worst judges in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges also ruled that Yagman engaged in judge-shopping. They said he had 
criticized the judge in question, William D. Keller, "in an effort to force him 
to recuse himself" from Yagman's cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In most of his cases, Yagman represents plaintiffs suing law enforcement 
officers on allegations of misconduct. Keller, a former U.S. attorney and a 
1984 Reagan appointee, is generally viewed as sympathetic to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's ruling does not end the matter. Yagman still faces the possibility 
of a reprimand, suspension from practice in some federal courts or other 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a rare and unfortunate day when the judges of this district must 
sanction an attorney for conduct involving criticism of the bench," said 
federal judges John G. Davies, Edward Rafeedie and David W. Williams in their 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robust debate regarding judicial performance is essential to a vital 
judiciary," but "baseless factual allegations contribute nothing to judicial 
accountability and undermine public trust in the courts," the judges added in 
the ruling, released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The panel finds no evidence that Judge Keller is in fact anti-Semitic or that 
(Yagman) had a reasonable basis for making such accusations," the judges wrote. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The judges also said Yagman "has made no effort to explain his accusations 
that Judge Keller is dishonest or 'drunk on the bench.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of supporting evidence, the judges said, "the panel presumes 
(that) these charges are false" and that Yagman lacked an objectively 
reasonable basis for expressing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, through his secretary, said he had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman blasted the ruling: "I am a Jew who believes a federal judge is an 
anti-Semite. And if friends of that judge who were appointed to the bench by 
the proven anti-Semite (Richard) Nixon and the odious (Ronald) Reagan attempt 
to harm me based on trumped-up charges for holding my belief, I cannot let that 
deter me. I'm a realist who holds a correct but unpopular opinion and who 
expects and who will bear the wrath of opponents whose righteousness is 
surpassed only by their lack of integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was appointed by Nixon. Davies and Rafeedie were appointed by Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 In their ruling, the three judges deferred making a recommendation on the 
"appropriate sanction" pending further briefs from Yagman and a special federal 
court disciplinary committee made up of 12 attorneys. Last year, the committee, 
citing the remarks about Keller, recommended that Yagman be barred from 
practicing in federal courts in seven Southern California counties from 
Riverside to San Luis Obispo, which make up the Central District of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a decade ago, Federal Judge Manuel L. Real imposed a $250,000 sanction 
on Yagman, which ultimately was reversed by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals. Yagman, 49, also was suspended from practice by the state bar for six 
months in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the disciplinary committee filed the charges against him in December, 
1992, Yagman has contended that he is the subject of a vendetta stemming from 
his longstanding feud with Real, who until recently was the chief judge of the 
Central District. Real appointed the 12-member committee that lodged the 
charges against Yagman. 
</P>
<P>
 In their ruling, the three judges cited as evidence statements Yagman made to 
a reporter from the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal trade paper; a letter he 
wrote to Prentice Hall, the publisher of a book of judicial profiles, and an 
advertisement Yagman placed in the Daily Journal seeking information from 
lawyers whom Keller had sanctioned.

OFFICIALS SAY PACOIMA SCHOOL'S SAVINGS CAN'T BE DUPLICATED; EDUCATION: DISTRICT 
PRAISES STAFF BUT SAYS OTHER CAMPUSES DO NOT GET BREAKS THAT ALLOWED $1-MILLION 
SURPLUS. VAUGHN LEARNING CENTER DIRECTOR DISAGREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While admitting that Los Angeles schools could learn effective new ways to 
save money from a Pacoima charter school, a financial review of the Vaughn Next 
Century Learning Center's budget concludes that the school received special 
treatment that cannot be extended to other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-page review sent to Los Angeles Board of Education members 
Thursday, district officials found that Vaughn succeeded in saving a total of 
$1 million, in part by decreasing student and teacher absenteeism and by hiring 
less experienced -- and less expensive -- teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report also calculated that most of the savings -- about $700,000 -- 
came from the district giving Vaughn financial breaks on costly items. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, for example, was given more money for teacher salaries and benefits 
than other schools and charged less for Los Angeles Unified School District 
support services, the report showed. The district would be unable to give those 
same breaks to other campuses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the review found that the school, led by school director Yvonne 
Chan, had miscalculated its surplus by about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The district financial study was prompted by Chan's public assertions that she 
had saved $1.2 million this year by operating the school more efficiently. In 
response, the district sent two members of the accounting division to review 
the school's finances for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, who met with the accounting officials on Thursday afternoon, said she 
disagrees with the finding that her surplus has dropped to $1 million. In 
addition, she said the school's successes could be easily duplicated across the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're any smarter than anyone else," Chan said. "I don't think 
we have any better conditions than anyone else. If we can do it, why can't 
everyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 The district report praised Chan and her staff for being innovative and for 
implementing many of the reforms other schools are attempting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Chan, her staff and parents are to be commended for their vigorous 
efforts in effecting school flexibility and reform," the report said, "even 
though a substantial portion of the savings resulted from district efforts 
which treated Vaughn more generously than other district schools."

 Bill Rivera, the district's spokesman, said the central administration allowed 
Vaughn to use unique spending practices to help encourage the new charter 
school. He said the district could not afford to extend the same favorable 
budget formulas to other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing a hell of a job," Rivera said. "A lot of schools are going to be 
looking at this. But a lot of what she has done has been with one-time funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Charter Schools Act, passed in 1992, gave campuses authority to 
break away from many district and state regulations. Using its budget 
flexibility, Vaughn successfully argued last year for more funds and has waged 
public battles over the district's spending practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn ultimately was granted more money per student than most comparable 
elementary schools, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members said the system was unfair to other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were overly fair to Vaughn," said board member Mark Slavkin, who 
voted last fall against giving Vaughn more funds. "I think we did some things 
for Vaughn that we're not going to be able to do (for) other schools and it's 
not fair to set that up."

DOW CONTINUES CLIMB; DOLLAR CLOSES MIXED

<P>
 Stocks posted solid gains Thursday for a third straight session, helped by 
another rally in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished mixed, however, rising against the Japanese yen but losing 
ground against the German mark despite a surprisingly good U.S. trade report. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrials gained 26.09 points to 3,758.98, pacing a 
broad rally. Winners outnumbered losers by nearly 3 to 2 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors continued to snap up stocks of companies whose businesses would be 
helped by a continuing economic recovery. Many of those shares had tumbled in 
recent weeks, as rising interest rates sparked fears of a pronounced slowdown 
in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those worries dissipated significantly on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve 
Board signaled that it is finished raising rates for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks, also sensitive to the economy, were big winners as well 
Thursday. Their gains helped boost the Nasdaq composite index 5.41 points to 
727.31, the highest in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields finished lower across the board, even as commodity 
prices jumped again. The 30-year Treasury bond yield dipped to 7.23% from 7.27% 
on Wednesday. The bond's yield peaked at 7.65% on May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bond traders said investors were wary of bonds early in the day, after 
the government reported that the nation's March trade deficit narrowed 
unexpectedly to $7.46 billion, thanks to record exports. That raised concerns 
about faster economic growth leading to higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trade report also helped the dollar rally against the yen, which may 
have encouraged Japanese investors to buy U.S. bonds later in the day, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there were rumors of buying of intermediate-term bonds by major 
central banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, which jumped to 104.25 yen in New York from 103.50 on Wednesday, 
was also supported by statements from U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor. 
He expressed hope that preliminary discussions with Japanese officials will 
lead to a full resumption of the stalled "framework" talks on reducing Japan's 
huge trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar failed to rally against the German mark, however. It closed at 
1.654 marks, compared to 1.656 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Streeters said the big surprise Thursday was that the bond market 
ignored another jump in commodity prices. A surge in coffee, cocoa, cotton and 
oil futures drove the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 key commodities up 
1.45 points to 232.43, the highest level since October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil futures gained 46 cents to $18.45 a barrel on the New York Merc, 
near a seven-month high, on talk of tightening supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks leading the market higher included DuPont, up 1 to 61 1/4; 
GM, up 1 1/8 to 55 1/4; International Paper, up 1 7/8 to 68 3/8; 
Georgia-Pacific, up 3 3/8 to 63 1/2; Varity, up 3/4 to 36 3/4, and Nucor, up 2 
1/8 to 64 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transport issues also advanced again, on news that Kansas City Southern is 
trying to sell its rail business for as much as $2 billion. Kansas City rose 2 
1/2 to 45 1/2 and other rail stocks climbed as well. CSX jumped 3 3/8 to 76 and 
Burlington Northern gained 1 7/8 to 57 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City said it wants to concentrate on its financial services businesses. 
The firm announced that it will increase its stake in the Denver-based Berger 
mutual fund firm to 80% from 18%, buying most of the additional shares from 
founder Bill Berger. Kansas City also owns an 81% stake in the Janus mutual 
fund firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the technology and telecommunications arena, AT&T jumped 1 3/8 to 56 5/8 
and General Instrument leaped 4 1/4 to 59 1/8 after Bell Atlantic picked them 
to furnish a new network system. Bell Atlantic was up 1/8 to 53 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, DSC Communications plunged 8 11/16 to 49 1/16 because it 
failed to get a piece of the Bell Atlantic contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech gainers included Apple, up 1 1/2 to 32 1/8; Compaq, up 2 1/2 to 111 
5/8; Motorola, up 1 to 47 1/8, and Tellabs, up 1 7/8 to 71 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among energy issues gaining from higher oil prices, Mobil rose 1 3/8 to 82 
3/4, Chevron added 1 1/4 to 87 3/4 and Unocal was up 1 to 27 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 19.65 points to 2,247.76, while London's 
FTSE-100 index gained 6.3 points to 3,122.8. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index gained 68.61 points to 20,221.34. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot foreign action continued to be in emerging markets. In Mexico City, 
the Bolsa index jumped 29.73 points to 2,404.91.

NEW FIGURES RANK COLLAPSE OF AMERICAN S&L AS COSTLIEST EVER; BANKING: 
REGULATORS NOW SAY IT WILL COST TAXPAYERS $5.4 BILLION. BASS REPORTEDLY PLANS 
TO SELL SUCCESSOR AMERICAN SAVINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American Savings & Loan, once the nation's largest thrift before its 1988 
collapse, now ranks as the nation's most expensive S&L failure, costing 
taxpayers $5.4 billion, or more than triple the previous official estimate, 
regulators said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the increase was caused mostly by a 
more detailed evaluation of loans, securities and other holdings after a 
complicated and controversial sale of the failed institution in December, 1988. 
The slumping California real estate market also added to the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised estimate came amid reports that American Savings Bank, the 
successor financial institution in Irvine that was created from the ruins of 
the failed S&L, is now up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of American Savings Bank, an investor group led by billionaire 
financier Robert M. Bass in Ft. Worth, Tex., are believed to have put the 
financial institution on the market for $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has a direct interest in any sale. Under the deal that created 
American Savings Bank, the FDIC holds stock rights that entitle it to 30% of 
any eventual sale price. What it recoups on a sale would reduce the 
government's huge loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised estimate of what the failure of American Savings & Loan cost 
taxpayers, originally pegged at $1.7 billion, surprised even the Bass group. 
"That's higher than anything we had ever heard to this point," said Owen 
Blicksilver, a spokesman for Bass. 
</P>
<P>
 It far exceeds the $3.4 billion that taxpayers are expected to pay for the 
failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan. That thrift, which had been the costliest 
failure, failed in April, 1989, under the weight of bad investments and 
outright fraud by its operator, Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised loss at American Savings & Loan could revive congressional debate 
over the wisdom of the December, 1988, deal that split the thrift into two 
entities: American Savings Bank, which held the good loans and other assets, 
and New West Federal Savings Bank, which held the bad loans and securities and 
has nearly liquidated itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bass-led group, now called Keystone Holdings Partners, had received $1.7 
billion in government assistance and put in about $350 million to buy the 
financial institution and operate both units. The deal was roundly criticized 
at the time as being too costly, and regulators were criticized for failing to 
get more money out of Bass. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alternative then was to shut down American completely and suffer even 
greater losses. Under the revised estimate, regulators said, the loss from 
simply closing the institution and paying off depositors still would have been 
greater than entering the deal with Bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very troubled institution, and we didn't have the ability then to 
do a lot of due diligence to determine the exact loss," said James Meyer, an 
FDIC executive. "After the (Bass) acquisition was done, there were budgets and 
plans made and each asset was evaluated. We got to the bottom of the barrel, 
and the estimates got higher." 
</P>
<P>
 FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney acknowledged that the agency has known for the 
last four years that the failure of American would cost more than $4 billion, 
but it didn't release any figures before Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wall Street has long expected that Bass would eventually sell 
American Savings Bank. Keystone Holdings has retained two investment banking 
firms, Goldman Sachs & Co. and its longtime adviser, Lehman Bros., to drum up 
interest in its thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment bankers approached Citicorp in New York, the nation's largest 
banking company, but it declined to pursue a deal, according to a report in 
American Banker, an industry trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to American Savings Bank said NationsBank in Charlotte, N.C., 
another large banking concern, is expected to send a team to the savings bank 
in the next few weeks to look at loans and other assets as part of a 
preliminary review toward possible negotiations. NationsBank and American 
Savings Bank refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people assumed that sooner or later, the Bass group would either seek to 
raise public equity or sell the bank," said Peter Treadway, an industry analyst 
at Smith Barney Shearson in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bass group could be laying the groundwork for a sale or public offering 
sometime next year, he said. "I think prices for thrifts will be higher a year 
from now in California," Treadway said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings Bank holds $17.1 billion in loans, securities and other 
assets. It also has an attractive branch system throughout the state and has 
developed a reputation as one of the premier mortgage lenders in poor and 
minority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bass is reportedly tired of regulatory disclosures he must make and the 
time it takes to oversee the investment. He wants to cash in on the thrift's 
success, sources said. The time to sell may be approaching, but the 
organization isn't saying when. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bass organization has no timetable for holding or selling any 
investment," Blicksilver said. "But from time to time, the group will look at 
the market and decide a course of action." American Savings Bank

RECORD U.S. SALES ABROAD HELP CUT THE TRADE DEFICIT; COMMERCE: BUT THE 
CONTENTIOUS IMBALANCE WITH JAPAN PERSISTS AS GAP HITS $5.8 BILLION IN MARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. trade deficit narrowed greatly to $7.46 billion in March as a record 
level of American sales abroad helped offset record imports, the Commerce 
Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, within the overall positive report were troubling statistics on trade 
with Japan. While the total U.S. deficit narrowed by 18.5%, the imbalance with 
Japan grew by 25.4% to $5.8 billion, its third-highest monthly level. 
</P>
<P>
 As the report was being released, representatives of both nations were 
meeting, breaking three months of near silence in an effort to resume 
negotiations on a smoother trade relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly U.S. trade figures, which are routinely volatile, showed U.S. 
exports of goods at an all-time high of $42.17 billion. Imports were valued at 
$54.21 billion, also a record. A surplus in the area of services -- investment 
operations, entertainment and travel, for example -- cut the overall trade 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported that the increase in exports was fueled by 
jumps in U.S. sales of gold bullion, commercial airplanes, telecommunications 
equipment and engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "These exports occur in areas of rising U.S. competitiveness and coincide with 
some early signs of better economic growth in the industrialized nations, 
particularly in Europe," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said in a 
statement. But he said that despite such month-to-month jumps, "continued slow 
growth abroad remains a drag on U.S. economic expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has been pressuring Japan to stimulate its sluggish domestic 
economy to spur demand for U.S. goods and help narrow the growing trade 
imbalance between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Emissaries from the new Japanese government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
visited the offices of the U.S. trade representative Thursday, trying to 
re-establish talks that were broken off Feb. 11 when U.S. and Japanese 
officials were unable to agree on a plan to open the Japanese market in four 
crucial economic sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials approached the meeting with a wait-and-see attitude, saying 
during a dinner break that they had not yet heard enough from the Japanese to 
warrant reopening the stalled negotiations. But they said the meetings would 
continue into the evening and could resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese, a senior White House official said, "know what it would take" to 
resume formal negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Hata government still trying to get its political footing, Clinton 
Administration officials are reluctant to push Japanese officials to make risky 
concessions. There is no suggestion that such pressure, which produced some 
progress in low-visibility areas during the past year, would be successful in 
the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations fell apart when Hata's predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, visited 
the White House earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage, with the new prime minister expressing interest in resuming the 
talks, "it's not the best thing in the world to start throwing furniture around 
the room," a senior U.S. trade official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout its first year in office, the Administration sought ways to 
pressure Japan to compromise on the trade front, demanding that Tokyo agree to 
establish some form of objective criteria for measuring progress in purchasing 
foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials deny there has been a shift from that approach, but their 
comments have suggested that it has less emphasis. They said there is no 
deadline for progress, and they steered clear of creating any expectation that 
Clinton and Hata would be able to nail down an agreement by the time they meet 
at the next international economic summit, which takes place in Naples, Italy, 
in July. But they also made it clear they are unwilling to let new talks drag 
on indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in what he freely acknowledged was a defensive tenor, the senior 
trade official took pains during a recent meeting with reporters to emphasize a 
series of agreements that are intended to open Japan to U.S. apples, rice and 
chemicals, as well as cellular telephone companies and construction contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting Thursday got under way, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor told reporters during a recess that "we had an exchange of very detailed 
ideas."

LAWYERS TO GET 25% OF PRUDENTIAL CLASS-ACTION SETTLEMENT; SECURITIES: JUDGE 
APPARENTLY IGNORES COMPLAINTS FROM SEC AND CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS THAT THE FEE 
REQUESTS WERE EXCESSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has awarded a group of lawyers 25% of the $90-million 
settlement won for small investors in a private class-action suit involving 
Prudential Securities' oil and gas partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 In making the award, U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. of New Orleans 
made no mention of unusual letters he received from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and California's corporations commissioner raising concerns that the 
lawyers' fee requests were excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 The roughly $22 million in legal fees -- which gives most of the investors' 
lawyers the sums they were seeking -- comes out of the settlement pool, 
reducing the amount that will go to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves Prudential's Energy Income Funds partnerships, in which 
130,000 predominantly elderly investors put money in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds suffered major losses; under the class-action settlement, most 
investors will end up with 80% to 90% of their initial investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the SEC and state securities regulators have said recently that they are 
scrutinizing such class-action cases for abuses by lawyers, including fee 
requests out of proportion to the work done. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Livaudais said the fee award is justified because "all counsel 
have prosecuted the case in an efficient, cooperative and diligent manner, 
bringing the litigation to a swift and successful conclusion" for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward A. Grossmann, the lead class-action lawyer for investors in the case, 
drew criticism last year from state regulators and other lawyers for initially 
agreeing to a settlement that would have paid investors far less. Only after 
the other lawyers and regulators intervened was the cash portion of the 
settlement greatly boosted. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest portion of Livaudais' award will go to Grossmann's law firm. The 
judge concluded that lawyers who objected to the original settlement had not 
fully documented their fee requests. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC general counsel Simon Lorne, who wrote the SEC's letter to the judge, 
declined to comment on the fee award. Gary Mendoza, the California corporations 
commissioner, was said to be traveling Thursday and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart C. Goldberg, a Texas attorney who has represented Energy Income 
investors, strongly objected to the fee award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an outrage," said Goldberg, who asked for no fees from the 
class-action pool. "It's my conclusion that the class-action plaintiffs were 
not well represented, that the settlement was totally inadequate and that the 
attorneys made millions." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said investors who chose not to participate in the class action but 
instead have sought redress through an entirely separate settlement obtained by 
the SEC so far have been getting much more of their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the SEC settlement -- which covers a range of Prudential limited 
partnerships -- the firm has established an initial pool of $330 million to 
reimburse investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmann said the settlement is fair. "I think the judge's opinion makes it 
clear that the judge believes (investors) were well represented," he said.

PAIN AND GAIN FOR GM; EDS SPINOFF WOULD CLOSE STORMY, PROFITABLE CHAPTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tempestuous 10-year marriage of General Motors Corp. and Electronic Data 
Systems could be judged GM's most successful failure ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquired from Texas entrepreneur Ross Perot for $2.55 billion in 1984, the 
computer data-processing services company is now valued at $16 billion. Its 
steady profits have provided much-needed cash to the auto maker, and EDS 
brought order to the chaos of GM's confusing maze of computer and 
telecommunications systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is less clear whether the acquisition -- advertised as loaded with 
high-tech synergies -- improved GM much as an auto maker. Despite its 
tremendous technological resources, GM still lags major competitors in the 
efficient design and manufacture of cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "EDS has been very profitable for GM," said Joseph Phillipi, analyst for 
Lehman Bros. "But did it help them be a better car company? No." 
</P>
<P>
 GM said this week it may spin off EDS; meanwhile, EDS is pursuing a possible 
merger with U.S. Sprint, the telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of EDS would end a volatile chapter in GM's history that has brought 
both pain and gain to the world's largest auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, the relationship was overshadowed by a public clash of egos -- GM's 
pugnacious Roger Smith vs. EDS' loquacious Perot -- and the difficulty of 
meshing disparate cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of EDS was the brainchild of former GM Chairman Smith, who set 
out to remake the company with several broad strokes in the mid-1980s. Long 
fascinated with high-technology, he used GM's $10-billion cash hoard to 
diversify the auto maker. The idea was to acquire businesses whose technologies 
could be transferred to the auto business and whose profits could see GM 
through cyclical slumps in the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the EDS acquisition -- which Smith once described to reporters as 
"a lulu" -- was the largest undertaken by GM. But it was soon surpassed by the 
company's $5.2-billion takeover of Hughes Aircraft Co. In both cases, Smith 
talked about high-tech possibilities that could help build GM into the car 
company of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith laid out a futuristic vision. He saw car buyers eventually ordering cars 
on dealership computers. Orders would be sent via satellite to assembly plants. 
Parts would quickly be shipped by suppliers tied into an on-line computer 
system. Assembly would be done by robots programmed to meet each order. 
Meanwhile, GM's finance arm would process the buyer's loan application, using 
computers to check credit ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts expected that the high-tech benefits would be elusive and noted 
that the computer services could be obtained from outside suppliers. Others 
worried that GM would stifle EDS' entrepreneurial bent or rankle at Perot's 
maverick style. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain EDS' independence, it was set up as a wholly owned subsidiary with 
a separate class of stock. Holders of the new Class E stock had a stake in EDS' 
financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meshing the two companies soon brought storm clouds. With EDS officials 
swooping into Detroit like a tornado, GM managers resisted their moves to take 
over computer operations. Resentment reached a fever pitch when 6,000 GM 
employees were transferred to EDS at lower pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot soon accused Smith of reneging on promises to maintain EDS' 
independence. Smith's anger grew as Perot publicly ridiculed GM as an unwieldy 
elephant. Detente came only after Perot resigned from the GM board in late 
1986, taking a $750-million payoff with him. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS' impact on GM initially was more mundane than many expected. Instead of 
building the factory of the future, it set about fixing GM's archaic 
data-processing system -- a mishmash of computers that often could not talk to 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger Smith had a vision of technological interaction," said David Healy, 
analyst with S.G. Warburg & Co. "But on the whole, that did not take hold very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 However, GM and EDS officials say EDS has been instrumental in improving the 
auto maker's operations -- but often in intangible ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a tremendous amount of places in GM where EDS has made the 
manufacturing, design and production faster, better and cheaper," one GM 
official said. "But it's hard to put a price tag on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts agree that it is difficult to assess EDS' contribution to GM's 
operations. What is easier to see is the financial impact. EDS market 
capitalization has increased sixfold in the last decade, and it has contributed 
$4 billion in profits to GM. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, EDS may have gotten more out of the merger than GM. "It has allowed 
us to grow our business much faster than we could have alone," EDS spokesman 
Tony Good said. 
</P>
<P>
 With GM's backing, EDS has aggressively sought to increase its reach. In 1985, 
GM made up 75% of EDS' business; today it accounts for only 38%. EDS is also 
expanding abroad and into new business areas -- moves made easier by its ties 
to GM, which has a presence throughout the world and has given EDS exposure to 
computer-aided design and manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's decision to shed EDS comes as the auto industry worldwide is shunning the 
diversification strategy of a decade ago. Increasingly, auto makers are 
focusing on making vehicles and strengthening their balance sheets for battle 
in developing markets. A Match Made in...? 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Data Systems' revenue and profit have grown steadily since General 
Motors acquired it in 1984. The unit has also increased its non-GM business: 
Its auto maker parent accounted for about 75% of EDS sales in 1985 but only 38% 
in 1993.

 Former Fed Governor Reportedly Under Investigation: The Federal Reserve System 
is investigating whether former Fed Gov. Wayne Angell received inside 
information about the Fed's activities or simply had a brilliant hunch, 
according to the New York Times.The focus of the inquiry is a report Angell 
wrote a few weeks ago for clients of Bear Stearns, his new employer. In the 
report, he said eight or nine of the 12 regional banks had requested an 
increase in the discount rate. The knowledge that the boards of regional banks 
were pushing to raise the discount rate would be helpful in predicting the vote 
of the Federal Open Market Committee because very few people are close to those 
requests.

 'Civil War' Producer Criticizes Disney: Ken Burns, producer of the acclaimed 
public television series, said building a theme park near a historic 
battlefield in Virginia could destroy a place "where the ghosts of our 
collective past still have the power to mesmerize." Burns said he was joining 
other historians in urging Walt Disney Co. to build elsewhere even though he 
too is in the business of popularizing history "and, in fact . . . (am) working 
with Disney on another unrelated history project."Burns is under contract as a 
consultant on a documentary about baseball. He issued his statement through 
Protect Historic America, a group of writers and historians that last week 
asked Disney not to build the park on the proposed site near the Civil War 
battlefield at Manassas, Va., near Washington.

 Kmart Settles Overcharging Claim: The company has agreed to pay $985,000 in 
civil penalties and costs to settle a consumer protection lawsuit filed by the 
Riverside County district attorney.The lawsuit, filed in cooperation with 
prosecutors in Kern and San Diego counties, said Kmart Corp. engaged in unfair 
competition and misleading advertising by charging customers more at the 
checkout register than the prices advertised for certain goods. Prosecutors 
said the overcharging occurred at Kmart stores in the three counties, and their 
claims were based on routine inspections by the California Department of 
Weights and Measures. Kmart did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the 
settlement.

 Chrysler Says It Will Wipe Out Pension Liability: The auto maker plans to 
eliminate its unfunded pension liability by the end of the year, Chairman 
Robert Eaton told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in Toledo, 
Ohio.Chrysler Corp. also announced it will boost shareholder dividends to 25 
cents a share from 20 cents. It also raised its dividend in December. The 
company's unfunded pension liability stood at $2.2 billion at the end of 1993. 
The liability has been reduced by $700 million since then, leaving a 
$1.5-billion deficit.

 SciClone Reports on Hepatitis Drug: SciClone Pharmaceuticals said ongoing 
clinical trials of its treatment for chronic hepatitis B in Taiwan have not 
shown indications of drug toxicity or adverse reactions.However, the company 
warned against concluding that thymosin alpha 1 has been proven effective in 
treating Asian patients, because the results were based on a small number of 
patients in the early stages of testing. The stock of the San Mateo, 
Calif.-based biotechnology firm has fallen 60% since April, when the company 
announced results of drug testing in the United States that showed thymosin 
alpha 1 was no more effective in treating hepatitis B than plain water.

 'Screen Saver' Patent to Be Reviewed: The Patent and Trademark Office will 
re-examine a broad patent covering advertising on computers that was granted in 
1992 to a La Costa, Calif., company.Earlier this year, Software Advertising 
Corp. complained that a PC Dynamics "screen saver" program featuring the 
Energizer Bunny violated its patent. PC Dynamics, based in Westlake Village, 
licenses the bunny image from Eveready Battery Co. The patent office 
commissioner, Bruce Lehman, decided to take another look at the patent after he 
was made aware of similar technology that existed before it was granted.

BANKS APPROVE PLAN TO RESCUE EURO DISNEY

<P>
 The 61 creditor banks of the ailing Euro Disney theme park have agreed to a 
financial restructuring plan aimed at reviving the debt-ridden resort, two of 
the banks said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez said a sufficient number of 
banks have agreed to cover 51% of a capital boost for Euro Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue package features a $1.05-billion capital increase through an 
offering of stock planned for this summer. Shareholders have yet to consider 
the overall plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney, 20 miles east of Paris in Marne-La-Vallee, has accumulated 
enormous debt since its opening just over two years ago, although it has become 
the favorite short-trip destination in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Euro Disney announced an operating loss for the first half 
of 1994 of $183.9 million, with revenue dropping 12.4% to $276 million. It has 
a total debt load of $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney blames its problems on the European recession, which led to 
falling real estate prices and visitors who scrimp once they get to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary agreement between major creditor banks, Euro Disney and parent 
company Walt Disney Co., which owns 49% of the park, was reached March 14, but 
it was contingent on approval by the 61 creditor banks.

TIME WARNER SAYS PANEL HAS CLEARED ABOODI

 Time Warner Inc. Chairman Gerald M. Levin said Thursday that a committee of 
outside directors has cleared the company's leading financial adviser, Oded 
Aboodi, to continue his relationship with the firm in the wake of an 
insider-trading case that was settled last week with Aboodi's agreement to pay 
fines of $931,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboodi neither admitted nor denied allegations by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that two family partnerships sold Time Warner common stock at a time 
when Aboodi knew that Time Warner management had -- in May, 1991 -- approved 
controversial stock rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Public disclosure of the plan triggered a 10% decline in Time Warner's stock 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboodi was the late Time Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross' closest financial 
adviser, and he developed a strong friendship with Levin after negotiating the 
Time Warner merger in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, at a well-attended annual shareholders meeting on a Warner Bros. 
sound stage in Burbank, Levin gave the 52-year-old adviser a ringing 
endorsement and said the committee's action "closes the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Levin also fielded questions about Seagram Co.'s 14.9% stake in Time Warner. 
He said no representatives have been invited to join the board because "they 
haven't asked." However, Levin noted that Seagram sent three representatives to 
the shareholders meeting.

PLAN TO AUCTION AIRWAVES RAISES PROTEST; COMMUNICATIONS: COALITION, CITING A 
DECLINE IN MINORITY OWNERSHIP, SAYS THE GOVERNMENT SALE WOULD FAVOR BIG FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As it prepares to auction off valuable slices of the radio spectrum for new 
communications services, the Clinton Administration is coming under fire from 
critics who say it hasn't done enough to help women and minorities acquire an 
ownership stake in the information networks of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism surfaced last week in a letter sent by the Coalition for 
Wireless Competition to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed E. 
Hundt, expressing concern that the auctions "will only benefit some large 
companies." The issue will receive further scrutiny in a hearing today before 
the House Subcommittee on Minority Enterprise, at which committee members are 
expected to challenge Administration officials over their proposed auction 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past three years, minority ownership in broadcasting has been in 
steady decline; with other new technologies now emerging, we believe new and 
much more aggressive approaches are needed to foster more minority ownership 
opportunities," said David Honig, executive director of the Minority Media 
Ownership and Employment Council, a Washington-based advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 The House hearing comes only days after a heated Commerce Department meeting 
at which attorney Thomas A. Hart Jr., who represents minority investors seeking 
to acquire so-called personal communications services licenses, told Assistant 
Commerce Secretary Larry Irving that the Administration's plans to auction the 
airwaves without more financial incentives for women and minorities amounts to 
"raping us for $10 billion by not allowing us to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also opposition to giving special preference to the groups 
clamoring for it. Preference programs have come under attack in the past from 
critics who say they are unfair and encourage big companies to ally with 
minority or female investors who aren't sincerely interested in running a 
communications business. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainer Bill Cosby and civil rights lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr. are among 
scores of minority and female applicants who made millions of dollars from FCC 
preference rules in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over preferences underscores the importance of the government's 
fall auctions of radio spectrum to provide new wireless services that will 
enable users to talk and send faxes and data over the airwaves with hand-held 
transceivers. Wireless technology is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the 
burgeoning telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond financial self-interest, advocates of women, minorities and small 
businesses say owners in these groups can better bring new technology to rural, 
inner-city and niche markets that might otherwise be left out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although efforts to encourage women, minorities and small businesses to gain 
PCS licenses have more support this time around, Jerry Lucas, president of 
Telestrategies, a McLean, Va., consulting firm, says they are still likely to 
be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small businesses, woman-owned or minority-owned companies (aren't) going to 
do anything in offering PCS service that is unique or different," Lucas told 
his clients in a recent newsletter.

 The Clinton Administration says it supports ownership diversity but is also 
counting on the spectrum auctions to ease federal budget woes.

 "We made a $10-billion commitment to the American taxpayer" to reduce federal 
outlays with revenue from the auction, Irving said during Tuesday's meeting 
with minority and female executives.

<P>
 Since 1978, the FCC has given preference to seekers of broadcast licenses if 
minorities and women were to be among the owners and managers. Still, just 273 
of the nation's 9,870 radio stations are controlled by blacks, Latinos, Asian 
Americans or Native Americans, according to the Commerce Department, and just 
27 of the 1,151 television stations are controlled by minorities.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: FOREIGN STOCKS MAY BE POISED FOR GROWTH SPURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the world's emerging stock markets are bouncing back, after losing 20% 
or more of their value in recent months. Some Wall Streeters think it's time to 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Markets from Chile to Thailand to Turkey were red-hot last year as Americans 
were reawakened to the potential in foreign stocks, especially those of 
developing nations. Hong Kong shares, for example, rose 116% last year on 
average, Taiwan shares 80% and Mexican shares 48%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the avalanche of cash into those still-illiquid markets produced wild 
overvaluations in many stocks by year's end. Ripe for selling, emerging markets 
needed only a small push to fall off the cliff -- and they got that when the 
Federal Reserve Board began raising interest rates on Feb. 4, causing a ripple 
effect worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, the Fed's fourth rate hike of the year was the catalyst 
for a rally in many markets, rather than another decline. The reason: The Fed 
indicated that it's done tightening credit for now, removing the specter of a 
new surge in rates that could jeopardize global growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've seen is a 'sigh of relief' rally" in emerging markets, says Jay 
Pelosky, Latin America stock strategist at Morgan Stanley & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 2.7% so far this week, 
Mexico's Bolsa stock index has leaped 7.4%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is up 
5.3% over the past seven days. And Argentine stocks have advanced for six 
straight sessions, rising 2.8% on Thursday alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Some markets have been helped by more than the Fed. In Brazil, the Sao Paulo 
stock exchange index zoomed 12.1% on Thursday after the country's congress OKd 
the second phase of the government's economic reform plan, which is designed to 
end Brazil's crippling hyperinflation. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Mexico, the poor showing of the ruling party's chief rival in a 
presidential debate last week gave investors more reason to feel optimistic 
about the outcome of the August election. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in most emerging markets the problems dogging stocks this year have 
been largely political or technical, many Wall Streeters say. (Technical in the 
sense that heavy profit taking in illiquid stocks can depress prices more than 
is justified.) 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamentals of developing nations' economies, meanwhile, have generally 
remained healthy -- a function of the U.S. economy's strong expansion and the 
nascent recovery in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 If investors begin to focus once again on growth rather than interest rates, 
cash should continue to move back into emerging-market stocks, argues Dan 
Duane, head of Prudential's Pacific Growth fund. "The whole story from now on 
will be where the earnings momentum is," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Duane's favorite markets today is South Korea, which he figures will 
show real economic growth of 6% this year and corporate profit growth of 20% or 
better. The risk of war with the North notwithstanding, South Korea is fast 
supplanting Japan as a supplier of electronics and other manufactured goods to 
Europe, Duane says. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kalb, Latin stock specialist at Smith Barney Shearson, this week urged 
clients to jump back into Argentine stocks. With the threat of more Fed rate 
hikes removed at least for now, Kalb expects global investors to be drawn to 
Argentina's expected growth rate of 4.5% to 5% this year, low inflation and 
political stability. 
</P>
<P>
 But are emerging-market stocks cheap relative to earnings? The bulls say yes, 
but that depends on your idea of "cheap." In any case, it's at least true that 
the declines in many markets since January have produced more reasonable stock 
prices worldwide. You're more likely to be paying 15 to 20 times '94 earnings 
today than 20 to 25 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, playing one-country stock funds, or funds of specific regions, is 
probably best left to traders or to investors with high risk tolerance, because 
of the volatility in such narrowly focused investments. Most investors would 
probably be best off in a widely diversified global fund. 
</P>
<P>
 David Herro, manager of the Oakmark International stock fund, argues that the 
bigger risk today isn't overpaying for foreign stocks, but underestimating 
their long-term potential. "I think this is one of the great buying 
opportunities," he insists. As he travels the world, Herro says, he sees 
capitalism blooming all over. "People everywhere just want to go out and do 
something," he says. Third World Rebound

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: GOODYEAR TO ABANDON COMMISSIONS 
</P>

 Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. announced this week that it is eliminating 
commissions for its auto technicians effective June 1, similar to an action 
taken by Sears, Roebuck & Co. two years ago after California regulators accused 
it of selling consumers unneeded auto parts and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissions paid to auto mechanics have come under scrutiny since the state 
Department of Consumer Affairs raised questions about Sears' incentive program 
in its 1992 investigation of the company's auto repair centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state said commissions that Sears paid employees for selling specific 
parts may have led to overselling. Sears later settled the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodyear said it is changing compensation at its 900 centers nationwide to win 
the trust of consumers who in general seem to lack confidence in auto 
mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodyear spokesman Barry Berlin said the action had been under study and is 
not related to any specific incident. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a spokesman for the Minnesota attorney general's office said Goodyear 
agreed last December to change its business practices in that state and to pay 
the state $40,000 for consumer education to settle an investigation into 
possible abuse. No charges were filed, said Art Sasse, a spokesman for the 
attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sasse said the changes announced this week by Goodyear fall short of what it 
is now required to do in Minnesota as a result of the settlement. He said the 
settlement requires Goodyear to pay for arbitration for consumers who believe 
they received unneeded repairs. The settlement also requires Goodyear's auto 
technicians to tell consumers whether recommended repairs are routine 
maintenance or necessary to keep the vehicle running safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on Goodyear's action this week, Sasse said, "It's a good first 
step, but we think they could go farther."

<P>
 They have the power: The creator of the popular "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" 
children's television show is going after companies selling unlicensed 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Saban Entertainment says it is taking the action to protect consumers because 
unauthorized T-shirts fade and knockoff toys break. (It is also very likely 
that Saban is interested in protecting the value of the license to reproduce 
Power Ranger products.) 
</P>
<P>
 One action that might discourage counterfeiters would be increased 
availability of Power Ranger toys. The action figures are in short supply, even 
though manufacturer Bandai of America says it increased the number of factories 
producing them since last October to 13 from five. The company expects to bring 
yet another factory on line "any day now," a Bandai spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Saban plan to do with all the potentially defective merchandise it 
confiscates? 
</P>
<P>
 It says it plans to donate all items that "do not appear dangerous" to needy 
children in Eastern Europe, including Romania and Croatia.

 Hold the spinach: In its annual survey of consumer attitudes, the Food 
Marketing Institute, the supermarket industry trade group, found that 76% of 
grocery shoppers think the nutritional content of food is very important. Taste 
was considered very important by 90% of shoppers.

 Ira A. Korff has resigned as president and director of National Amusements 
Ltd., the Dedham, Mass.-based movie theater company controlled by his former

by the closely held company, which owns 850 movie screens and is the 
controlling shareholder of Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 Korff, 44, was divorced two years ago from Redstone's only daughter, Shari E. 
Redstone, who joined the executive ranks of National Amusements last year. 
Korff, a rabbi who holds a doctorate in international law, was the theater 
chain's chief operating officer for eight years and supervised its expansion in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone said Korff has a long-term consulting contract with National 
Amusements, and added: "Ira remains a member of my family and the father of my 
grandchildren. Neither his business nor personal relationship with me has been 
affected by the divorce." 
</P>

BELL ATLANTIC'S HIGH-TECH REWIRING TO COST $11 BILLION; COMMUNICATIONS: PHONE 
COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS WILL BE ON LINE TO RECEIVE MOVIES, INTERACTIVE GAMES AND 
OTHER SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joining scores of competitors gearing up to deploy advanced communications 
networks, Bell Atlantic Corp. on Thursday announced it will spend up to $11 
billion to rewire its phone lines to enable customers to receive movies, 
interactive games and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic, which thanks to a favorable court ruling is the only Bell 
telephone company with authority to offer video service, said that up to 1 
million of its customers in northern New Jersey, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, 
Baltimore, Washington and Virginia Beach, Va., will be hooked up to the network 
by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will be capable of two-way analog and digital transmission of 
phone, data and video signals. While the $11 billion does not represent a 
significant increase in what Bell Atlantic had already earmarked for capital 
spending, the announcement is the latest evidence that phone companies have 
renewed their intense push to build the costly networks that will 
electronically link homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how much demand there is for the fancy services the system would 
offer, but cable operators and telephone companies are committing billions to 
rewiring their networks. 
</P>
<P>
 BellSouth Corp., for example, said Thursday that it will spend up to $18 
billion over the next six years as part of its upgrade plans to install 
fiber-optic cable and digital switches capable of handling the simultaneous 
transmission of voice, video and data. And at the Federal Communications 
Commission, there are 17 outstanding applications from local phone companies to 
offer video programs to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic, which needs similar approval for its video plan, will probably 
have to wait several months for the FCC to review its application. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which won a federal court ruling in August to provide video 
programming in its own service area, has long sought to offer movies and other 
video fare. Last year, it pursued a merger with cable giant Tele-Communications 
Inc. until depressed stock prices led the parties to call off the deal. Phone 
companies view video services as more lucrative than ordinary phone service, 
whose growth has flattened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Bell Atlantic announcement is extremely significant," said George 
Kotelly, a fiber-optic analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that instead of deploying costly fiber-optic cable to consumers' front 
doors, most systems now propose using cheaper coaxial cable to take the signal 
from a local fiber-optic "node" to individual homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Atlantic has selected American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and tiny 
Broadband Technologies Corp. to help build the fiber-optic and coaxial network. 
General Instruments Corp. will build the TV set-top boxes needed to receive the 
new information services.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: HOPKINS JOINS OTHERS BEHIND CAMERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you do when you've become one of the most successful actors of your 
generation? If you're Anthony Hopkins, you follow the lead of Kevin Costner, 
Mel Gibson, Warren Beatty and others and move behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins made a brief swing through Cannes on Thursday to announce that he will 
direct and star in "August," which he describes as a "funny, sad, tragic love 
story." The $5.5-million movie, set in northern Wales, is being produced by two 
British companies, Majestic Films and Granada Film. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins said he's wanted to direct for years, but only recently found the type 
of story he was interested in telling -- a combination of two works by Anton 
Chekhov, "The Wood Demon" and "Uncle Vanya." 
</P>
<P>
 The Academy Award-winning actor called "getting the deal down on paper" the 
hardest part of the job so far. To help move things along, sources said, 
Hopkins agreed to work for "slightly less" than his usual acting fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "August" doesn't have an American distributor yet. With Hopkins behind and in 
front of the camera, however, that's not likely to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when making films is an increasingly costly venture, many actors 
have moved into directing and formed their own production companies to gain 
more control of the creative process. Hopkins plans to return to acting full 
time next year, but he says he also wants to keep his hand in directing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge for me is to prove to myself that I can do something creative 
without all the Sturm und Drang you see with some of the maniacs on these 
films," said the actor, who was too polite to name names. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting near poolside at the Carlton Hotel on a brilliantly sunny afternoon, 
where he somehow managed to avoid the kind of riot scene that envelopes most 
celebrities here, Hopkins said he would ultimately like to direct a big 
Hollywood movie. "I know it's going to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Cannes, you never die. You just come back with fresh hope and money. 
Director Peter Bogdanovich on Thursday became the latest Lazarus here when he 
announced the formation of a production company with philanthropist Laura Pels, 
who has committed to financing eight movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Pels/Peter Bogdanovich Pictures Corp. projects include "Protect and 
Defend," based on the political potboiler by Jack Valenti, president of the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America. Valenti, who will act as a technical adviser 
on the film, is said to have received $500,000 for the rights to the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the festival, director Roman Polanski took center stage in two 
incarnations. He starred in the festival's "A Simple Formality" and vigorously 
promoted the soon-to-be completed "Death and the Maiden," which is touted as 
his most commercial directorial work in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski said he wants to pick up the pace of his career, because "I have less 
and less time." One of the producers of "Death and the Maiden" is Thom Mount, a 
Hollywood veteran who has also been out of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging as the biggest comeback kid-in-waiting here is Mike Medavoy. The 
former TriStar Pictures chairman, who's expected to go into business with 
CineVisions chief Peter Hoffman, made no formal announcements, but he appeared 
at practically every major festival party and was said to be in deal talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the mother of all comebacks, the one staged by Menahem Golan and 
Yorum Globus, the former Cannon Pictures chiefs who split bitterly five years 
ago. This week, the Israeli cousins announced they're baaaaack.  
</P>
<P>
 Golan and Globus, who redefined the art of self-promotion and the role of 
independent producers at Cannes in the 1980s, have formed International Dynamic 
Pictures. "For five years there was a feeling of betrayal between us," Golan 
said. "But now we are on the verge of a new beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 IDP was started with $8 million from private investors. Golan said further 
financing is being raised through pre-selling rights to their productions. Time 
hasn't dulled the controversial cousins' promotional flare. Among the upcoming 
films touted in their brochure is "On Dangerous Ground," which contains the tag 
line "The Heidi Fleiss Scandal . . . Now, the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his bright yellow pants and busy tie, Lloyd Kaufman looks a lot like one of 
his films -- loud and a little over the top. But the chairman of Troma Inc. -- 
think of "The Toxic Avenger" and "Surf Nazis Must Die" -- has gained the 
respect of the industry by creating a loyal cult audience for his B-movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Troma, founded by Kaufman and Michael Herz after they graduated from Yale, is 
celebrating its 20th anniversary at this year's festival with new offerings 
such as "Sgt. Kabukiman, N.Y.P.D.," "Femme Fontaine, Killer Babe for the 
C.I.A." and even "Nathaniel Hawthorne's Young Goodman Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is part of an effort to create more serious fare. But at heart, 
Kaufman still resides primarily in the Roger Corman-Sam Arkoff universe of fast 
cars, fast guns and fast women. "I must give what I have to the moviegoing 
public," he said. "Unfortunately, I don't have that much to give." 
</P>
<P>
 Self-deprecating one-liners are stock and trade for the New York-based 
Kaufman, who spent a frantic lunch here greeting everyone from financiers to 
lifelong friends to waiters with the same unfettered enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Troma, which make movies in the $2-million range and under, has 150 titles in 
its library. Kaufman values them at $75 million to $80 million, but admits that 
his partner thinks that figure is too high.

 The ink is almost dry on a deal that would have the massively successful 
Russell Simmons-owned Def Jam record label moving from Sony to PolyGram. Under 
the agreement, PolyGram would distribute, market and promote the RAL/Def Jam 
roster, which includes such big-selling rap acts as LL Cool J, Public Enemy and 
Onyx. The first priority will be the album from newcomer Warren G., who already 
has a hit single from the "Above the Rim" soundtrack. Huge sales for that debut 
project are predicted.

U.S. EXPORTS TO MEXICO FLOURISH UNDER NAFTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Record growth in U.S. exports to Mexico during the first quarter of 1994 was a 
bright light in the U.S. Commerce Department's trade report issued Thursday -- 
and evidence that the North American Free Trade Agreement is living up to its 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
 The easing of tariffs that began when NAFTA took effect Jan. 1 helped boost 
U.S. exports to Mexico to $11.8 billion in the three months ended March 31 -- 
16% higher than the first quarter of 1993.It was the highest quarterly level of 
exports to Mexico ever recorded, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very positive," Lehman Bros. economist Lawrence Krohn said. "The 
whole purpose of NAFTA was to promote trade and exploitation of comparative 
advantage, and it looks like it's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of U.S.-made electrical machinery, paper, trucks and cereals led the 
increases. They were among the trade categories on which tariffs were either 
reduced or eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Under NAFTA, tariffs on most goods produced and traded within the 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade zone are being phased out over 15 years. But Assistant 
Secretary of Commerce Charles Meissner said NAFTA is already paying dividends, 
accounting for "over half of U.S. export growth and one-third of U.S. import 
growth" so far in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth in U.S. exports to Mexico also demonstrates the strength of the 
peso, which makes U.S. goods relatively inexpensive compared to domestically 
produced goods, said David M. Gould, a senior economist with the Federal 
Reserve Bank in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 First-quarter imports of Mexican goods and services grew to $11.3 billion, up 
22% from the same period in 1993, bolstering proponents' view that NAFTA is 
good policy for Mexico as well.

'JAFAR': NEW JOURNEYS TO PROFITLAND?; VIDEOS: INDUSTRY EXPERTS PREDICT DISNEY'S 
SEQUEL TO 'ALADDIN' WILL WIND UP AMONG THE ALL-TIME TOP SELLERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney has found a true diamond in the rough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Return of Jafar," the home-video sequel to "Aladdin," began selling in 
supermarkets and retail stores across the country Wednesday, and copies are 
flying off shelves faster than a magic carpet ride. "Jafar" moved 1.5 million 
cassettes in the first two days, out-pacing the early video sales of two recent 
Disney classic releases, "The Fox and the Hound" and "Pinocchio." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts predict that "Jafar," with a suggested retail price of 
$22.99, will eventually sell more than 10 million units to rank among the 10 
top-selling videos of all time. This is for a musical that was made for a song 
in Disney's TV animation division, did not have the benefit of being seen in 
movie theaters first and has been received coolly by critics (see review, on 
this page). 
</P>
<P>
 The ramifications for the home-video business could be enormous. Until now, 
the bulk of made-for-video products have been tawdry B-movies, bun-burning 
fitness tapes and cutesy children's fare -- and a top title sells 1 million 
units. Disney gambled when it shipped 8 million "Jafar" cassettes to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a colossal success," Ann Daly, president of Buena Vista Home 
Video, a Disney subsidiary, said Thursday. "After the first two days, to have 
sold through this many copies to consumers, to put it on a par with some of the 
Disney animated classics, suggests that (the studio's) first direct-to-video 
movie is a quality product and there's a market for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has already created a separate banner to serve this market, Walt Disney 
Home Video Presents, and in August will release "Muppet Classic Theater," an 
original, feature-length project from Jim Henson Productions. Sources say the 
company has two more animated home-video projects in story form -- another 
"Aladdin" installment and a sequel to Disney's big summer movie, "The Lion 
King." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is not alone. Later this year, MCA Home Video will bypass movie 
theaters with the direct-to-video movies "Darkman II," and after that "Darkman 
III," both sequels to the 1990 original starring Liam Neeson. And the Spelling 
Entertainment Group announced this week that its four-hour, $12-million 
miniseries "Texas," based on James Michener's best-selling novel and now 
filming in Del Rio, Tex., will premiere this fall on home video before airing 
on ABC next year. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disney, Daly said it was the success of the "Aladdin" franchise that "gave 
us the enthusiasm to launch this (direct-to-video) business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aladdin," the most successful animated film in movie history, has grossed 
$486 million worldwide in theaters. Disney's merchandising for "Aladdin" was 
greater than any previous Disney film, with a record 24 million videocassettes 
sold, a triple-platinum soundtrack album, 20 million story and activity books 
in print and a Sega Genesis video game with sales pushing 1 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, "Aladdin" reportedly has reaped $1 billion in revenue for Disney 
since its release in spring last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A feature-film sequel to "Aladdin" would have taken years to make, and 
Disney's last animated sequel, "The Rescuers Down Under," was not a big 
success. "Bringing 'Aladdin' back on home video allows us to bring it to the 
market much faster, while the characters are still hot and kids are still 
interested," Daly said. "It's the peak of the franchise, really." 
</P>
<P>
 For the fall, Disney has made 65 episodes of an animated children's TV series 
based on "Aladdin" for syndication and another 13 episodes for CBS. In a sense, 
the "Jafar" video acts as a segue from the feature film to the cartoon series 
by swinging over the parrot Iago -- Jafar's evil sidekick, voiced by Gilbert 
Gottfried -- to the good side.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In my experience, the word synergy is more than just a concept at the Walt 
Disney Co. It's actually an operating philosophy," Daly said. "When we as a 
company develop a creative property, there's a process in place that allows for 
participation by a variety of areas to help the idea along, or extend it in one 
way or another. 'The Return of Jafar' movie is a perfect example of that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney has also come under criticism for continuing to rub the "Aladdin" 
lamp so enthusiastically -- a tag line on the "Jafar" preview cassette sent to 
retailers reads: "The Story Continues . . . and So Do the Profits!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Little of that money (brought in by the "Aladdin" franchise) seems to have 
been invested in 'Jafar,' " complained a review of the video for Entertainment 
Weekly. And the Hollywood Reporter suggested that "Jafar" was actually 
developed as a TV movie -- there are several fade-to-blacks, a TV technique to 
lead into commercials -- and that home video was an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney does plan to broadcast "Jafar" in syndication later this year, but the 
project was always designed for home-video release, Daly responded. She also 
cautioned against comparing "Jafar" to "Aladdin" because they were made for 
different mediums. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real easy for people to pop in the 'Aladdin' tape and then this tape, 
and tear it down," concurred Tad Stones, co-producer and co-director of 
"Jafar." He said he now regrets the fade-to-blacks, which were creative choices 
for dramatic effect. "But we're not trying to say this is 'Aladdin' by any 
means. It's a fantastic piece of entertainment for direct-to-video." 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of production, "Jafar" falls somewhere between a TV program and a 
feature film. Sources put the budget of the 66-minute "Jafar" near $5 million 
-- more than the $500,000 Disney spends on an animated half-hour of television, 
but considerably less than the reported $30 million spent on "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the creative losses required by the reduced budget, producers say 
there are also creative gains when working on a direct-to-video project. A 
product can get to the marketplace quickly and inexpensively, and there are no 
rules or standards dictating what the project should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're producing for television, you have to be so aware of the amount 
of time you have so you can fit within commercial breaks," said Brian Henson, 
president of Jim Henson Productions. "Muppet Classic Theater" is a compilation 
of folk and fairy tales, shot on video rather than film to save money. "With 
features, you're locked into the accepted narrative structure. Video is an 
emerging medium that's getting stronger and stronger, but still doesn't have 
any audience expectations. They're open to anything coming on video." 
</P>
<P>
 The limits of the direct-to-video market will be tested this fall with the 
release of "Texas," a sweeping saga starring Maria Conchita Alonso, Patrick 
Duffy, Chelsea Field, Stacy Keach, David Keith, Rick Schroeder, Grant Show and 
Randy Travis, among others. Rather than sell the miniseries to consumers 
inexpensively, the producers will charge retailers a much higher price for them 
to rent it to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of faith this is going to work," said Glenn Ross, senior vice 
president of Republic Pictures, a division of Spelling. He plans to support 
"Texas" with the kind of home-video marketing plan reserved for major studio 
movies. "If the video retailers get behind it, this will make them a unique 
outlet for new product. They stop being an aftermarket, and they start becoming 
a primary market."

'BODIES OF EVIDENCE' VOICES PERSONAL PAIN AND HEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Writer-performer Carla Kirkwood is nothing if not intense. A quiet woman 
dressed in black, with dark hair framing a face that smiles gently but seldom 
laughs, she was in Los Angeles recently to talk about "Bodies of Evidence," a 
solo work she's performing at Highways this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego-based artist answered question after question for two hours 
without so much as a coffee break or a quip, never wavering from the matters at 
hand. It's as though she doesn't want you to lose sight of just how urgent and 
grave the issues of her art are. And you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkwood, 45, makes solo performances about incest and sexual violence -- 
topics much in the news these days -- yet she also uses these subjects to 
address the larger, inherent issues of abuse of power. "The question of incest 
is not only the question of an event," says Kirkwood. "It's also a political 
question in the way that it acts itself out in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkwood is someone for whom the feminist slogan "the personal is political" 
is gospel. "For myself, doing these works is not about survival anymore," she 
says. "I'm not interested in being a victim anymore. I don't care if I am a 
woman or from the working poor, I exercise power all the time and I'm going to 
accept the consequences of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she doesn't sacrifice the art to the agenda, says friend and sometime 
collaborator Deborah Small. "Carla's amazing quality is her incredible 
intensity as a performer. Audiences sometimes seem speechless after a 
performance, but then she compels them to talk about issues. She also has an 
incredible sense of humor and compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bodies of Evidence," directed by Sharon Taylor-Tidwell, mixes fiction and 
autobiographical experience to tell the story of a young girl's experiences of 
abuse. In the piece, the line is blurred between what Kirkwood personally has 
experienced and what her protagonist says and does. Reviewers may think they 
know what's real and what's not -- one critic wrote that she "had not a shred 
of doubt that every graphic word was true" -- but Kirkwood declines to say how 
much is fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, even if it's only half of the tale "Bodies of Evidence" tells, was 
bad enough. Born into a military family in San Diego, Kirkwood lived through a 
childhood she says was marked by sexual abuse and domestic violence. "Even in 
the middle of these experiences, I was not this little meek kid," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have this picture of children with big eyes filled with tears who have 
been sexually abused, but I was resisting in many ways. Once in a while, I 
grabbed my father off my mother when they fought. It was important for me to 
know that I exercised power." 
</P>
<P>
 Institutionalized in a home for runaway and abused children during the 1960s, 
the then-teen-age Kirkwood was fortunate enough to have had what she describes 
as "some really progressive thinkers" as her therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't immediately look up, though, once Kirkwood left the institution. 
"Up until I was about 20, things were pretty severe in my life," she says. 
"Lots of physical brutality, poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kirkwood boot-strapped her way out of adversity. As a student at San Diego 
State in 1969, she lobbied for and helped found one of the first Women's 
Studies programs in the country. She also worked as a trade union activist from 
1974 to 1980. But the political climate made activism increasingly difficult. 
"I was doing trade union work when the Left in the U.S. fell apart in 1980," 
says Kirkwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the theater beckoned. From 1982 to 1984, Kirkwood studied abroad as 
the first American student in the Central Drama Academy in Beijing. After that, 
she continued her graduate education, receiving her master of fine arts degree 
from the University of Leeds, England, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she drew upon autobiographical material for her 1982 performance 
"Your Mama Your Sister and Your Girlfriend," Kirkwood didn't openly use her own 
experiences and the first-person voice until 1992's "MWI -- Many Women 
Involved." That work was originally performed as part of a San Diego public art 
project, "NHI -- No Humans Involved," focusing on the then-unsolved murders of 
45 San Diego women. In her piece, Kirkwood told of two female cousins, one who 
becomes a feminist and the other a prostitute and drug addict. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'MWI' and 'Bodies of Evidence' are the first times where I've publicly come 
out around this particular issue (of my history of abuse) in my art," says 
Kirkwood. "I did it because I found myself wanting to bury the issue again." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkwood, who currently serves on the faculty of San Diego's Southwestern 
College but will soon be taking leave to teach at Smith College, has won three 
Emmys for her writing and directing projects for San Diego's PBS affiliate, 
KPBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kirkwood's teaching and writing are marked by a repeated questioning of 
both her own motives and the social contexts in which they're played out. "I 
understood why I wanted to resist institutions like the family and the State, 
but I didn't think there was anything in me that was like them," she says. "I 
had a lot of rage, but I didn't accept responsibility for it because I was a 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, says Kirkwood, is that society tends to preserve the 
institution at the expense of the individual. "In this culture, there's this 
structure that we preserve -- not what the structure does to people, but the 
structure itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families can't actually survive this kind of examination," Kirkwood 
continues. "Often, in revealing abuse, we end up having to betray the family. 
That's one of the reasons we don't like to do it. I don't have a blood family 
anymore because of this."

MOVIE REVIEW; WESTERN JOKES FOR CITY FOLKS; 'MAVERICK' SHOOTS FOR THE HIP -- A 
BIT TOO MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Maverick" is smart-alecky without being very smart. It's full of spoofy, 
har-dee-har-har ribaldries -- this film practically winks at you. As 
sophisticated Western comedies go, it's somewhere between "Butch Cassidy and 
the Sundance Kid" and "The Apple Dumpling Gang." Crammed with such big-name 
crowd-pleasers as Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, "Maverick" reaches 
for that Feel Good feeling. It settles for Feel OK. 
</P>
<P>
 The most damning criticism ever leveled against "Butch Cassidy" -- like 
"Maverick" scripted by William Goldman -- is that it was a "Beverly Hills 
Western." This also describes "Maverick." It's proudly inauthentic, twinkling 
with high-gloss production values that make even the dust look like something 
you'd buy at Bijan. Watching it is like taking in a deluxe window display of 
hand-me-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maverick, who spends most of the movie trying to con his way into a 
high-stakes poker game, Gibson is still in his hyperhectic mode from the 
"Lethal Weapon" films -- perhaps because Richard Donner is once again the 
director. Gibson tumbles and scampers and issues double- and triple-takes to 
everything from riverboat gamblers to rattlesnakes. He's ingratiatingly and, 
finally, exhaustingly, goofy. He seems to be simultaneously impersonating the 
Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors form-fitted for heroism often go a little blooey when they're 
encouraged to act comically anti-heroic; they bounce off the audience's 
expectations of glamour. Gibson manages to look glamorous anyway in "Maverick," 
and that's part of the joke -- just as it was with Paul Newman and Robert 
Redford in "Butch Cassidy." But it's not the most ample of jokes. Gibson, for 
all his handsomeness and hearty frivolity, is playing down to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Maverick is a role to be played with the gravity of a Geronimo. James 
Garner's Bret Maverick on the original ABC-TV show, which ran from 1957 to 
1962, was already pretty sporty and flip. So was the series. (A memorable 
parody of "Bonanza" featured Jim Backus as the baron of the Subrosa cattle 
ranch, with sons Moose, Henry and Small Paul.) Garner is in the new movie as 
lawman Zane (Coop) Cooper, and he gives the film a pedigree -- and some class. 
(Garner walked out on the series in 1960, two years before its demise, so his 
appearance here is a double-edged "tribute.") In this whirligig of 
off-the-shelf gags and celebrity clowning, Garner's wry harrumphiness goes a 
long way. 
</P>
<P>
 Jodie Foster is playing Annabelle Bransford, a siren who spends the entire 
movie trying to out-con Maverick. She's the kind of woman who bats goo-goo eyes 
at her man while she lifts his wallet. Now how often have you seen that gag 
before? Foster tries to ventilate the tiresomeness by letting us know she's too 
smart to be playing someone this smart-dumb. Her performance has an 
only-kidding coyness that's entirely in keeping with the entire movie -- alas. 
It's integrity of a sort. Foster knows what kind of movie this is, and she at 
least has the courage of her own inauthenticity. What else can she do when 
she's required to play a character who keeps misstating Maverick's name? She 
repeatedly calls him Burt instead of Bret -- har har. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiredness of the jokes in "Maverick" is supposed to be terminally hip. 
We're supposed to enjoy our familiarity with all the cliches. For people who 
enjoy having their junk memories jogged -- and coddled -- this kiddie 
connoisseurship can pass for a good time. When Maverick puts his ear to the 
ground as if to listen for distant hoofbeats and then lays down for a nap, we 
can see the gag coming a mile away, just as we can anticipate the shenanigans 
at the gaming tables and the horsing around with a tribal chief (Graham Greene) 
who dresses Maverick up as a bespangled Native American. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman and Donner don't draw on Western traditions in order to tweak them 
into new life; they're having too much fun giggling over the corpses of old 
routines. Their uninspiration has above-it-all airs. They showcase a rogue's 
gallery of familiar faces from old Westerns and from the country-Western music 
world, ranging from the glorious Dub Taylor to Denver Pyle and Waylon Jennings, 
but that's all these people remain: faces. (James Coburn fills out smartly a 
somewhat larger role as the ringleader of the poker championship.) The 
filmmakers have no feeling for the traditions they're sending up, and the lack 
gives "Maverick" a hollow facetiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Maverick the high-stakes gambler is proud of being spineless. He's fast on the 
draw, but he always opts to run from a fight. In a way, he's the perfect 
protagonist for this high-stakes film, which also flaunts its flimsiness.

 King of Late Night: Neither Dave nor Jay is winning this week's ratings race. 
Ted Koppel has taken the lead, with an especially big margin in New York, which 
is home to all three men this week as they duke it out for those all-important 
ratings sweeps. In early numbers for the nation's top 31 markets, Koppel won 
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights, with the highest margin on Tuesday when 
he drew viewers in more than 3.7 million homes, compared to Letterman's 2.9 
million homes and Leno's 2.3 million homes. But the gap narrowed considerably 
on Wednesday, when the numbers were 3.1 million households for Koppel, 3.0 
million for Letterman and 2.9 million for Leno. In New York, where Leno is 
visiting in an attempt to win a bigger share of the crucial market, Koppel drew 
709,394 viewing homes on Tuesday, compared to Letterman's 374,774 and Leno's 
240,926. On Wednesday, Koppel averaged 522,007 New York viewing homes, 
Letterman drew 441,698 and Leno attracted 401,544.

 Execution Broadcast Denied: The North Carolina Supreme Court has refused to 
let Phil Donahue televise the June 15 execution of convicted murderer David 
Lawson, who claims he suffers from severe depression. Lawson and Donahue had 
said that broadcasting the execution would draw attention to depression and its 
consequences and that the public deserves more information about capital 
punishment. The court held, however, that neither the state nor the U.S. 
Constitution gives Donahue or the condemned man the right to videotape the 
execution. Donahue's attorney said he will ask the court to reconsider. RADIO

 Listeners Speak: KTWV-FM (94.7 "The Wave") returns to its all-music morning 
show today, dropping "The Keri and Sheryl Show" in response to listeners'

station said was an attempt to be innovative. But about 2,000 listeners have 
since called the station to say they preferred music.

 Educational Competitors: KUSC-FM (91.5) has joined with the national 
Learningsmith educational store chain, whose local outlets (at the Beverly 
Center and Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza) will now be called KUSC 
Learningsmith: A General Store for the Curious Mind. The Learningsmith chain is 
operated by Boston's public TV station WGBH, and is a direct competitor of the 
Store of Knowledge that Los Angeles' public TV station, KCET Channel 28, opened 
at the Glendale Galleria in April. KUSC-FM, a classical music and fine arts

makes his widow, Courtney Love, and the couple's 21-month-old daughter, Frances 
Bean Cobain, sole heirs to the estate. STAGE

MOVIE REVIEW; 'EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES' IS ALL THUMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many films that arrive on screen more dead than alive, writer-director 
Gus Van Sant's version of Tom Robbins' "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" contains 
its own built-in epitaph. "Playfulness ceases to have a serious purpose when it 
takes itself too seriously," someone says, a theory this unfortunate movie goes 
way out of its way to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Robbins' original novel, which followed the exploits, hitchhiking 
and otherwise, of Sissy Hankshaw and her oversized thumbs, was playful to the 
point of suffocating cutesyness. Whatever charges can be made against a book 
that comes up with a philosophy of "Ha Ha . . . Hoo Hoo . . . Hee Hee" and 
dialogue like "You can tune a guitar but you can't tuna fish," excessive 
seriousness is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though millions apparently found this sort of thing appealing, that doesn't 
ensure that its gossamer spirit would benefit by or even survive the 
translation to flesh-and-blood reality that turning words into film makes 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if Robbins' book could possibly have been made into a successful 
picture, getting Van Sant to do it, the ideal hipster-meets-hipster combination 
though it must have seemed at the time, has turned out to be a recipe for a 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 For what Robbins' smug whimsy doesn't need is a dose of Van Sant's deadpan 
aesthetic of knowing, way hip boredom. Though the director's sensibility worked 
extraordinarily well when applied to hard-edged subject matter like "Drugstore 
Cowboy" and even "My Own Private Idaho," combining it with Robbins' flimsy 
jokiness has resulted in a film whose tedium is painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Postponed for six months of tinkering after lackluster screenings at last 
fall's Toronto Film Festival, "Cowgirls" stars Uma Thurman as Sissy, the proud 
possessor of thumbs the size of Hebrew National kosher hot dogs. A former model 
for the Yoni-Yum line of feminine hygiene products, Sissy finds that her true 
calling is the open road. Nothing that moves, up to and including airplanes, 
can resist those thumbs, a situation that causes Sissy to declaim, in a 
typically leaden monologue, "I have the rhythms of the universe inside me. I am 
in a state of grace." 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from Yoni-Yum magnate the Countess (John Hurt), one of Robbins' 
androgynous characters, brings Sissy to New York City, where she resists the 
notion of riding in a taxi and paying for transportation and has an abortive 
date with artist Julian Gitche (Keanu Reeves) and his decadent friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's off to the Countess' Rubber Rose Ranch way out West to film yet 
another commercial, this one inspired by the flock of whooping cranes who stop 
off there. Also in the neighborhood is the Chink (Noriyuki "Pat" Morita), an 
enigmatic spiritual leader without portfolio, and the ranch's assorted lesbian 
cowgirls, led by the whip-cracking Delores Del Ruby (Lorraine Bracco) and the 
equally boisterous Bonanza Jellybean (Rain Phoenix, River's sister), who can't 
help falling in love with Sissy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because both the Robbins novel and Van Sant himself are such pillars of 
trendiness, any number of celebrated folks ended up with bit parts in the film, 
including a brief but puzzling glimpse of William Burroughs, a particular 
favorite of the director's. Former Merry Pranksters Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs 
play Sissy's relatives, Roseanne Arnold is a fortuneteller named Madame Zoe and 
Buck Henry plays an aphorism-spouting surgeon, all to not much effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is possible to pin various philosophical labels on "Cowgirls," 
loaded as it is with undeveloped notions about feminism and individuality, 
nothing about it is really memorable except the appealing musicality of the 
fine k.d. lang/Ben Mink score, which deserves better. So do those poor whooping 
cranes, who look great in their close-ups but would have been wise to follow 
Sissy's motto: "When in doubt, keep moving." It's that kind of film. 
</P>
<P>

some raunchy talk, brief nudity and awkwardly simulated sex.

ART REVIEW; AN EXERCISE IN EXTREMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Martinez-Canas' photo-based images are technically impressive but 
conceptually thin. In eye-grabbing combinations that snap with crisp, visual 
energy, her unique, black-and-white prints at Iturralde Gallery fuse abstract, 
surrealistic figures with common travel photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the 33-year-old, Cuban-born, U.S.-educated and Miami-based 
artist's otherwise promising work is that it puts forth a formulaic, rather 
conservative version of social identity. Her large images look like 
flattened-out compositions based on the paintings of Wifredo Lam. 
Martinez-Canas has eliminated the middle ranges, keyed up contrasts and 
sharpened the spiky forms for which the Cuban Modernist is famous. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also filled in selected figures and fields with snapshots of Spanish 
cities, the canals of Venice and pre-Columbian ruins. Most important, she has 
invented a clever process of cutting and making collages of negatives, then 
printing the mysteriously seamless results on single sheets of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez-Canas' use of Lam's spindly, totemic figures gives her images some 
art historical authority and identifies her work as Cuban. But this insistent 
nationalism denies Lam's own international aspirations and detracts from 
Martinez-Canas' technical virtuosity, undermining her powerfully inventive use 
of photographic processes.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SWORDSMAN 3': MARTIAL ARTS AND HEART BOTH PLAY A ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tsui Hark's spectacular and fanciful production of "The East Is Red: Swordsman 
3," a dazzling yet poignant martial-arts period fantasy, takes up where the 
last installment left off. In "Swordsman 2," a cautionary tale about absolute 
power corrupting absolutely, an ambitious member of the monastic Sun Moon sect 
of Chinese Highlanders steals its magic sacred scrolls and decides that his 
lust for power will be more easily realized if, through the scrolls' magic, he 
gradually evolves into a fierce female warrior called Asia the Invincible. 
(This explains why throughout "The East Is Red" the deadly but gorgeous 
Brigitte Lin as Asia is always referred to as a male.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset of the new film Asia is believed to be dead, but the virile 
young Naval Officer Koo (Yu Rong-guang) suspects the demon lurks in the ruins 
of the Sun Moon monastery, where he persuades her to destroy those who are 
claiming that they are in fact Asia the Invincible at the expense of innocent 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The stylish, slyly amusing "The East Is Red" is charged with both sexual 
ambiguity and a hostility toward the Ming Dynasty's oppression of the 
Highlanders and also toward greedy Dutch explorers and Japanese ninja sailors, 
who arrive in a quaint submarine to do battle with a Sun Moon junk under the 
captaincy of the beautiful Snow (Joey Wong), whose entire crew are her lovers. 
Amid much swordplay, elaborate kung-foolery and a complicated plot, Koo falls 
for Snow who in turn is so enamored of the cruel and capricious but ultimately 
lonely Asia that she's ready to die for her in an instant.  
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, Koo and Asia square away in what can be simultaneously regarded as 
an epic battle of the sexes and a man taking on an intrinsically male demon. 
Either way -- or both -- "The East Is Red," which was directed vigorously by 
Ching Siu-tung and Raymond Lee, is lots of fun for Hong Kong martial arts fans.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; THERE'S MORE TO ROSTI THAN POLLO

<P>
 The first person I bring to Rosti takes one look at the toasty brown grilled 
chicken and roasted potatoes in the deli case and announces, "I want that." 
</P>
<P>
 The next person I bring to Rosti -- same thing. "I'll have the chicken," he 
says, then goes sullen when I suggest we try other food. A third person I nudge 
directly to a table without so much as a glimpse into the deli case -- to no 
avail. My friend points to the next table: chicken. "I'll get that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The pollo al mattone con patate , a grilled pounded half chicken scented with 
rosemary is as good as it looks: The meat is juicy, the skin sticky-crisp; the 
slow-roasted potatoes may be oily, but they're wonderful, even the next day, 
eaten cold. This is not a meal you want to eat every night of the week on your 
low-fat diet, but once or twice a week might promote happiness.

 In the end, the only way I can get any of my dining companions even to look at 
a menu is to order a plate of the pollo for the table. As bribes go, it's not 
expensive: $6.95; add spinach, a dollar more.  
</P>
<P>
 Rosti Rosticceria Toscana has sold Tuscan takeout cooking for more than three 
years now. While there have always been a few tables, recent renovation has 
enlarged the dining area and added a bakery, which serves coffee and pastries 
starting at 7 a.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
 With sparkling white tiles, inset lighting and shelves of Italian cookies, 
coffee, pasta and oil, Rosti has the look of a gourmet shop-cum-scullery -- 
Williams Sonoma with a kitchen. Hanks of chili and garlic and huge Parma hams 
hang on the south wall. The new floor is handsome wheat-colored stone, the 
tables wood, the wooden chairs green with woven straw seats. A sidewalk patio 
is shaded with cheerful red umbrellas and heated at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd is local, neighborly, a mix of pizza-fed young men, couples of all 
ages, families with children. People seem to know one another; those waiting 
for takeout orders schmooze with friends. Waiters and waitresses are young and 
well-meaning, but not particularly skilled; they routinely forget bread and 
beverages, and refills of anything are beyond their scope. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early morning, the juice is fresh, the lattes strong, if small and too 
foamy. The decision among brioche, croissants and Danish is unimportant; 
they're all good, not great. I'd be perfectly happy there reading the paper if 
the radio weren't so loud and buzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch and takeout starts at 11 a.m. and continues until 10 p.m. A well-devised 
menu is augmented by a dozen daily specials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The antipasti selection is small and fresh. I tried satisfactorily roasted red 
peppers with capers, a dense eggplant caponata , and found the flaked tuna in 
cannellini beans quite agreeable -- but then, I love cannellini beans. Maybe 
that's why I also cottoned to zuppa alla Toscana , a pleasantly bland vegetable 
soup thickened with cannellini. 
</P>
<P>
 With its medium-thick chewy-enough crust, the pizza Margherita (topped with 
plain cheese, tomato sauce and a few fresh basil leaves), is serviceable. 
Pepperoni pizza, the Margherita minus basil plus spicy pepperoni, is feistier 
-- and greasier. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigatoni gratinati is a heavenly high-end macaroni-and-cheese -- big tube 
pasta, cream and chewy chunks of prosciutto baked until the top is browned and 
bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravioli are notably plump here, and thin-skinned; the spinach-and-ricotta 
filling is so fresh, the spinach is still a startling green when I cut the 
ravioli open, and I loved their subtle sauce (on special one night) of cream 
and enticing bitter radicchio. 
</P>
<P>
 The seafood risotto -- chock-full of rock shrimp, fresh clams and calamari -- 
would rule if it had just a tad less butter and salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert involves a short hike to the counter and another tricky decision: a 
good, dense creme brulee with berries or a decent berry tart or a perfect 
tiramisu with fluffy, barely sweetened cheese the perfect counterpoint to the 
espresso-swollen ladyfingers. If you're having post-fat intake remorse after 
the pollo or baked rigatoni, there are fresh berries and melon. 
</P>

VETERAN ACTOR TRINTIGNANT'S TALK OF THE TOWN; CANNES REPORT: THE FRENCH STAR IS 
SHOWCASED IN TWO FILMS, 'THREE COLORS: RED' AND 'REGARDE LES HOMMES TOMBER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although its imperturbable director insists that it realizes only 35% of his 
intentions (as opposed to 30% for the rest of his films), Krzysztof 
Kieslowski's "Three Colors: Red" looks to be the surest bet to win at least one 
Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, if not for film or director then at 
least for best actor for French veteran Jean-Louis Trintignant. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Trintignant, the role of a misanthropic judge whose life changes when 
a young model (Irene Jacob) runs over his dog, was challenging "only in the 
technical sense; I never had a problem understanding my role or understanding 
the story." With his other film at Cannes, "Regarde Les Hommes Tomber" ("See 
How They Fall"), a mesmerizing film noir that opened the Critic's Week section, 
the story was entirely different. 
</P>
<P>
 For though he has starred in more than 100 films, including Claude Lelouch's 
"A Man and a Woman," Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Conformist" and Eric Rohmer's 
"My Night at Maude's," Trintignant admits that he's never had a part anything 
like the surly, violent conman named Marx in director Jacques Audiard's debut 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking through a translator, Trintignant acknowledged that Kieslowski was "a 
director with very precise ideas, much more demanding. With certain moments, 
even with the rhythms of speech, which Kieslowski wanted faster than my 
Southern manner, he knows exactly what he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Regarde," however, "the challenges were of a psychological order. I 
found the character much harder to understand, and I was very frightened during 
the filming. I was worried I would not be able to act the person, that I 
wouldn't be realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all the more difficult because I'm quite well known in a certain way, 
and I was afraid I wouldn't be believable, that the audience wouldn't be able 
to forget that they're watching an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 However with "Regarde" a hot ticket for French audiences here (it has yet to 
find an American distributor), Trintignant has relaxed. "I've seen the film. I 
think it is a good film and that I've given a good performance," he says 
quietly. "Now I'm not worried." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, my name is Paul," says P.J. Hogan, the writer and director of 
"Muriel's Wedding." Unfortunately because in Australia, "Crocodile Dundee" made 
another Paul Hogan into a kind of national symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too stubborn to change it," says this Hogan, smiling. "But I tell 
everyone I'm his love child. Maybe he'll believe it and leave me some money. 
Anyway, I believe we can coexist in the film world. We'll have to." 
</P>
<P>
 After the tumultuous reception "Muriel's Wedding" has received at Cannes, 
Hogan will no longer have to worry about the confusion. An uproarious tale of 
an ugly duckling who is fixated past the point of sanity on getting married, 
"Wedding" is the comic crowd-pleaser of the festival so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in life's outsiders, and it was liberating to put someone as 
gauche as Muriel, who wears a fake leopard-skin dress to a wedding, on screen," 
Hogan says. But because "actresses are so devoted to perfection in look," until 
he met the fearless Toni Collette, "I couldn't give this part away." 
</P>
<P>
 If being confused with the other Paul weren't enough, Hogan is married to 
director Jocelyn Moorhouse, whose "Proof" was one of the most impressive of 
recent Australian films and who served as co-producer on "Muriel." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jocelyn says that I bring out her humor and she brings out my eccentricity," 
Hogan says. "Before she met me, she used to make very Bergmanesque short films, 
uncontaminated by humor of any sort. And though I'm drawn to comedy, she's 
gotten me to go deeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Deeper for "Muriel" means a dark edge to the proceedings that Hogan says he 
had to fight to keep. "I abhor sentimentality," he says decisively. "There's 
nothing worse than a film that comes up and licks you." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some films, perfect gems though they are, have a hard time making it out of 
film festivals, and the Polish "Wrony" ("Crows") may be one of them. Only 66 
minutes and made for a big sounding but really tiny budget of 6 million zloty 
(approximately $300,000), it is a beautifully assured, poetic look at a day in 
the life of two small girls in the Polish city of Torun. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Copernicus' birthplace," volunteers writer-director Dorota 
Kedzierzawska through a translator. Age 36 and herself the daughter of a female 
director, Kedzierzawska first began writing "Wrony" because "I wanted to do 
something with my daughter so I wouldn't miss her while I was away shooting. 
But before the money could be found, she was old enough that she didn't want to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 To find "Wrony's" leads, Kedzierzawska looked at more than 2,000 children, and 
then found that the two selected wanted to leave the picture within a week. The 
two charming girls selected ended up being found on very short notice and the 
director, whose second film about children this is, says dealing with them "is 
easier for me than working with some adults. They are more open, more direct, 
though you have to be very patient." 
</P>
<P>
 And what does Kedzierzawska's mother the director think about "Wrony"? "She 
loves it," comes the bashful answer.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One of the most fascinating characters in Kayo Hatta's "Picture Bride," the 
evocative story of the trials of a Japanese mail-order wife in 1918 Hawaii, is 
that of the benshi , a traveling narrator who would supply the verbal 
accompaniment to silent films. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were often a bigger attraction than the on-screen people," says Hatta, a 
graduate of UCLA's film school. "Kurosawa's brother was a benshi , and when the 
silent era ended, he committed suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it seemed like "a total fantasy," Hatta's first choice to play the 
benshi was legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune. And though he didn't reply 
to her letter for five months, Mifune, who has ties to Hawaii, agreed to take 
the part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was initially intimidated, thinking, 'What am I doing directing Mifune in 
my first film?' " Hatta remembers. "But he wasn't gruff and unapproachable at 
all. He would really listen carefully, even furrowing his eyebrows. And if he 
couldn't remember his lines, he would knock himself on the head and say, 'Oh, 
I'm getting old.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One of Hatta's most memorable Mifune moments came even before the shooting 
began. "He had had Tojo, the big Japanese studio, make him a costume 
appropriate for a benshi , and he called us to his hotel room to see it. Mifune 
is a very precise man, he held up each garment and explained how it was cut, 
how it was worn, how it was supposed to hang. The whole presentation must have 
taken about an hour. He turned it into a ceremony."

JAZZ NOTES: PIANIST DANILO PEREZ TAKES AN AMBITIOUS 'JOURNEY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danilo Perez has no qualms about wading right into an artistic challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On "The Journey," the 27-year-old Panamanian pianist's second Novus Records 
album, he tackles no smaller a subject than the story of African slaves brought 
to South -- and eventually North -- America. 
</P>
<P>
 With instrumental portraits that range from seething to soothing, Perez 
recounts the slaves' departure from Africa, their integration into the 
societies of the Americas and their ultimate liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez wrote his pieces based on stories he devised from his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the music to give the message that slavery was terrible, but also 
that we must learn to respect other people so that people of all races can go 
out and build the best world we can," says Perez, speaking from Panama, where 
he was participating in the national elections, supporting upstart Ruben Blades 
in his unsuccessful bid to become that country's president. 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist plays Tuesday through May 29 at Catalina Bar & Grill, leading his 
quartet with Larry Schneider on sax, Larry Grenadier on bass and Ignacio Berroa 
on drums (Berroa will be replaced on May 28 only by Terri Lyne Carrington). He 
says the band represents not only musicality, but social consciousness. In this 
direction, he was inspired by Dizzy Gillespie, with whom Perez worked in the 
late '80s and early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most alluring facets of "The Journey" is that there are several 
pieces, among them "The Captive," that start out as Latin or African in 
rhythmic nature and then go into hearty jazz, 4/4 swing. "Diz was the one who 
started to do this," he says. "I like it when you can't tell if it's a Latin 
piece, or a swing piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (213) 466-2260. 
</P>
<P>
 Revival in Monterey: After many years of creative doldrums, this year's 
Monterey Jazz Festival, Sept. 16-18 on the Monterey county fairgrounds, offers 
the kind of musically rich and diverse lineup that marked the festival's 
halcyon days in the late '50s and early '60s, when the late founder-producer 
Jimmy Lyons was at his best. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is headlined by artists such as Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, 
Shirley Horn and Ornette Coleman. A tribute to bassist Ray Brown includes 
guests J. J. Johnson and Milt Jackson, and the West Coast premiere of Max 
Roach's 12-piece percussion ensemble, M'Boom. A new work for jazz trio and 
23-piece string/brass ensemble that was commissioned by the festival will also 
be performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my cues from old programs in scheduling this year's festival," says 
Tim Jackson, now in his second year as Monterey's producer and musical 
director. "A lot of incredible stuff used to happen here. The commission thing 
is a natural, and I'm hoping to do that on an annual basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the program: Grover Washington Jr., the Contemporary Keyboard 
Ensemble, the Bob Mintzer big band and Etta James.  
</P>
<P>

single-event tickets may be available at the gate.

MUSIC REVIEW; ST.CLAIR VENTURES MASSIVE MAHLER IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bigger isn't necessarily better. Sometimes bigger is just bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But bigger was terrific Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, and poignant too, when Carl St.Clair led the Pacific Symphony 
Orchestra, the Pacific Chorale and two operatic soloists through the mighty, 
massive, mystical, spiritual, folksy, poetic, gut-thumping convolutions of 
Mahler's Second Symphony, a.k.a. "Resurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every local man, woman and child who could hold an instrument or 
sing a scale was called into service. The orchestra enlisted 103 players, and 
it could have used a few more. The chorus numbered 146. 
</P>
<P>
 The PSO hadn't attempted anything so grand since Keith Clark -- remember Keith 
Clark? -- rushed in to tread over Schoenberg's "Gurrelieder" back in 1988. The 
founder of the orchestra, ambitious literally to a fault, had ventured the 
Mahler Second a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair, who was climbing this symphonic Everest for the first time, could 
have settled for a superficial success. Mahler ensured an ultimate ovation for 
any maestro who can sustain the 90-minute endurance test, keep the unwieldy 
performing apparatus more or less on track and make an uplifting noise in the 
zonking finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Enlightened conductors, however, do much more. They seek out the inner voices. 
They give the sentiment plenty of breathing space, even in the face of linear 
sprawl. They paint with dynamic light and shade. They sustain tension by 
avoiding too much stress on isolated wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be an exaggeration to claim that St.Clair's initial effort placed him 
instantly in the pantheon of Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer and Leonard 
Bernstein. Some details got blurred on Wednesday. Pianissimos tended to receive 
a bit less attention than fortissimos. The ultimate, cumulative climaxes may 
not have been perfectly calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 But. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing went seriously wrong, and much went emphatically right. Refinement and 
refocusing will no doubt come with repetition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his relative youth, St.Clair certainly did not offer what one would 
call a brash young man's Mahler. His interpretation was marked with maturity at 
every mellow turn. 
</P>
<P>
 He established the tragic drama at the first portentous outburst, but never 
suggested cheap theatrics. He sustained the bucolic charm of the andante slowly 
and gently, without succumbing to bathos. He churned out the quirky imagery of 
the third movement -- St. Anthony's sermon to the fish -- without permitting 
the grotesquerie favored by a few famous colleagues. In the "Urlicht" and 
concluding scherzo, he found a sensitive balance between introspection and 
cataclysm. 
</P>
<P>
 Legs spread, swaying torso bent forward, the conductor occasionally resorted 
to his familiar snake-dance mannerisms. Even then, however, his histrionic 
attitudes seemed directed at the players, not the audience. That cannot be said 
for the celebrated Mahlerians who regard the inherent pathos as an excuse for 
self-indulgent histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Symphony responded to St.Clair's enlightened urgings with splendid 
power, ample flexibility and more accuracy than one had a right to expect under 
the circumstances. Stephanie Sant'Ambrogio, a celebrated chamber-music 
specialist and first chair at the Akron Symphony, served impressively in her 
apparent audition as concertmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Chorale, presumably trained by John Alexander, began its momentous 
task with a perfectly gauged, resonant whisper in the Klopstock ode, 
"Auferstehn." As the movement evolved, the choir rose with equal poise to the 
composer's demands for ethereal purity and elemental force. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Lerner, rather generously heralded by the local publicity machine as a 
"Metropolitan Opera star," sang the mezzo-soprano solos with pallid competence. 
Christina Cox sounded properly sweet as she floated the few ascending phrases 
allotted the soprano. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience managed to resist mood-shattering applause between movements, for 
once, but mustered an ovation at the end. For once, it was deserved.

THEATER BEAT: FANTASY, NIGHTMARE MIX IN 'RIFFS & CREDOS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.M. Barrie called death "an awfully big adventure." In "Riffs & Credos" at 
Playwrights' Arena, Gene, a Catholic priest dying of AIDS, is embarked on the 
ultimate Outward Bound trip. Deep in a coma, he drifts in a hallucinatory 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene doesn't question the concept of a hereafter. It's just that he hasn't 
quite figured out whether he's climbing Jacob's ladder or descending Joseph's 
well. Despite all his agonized prayers and musings, he's lost due North. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Salamone's "Riffs & Credos" is the stuff of fantasy and nightmare. A 
sequel to his earlier work, "All Soul's Day," the play is a vividly dramatic 
re-creation of one man's final moments. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest, Gene (Steve Tschudy), a practicing homosexual until the time of 
his ordination, has stringently kept his priestly vow of celibacy, but the cost 
to his psyche -- not to mention his friends -- has been dear. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene's former lover Sunny (Salamone), himself an AIDS sufferer, is a tenacious 
disbeliever who remains defiantly carnal as he faces his own end. Val (Jon 
Powell), Gene's sometime lover turned platonic companion, is as repressed as he 
is cerebral. Jan (Elizabeth O'Connell), Gene's longtime gal pal, nurses a 
subterranean passion for the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble brings a sense of urgency and mission to the play, which is 
sensitively directed by Jessica Kubzansky. In Jim Byrkit's scenic design, the 
white-swathed stage becomes the penumbra of light into which Gene will shortly 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Itself a big adventure, "Riffs & Credos" is an authoritative glimpse of the 
unknowable. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Riffs & Credos," Playwrights' Arena, 5262 Pico Blvd., Los Angeles. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends June 11. $12. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 1 
hour, 25 minutes. 'Life After Birth?' Is Long on Laughs 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Walter feels displaced, insecure. Perhaps it was all those years of being 
called "butt-head" by his bratty brother. Or maybe he shouldn't have adopted 
the Cleaver family as role models. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen feels ugly, unlovable. Raised in the shadow of her sexpot sister, she 
still imagines herself the archetypal dweeb, complete with braces, glasses and 
dowdy band uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, these two were made for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is There Life After Birth?," now at the Tamarind, is a wacky boy-meets-girl 
comedy that is long on laughs, though sometimes short on substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Jeffrey Alan Arbaugh, who also plays Walter, borrows a bit from 
Woody Allen, a bit more from Robin Williams, throws in a selection of vintage 
television snippets, then melds all into his own distinctively manic style. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Don Most's sure sense of comic timing complements Arbaugh's humor 
throughout, as does Ken Radcliffe's witty sound design. Cathy McAuley is 
delightful as the pretty but gawky Kathleen, the neurotic of Walter's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 The play soars, despite some turbulence in the second act, in which Kathleen 
turns unmotivatedly capricious. Also, there's a corny "last leaf" metaphor that 
was shopworn when O. Henry used it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, however, Arbaugh is a witty chronicler of life in the 
down-and-dirty singles marshlands. Kathleen and Walter's ungainly mating dance 
makes a couple of amorous whooping cranes look like Astaire and Rogers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Like the classic fairy tales upon which it is based, "Into the Woods," 
currently at Actors Co-op, bears frequent repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 For those already familiar with the show, this version will be a pleasant 
surprise, at least in most particulars. In the intimacy of this small theater, 
not a single word of Stephen Sondheim's wonderful lyrics or James Lapine's book 
are lost. This production is not a big-budget extravaganza, but rather a 
comfortable bedtime story. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's designers have worked ingeniously to scale. The sets, costumes and 
lighting are handsome and versatile. Teresa Klorer's miniaturist choreography 
nicely fills the postage-stamp space. Robin Strand's direction is nimble, never 
claustrophobic. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, some of the performers are vocally strained by Sondheim's 
virtuosic score, but even if a few voices are not Broadway caliber, the show 
stands up to the occasional clinker. 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim's "giants in the sky" may have been cut down to size, but they still 
loom tall in this production, which has been reduced but not diminished.

</P>
<P>
 What a difference a decade makes -- particularly when the decade in question 
ends with one of the most ravaging recessions in post-Depression history. 
</P>
<P>
 A musical based on Studs Terkel's book "Working," at the Colony's Studio 
Theatre Playhouse, first opened in the late '70s. A little more than 15 years 
later, it seems surprisingly anachronistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Proud goldbrickers, the play's secretary and editor probably would not survive 
long in today's drastically downsized corporation. The glamorous hooker doesn't 
even mention AIDS. Many modern-day educators would likely be happy to change 
places with the schoolteacher, who frets that she can't find time to teach 
spelling "between weaving and clay." 
</P>
<P>
 Even paperboys have gone the way of the Pony Express rider, replaced largely 
by an adult work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the voices are good and the performances heartfelt. 
Director-choreographer Todd Nielsen has a solid grasp on composition and 
pacing. Richard D. Bluhm's utilitarian scenic design is user-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working" may not yet be a candidate for the time capsule, but it has mellowed 
into a nostalgic period piece, a barometer of just how quickly society can 
change -- not always for the better.

</P>
<P>
 Playwright John Ford Noonan and director Dorothy Lyman have worked together 
before. Lyman directed the original Off-Broadway production of Noonan's "A 
Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Call this, their latest collaboration, "A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around 
Twitching." 
</P>
<P>
 "Music From Down the Hill" at the Odyssey deals with two roommates-patients at 
a private mental facility. These "chicks" clash, bond, slash and despond in a 
shallow wallow of histrionic pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Picotte and Lee Garlington are accomplished actresses who tackle their 
roles as the mentally disturbed roomies with all the conviction of their craft. 
However, the fact that they must slash themselves at predictable junctures and 
persistently chat with a teddy bear undermines their efforts, however heroic. 
Lyman's journeywoman direction is an equally thankless task. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Noonan's play, the plot is too neat, the sentiment too easy, the 
metaphor too forced and the characters too picturesquely insane to be credible. 
If only the mentally ill were this adorable -- or this easily cured.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'FLINTSTONES' VIDEOS ARE ROLLED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In case you hadn't noticed, we're in the middle of a "Flintstones" blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, there's been no escaping the advertising of products tied 
into "The Flintstones." It's all shamelessly plugging the movie due out next 
week, featuring a star-studded cast playing the characters of the '60s animated 
TV series about a Stone Age family. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about this blitz is Turner Home Entertainment's re-release of 
four videos from the old TV series. For $13 a tape, you get two 25-minute 
episodes. Watching on video is much better than seeing the episodes on TV 
because stations cut them to make room for more commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassettes of "The Flintstones" have been available in the past, but when 
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. bought Hanna-Barbera in December, 1991, a 
two-year moratorium was imposed on releasing the company's videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since they've been off the market so long, we can market them now like they 
were new," said Stuart Snyder, Turner Home Entertainment's senior vice 
president and general manager. "The movie should create a whole new market for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think Turner would continually flood the market with new "Flintstones" 
videos over the next few months, but Synder said the company only has plans to 
release four more at the end of the year, regardless of the movie's box-office 
figures. Schindler's List 
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal is still trying to figure out what to do with Steven Spielberg's 
Oscar-winning "Schindler's List," which will probably come out on home video 
this fall. According to distributor sources, the company is trying to decide 
whether to price it for the sales market or make it strictly a rental. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems with gearing it to sales is that it runs more than three 
hours, making it a two-cassette movie and forcing the price higher than the 
usual $20-$25 for a single-cassette film. The betting among industry sources is 
that it will be a rental, probably coming out in November or December. Special 
Interest Videos

<P>
 * Missing Johnny Carson? Buena Vista video offers a sampling of the former 
king of late-night TV in a four-video set, due next Friday. Three are 
collections of Carson's favorite bits, priced at $15 each. The fourth, his 
final show, is available only in a $60 set with the other three. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you get a kick out of oogling the palatial digs of the filthy rich, 
you'll enjoy perusing "America's Castles" (A&E, $30). 
</P>
<P>
 * There's an insight-filled hour of dialogue between authors Deborah Tannen 
and Robert Bly, who wrote "Iron John," about getting along with your mate in 
"Men and Women: Talking Together" (Mystic Fire, $30); (800) 292-9001. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Secret Life of 118 Green Street" (ABC, $20) is a clever, creepy 
documentary, narrated by Buck Henry, zeroing in on the tiny insects that 
quietly live with us. 
</P>
<P>
 * The two sides of the band Chicago -- playing its great old jazz-rock tunes 
and its current pop-rock material -- are featured in a well-done, expanded PBS 
special, "Chicago in Concert at the Greek Theatre" (Warner Reprise, $25). 
What's New On Video 
</P>
<P>
 "A Dangerous Woman" (MCA/Universal). The tale of a simple-minded, small-town 
clerk (Debra Winger), whose guilelessness gets her into trouble. What starts 
out as an interesting, offbeat story about the clerk's dealings with her sister 
(Barbara Hershey) and a lusty handyman (Gabriel Byrne) turns into a grim, 
contrived melodrama.  
</P>
<P>
 "RoboCop 3" (Orion). The 1987 original was a great action film, but the 
quality has slipped badly in the two sequels. This time the cyborg-cop, played 
by Robert John Burke, battles vicious real-estate developers. Some decent 
action sequences but the edge and the wit are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look Who's Talking Now!" (Columbia TriStar). In this series, toddlers' 
thoughts have been voiced by actors. This time it's talking dogs, with the 
voices of Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton. They join the family, again headed by 
parents played by John Travolta and Kirstie Alley. Even if you liked the first 
two, you might not find much humor in this very low-brow comedy. Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced: Coming on July 13: Buena Vista's "Sister Act 2," starring 
Whoopi Goldberg; Paramount's "Searching for Bobby Fischer," with Joe Mantegna, 
and New Line's "Blink," featuring Madeleine Stowe. FoxVideo's "Sugar Hill," 
starring Wesley Snipes, is due July 6: 
</P>
<P>
 Also: "The Piano" and "Rudy" (Wednesday); "Short Cuts" (June 1); "Wayne's 
World 2" and "My Life" (June 8); "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" (June 14); "The 
Getaway," "Dangerous Game" and "The Air Up There" (June 15); "Six Degrees of 
Separation," "Geronimo: An American Legend" and "Tombstone" (June 22); "The 
Pelican Brief," "Philadelphia," "In the Name of the Father" and "Iron Will"

'JAFAR' VIDEO LACKS THE MAGIC OF 'ALADDIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Return of Jafar" is a straight-to-video sequel to Disney's "Aladdin," and 
the results are about what you'd expect -- not nearly up to the studio's 
big-screen standards but better than most kiddie TV animation. 
</P>
<P>
 An almost entirely new group of producers, directors, writers, animators and 
composers worked on the sequel, but it's not slovenly -- just repetitive and 
uninspired.The score, in particular, is an unhummable melange of pseudo-tunes. 
The only big number that works up a head of steam is, paradoxically, "You're 
Only Second Rate," with words and music by Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 The script, credited to eight writers, has the sorcerer Jafar escaping from 
his magic lamp and wreaking vengeance on Aladdin, now living in the Sultan's 
palace and being an all-around nice guy to the poor people of Agrabah. 
</P>
<P>
 Aladdin and Jasmine, his doe-eyed paramour, are still as bland as ever, but 
Iago, the parrot who escapes the lamp with Jafar, is even more manic than he 
was the first time around. Gilbert Gottfried does Iago's voice again, and he's 
so screechingly overbearing that, when Genie finally tapes his beak, you want 
to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Williams does not do the Genie's voice this time, but all the other 
featured characters in "Aladdin" repeat their roles. His replacement, Dan 
Castellaneta, is the voice of Homer Simpson, and he's not bad. Given the 
competition, he could hardly have bested our memories of Williams. He's a lot 
closer in quality to Williams than "The Return of Jafar" is to "Aladdin."

WHY ABC DECIDED TO CANCEL 'PHENOM'; TELEVISION: RANKING 28TH AMONG NETWORK 
SERIES AND HOLDING 95% OF THE LEAD-IN AUDIENCE AREN'T ENOUGH TO EARN A SECOND 
SEASON. CREATIVE DIFFERENCES MAY BE WHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE WILLENS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Phenom," a sitcom about a single mother with three children, one of them a 
tennis star, ranked 28th among this season's 133 prime-time network series -- 
and ninth among youngsters. A first-year show airing Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., it 
retained 95% of the lead-in audience from longtime hit "Full House." 
</P>
<P>
 So why did ABC cancel it last week? 
</P>
<P>
 "A complete mystery to me," says Dick Blasucci, one of its creators and 
executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasucci acknowledges that the network was not always high on the show but, 
even so, given the ratings, the worst he expected was that it would be moved to 
a new time slot come fall.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a prime place, and I thought, 'Well, maybe they'll bury us and see 
if we succeed without the boost (of "Full House")," he said. "What can I say? I 
thought we fulfilled everything in terms of what an 8:30 show should do." 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation was noteworthy not only because of "Phenom's" ratings but 
also because it was produced by Gracie Films, headed by one of Hollywood's most 
successful writer-producers, James L. Brooks ("The Simpsons," "The Mary Tyler 
Moore Show," "Terms of Endearment"), with whom ABC had a multishow production 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry insiders suggest that ABC, buoyed by its strong second-place 
finish behind CBS for the season, was reasserting itself, unhappy that Brooks 
wouldn't move "Phenom" in the direction it felt the series should be going. 
Some note too that "Phenom" is being replaced in the fall by "Me and the Boys," 
a comedy from ABC's own production company. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks himself is clearly seething, sending this rather cryptic message 
through a spokeswoman: "I have no comment while I'm developing the muscle to 
lie about my reaction to what ABC did." One person close to Brooks said their 
feeling is that "ABC has become drunk with power." 
</P>
<P>
 For the network's part, ABC spokeswoman Sherrie Berger says, " 'Phenom' was 
canceled despite a very talented cast. In the past, we have had the luxury of 
being patient and allowing a show a second year to see if it would pop in its 
time period. This season we had strong pilots and fewer time periods available 
and, as a result, we were in a position to judge more strictly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although it rarely happens, when a well-rated show is canned it's usually 
because it is losing a significant amount of its lead-in audience or there is 
research showing that ratings problems are looming. But "Phenom" was not losing 
its audience. In fact, quite the opposite, according to a research executive at 
Columbia TriStar, the studio behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It consistently went up in the key demographics over the season," the 
researcher said. "And while it didn't always beat 'Full House' in the number of 
households watching, it beat that show in the number of desirable young adults 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
 The executive points out, however, that "ABC creatively didn't like the show, 
and that means they find ways to say it isn't working." Blasucci also says the 
network "would occasionally tell us its own research didn't match ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those involved say "Phenom," which starred Judith Light as the mother and 
William Devane as her daughter's tennis coach, was still finding its way 
creatively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a long process to find the voice of a show," says Light, the former 
star of "Who's the Boss?" "This is a show that was particularly hard to define. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "For Jim Brooks, complexities and nuances can be as automatic as breathing, 
and he brought in some very original writers. But he was also working on a film 
("I'll Do Anything"), and, though he was with us as much as he could be, he was 
in and out.  
</P>
<P>
 "One can argue that any show in the top 20s should get a second season, but 
then one can also argue that maybe we should have distilled the show faster. 
Obviously, I'm sad that we couldn't develop these characters further, but, in 
this case, I really think both sides are right."

TV REVIEWS; MOYERS VISITS PETE SEEGER, TIRING FIREBRAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The autumnal feeling that descends over "Pure Pete Seeger" would seem to cut 
directly against the folk singer's lifetime of passionate commitment to the 
power of song and grass-roots activism. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a man, after all, who rode the rails with Woody Guthrie, cajoled 
record companies and TV networks into paying attention to folk music when swing 
and Sinatra ruled, and endured the McCarthy era blacklisting scourge. Pete 
Seeger, even at 75, is not one to go quietly into that good night. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Bill Moyers did with poet Donald Hall, he has managed to get his crew 
for "Bill Moyers' Journal" to an artist's abode before that artist fades 
forever. The Seeger with whom Moyers chats on a slope overlooking the Hudson 
River is still wiry and has a little fire in his eye, but the fire is 
definitely waning. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeger apologizes for his weakened voice -- which he needn't, because it adds 
a new, reedy, even haunting quality to a spiritual like "How Can I Keep From 
Singing?" But he admits the impossible, that maybe "I protested too much," and 
that, unsure about a mildly irreverent version of "That Old Time Religion," "I 
don't want to offend anyone." Seeger sings the song anyway, showing a glimpse 
of what the old corporate bosses used to call an agitator. 
</P>
<P>
 These are louder, nastier times for many of us, but quieter, calmer ones for 
Seeger since the Vietnam War era, when he became the anti-war movement's 
authentic troubadour, the living proof that you could trust someone over 30. He 
also showed that you can risk much with a song, as he did on "The Smothers 
Brothers Show" with his dramatic anti-war "Waist Deep in the Big Muddy." CBS 
tried to cut it but relented and here we see a tape of the full, powerful 
performance as it finally aired. 
</P>
<P>
 Agitator? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bill Moyers' Journal: Pure Pete Seeger" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV 
Channel 28, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

TV REVIEWS; PORTRAIT OF A JAZZ FRIENDSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Movies about jazz through the years (whether theatrical or made-for-TV) have 
maintained a low level of authenticity. It is a rare pleasure to report that 
"Lush Life" is an exception to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The story line might well be dismissed as just another disease-of-the-week 
melodrama. But the relationship between the two principal characters is warmly 
convincing, thanks to the writing (by director Michael Elias) and the 
performances. Jeff Goldblum is a saxophonist, Forest Whitaker a trumpeter. They 
work together on everything from jazz gigs to bar mitzvahs and baroque dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither artist is glamorized as a frustrated genius; this is neither "Bird" 
nor "Round Midnight." Goldblum, who sports a Yassir Arafat growth throughout, 
is in marital trouble; Whitaker, we soon learn, has an inoperable brain tumor. 
Goldblum arranges to bring together all his buddy's favorite musicians and 
friends for a grand finale, without telling them the true reason for the 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple plot is serviceable enough to provide an admirable soundtrack, with 
the late Bob Cooper dubbing the sax parts, Chuck Findley playing the trumpet 
for Whitaker, and Sue Raney singing "I'm Old Fashioned" as the voice of Kathy 
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennie Niehaus, who did a similarly splendid job for "Bird," was the 
mastermind, writing original music and incorporating such works as Thelonious 
Monk's "Misterioso" (used as bookends to open and close the story), Freddie 
Hubbard's "Up Jumped Spring" and other jazz standards. Whitaker, whose 
performance as Charlie Parker in "Bird" won him a Cannes Film Festival award, 
is no less convincing here. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Ernie Andrews is seen briefly in a nightclub sequence. Jack Sheldon and 
other leading Los Angeles studio musicians take part, mainly on the soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, Billy Strayhorn's "Lush Life" is not heard, but this is a minor flaw in 
a movie that succeeds musically and, to a lesser degree, dramatically, in 
holding the attention for most of its 105 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lush Life" airs at 9 tonight on Showtime. Additional play dates are 
Thursday, June 5, June 14 and June 20.

'MELROSE' FINALE DRAWS HIGH RATINGS, PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two-hour season finale of Fox's "Melrose Place" scored the highest ratings 
in the program's history Wednesday night -- but without the much-talked about 
kiss between two gay characters, prompting cries of censorship from the Gay & 
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is defamation by invisibility," Lee Werbel, executive director of the 
GLAAD chapter in Los Angeles, said in a statement Thursday."Here is a 
television show portraying steamy romances, including the opening scene in this 
very episode, in which a heterosexual couple is in bed (implicitly after making 
love), and two gay characters cannot even show affection." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Darren Star filmed the scene of series regular Doug Savant giving a 
good-night kiss to another man and showed it to Fox executives two weeks ago, 
executive producer Aaron Spelling said. At the request of Fox, the producers 
agreed to cut it. A scene in which Savant talked about the kiss with Andrew 
Shue's character was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>

O.C. AGENCY HELPS ITS CLIENTS CRACK THE LATINO MARKET; ADVERTISING: MENDOZA 
DILLON, WINNER OF NABISCO ACCOUNT, KNOWS WHAT SELLS AMONG SPANISH-SPEAKERS. 
</P>

 When one of the nation's largest cookie-makers decided to launch its first 
Spanish-language ad campaign, it turned to an Orange County agency to help it 
hablar espanol.  
</P>
<P>
 Nabisco Biscuit Co., a division of Nabisco Foods Group, awarded the account, 
worth unspecified hundreds of thousands of dollars, to Mendoza Dillon & 
Associados, a 15-year-old Irvine firm that has created Spanish-language ad 
campaigns for corporations as diverse as Miller Brewing Co., the Wendy's 
fast-food chain, retailing giant Sears and Levi's Jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency "had the right balance of creative ideas, consumer promotions 
experience and strategic thinking," said Mark Gutsche, a spokesman for Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Orange County's 50 or so ad agencies, Mendoza Dillon, which reports 
annual billings of $65 million, is culturally distinctive. In the lobby of the 
company's airport-area high-rise is a small, pre-Columbian statue -- a 
turtle-like creature whose concave back was used for grinding spices and 
grains. A coffee table book displays a self-portrait by celebrated Mexican 
artist Frida Kahlo. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's approach to business is to use a strategy pioneered by co-founder 
Richard Dillon: persuade the client how good a market Latino consumers are by 
using research and statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clients usually think they don't necessarily have to advertise in Spanish, 
that they can reach a good segment of the (Latino) population in English," said 
Robert Howells, president of Mendoza Dillon. "We move them from the opportunity 
phase to the necessity phase." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Casanova, who left Mendoza Dillon a decade ago with Viviana Pendrill to 
form their agency in Irvine, said they have always kept that marketing formula 
in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies used to advertise in the Hispanic market out of political 
sensitivity," said Casanova, president of Casanova Pendrill. "Dillon's original 
approach to proving the effectiveness of the market to the client has proven 
very useful." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dillon and Nicholas Mendoza formed their company in 1979. Dillon 
brought with him several accounts from Johnson & Johnson and General Foods, 
where he served in top marketing posts. By 1980, the agency was posting annual 
billings of about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Howells, who also worked for Johnson & Johnson, joined the agency two years 
later. Howells learned Spanish as an adult, spending two years in Argentina as 
a missionary before finishing his undergraduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, a British marketing firm that owned ad giant J. Walter Thompson 
surprised the industry by purchasing Mendoza Dillon. WPP of London paid $25.5 
million for the Latino agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who had already thought of ourselves as visionaries began to 
wonder if our visions were big enough," said one ad executive, Carl Kravetz of 
Ferrer/Ad America, at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The vision has not been realized as rapidly as some had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 No more than 2% of advertising budgets are targeted to Latino consumers, who 
make up about 9% of television watchers, according to Broadcasting & Cable 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Latino market is expected to number 31.5 million by the end of 
the century -- a growth of 41%, compared with 5% growth predicted in the 
non-Latino population, which Mendoza Dillon and others use as a selling point. 
It is a particularly strong point in Southern California, where a fast-growing 
population of 3.9 million Latinos accounts for 34% of the total population in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, recent studies show that Latinos and African Americans watch very 
different television shows from the general market, and that a simple 
mass-market approach will not effectively reach either group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Simpsons" tops the chart among Latino TV watchers, for example, but it is 
27th among general-market viewers, according to a study by New York ad agency 
BBDO Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza and Nabisco have determined that they will target eight separate 
markets in the United States. Radio ads will be tailored to the local culture 
and idiom -- Puerto Rican in New York, Mexican in Los Angeles, Cuban in Miami. 
Different Spanish-speaking countries answer the telephone differently, for 
example: "Bueno," "Hola" or "Diga."  
</P>
<P>
 TV commercials on Univision and Telemundo, Howells said, will be in "what I 
call 'Walter Cronkite Spanish.' " Latino Spending Habits 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 study shows that Latino households spend more on certain items than 
non-Latino households. Items for which Latino households spend more than the 
average for the general U.S. population: 
</P>
<P>
 FOOD 
</P>
<P>
 * 37% more on beef 
</P>
<P>
 * 21% more on cereals 
</P>
<P>
 * 20% more on fresh and processed fruits and vegetables 
</P>
<P>
 * 9% more on nonalcoholic beverages 
</P>
<P>
 CLOTHING 
</P>
<P>
 * 76% more on apparel for children younger than 2 
</P>
<P>
 * 30% more on apparel for children age 2 to 15 
</P>
<P>
 * The study also found that Latinos buy more used cars, have larger telephone 
bills and spend more on laundry and cleaning supplies than non-Latinos. The 
difference in spending is attributed to Latinos having larger and younger 
families. Latinos were found to spend less on life insurance.

BRIEFCASE: MARKETING AND MEDIA; SEC HALTS WIRELESS CABLE INVESTMENTS AT NEWPORT

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has halted sales at several 
companies -- including a Newport Beach operation -- that are selling 
investments in wireless cable television, the agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The wireless cable system being sold is in Parkersburg, W. Va.This is the 
fourth time this year that federal or state officials have shut down wireless 
cable sales operations. The sellers, officials allege, have promised 
unrealistically high returns on investments while siphoning exorbitant fees out 
of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cablefree Investments Inc. in Newport Beach was one of nine companies targeted 
in the latest SEC action. Investors paid $10,000 each, for a total of $10.3 
million raised by promoters of the Parkersburg system since January. Officials 
said the sales companies kept $6 million of the proceeds.

WESTERN S&L CITES FLAT HOME VALUES IN LAYOFF; EMPLOYMENT: THE IRVINE FIRM IS 
DISMISSING UP TO 57 WORKERS AND CLOSING A LOAN UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western Financial Savings Bank, convinced that real estate values will 
continue to be flat for some time, said Thursday that it has shut down its 
home-improvement loan unit and will lay off up to 43 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Irvine savings and loan will dismiss 14 others in its 
57-branch network statewide as it consolidates work and reduces costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57 layoffs represent about 5% of its 1,200-member staff, but a number of 
those targeted to leave may instead be transferred to the thrift's auto-loan 
division, which represents about half the thrift's business and is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The auto finance unit will expand 30% this year, so we're going to see if 
there are opportunities there for some of the people," said Stephen W. Prough, 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift, the subsidiary of Westcorp Inc., expects to save $3 million a year 
by its consolidations. 
</P>
<P>
 The closing of the home-improvement loan operation is designed to get the 
thrift out of a business that is getting too risky, Prough said. With lower 
property values, the thrift has less of a chance to recoup money it loans on 
second trust deeds, or junior mortgages. The thrift continues to make home 
loans secured by first trust deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Westcorp was one of the top-performing public companies in the state last year 
in spite of operating restrictions imposed by regulators. Those restrictions 
were lifted in January. The company earned $3.9 million for the first quarter.

BOARD TARGETS LICENSE OF ACCOUNTING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's accounting board has sought to revoke or suspend the license of 
Arthur Andersen & Co., the world's biggest accounting firm, for what it calls 
negligence in auditing Lincoln Savings and two other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Lincoln was seized in 1989 at an ultimate cost to taxpayers of 
$3.4 billion, America's costliest thrift failure.Charles H. Keating, the 
chairman of its Phoenix-based parent company, American Continental Corp., is 
serving a 12-year prison sentence for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Grossman, a lawyer for Arthur Andersen, said discussions with state 
officials initially resulted in a deal in December calling for Arthur Andersen 
to pay $625,000 and perform pro bono work to settle the Lincoln charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman accused the board of withholding the Lincoln settlement to pressure 
Arthur Andersen to pay $2 million to settle the other two cases, which involved 
allegedly negligent audits of A&B Loan Co. and Grand Wilshire Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Andersen paid about $79 million to the U.S. government last year to 
settle charges of negligence in auditing thrifts, including Lincoln.

 New Magazine: Two South County publishers have agreed to work together to 
create a new magazine, Laguna Life. 
</P>
<P>
 One publisher is Brad Wright of Community Services Network Inc., which 
produces South Coast, Orange County Arts and several magazines with location 
titles: San Juan Capistrano, Elsinore, Oceanside, Escondido and North County. 
The other is Deborah Long, publisher of the 45-year-old Laguna/California 
Riviera magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 For the new venture, Wright will serve as publisher and Long as editor. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach residents "have missed having their own magazine," Long said. The 
focus will be on entertainment, where to go and what to see, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly magazine will initially be distributed free to homes.

'AUTUMN LEAVES' FELL IN RIGHT PLACE FOR WILLIAMS; POP MUSIC: THE PIANIST 
PROMISES TO PLAY REQUESTS DURING HIS PERFORMANCES THIS WEEKEND WITH THE PACIFIC 
SYMPHONY. 
</P>

 Roger Williams still laughs when he remembers the day he recorded "Autumn 
Leaves," his first hit. It was the mid-'50s, and the then-virtually unknown 
pianist was struggling hard just to survive another New York City winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Dave Kapp, the producer, asked me to record the tune," said Williams, 
who performs with the Pacific Symphony tonight and Saturday in Costa Mesa, "I 
was barely aware of it, and I thought it was called 'Falling Leaves.' So the 
first thing that came to mind was to play all those runs down the keyboard -- 
all that baloney. I tried to make it sound like falling leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had no particular high hopes when he headed home after that session. 
"My fondest dream for that whole thing was that it would pay the last month's 
rent, which I still owed," he said with a chuckle. "Who knew it would become a 
No. 1 record!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Autumn Leaves," of course, was the only the start of a long string of 
instrumental hits. Williams went on to become the first popular pianist to be 
honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and he has performed for 
seven U.S. presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 He has recorded 106 albums and is about to begin work on his 107th. Of those, 
18 have been certified gold, and 19 have climbed into Billboard's Top 40, 
placing him No. 23 on Billboard's Top 500 Album Artists of All Time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Billboard "Book of Top 40 Albums" ranks Williams 50th in its 
evaluation of the "Top 100 Artists of the Rock Era." That places Williams -- 
despite a tendency on the part of pop and rock observers to ignore his 
achievements -- well ahead of such stars as John Denver, Creedence Clearwater 
Revival, the Doobie Brothers, James Taylor and John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than four decades in the business, Williams takes it all in stride 
-- the monster hits on "Autumn Leaves," "Born Free," "Till," "Almost Paradise" 
and "The Impossible Dream," the endless concertizing with the nation's top 
orchestras, the appearances everywhere from Carnegie Hall to Garden Grove's 
Crystal Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Louis Weertz in 1925 in Omaha, he was raised in Des Moines, Iowa. His 
musical skills were apparent almost from birth: At the age of 3 he walked up to 
the piano and began to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt at home there," he said, so much so that his piano teacher soon 
realized that she could not play a new piece on the piano for him. Williams' 
ear was so extraordinary that he could instantly learn it.  
</P>
<P>
 "She got around that by making me sight-read my lessons," he said. "Funny 
thing is that I never did learn to read music as well as I can hear it. I read 
pretty well now, but I'm not phenomenal at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams registered at Drake University at the age of 16 as a piano major, and 
was promptly booted out of the music department for the egregious sin of 
playing a jazz version of "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes" in one of the practice 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After serving in the Navy, he acquired an engineering degree at Louisiana 
State University before returning to Drake for a master's degree in music. 
Postgraduate work at the Juilliard School followed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the education Williams is most proud of is the time spent in individual 
study with jazz greats Teddy Wilson and Lennie Tristano. Although he is not 
often identified as a jazz pianist, Williams still manages to sneak a few Oscar 
Peterson-tinged licks into his performances. 
</P>
<P>
 His appearance with the Pacific Symphony will include his now-famous request 
segment, in which he weaves together an ever-changing medley of tunes based on 
titles called out from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take about 40 requests," Williams said. "And I tell the musicians, 'Don't 
expect me to play these in their original keys, because if I did, I'd be 
modulating all night.' I know about 10,000 different songs, so we just start, 
and I play steady for about 45 to 50 minutes without stopping, from one request 
to another. And, gee, I get calls for everything from hard rock to Beethoven 
sonatas. I think for the audience it's really turned out to be the best part of 
the show." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 70, Williams has the relaxed style and manner of a contented man. For 
35 years, he has lived in the San Fernando Valley, where he and his wife, 
actress Louise DeCarlo, maintain houses directly across the street from each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our schedules are different," he explained. "She gets up at 4 in the morning, 
and that's when I go to bed. And that's worked out great -- boy, do we have 
wild weekends!" 
</P>
<P>
 In between those weekends, Williams has no plans to reduce his perpetually 
busy performance agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I can wiggle my fingers in sequence, I'll be out there," Williams 
said. "Music's been real kind to me. I'm a lousy golfer, and I don't remember 
phone numbers too well, but I figure I've got this music thing down pretty good 
by now." 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; SPARKLING SUPPORTING CAST WARMS UP 'ANNIE'; ASHLEY CAMP IS 
PRETTY MUCH AT HOME IN THE ROLE OF THE ORPHAN, BUT THE FUNNY PEOPLE KEEP 
FULLERTON PRODUCTION GOING.

 In its own perverse way, director Jan Duncan's Fullerton Civic Light Opera 
staging of "Annie," at Plummer Auditorium, provides a few clues to the show's 
durability. A lot of musicals have come and gone since the '70s. (Remember 
"Barnum"?) Not "Annie." Why? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not necessarily because of Annie, or whatever bright young girl sings 
"Tomorrow." No, "Annie's" secret weapon is the array of acid and charming and 
sneaky comic characters that fill Thomas Meehan's book, based on the "Little 
Orphan Annie" comic strip. And it's the reprise of "Tomorrow," involving 
F.D.R.'s nutty White House cabinet, that really delivers the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Fullerton, the big number for Ashley Camp's Annie isn't "Tomorrow" at 
all, but her first (and reprised) number, "Maybe."  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Irma Torres, credited with hair and wig design, seemingly 
couldn't come up with the proper curly red wig for our favorite orphan. 
Instead, Camp must show off fairly flat-looking tresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp otherwise looks and acts at home with the role, which takes her from the 
dreadfully clammy New York municipal orphanage, run by bitter Miss Hannigan 
(Carol Swarbrick, who steals the show with relish), to the heavenly mansion of 
billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Van Mosley, in fine voice). 
</P>
<P>
 Camp's Annie can stand up to the toughest orphan in the ward, or fool Hannigan 
whenever she must, or persuade a copper that the dog she just found really is 
her Sandy (the well-behaved novice canine actor, Ginger). 
</P>
<P>
 We feel a little for this Annie, but we can't really warm up to her. While 
"Maybe" contains a good dose of longing and remains one of the most evocative 
pieces by composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Martin Charnin, "Tomorrow" 
sounds rote, ill-timed, even harsh. Musical director and conductor Lee Kreter 
might do something to smooth the harshness, which is hardly helped by 
problem-plagued miking throughout the show. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a musical to do? Bring on the funny people, if you have them. Luckily, 
"Annie" contains a fair share. Leading the pack is Swarbrick's Hannigan, who 
may be too Paul Lynde-ish for some tastes, but who milks every one of her 
moments with the comic-book sensibility of the original strip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conniving with her in the plot to steal Annie are Frank Stancati's superb, 
chameleonic Rooster and Laura Soltis as his cackling, evil lover, Lily. (Watch 
them in their disguise to snatch up Annie; they're performances within 
performances.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although he doesn't exactly resemble President Roosevelt, Stephen Breithaupt 
affectionately captures the New Deal man's sing-song tone with the ideal 
deadpan attitude. Richard Comeau as both an apple seller and, later, as radio 
host Bert Healy singing a period-perfect version of "Fully Dressed," shows the 
range of talent that typifies the various ensemble groups. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of "Fully Dressed," the little orphans who terrorize Hannigan 
pick up Bert's song and run with it. The frisky group of Ashley Day, Alex 
Chester, Candice Oden, Deanna Aguinaga, Lora Kane, Carolyn Tomaka, Jodel Visser 
and Peri Baker deliver terrifically infectious energy, guided by choreographer 
Sha Newman's steady hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the more sober roles, Mosley's Warbucks and Therese Walden as his aide 
Grace anchor the story with tender, loving care. The slender Mosley doesn't 
match our physical idea of a more rotund Warbucks; still, his tender-edged 
voice and lack of gruffness effectively play against the stereotype of the mean 
old rich man. 
</P>
<P>
 If only as much thought has been given to the show's look, which is sometimes 
desperately bus-and-truck, and sometimes (as in the orphanage set by Mark 
Klopfenstein) not. Donna Ruzika's best lighting work comes through on the 
Depression-era scenes, while Edith Melcher's costumes show off at their finest 
in the brightness of Warbucks' living room.

THEATER REVIEWS; BRITISH WIT, GREEK WOE; TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER'S 'NIGHTINGALE' 
AT VANGUARD BALANCES TRAGEDY, HUMOR WITH FEMINIST SPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When British playwright Timberlake Wertenbaker decided to write a feminist 
play, she went whole hog. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Love of the Nightingale," at the Vanguard Theatre, she goes back to an 
ancient Greek myth in which Tereus, the young King of Thrace, has come to the 
aid of the King of Athens in a war, and as a reward is given the King's 
daughter Procne's hand in marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 After she bears his son, Tereus loses interest in Procne, who wants her sister 
Philomele brought from Athens to keep her company. On the way back to Thrace, 
Tereus tells Philomele that Procne is dead, makes his play for her and, when 
she refuses, he brutally rapes her and cuts out her tongue so she can't tell 
the world what he's done. 
</P>
<P>
 If this all sounds as if it must be very heavy and very Greek, you don't know 
Wertenbaker's way with a play. There is much humor here, as a place-setting for 
the tragedy, and a typically Greek happy ending from which the title comes, and 
whose surprise won't be ruined here. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Elizabeth Swenson is as easy with the play's wit as with its woes. 
She knows where the lightness is and lets it glimmer, and when the going gets 
heavy, she lets it drop with the force of a sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 The anachronistic modern dialogue is perfect to place the play's intent in no 
set time, and to give the characters an added richness, both in their emotional 
complexity and their mythic simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The leads and a few members of the supporting cast are on to the conceit and 
carry it off beautifully. Jill Cary Martin's Procne is a full-blooded, 
intelligent woman, at home in any era, and Martin's sense of majesty mixed with 
warmth couldn't be more right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Etzel's Philomele, bubbling with girlish naivete at first, grows with 
fine, emerging power as the mute beggar Tereus has made of her. 
</P>
<P>
 None of it might work as well without Robert Shaun Kilburn's eccentric 
performance as Tereus. Totally confused by Athens, its powerful drama and, 
above all, by its words, uncommunicative Tereus is, in any period, a cluck. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilburn plays Tereus when he's being bad like a little boy thinking quickly to 
make up an excuse, when he's horny like a bumbling, impatient high-school jock. 
He catches the humor, and the irony, with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 If Procne's Thracian ladies-in-waiting seem confused by the multifaceted 
writing, Joyce Eriksen appreciates the fun in the play; as the Queen of Athens, 
she describes a staging of the tragedy of Phaedra as though it were a soap 
opera. In a small role as a dense Thracian soldier, Jeff Schlosser also has a 
few very funny moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Dunne finely delineates the complex shadings in Philomele's nurse Niobe, 
both humorous and very serious, particularly in her long speech during a 
beautifully modulated moment when Philomele is being raped offstage and Niobe 
bemoans her charge's fighting against fate. 
</P>

MEMORY VERDICT HAS THERAPISTS RETHINKING; LAW: PSYCHIATRIC COMMUNITY REVIEWS 
USE OF A DRUG, HYPNOSIS AFTER JURY'S NEGLIGENCE DECISION IN IRVINE WOMAN'S 
ABUSE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Orange County mental health professionals are reconsidering how they 
treat psychiatric cases following a jury's decision that therapists had 
negligently "reinforced" an Irvine woman's emerging memories that her father 
raped her as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI Medical Center is reviewing its use of hypnosis and a drug that was 
used by the defendant therapists to clarify repressed memories. The Community 
Psychiatric Centers facility in Santa Ana stopped those practices two years 
ago, when the father's lawsuit, filed in 1991, began to attract publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is clearly a need for our company and for other psychiatric 
hospitals to revisit strategies such as sodium Amytal interviews and hypnosis 
that are used . . . to assist in recovering memories," said Dr. Martin Brenner, 
medical director of CPC in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Barry Chaitin, medical director of the neuropsychiatric center at UCI 
Medical Center, said that, in addition to reviewing the use of hypnosis and 
Amytal, he expects that UCI therapists will "have to take a much more skeptical 
stance" in interviewing patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will have a great impact on our clinical practice in that we will have 
to be in a state of vigilance as to the potential impact therapy might have on 
other people in the patient's life," Chaitin said. "And that could severely 
interfere with the trust between the patient and the clinician." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the UCI Medical Center nor CPC were named in the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental health practitioners are divided whether the precedent-setting legal 
case involving Gary Ramona and his daughter, Holly, now 23, will make some 
therapists more cautious or unleash a wave of lawsuits that will hurt the 
therapist-patient relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ramona in his suit alleged that while Holly was under sodium Amytal, 
therapists influenced her into falsely remembering that he had raped her when 
she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The therapists, however, said Holly had these memories while conscious and was 
put on sodium Amytal to determine if her story would remain the same under 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff also contended that Holly was told that the medication, which 
lowers a patient's inhibitions, was a truth serum, when in fact what a person 
remembers under its influence might not be factual. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, a Napa Valley Superior Court jury found that Richard Rose, 
formerly chief of psychiatry at Western Medical Center Anaheim; Marche 
Isabella, a private therapist who practiced at Western; and the hospital were 
negligent in Holly's treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Dudum, the jury foreman, said the jury was uncertain whether Holly was 
molested by her father. He said, however, the jury found evidence that the 
therapists had reinforced memories that most likely were false. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudum said the jury determined that the therapists had failed to do their job. 
"She (Holly) went to the therapists for bulimia and depression and as the 
therapy went on the bulimia worsened," he said. "There seemed more emphasis 
placed on these memories than what she went to the doctors for." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's decision has had a pronounced effect on the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been enthusiastically welcomed by some mental health professionals who 
contend that too many therapists have persuaded patients to remember sexual 
abuse in their childhood as the cause of their psychiatric problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But other mental health experts worry that the decision could affect the 
relationship between patients and their therapists, who might become paralyzed 
with worry that their patients' spouses, parents and other third parties might 
sue them if they feel victimized by the therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several psychiatrists predicted that colleagues might reconsider the wisdom of 
using hypnosis and sodium Amytal, a medication that creates a state of 
hypnosis, in attempts to extract repressed memories and other information from 
patients.  
</P>
<P>
 "This recovered memory stuff has been a disgrace in the mental health field 
for a decade now," said Don DeFrancisco, chief of the psychiatric division at 
Hoag Hospital. "I am very happy about this case and I hope it does change the 
mental health practice." 
</P>
<P>
 DeFrancisco said too often he gets patients after previous therapists have 
convinced them that they were abused as children. "They say if you have 
problems with the opposite sex or you have depression, you must have been 
molested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lawrence Sporty, senior lecturer in psychiatry at UCI College of Medicine, 
said he also hopes the case will discourage therapists from "jumping to 
conclusions" that childhood sexual abuse is necessarily at the root of adult 
mental illnesses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have dealt with many patients who have been abused. In many, many cases it 
is true," Sporty said, "and it would be a major disservice to patients to deny 
the existence of abuse. But not every psychiatric illness comes from emotional 
abuse or from sexual abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramona case, he said, "brings to the attention of everybody that 
simplistic formulations of patients' problems are not the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 The organized profession of psychiatry is still struggling with how to respond 
to the court decision, said Dan Willick, attorney for the California 
Psychiatric Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is in determining whether repressed memories of sexual abuse are 
truthful or accurate," he said. "While for purposes of therapy it may be 
necessary to treat the emotional hurt, whether the memory is accurate or not, 
the intrusion of the law into therapy creates difficult and complicated legal 
issues which may result in awards of substantial damages against therapists." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Rose, who has left the field of psychiatry and is operating a 
printing business in Maui, said he believes the jury faulted him for giving 
Holly reassurance to make her comfortable with telling her thoughts. 
"Reassurance is an appropriate part of the interaction between any professional 
and his client," Rose said.  
</P>
<P>
 Western Medical Center, the hospital where Holly Ramona was questioned under 
sodium Amytal, probably will not recommend any changes to its psychiatric 
staff, said Ed Leonard, lawyer for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said it is not a therapist's role to investigate the veracity of what 
his or her client remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To comply with this muddled verdict, we would have to make fundamental 
changes in the way psychiatry is practiced for which there is no scientific 
support," said Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Shearer, an attorney for Gary Ramona, said: "Hospitals clearly 
have oversight responsibility for what goes on within their walls. It was 
pretty clear that the Amytal interview for verifying memories was wrong and a 
hospital can't just wink and say we are just providing the beds."

O.C. SANITATION DISTRICTS' WOES WORRY DIRECTORS; LITIGATION: THE AGENCY, WHICH 
IS FACING ADDITIONAL LEGAL PROBLEMS, HAS SPENT $4.2 MILLION IN ATTORNEY'S FEES 
AND RELATED EXPENSES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Orange County Sanitation Districts, now facing wrongful death claims 
following a fatal fire at one of their plants and a certain legal fight over 
treatment of an agency whistle-blower, have spent $4.2 million in attorney's 
fees and related expenses in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees and potential for additional litigation have startled some agency 
directors, who said the legal costs will be studied as part of an overall audit 
of the districts' management practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen the same figures, and I'm very surprised at the amount we are 
paying in attorney's fees," said Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond, one of the 
agency's 46 directors. "There has to be an attitude of willing to solve 
problems and disputes without going to court, a use of common sense. I'm very 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 In a short statement issued Thursday through the sanitation agency, General 
Manager J. Wayne Sylvester acknowledged that the agency has devoted 
considerable resources to defend itself against lawsuits but expressed 
confidence in legal counsel Rourke, Woodruff and Spradlin, a private firm based 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unfortunate that we have been drawn into several extraordinary legal 
matters in the past few years that were not of our doing," Sylvester said. "We 
believe that our legal interests have been well represented." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester and other top administrators have declined to comment about the 
agency's most recent legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation agency provides sewer services in cities throughout the county 
and is split into various jurisdictions. The cities and jurisdictions are 
represented by the districts' directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the agency's directors said they are increasingly concerned about its 
recent problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of their focus has been on the serious nature of safety code violations 
issued last week against the agency by state authorities. The violations were 
related to the fire that killed two workers at the districts' Huntington Beach 
treatment plant. Earlier this week, the families of the two workers notified 
the agency of their intentions to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members have expressed outrage over the agency's treatment of 
laboratory manager Louis Sangermano. After acknowledging that he was 
cooperating with the Orange County district attorney's investigation of 
activities within the sanitation districts, Sangermano learned the next day 
that laboratory locks were changed and that his office telephone number had 
been recoded. Sangermano's attorneys have also notified the agency that they 
will challenge the recent actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that the recent problems in the districts have been staggering," 
said Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson, another sanitation agency 
director whose city has been notified it will be a defendant in the wrongful 
death lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the directors are concerned," she said. "I want some answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson characterized the agency's legal costs as "exceedingly high" 
and said she planned to ask agency administrators for a breakdown of those fees 
and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, the agency has been involved, either as a defendant or plaintiff, 
in more than 80 lawsuits, with some of the most costly cases coming within the 
past five years, according to officials and agency records. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the nation's largest offshore chemical contamination cases, the 
federal government sued the Orange County Sanitation Districts and more than 
100 other cities and special districts in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The case centered on the dumping of industrial chemicals and the pesticide DDT 
into coastal waters from Southern California sewer systems. Less than two years 
ago, the cities and special districts agreed to settle the case by spending $43 
million to clean up the waters. The sanitation agency's share of that cost was 
more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Corinne Clawson said the agency recently settled a lawsuit it 
filed against a contractor over defective engines installed for its Central 
Power Generation System. The agency prevailed in the case, but the settlement 
required that it pay its own legal fees, which totaled more than $400,000.

DANA PARSONS: TO PROTECT OTHERS, WOMAN TURNS IN FATHER IN ABUSE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first question I asked was why she was so eager to go public, including 
naming herself and her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because at this point in time, I know of five people my father has molested 
and sexually abused in some fashion or another, and he's still walking the 
streets. My mother baby-sits children and brings them into their house. It's 
like bringing them in for slaughter, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 So began the conversation with the 31-year-old mother of two. We talked beside 
the pool at the Newport Beach residential complex where she lives, and over 
much of the next hour she detailed the sexual abuse she says her father 
committed against her two children and herself. She also believes her father 
molested two of her cousins. It was her children's allegations, she says, that 
18 months ago triggered her own repressed memory of extended abuse of her as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 But although she was perfectly willing to identify herself and her father, I 
am less so. At my suggestion, she agreed to discuss her situation without 
naming names. I also wanted to get her opinion of the victory last week for the 
Northern California man who won his case against two therapists who, he 
claimed, implanted false memories of abuse in his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The "repressed memory" phenomenon of recent years has divided mental-health 
and academic professionals, some of whom accept as fact that people repress 
horrible events for years and others who are skeptical of belated claims of 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked the woman, whom I'll call Sandy, her reaction to the verdict last week 
involving Holly Ramona and her father, Gary Ramona. Holly, now 23, claimed in 
1990 that her father had molested her when she was 5 years old, continuing 
until she was 8. Jurors didn't totally discount that molestation occurred but 
supported Gary Ramona's claims of improper behavior by the therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bothered by it," she said of the verdict. "Very much so, because now when 
someone comes forward and a therapist is called to testify, people will say, 
'Yeah, he was leading her on.' What kind of credibility is there going to be 
for people who it really happened to and who want to make a change? I'm glad my 
daughter had the faith to come to me and thank God I was strong enough to 
finally look at my past and let it come out so I could help them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy says the story began unraveling 18 months ago when her daughter, then 5, 
returned from visiting Sandy's parents, who now live out of state. Sandy 
spotted bruises inside her daughter's thighs, but her daughter first said she 
fell off a bicycle. However, Sandy's son, now 12, told his mother that "I know 
where they came from. Papa (his name for his grandfather) did the same thing to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son then told her of an incident years before, when he was 5, when he was 
visiting the grandparents and his grandfather allegedly molested him in the 
middle of the night. Armed with that information, Sandy again asked her 
daughter, who said that her grandfather had touched her in her genital area. 
</P>
<P>
 Those disclosures opened the memory floodgates over the next few months, Sandy 
says. "I actually thought I was going crazy at first. I'd lay down at night and 
try to go to sleep, then my heart would start beating really, really fast and 
then it was like I couldn't breathe, like I was having a panic attack. It was 
like someone putting a tape into the VCR and turning that thing on. Then it 
replayed, but instead of just replaying the pictures, it replayed smells and 
feelings that came with it. It's like I was going through it all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy now believes she was molested between the ages of 5 and 13. She says her 
father engaged her in all forms of sex and that it ended only when she 
threatened to tell the police. I asked how she could not remember events that 
traumatic until 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It blows me away, too," she says. "It's like my whole life has been a 
complete lie." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if she understood why some people have trouble believing 
repressed-memory situations. "Why do I think I waited 31 years? I don't know. 
Maybe I'm at a point where I knew I'd never ever have to ask him for anything 
again. I didn't need nor want their financial support or their backing. . . . I 
didn't want to remember these things. All these things kept coming to me; Dad 
picking me up, putting me on the bed, him rolling over on top of me, feeling 
smothered. I remember him taking his white undershirt and wiping semen from 
between my legs." 
</P>
<P>
 And you had never seen those images before? "It was like watching a tape of 
it, a tape I'd never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
 She took her children's allegations to her parents' local police department 
and filed a complaint. Her father denies molesting anyone but attended a few 
therapy sessions after the local district attorney threatened him with jail, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy says that she's concerned about neighbors' children going to her 
father's home but that authorities said they can't intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if her mother believes the allegations. Sandy said she insisted that 
her mother hear Sandy's therapist detail the incidents. Her mother's response, 
according to Sandy, was: "If only I knew the truth. If only someone could take 
a magic wand and wave it in front of my face, then I would know." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy says her children responded well to therapy. She also feels fine, 
emotionally and psychologically. "There's one good part to this, to anyone who 
may be reading this and has been molested. It does get better, as long as you 
can put it in the right frame of mind. It's something that happened, it's 
always going to be with you, but it doesn't have to be the major focus of your 
life. It's like if you've been in a bad car accident and got hurt really bad, 
and the pain is going to be there, but if you face the anger and the hurt, 
yeah, it does get better."

QUAYLE SHOWS CLEAR SIGNS OF PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing on a stage at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace on Thursday, 
former Vice President Dan Quayle recalled the late President's advice never to 
"curry favor with your critics," and said the Bush Administration lost the 1992 
election because it had done the opposite by following Bill Clinton's campaign 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset of an hourlong speech, Quayle looked across the crowd of 300 
paying guests and asked rhetorically: "How in the heck did we lose the 
election? 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we lost the election is that we bought into our opponent's agenda. 
Richard Nixon knew that issue, that if you ever adopt your opponent's agenda or 
try to curry favor with your critics, you will lose," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because if you adopt your opponent's agenda, you do not stand for anything. 
And if you do not stand for anything, then why are people going to support 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 During the speech, which preceded a lengthy session of autographing copies of 
his new autobiography, Quayle also criticized the Clinton Administration for 
waffling on foreign policy and continued to espouse a conservative, Republican 
agenda on domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did not have a clear answer when asked by a member of the audience 
about a California ballot initiative that would bar illegal immigrants from 
public hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very difficult question. It's a very difficult problem," Quayle said, 
adding that the North American Free Trade Agreement and enhanced border patrols 
might deter illegal immigration. He concluded that the "Save Our State" 
initiative would be a "significant step in the right direction" and merits 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle, who is using the national book-signing tour as a trial balloon for a 
possible presidential bid in 1996, was cheered by a crowd that typified Orange 
County's reputation as a Republican stronghold. Library officials estimated 
that 3,000 people had lined up by 9:30 a.m. to purchase Quayle's book and get 
his autograph. Two thousand copies of the book were sold, a record for any 
book-signing at the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle's appearance kicked off the library's "1996 Issues Forums," a series of 
presentations by political candidates, journalists and campaign strategists 
leading up to the 1996 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
 The book has received attention because it includes blunt criticism of former 
Bush Administration officials, including Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Jack Kemp and Chief of Staff and Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III. 
</P>
<P>
 When told by one member of the audience that she felt the book contained a 
"little bitterness" on his part, Quayle responded: "I would not describe it as 
bitter; I am not a bitter person. I would describe it as setting the record 
straight, telling the media exactly what they did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush-Quayle ticket was widely criticized during the 1992 campaign for 
touting its foreign policy accomplishments but paying little attention to the 
nation's longstanding economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quayle's speech signaled his intent to focus on foreign policy in 1996, if 
he runs. He attacked Clinton for "leadership by consensus," which he contended 
has led to mismanagement of foreign crises and the diminishment of U.S. 
influence and credibility around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Haiti as an example, Quayle said the President was "conducting foreign 
policy by hunger strike" instead of exerting leadership, a reference to 
Clinton's renewed focus on Haiti after a 27-day hunger strike by TransAfrica 
foundation director Randall Robinson to protest the forced repatriation of 
Haitian refugees by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As he turned to the domestic front -- which drew more reaction from the 
audience -- Quayle painted a dark picture of the Clinton Administration's 
social and political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still have somewhat of a radical '60s mentality that believes in tearing 
down the Establishment, questioning the police, disdaining authority and trying 
to radically change our society," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am somewhat impressed by the way Clinton is able to grab the center in the 
political arena. He is for everything," Quayle added. "His style of 
communication . . . (includes) answering very important national security 
questions on MTV. It's sort of 'in your face' communication about everything. 
But we need to watch what (Clinton Administration officials) do rather than 
what they say." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to recapture the White House, Quayle said, Republicans need to 
articulate the themes that brought them success in the past -- family values, 
tax cuts, welfare reform, choice in education and congressional term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, he added, "need to really get their act together" on the health 
care issue and call for radical reforms in the legal system that drives up 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle also disagreed with a member of the audience who described Republicans 
as "chicken" on the "pro-life" issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said conservatives need to shift the debate "to issues that the 
pro-life community can begin to win," such as opposition to tax-subsidized 
abortions, supporting a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion can be 
performed and requiring parental consent when a minor is involved.

LAGUNA'S BLOOMIN' MIRACLE; PARK VISITORS CAN VIEW FLOWER SHOW EMERGING IN THE 
WILDFIRES' WAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Mother Nature has made an artist's palette of the hills above this city. 
</P>
<P>
 Where fire-charred tree skeletons gave the landscape the appearance of an 
alien planet, bright purple snapdragons push toward the sky. Black ashen soil 
has given way to carpets of swaying pink Mariposa lilies. And the burned 
prickly pear plants still occasionally visible have now been joined by white 
popcorn flowers and stately red Indian paintbrushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen wildflowers this year that we just haven't seen before," said 
Larry Sweet, the Orange County park ranger who oversees the 2,540-acre Laguna 
Coast Wilderness Park. "For many of us this could be a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity to see such a bloom; it really is an ongoing bouquet." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly seven months after a wildfire swept over close to 17,000 acres in and 
near Laguna Beach, nature is showing who's boss. And this Saturday, hundreds of 
people are expected to convene at the park for a rare opportunity to tour the 
land on their own during an open house celebrating the earth's victory over 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really beautiful out there," said Sharen Heath, a park docent and one of 
the planners of the gathering. "Those of us who go come back feeling heartened. 
Every week it gets greener and greener." 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists say they aren't surprised by the spectacular display of spring 
growth in the burned-out areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In removing the usual cover of coastal sage scrub, they say, the fire 
fertilized the soil with a rich mixture of ash and other nutrients and exposed 
the seed-rich earth to life-giving rays of light. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, they say, an array of wildflowers -- called "fire followers" for 
their habit of lying dormant in the soil until after a fire -- are getting 
their brief moments in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ecologists promised us a show and we've got one," said Elisabeth Brown, a 
biologist with Laguna Greenbelt, a grass roots environmental organization. 
"Flowers that you sometimes see in ones or twos, now you see whole carpets of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists predict that the colorful bouquet will return each spring for the 
three-or-more years it takes the familiar coastal sage scrub to re-establish 
itself as the dominant plant in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 That process is already well underway, according to Trish Smith, a Nature 
Conservancy ecologist who last week completed the first installment of a 
five-year study documenting what she described as the "vigorous" regrowth of 
the scrub. 
</P>
<P>
 Areas that were reseeded in the wake of the devastating fire on Oct. 27 are 
showing some signs of regrowth as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Bright orange California poppies dot some of the 277 acres within city limits 
that were reseeded with a rich mulch designed to prevent erosion. And some new 
grass has been seen on the more than 3,000 acres of open space reseeded by 
helicopters supplied by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most impressive, though, has been the growth spawned by nature 
itself, ecologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about the fire is that it allowed us to experience a natural 
process," Smith said. "We're getting a different view of the landscape that is 
just as natural as the shrub-covered view we're used to and it's quite 
spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed evident during a recent impromptu tour of Laguna Coast Wilderness 
Park by Sweet and Heath. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just astonishing," said Heath, striding gingerly through a field strewn 
with splashes of white, salmon and yellow from the newly budded morning 
glories, sticky monkey flowers and golden stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like looking into a tide pool," she said. "If you stop and relax, all 
the colors come into focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Opened just last year, the park -- except for a small portion always 
accessible -- can ordinarily be seen only during the prearranged docent tours 
held several times a month. The wilderness park -- on land formerly owned by 
the Irvine Co. -- is overseen by the private Laguna Canyon Foundation, which is 
still raising money for the purchase of its last 189 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath said participants in Saturday's open house are asked to park their cars 
at the Act V parking lot from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. From the lot, on the west 
side of Laguna Canyon Road opposite the Canyon Club, they will take free 
shuttle buses to the entrances of four different areas of the park: Big Laguna 
Lake, Little Sycamore Canyon, Little Laguna Lakes and Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath said that the visitors, who are encouraged to bring picnic lunches, may 
either hike through the areas themselves or participate in organized docent-led 
tours. Those interested in reserving space on a shuttle, she said, should call 
(714) 855-PARK. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to come," Heath said. "Coming out here will recharge their 
spiritual batteries."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; GREENHORNS KICK OFF RODEO FIESTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a cattle drive straight out of a Western. The only thing missing was 
the movie camera. 
</P>
<P>
 In a real-life version of the film "City Slickers," the greenhorns nearly 
outnumbered the steers on Thursday as cattle were herded to the site of this 
weekend's Rancho Santa Margarita Fiesta Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 20 would-be cowpokes -- local Rotarians, computer engineers and 
general contractors -- to watch 60 head of cattle. And five real ranch hands to 
shepherd the would-be cowpokes. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had one guy fall into a ditch with his horse upside down this morning," 
said Harley May, trail boss and three-time rodeo champion. "I'm not sure some 
of these guys know how to ride a horse." 
</P>
<P>
 The invitation-only event kicked off South County's fourth annual homage to 
the cowboy, the Rancho Santa Margarita Fiesta Rodeo, which starts today and 
runs through Sunday at Santa Margarita Parkway and Alma Aldea. 
</P>
<P>
 A full array of rodeo events will be on display during the weekend fiesta: 
bull and bareback riding, barrel racing, saddle-bronc riding, team roping and 
steer wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake will be $20,000 in prize money that will be sought by some of the top 
rodeo cowboys in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say this is one of the top 20 rodeos in California," said May, who works 
as a ranch consultant at the 40,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo. "The competition 
gets real intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rodeo is a true Western sport, it goes back a lot further than baseball," he 
continued. "And it's a good spectator sport because I think everybody down deep 
would like to ride a bucking bronco." 
</P>
<P>
 Some events will be free, including the team roping competition, which starts 
at 9 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a charge for other fiesta programs, including the Western rodeo 
dance, which is $5 and takes place at 7 p.m. Saturday, and an event for 
children, which is $3 and takes place at 3:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-rodeo highlights include a carnival with rides, arts and crafts booths, 
food and a chili cook-off set for 10 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are available at Ticketmaster. For more information, call (714)

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; PROGRESS REPORT LISTS 100 ACHIEVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to bring more attention to its accomplishments, Anaheim has 
issued its first progress report, trumpeting 100 achievements of city 
government during fiscal 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously approved the 31-page document Tuesday, praising a 
host of city staff members for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heartening to see the progress made by the various city departments," 
Mayor Tom Daly said. "Perhaps it can be a springboard for the next wave of 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
 In a year marked by Ram executives' announcement that the team might leave 
Anaheim, the city touted the opening of The Pond of Anaheim, the hiring of a 
new police chief and the finalization of the Disneyland Resort Specific Plan as 
noteworthy successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other self-congratulatory items included: opening a downtown telecenter, 
removing scores of old toilets and installing water-saving ultra-low-flush 
devices, and improving relations with federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, City Manager James D. Ruth said citizens should not overlook 
the everyday accomplishments by city workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These daily victories, such as a librarian helping a citizen obtain a 
hard-to-find book, a utility worker turning on water and electric service for a 
new resident or a police officer protecting a family from burglary, are the 
cornerstones to the continued success and vitality of the city of Anaheim," 
Ruth wrote. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; COUNCIL APPROVES NO-PARKING ZONES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week designated portions of several streets as 
no-parking zones to ease crowding on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next month, parking will be prohibited on a 500-foot stretch of 
Valencia Drive -- 250 feet east and 250 feet west of Basque Avenue -- at all 
hours.Also, no parking will be allowed on the east side of Casa Blanca Drive, 
south of Barris Drive. Parking on Short Street, between Commonwealth and 
Amerige avenues, will not be allowed for more than two hours between 9 a.m. and 
5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 After the city installs parking-restriction signs, anyone who parks on the 
prohibited streets will receive citations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking is already restricted on most city streets between 2 and 5 a.m., when 
street sweeping is done. People are allowed to park overnight on some streets, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 The council took action this week to add Hansen Avenue, between Santa Ysabel 
and Santa Fe avenues, to the list of the few streets where motorists are 
allowed to park whenever they want. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; TOLLWAY AGENCY, CITY AGREE TO 
CONCESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week decided not to challenge the planned San Joaquin 
Hills tollway in exchange for about $2.5 million in roadway and other 
improvements the project builder has agreed to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies, the umbrella 
organization for two tollway projects in the county, told city officials it 
will condemn a section of Rancho Viejo Road in the city that must be moved east 
to make way for the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing they wouldn't stand much of a chance in court if they challenged 
that condemnation, council members said they decided to strike the deal with 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the city's promise not to challenge the condemnation, the 
agency will provide the city with the $2.5 million worth of improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Those improvement include additional landscaping for sound walls in the 
project, bike lanes and equestrian trails, intersection signals and various 
freeway improvements. The agreement was hammered out by city officials and 
agency representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision means the corridor agency can proceed with construction 
of the tollway, which includes an Interstate 5 interchange, without having to 
deal with the city's building permit process. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency would also be immune from city regulations while operating under 
the process to condemn the road, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeff Vasquez cast the lone dissenting vote Tuesday night when the 
council voted to approve the agreement. Vasquez said it was a mistake for the 
council to give up its right to require building permits. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the council has seen only a conceptual plan. In addition, he said, 
agency officials still need to conduct tests to determine what effect noise 
from the tollway will have on nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than getting married to this agency, the council should be protecting 
the rights of the people living by the road," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Save Our San Juan (SOS), a grass-roots community group, has 
fought the planned tollway, claiming it will destroy the tranquillity of the 
rural neighborhoods on the east side of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The group recently sued the city and the tollway agency in an attempt to block 
the city's decision in March to endorse the agency's development plans in San 
Juan Capistrano -- to move Rancho Viejo Road east and widen it to four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 SOS members argue a new environmental study is needed because the agency has 
changed its plans in the area so many times.ANDREW LePAGE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; BOARD CANCELS PLAN TO TRANSFER STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of debate, Brea Olinda Unified School District trustees have 
decided not to force about 100 students to transfer from their present 
overcrowded schools to less crowded ones in their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who had complained that their children would be traumatized if 
required to shift schools said they are pleased with the school board's 
decision this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The most intense opposition had come in response to trustees' efforts to send 
some students from two predominantly white elementary schools to attend Laurel 
Elementary School, where half the students are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials and community leaders had accused parents who protested the 
proposed change of racism. The parents denied the charges and board members 
modified the boundary change proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current plan, all Brea children who attend the overcrowded Mariposa 
and Arovista elementary schools will be permitted to stay there, at least for 
another year. Any student who does not live in Brea will attend schools that 
are not overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 The school attendance boundary issue "started out being really messy," Trustee 
Frank Davies said. "But it came to a very good resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 School board members, however, warned that attendance boundary changes will be 
considered again in the next three to five years because of expected population 
growth.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CITY SEEKS TO RESTRICT BUDDHIST TEMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for a three-foot statue of Buddha in the midst of bonsai trees, dwarf 
bamboos and a flower garden, this three-bedroom house looks no different from 
the single-family homes clustered near a park on West Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But once inside, the sweet scent of burning incense greets the visitor. A 
Buddhist monk in a brown robe is usually found meditating at an elaborate altar 
decked with red candles, flowers, fruits and more Buddha statues. In the back 
yard is a garden where worshipers can burn incense or simply sit on benches and 
meditate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bat Nha Meditation Institute at 12362 West St. is the home of a 
2,000-member congregation led by Thich Nguyen Tri. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials want the temple shut down, arguing that it is operating in 
a residential neighborhood without a permit. Last month, City Atty. John Shaw 
filed a lawsuit against the congregation in an Orange County Superior Court to 
stop its operation. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said that neighbors have complained about the traffic and 
noise caused by the temple's operation over the past two years. City codes 
require that temples and other religious houses be built on at least one acre 
of land, and provide some kind of buffer between their buildings and nearby 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Shaw offered to drop the charges, but under strict conditions, 
including some requirements that temple officials say would violate their 
constitutional and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very sad," Nguyen Tri said Thursday. "I lost everything to the Communists 
in Vietnam. When I came to America, I thought I will have freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's settlement offer, for example, Nguyen Tri, who owns the 
house, would not be allowed to admit more than six people at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous and ridiculous," said Nho Trung Nguyen, an attorney 
representing the temple. "What if 20 people come to visit? Would the police 
come and take them to jail?" 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation must also remove the Buddha statue in the front yard, halt 
classes on Buddhism and completely cease celebrating religious holidays, such 
as Tet, Buddha's birthday and the Moon festival. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a gong that the group uses during religious rites would be 
removed, and a donation box would not be allowed inside the house. The group 
would be required to allow city code officials to inspect the property to 
confirm compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, in a letter to the congregation May 11, gave temple officials until 
today to respond to the settlement offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have indicated they wanted to settle and not get involved in a legal 
fight," Shaw said Thursday. "They have acknowledged that they have violated the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nguyen, the attorney, said that "there is no way, by reading this proposed 
settlement, that I would recommend that the temple signs it. It's clear-cut 
discrimination," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that it is unfair for city officials to prevent any form of holiday 
celebration and educational activity in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does that mean they can't talk to children about education? That they can not 
have friends to sit down at a dinner table to celebrate Tet festival, or 
Buddha's birthday?" Nguyen asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Dinsen said Thursday that some of the conditions, 
particularly the one limiting the number of people in the house, could not be 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can stop me from having more than six people in my house," Dinsen 
said. "So we can't stop them either." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the City Council allowed another Buddhist congregation, the Chua 
Duoc Su, to build a 1,500-square-foot temple in a residential neighborhood on 
Magnolia Avenue. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI MAKES COSMOS VISIBLE BY COMPUTER

<P>
 When Rognvald Garden wants to examine the red storm of Jupiter, the physics 
professor doesn't hike up the hill that is home to UC Irvine's new observatory. 
He simply flicks on his home computer, directs the telescope's robotics 
equipment to the correct coordinates and watches images from outer space flash 
onto his monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The observatory, which opened Thursday, cost $250,000 to build and includes a 
24-inch telescope complete with electronic cameras and computer connections. 
Instead of looking through an eyepiece, people view the telescopic images from 
computer monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, many people can look in the telescope at once," Garden said. "You 
can have 30 to 60 students looking through it at once, depending on the number 
of terminals available." 
</P>
<P>
 And with the help of advanced modems, UCI officials with the correct passwords 
can link up to the telescope from most any personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could be at home or be on the other side of the world and have access to 
the telescope," Garden said. "This offers more people more access." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the telescope is controlled by robotics, the observatory doesn't need 
to be staffed. The facility is near the University Hills housing development on 
the south end of campus. The telescope stands about five feet off the ground 
and is covered by a 20-foot dome. 
</P>
<P>
 The telescope will be used by astronomy students to gain a better 
understanding of outer space. "This is a teaching tool," Garden said. "It's not 
a research-quality telescope." 
</P>
<P>
 The university plans to store many of the images captured by the telescope on 
computer discs so that people without the observatory passwords can access 
information from their personal computers.SHELBY GRAD

 Officials for the Rancho Santiago College District will honor two alumni today 
for their service to the community by inducting them into the district's Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 During a private ceremony, district officials will recognize Anaheim 
firefighter Jerry D. Austin and Mary Halvorson, a dean at Rancho Santiago 
College, spokesman Dale Ruhe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin graduated from the college's Fire Academy program in 1978 and has 
worked for the Anaheim Fire Department as an arson investigator, fire education 
specialist and acting fire marshal. He was promoted to the rank of battalion 
chief in January. Austin lives in Long Beach and is pursuing a master's degree 
in public administration, Ruhe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Halvorson graduated from Rancho Santiago in 1978 and worked as a nurse for 
several years before returning to the school to teach. She later became the 
assistant dean of applied arts and sciences, a position she has held for two 
years, Ruhe said. 
</P>
<P>
 An accomplished pilot, Halvorson is a member of the Flying Samaritans, a group 
that runs medical clinics in Mexico. She has also worked with single mothers at 
Casa Teresa Home in Orange. She lives in Santa Ana. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; SMOOTH FIRE DEPT. TRANSITION IS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the City Council's decision this week to turn Buena Park Fire 
Department over to the county, city officials said they are focusing on a 
smooth transition and change the public hardly will notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Herb R. Jewell said the city's fire equipment will be sold to the 
county, but the chrome yellow fire trucks will remain the same color -- until 
they need a paint job. Only then will they be painted red to match the county's 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other equipment, however, will be renumbered and identified with the Orange 
County Fire Department seal, Jewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewell also said city firefighters' uniforms will be a different color: As 
employees of the county they will wear light blue shirts, instead of dark blue 
shirts, and will bear the county's uniform patch. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attitude is you're going to have the same fire stations, the same fire 
stations staffed and opened, you're going to have competent fire personnel and 
have many of the current Buena Park firefighters" working in the city, Jewell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief said he doesn't expect "any operational difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed this week to contract fire services beginning Oct. 1, a move 
expected to save Buena Park about $1.2 million over the next four years. The 
city has three fire stations, which will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement requires the county to add a fourth firefighter to one truck 
company but eliminates one of the city's four engine companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch was opposed by some residents, who vowed to fight the council's 4-1 
decision. Opponents, including Councilman Don R. Griffin, who cast the 
dissenting vote, said they feared the move would decrease service and cost the 
city more money for fire services in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters say the city will save money and maintain the current level of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin O'Rourke said that as a result of the contract approval, 
the council isn't expected to approve next year's general-fund budget until 
mid-July, a 30-day delay. O'Rourke said the extra time is needed to make budget 
adjustments and for the council to make policy decisions on what to do with the 
cost savings of contracting fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the changeover to county fire service, Jewell said, city 
firefighters will begin taking physical exams in July, a county requirement to 
be hired. The city's 55 firefighters will be offered jobs with the county 
providing they pass the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewell also said that in early August, orientation and training sessions will 
be held to inform city firefighters about county Fire Department policies and 
procedures. City Fire Department records, such as training and fire prevention 
records and dispatch materials, also will be transferred to the county, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewell, who is expected to be offered a battalion chief's position, said that 
the city's contract with the county will provide an adequate level of fire 
protection and paramedic service to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision to contract fire services "brings a closure to three 
years of a continual downhill slide in fire protection and paramedic service 
that have been brought on by elements external to the city," Jewell said. DEBRA

 To avoid potential lawsuits, the city is returning responsibility to the state 
for maintaining two state roads, Pacific Coast Highway and Beach Boulevard, 
where they pass through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Wednesday unanimously voted to end a 24-year agreement 
between the city and state.That pact, first signed in 1970, allowed the city 
autonomy in maintaining the two busy thoroughfares. The state, under the 
agreement, has reimbursed the city for the cost of the highway maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state has repeatedly refused to assume legal responsibility for the 
two roads within the city. City Atty. Gail Hutton on Wednesday night warned the 
council that Huntington Beach could face ruinous lawsuits if someone 
successfully sued while alleging faulty roads as the cause of their accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the council, Hutton said the city in 1983 had to pay an $85,000 
judgment to one bicyclist who hit a pothole on Beach Boulevard and who 
successfully sued. Last year, Hutton said, the city fortunately avoided what 
she called a "near catastrophic loss" in a $29-million lawsuit brought by 
another bicyclist who was injured on Pacific Coast Highway in the city. A jury 
ruled against the bicyclist in that case, but nonetheless the city wound up 
paying $345,459 in litigation costs, Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council action Wednesday directed that a letter immediately be sent to the 
state to end the maintenance agreement. The city-state agreement allows either 
side to unilaterally drop the pact with 30 days' written notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Huntington Beach must have been absolutely insane (in 1970) to 
sign that contract," Councilman Victor Leipzig said. "It leaves us open to such 
liability."BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CITY PLEDGES $900,000 TO HOUSING GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council and Redevelopment Agency has pledged $900,000 to the 
nonprofit Civic Center Barrio Housing Corporation to buy and renovate 18 
blighted apartments on West Myrtle Street and train residents to manage them. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $400,000 in federal funds controlled by the city will be spent to 
buy and administer the three six-unit buildings in the 1900 and 2000 blocks of 
West Myrtle Street, according the council's decision this week. Another 
$470,000 in redevelopment money earmarked for low- and moderate-income housing 
will pay for repairs, city Housing Manager Patricia Whittaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate goal would be to help Civic Center Barrio control as much of 
that block as possible," Whittaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit housing group will train residents to be on-site managers and 
help tenants with child care and job training, Whittaker said. The program is 
an effort to turn neighborhoods around and address the root causes of crime and 
blight, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the city received a U.S. Department of Justice "Weed and Seed" grant 
to help tackle crime in its most troubled neighborhoods and develop social 
programs there. Myrtle Street was one of the highest crime areas in the city 
and the impetus for the grant application, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the grant was spent on "weeding," but the Civic Center 
Barrio project approved this week begins to address the "seeding" of the area. 
Civic Center Barrio hopes to ultimately own 96 apartments on that stretch of 
Myrtle Street and train resident managers for them, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 No current residents will be evicted, Whittaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate vote, the council approved $320,000 in grants to 
Westminster-based American Lodging -- the transitional housing arm of Shelter 
for the Homeless -- for the purchase of a 10-unit building at 406 W. Washington 
Ave. in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants, formerly homeless, will pay a modest amount of rent and receive case 
management and job-hunting assistance as they work their way back into stable 
living situations, Whittaker said.LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CHAPMAN BOARD PICKS 3 NEW TRUSTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three new members have been appointed to the Board of Trustees at Chapman 
University, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees selected Jack Lindquist, recently retired president of Disneyland; 
David C. Henley, president of a newspaper publishing company, and Gloria 
Peterson, a former Chapman Alumna of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindquist, of Newport Beach, retired as president of Disneyland in November, 
Chapman spokeswoman Ruth Wardwell said. He worked with the theme park for 39 
years, in both marketing and administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman awarded Lindquist an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1991, 
Wardwell said. He graduated from USC, where he studied advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson recently appointed Lindquist to the California Tourism 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, heads the Henley Publishing Corp., which publishes a daily newspaper 
that serves western Nevada, Wardwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired brigadier general in the Nevada National Guard, Henley had joined 
the Army in 1957 and specialized in military intelligence, Wardwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, of Newport Beach, majored in journalism at USC and later became the 
director of that program at the university. He also directed journalism 
programs at the University of Wyoming and Cal Poly Pomona, Wardwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, the third trustee, graduated from Chapman in 1940, Wardwell said. 
She has been active in the Chapman Alumni Assn. and was named Alumna of the 
Year in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 After working as a social worker, Peterson became an elementary school teacher 
in Los Angeles, Wardwell said. Peterson later became a training teacher at 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The new members bring the total number of trustees to 35. ALICIA DI RADO

LAWYER DEFENDS BEQUEST TO HIM BY CLIENT; COURTS: 98-YEAR-OLD WANTED HIM TO HAVE 
$3.5-MILLION DOLLAR GIFT, JAMES GUNDERSON SAYS IN TRIAL OF CIVIL SUIT BROUGHT 
BY MAN'S RELATIVES. EX-PARTNER BACKS TESTIMONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 James D. Gunderson, the Orange County lawyer accused of profiting from his 
clients' estates, testified Thursday that he received a $3.5-million tax-free 
bequest because his client, a 98-year-old man, wanted him to have the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Merrill A. Miller, a Leisure World resident who died in February, 
1992, allege in a civil suit that Gunderson coerced or deceived the bedridden 
Miller into leaving him the largest single portion of an $18-million estate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gunderson insisted that it was always Miller's wish that he should inherit 
20% of all his stock in Abbott Laboratories, which was valued at about $17 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson testified that he shared a close friendship with Miller and was a 
beneficiary of his estate as early as 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 But the relatives' lawyer, John Westover of Phoenix, is contending that 
Gunderson's inheritance grew over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Gunderson instructed Ellsworth DeWeese -- his close friend, a former 
law partner and his son's godfather -- to draw up Miller's will and trust to 
hide any impropriety, Westover argued. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWeese testified Thursday that Miller told him he wanted Gunderson to have a 
significant portion of his estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Westover quizzed Gunderson about another inheritance, of $250,000 received 
from a Leisure World woman who had been declared senile about four months 
before Gunderson prepared her last will and testament, making himself the 
estate's major beneficiary. The other heirs sued, and Gunderson reached a 
confidential, out-of-court settlement with them that included a payment by 
Gunderson of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's lawyer, Stuart Lesansky, said he plans to prove that Gunderson 
also deserved that bequest. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-jury hearing, before Superior Court Judge Byron K. McMillan, is the 
latest in a series of actions that have followed a November, 1992, report in 
The Times detailing how Gunderson had inherited millions of dollars in cash, 
stock and real estate from clients whose wills and trusts were prepared by him 
and other members of his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The inheritances appeared to conflict with a longstanding California Supreme 
Court ruling that anything more than a "modest" gift to an attorney preparing a 
will raised suspicion of impropriety. The justices in that landmark case 
decided that a $20,000 bequest was excessive, and ordered the inheritance 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after The Times articles appeared, the State Bar of California 
publicly disclosed that it was conducting an investigation of Gunderson's legal 
practice. Gunderson surrendered his license to practice law in California in 
January of this year, after State Bar prosecutors announced that they were 
prepared to file conflict-of-interest charges that could have led to his 
possible disbarment. Gunderson's lawyers said the State Bar allegations were 
not related to any inheritances and that the lawyer retired from his practice 
because of failing health.

MAN DENIES MURDER CHARGES IN DEATH OF GIRLFRIEND'S TODDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A house painter pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder in connection with the 
death of his girlfriend's 22-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Laudenback, 32, of Newport Beach was arrested after Tyler Jaeger died 
March 25 at Hoag Hospital.A preliminary autopsy showed that the child, who 
Laudenback was baby-sitting, had suffered severe blows to his liver and 
pancreas caused by a blunt instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing was set for July 21 in Municipal Court in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback pleaded not guilty to felony child abuse last month. Authorities 
upgraded the charges to murder a week later and raised his bail to $250,000. He 
remains in custody, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One week before Tyler's death, Laudenback brought the child to Hoag Hospital 
for treatment of a fractured skull, authorities said. He said at the time that 
Tyler, the son of 22-year-old Karey Jaeger, had fallen accidentally and bumped 
his head.  
</P>
<P>
 Laudenback often baby-sat Tyler while Karey Jaeger went to work in the San 
Gabriel Valley. He was arrested March 25, the day Tyler died, after police said 
they learned of suspicious bruising on Tyler's body and the earlier head 
injury.

STATE BOARD UPHOLDS CUT IN FORMER CITY MANAGER'S PENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $29,000 severance package was used improperly to inflate pension benefits 
for former City Manager William O. Talley Jr., but he can keep $45,000 he has 
already been paid, state officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Talley's salary increased from $97,390 to $159,109 shortly before he resigned 
in September, 1987, after the Anaheim City Council put him on notice that he 
was about to be fired. Talley's outgoing salary helped boost his monthly 
pension to nearly $8,000, according to state records. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Public Employees' Retirement System concluded in November, 1992, 
that a $29,371 lump-sum payment at the time of his resignation was wrongly used 
to calculate his retirement benefit, and reduced Talley's monthly pension to 
just over $6,000, Assistant General Counsel Kayla J. Gillan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talley challenged that decision, but the PERS Board of Administration on 
Wednesday approved the finding of an administrative law judge who endorsed the 
pension reduction. The judge, however, said Talley does not have to return the 
$45,920 he has already been paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the allowance was reduced two years ago but the question was 
whether or not that reduction was appropriate, and the judge found that it 
was," Gillan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics call it "spiking": Government employees artificially increase their 
pensions by converting perquisites and benefits, such as unused vacation days, 
into an increased final-year salary that is later used to compute pension 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Talley and his retirement payments were cited prominently in a December, 1991, 
audit by state Controller Gray Davis, who blasted former government officials 
who "pig out" at the public's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Monica attorney Stephen H. Silver said Thursday it is wrong to 
characterize his client's retirement package as "spiking." He stressed that 
city officials at the time approved the deal, and he questioned the 
independence of the state board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering that the party that makes the decision is the same party that is 
prosecuting the action, I'm not surprised they wouldn't decide in our favor," 
said Silver, who said his client may appeal. "What Mr. Talley did was not 
unlawful. Everything he did was aboveboard." 
</P>
<P>
 PERS approved Talley's retirement package at the time, Silver said, "which is 
why (the judge) didn't allow PERS to recover any back pay. They knew about this 
for years and didn't do anything about this."

SANTA ANA CRACKS DOWN ON VIOLENT 6TH ST. GANG; CRIME: FOUR SUSPECTED MEMBERS 
ARE ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH ROBBERY SLAYINGS OF TWO MEN. 'THESE PEOPLE ARE 
TERRORISTS,' POLICE LT. ROBERT HELTON SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major crackdown on one of this city's most violent gangs, police have 
arrested four suspected members of the Sixth Street gang on suspicion of 
killing two men late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, police say, five other suspected members of the gang now in 
custody are under investigation for those crimes and various other robberies 
and homicides committed in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are terrorists," Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said of the 
gang, which he said has been linked to five fatal shootings and more than 14 
robberies between Nov. 1 and Feb. 25. "Their removal from the community can be 
nothing but a plus. They're not going to be out there freely running around 
robbing and shooting people for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent arrests represent a significant escalation of the department's 
anti-gang efforts that began last December. Until then, Helton said, most of 
the Sixth Street gang's crimes -- which date back to the mid-1980s -- were 
perpetrated against other gangs. But two incidents in December, he said, showed 
a change in that pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 17, 1993, Rogelio R. Millan, 20, was shot to death while sitting with 
friends on the porch of his fiancee's house on Walnut Street. Police determined 
that the motive was robbery. Six days later, Benton C. Dunscombe, 25, was 
fatally shot in the chest while trying to flee from gang members trying to rob 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, you didn't have a gang out there taking out its hostilities 
on other gangs," Helton said of the Sixth Street group, which has about 40 
members and operates in a few square blocks near Santa Ana's Civic Center. 
"What you had was a gang resorting to street crimes and killing its victims." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a newly organized multi-agency task force called the Street 
Terrorist Offender Program, police began analyzing the spate of street 
robberies and killings in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 By linking the same weapon -- a .44-magnum revolver -- to both the Millan and 
Dunscombe killings, police eventually were able to identify four suspects. On 
May 12, they arrested Manuel Mendoza, 18, and an unidentified 15-year-old youth 
believed to have been the triggerman in both killings. Mendoza, who police say 
hid the murder weapon for the 15-year-old, was arrested on suspicion of being 
an accessory to murder. And on Tuesday, police arrested Alfonso Martinez, 19, 
and a 17-year-old boy, both reputed Sixth Street gang members believed to have 
participated in the Dunscombe killing and an earlier carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Helton said, three other 15-year-old members of the gang already 
in custody on suspicion of either probation violation or robbery are being 
investigated for suspected roles in the Millan and Dunscombe slayings. And two 
other gang members, in custody since January on suspicion of robbery and parole 
violation, have been linked to yet another gang slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton promises that police will keep the pressure on the gang.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will pursue these cases aggressively and make other arrests where 
possible," he said.

LACK OF SOLID CLUES IN TORREZ KILLING FRUSTRATES POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months after discovering the body of 20-year-old Cathy Torrez stuffed in 
the trunk of her car in a hospital parking lot, police say they are no closer 
to learning the identity of her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 While reluctant to release the scanty details of the assault, police will say 
the Cal State Fullerton student was attacked in her car but was not sexually 
assaulted.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Manuel E. Ortega said that after following every lead and 
tracking even the most unlikely rumor, police don't know why Torrez was killed, 
or by whom. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez's body was discovered Feb. 19 in the trunk of her car, which was parked 
at Placentia Linda Community Hospital. She had last been seen seven days 
earlier, when she left work at Sav-On at 8 p.m., about a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say she died of multiple stab wounds sometime between Feb. 12, when her 
family reported her missing, and Feb. 14, when hospital employees first noticed 
the car in the parking lot but didn't realize it belonged to a missing woman. 
Police would not identify what kind of weapon was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokeswoman Corrine Loomis said a search of the car yielded no usable 
fingerprints, but police did find traces of hair and fiber that could be used 
to link or eliminate suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical examiner's report turned up no physical signs of sexual assault, 
Loomis said, but there were signs of a struggle inside Torrez's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were in disarray and damaged inside the car, and there was damage to 
the interior," Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 While police officials in the past speculated that Torrez probably knew her 
attacker, they do not rule out a random attack or robbery as a motive.  
</P>
<P>
 Police have received about 100 phone calls and letters from people who say 
they have information about the killing. All of these tips lead nowhere, a fact 
that frustrates Ortega and the rest of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega also said he was disappointed that a reward of more than $32,000 hasn't 
prompted someone with solid information to step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe the perpetrator could keep it a secret this long," Ortega 
said. "Or that those who know something could."  
</P>
<P>
 With no witnesses or new evidence, police are left with reviewing what little 
information they have. Lt. Bob Jones, who took over as head of the 
investigation division about one month ago, said he plans to "walk through" all 
the evidence with investigators to see what might have been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe, because I wasn't involved from the beginning, I can look at the 
evidence with a different perspective," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, three months since the day Torrez's body was discovered, her 
mother, Mary Bennett of Placentia, said she "can't put closure to her death." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've accepted that she's not going to come through the door and ask, 'What's 
for dinner?' or, 'Did anybody call?' but I can't accept that someone left her 
out there like that."

MARINES PROPOSE HOUSING AT SAN CLEMENTE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Marine Corps wants to build housing for Camp Pendleton officers and their 
families on a 40-acre site where the late President Richard Nixon once had a 
Western White House office compound. 
</P>
<P>
 The military proposes to put the 128 duplex units on San Mateo Point next to 
several San Clemente neighborhoods next year.The project would cost $5 million 
to $10 million and take 12 to 18 months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente City Planner Jim Barnes said Thursday that the project will be 
reviewed in public meetings and before neighborhood associations, including 
Breakers, Cotton Point Estates and Cyprus Shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Community comment on the housing plan will be submitted to the Marine Corps in 
July. According to Barnes, probable concerns include landscaping, 
transportation and who will pay for water and sewer services. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-owned land has been vacant since 1979, when a Coast Guard 
station was shut down, but has been used for field training, Marine spokesman 
Lt. David Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the project would help remedy a shortage of housing on base. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on 32 acres would leave the rest of the site for landscaping and 
a park. The site lies on the border of Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of working with the city is to provide a concept appropriate to 
all parties involved," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue will be discussed at a city Planning Commission meeting on May 31 
and at a City Council meeting on June 15. Barnes said he is also seeking 
opinions on the project from city departments such as transportation and 
housing.

OCEAN SWIM FIGURE PLEADS GUILTY TO MALICIOUS MISCHIEF 
</P>

 A Costa Mesa man who accompanied his young daughter last year on a publicized 
two-mile ocean swim pleaded guilty to malicious mischief Thursday in tearing 
the head off a neighborhood child's toy horse, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irv Krespi was sentenced in Municipal Court here to three years of informal 
probation and ordered to pay restitution and continue with counseling, the 
prosecutor said. Krespi was also found to be in violation of his existing 
probation, which stemmed from a guilty plea last year to a spousal abuse 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Krespi gained nationwide attention when he and his daughter Ariel, now 5, made 
the swim. Krespi said he had been found to have terminal cancer and trained 
with Ariel because he wanted her to have a special memory of their time 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the swim Krespi was arrested on charges of misdemeanor spousal 
abuse and resisting arrest stemming from a fight with his estranged wife. He 
pleaded guilty in September, but maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day he entered that plea he got in an argument with a neighbor who 
accused him of calling her obscene names and tearing the head off her child's 
stuffed toy.  
</P>
<P>
 Krespi pleaded not guilty to those charges in November. On Thursday, as the 
case headed to trial, he pleaded guilty to malicious mischief, a misdemeanor 
offense, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike Pear.  
</P>
<P>
 Krespi said Thursday that he is living in a Costa Mesa motel with his 
daughter. He said that he has become the victim of his own celebrity and that 
he was unfairly prosecuted.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he pleaded guilty to the malicious mischief charge because he ran out 
of money, and that the stuffed horse belonged to his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes to a certain point where there are so many charges you try to make a 
deal. . . . I can only borrow so much money," Krespi said. "If I had the money 
it would have gone full blast to jury trial and I would have won hands down." 
</P>
<P>
 Krespi said he pleaded guilty to the spousal abuse charge last year because he 
wanted to get on with his training for daughter, who has been hurt by the 
string of charges, Krespi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By this year she could have been ready to do Catalina Island to the mainland. 
Her training stopped because of all this," Krespi said.

STATE HIGH COURT AGREES TO CONSIDER REINSTATING GIONIS CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court agreed Thursday to consider reinstating Dr. Thomas 
Gionis' conviction on charges that he hired thugs to assault his estranged 
wife, the daughter of the late actor John Wayne, during a child custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis' 1992 conviction and five-year prison sentence were overturned in 
February by the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, which said the 
prosecutor made an improper verbal attack on Gionis' lawyer during the trial, 
and found the trial judge had improperly allowed testimony by an attorney whom 
Gionis had consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling would have entitled Gionis to a new trial. But the state's high 
court, which has the power to reinstate the conviction, said Thursday it had 
granted a prosecution request for a hearing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not very surprised," said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. 
Evans. "I'm just pleased that the justices felt there were reviewable issues, 
as we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis and his attorney, William J. Kopeny, could not be reached for comment. 
Wayne also could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 A first trial for Gionis ended in a mistrial. During a second trial in 1992, 
he was convicted of four felony counts stemming from the attack on Aissa Wayne 
and her boyfriend, Roger Luby, outside Luby's Newport Beach estate in October, 
1988. The attack allegedly was prompted by the couple's custody dispute over 
daughter Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne was tied up and thrown face first onto a garage floor, which caused head 
injuries. The two attackers pistol-whipped Luby and slashed his Achilles' 
tendons before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court criticized former prosecutor Jeoffrey L. Robinson for his 
"vitriolic rebuttal and personal attacks" on Gionis' defense attorney, Bruce 
Cutler, who is known for his flamboyant style and his defense of New York 
mobster John Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court also found that the trial judge improperly allowed jurors 
to hear incriminating testimony from a family law attorney who once represented 
Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
 State attorneys argued that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming and said 
the appellate court abused its proper function by undermining the independence 
of the trial judge, and said a review was necessary. But Kopeny has argued in 
court records that his client did not get a fair trial, and the appellate 
court's findings were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gionis remains free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other men have been convicted of their roles in the attack. Private 
investigator Oded Daniel Gal was sentenced to four years in prison for hiring 
the two men who carried out the attack on Wayne and Luby. Jeffrey Bouey pleaded 
guilty of assault and conspiracy, testified for the prosecution and was 
sentenced to nine months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouey said he held the gun to Wayne's head while his partner, Jerrel 
Hintergardt, carried out the attack. Hintergardt was sentenced to eight years 
in prison.

 Cesarean births -- Because of an editing error, a story in Thursday's Times 
incorrectly reported the number of babies born by Cesarean section in the 
United States in 1992. The correct figure is 896,289, according to a report by 
Public Citizen's Health Research Group. In addition, state health officials 
dispute the Public Citizen report's finding that 21.8% of all California babies 
were born by Cesarean section in 1992. The state puts the figure at 21.6%
