'ROSEANNE,' 'SEINFELD' SIDEKICKS WIN EMMYS; AWARDS: METCALF, RICHARDS WIN 
SUPPORTING HONORS FOR SECOND STRAIGHT YEAR. CBS TOPS NOMINATIONS.

 Back-to-back Emmy wins for "Roseanne" actress Laurie Metcalf and "Seinfeld" 
actor Michael Richards highlighted the early winners in the 46th annual 
nighttime Emmy Awards on Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Metcalf, who also won for best supporting actress in a comedy last year, 
collected the honors in the same category for her work on the ABC program, 
during televised ceremonies at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Also for the second consecutive year, the Emmy for best supporting actor in a 
comedy went to Richards for his portrayal of the eccentric neighbor, Kramer, on 
the NBC show. 
</P>
<P>
 A tribute to actress Jessica Tandy was also planned as part of the ceremonies. 
Tandy, an Oscar and Tony winner, died Sunday at age 85. She was nominated for 
an Emmy this year as best actress in a miniseries or a special for her role in 
a CBS television movie, "To Dance With the White Dog." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS headed into Sunday night's awards leading in both nominations and trophies 
already awarded in creative arts categories. 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue," the ABC series to beat with a record 26 nominations, jumped off 
to a solid start by collecting three trophies in Saturday's non-televised 
creative arts ceremony, a prelude to the main event. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS headed into the weekend's awards ceremonies with the most nominations, 92, 
and carried off 14 trophies in the creative categories. It was followed in 
total nominations by ABC with 73, NBC with 66 and HBO with 36. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Emmy awards contention was highlighted by "NYPD" star David 
Caruso's decision to leave the hit drama after one season, and the missed Emmy 
nomination for "Home Improvement's" Tim Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was co-hosted by two women: Patricia Richardson, an Emmy nominee 
for "Home Improvement," and comedian Ellen DeGeneres, star of "Ellen." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC captured nine awards in Saturday's preliminary event, followed by NBC with 
eight, PBS with seven and the Disney Channel with six. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting trophies given out Saturday for guest appearances on comedy and drama 
series went to Faye Dunaway for a role on "Columbo," Eileen Heckart for "Love & 
War," Richard Kiley for "Picket Fences" and Martin Sheen for "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Emmy winners were chosen by Academy of Television Arts & Sciences members 
through peer-review panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's show was expected to be seen in 85 foreign countries by an estimated 
record overseas audience of more than 550 million, the academy said. Countries 
signed up to receive the program for the first time were Germany, Austria, 
Sweden, Norway and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC had an exclusive four-year U.S. broadcast deal for the ceremony, but the 
network agreed to relinquish its hold two years early, after CBS, NBC and Fox 
executives boycotted last year's Emmys in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in 1995, the broadcast will rotate annually among the four networks. 
As determined by lottery, Fox will show the awards next year, followed by ABC, 
CBS and NBC in subsequent years.

 NO POGS ALLOWED: They're stackable. They're whackable. But they're no longer 
welcome on school grounds at Park Oaks elementary in Thousand Oaks. . . . 
Teachers and administrators banned Pogs after too many students complained 
about losing them during Pogs games -- sort of a hybrid of shooting marbles and 
flipping coins."It is just like banning gambling," Principal Rachelle Morga 
said. . . . Sixth-grader Ryan Hansen has little patience for the whiners who 
brought on the ban. "If they put their money in," he said, "they have to be 
ready to lose."

 SEEING RED: Taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings has blistered county supervisors 
for their handsome salaries and an array of other matters. . . . Now, he's 
taking issue with how they halt long-winded public speakers who exceed their 
five-minute allotment at the lectern. "Such an interruption for the uninitiated 
is disconcerting," Robings wrote to the board. His recommendation: install a 
speaker's timer that flashes yellow when time runs short and red when time's 
up. . . . Next time Robings rises to speak, says one county wag, "it'll be red 
light, red light!"

 FICUS FRACAS: Mushroom trees have lined California Street in Ventura for a 
quarter of a century. But they soon could be reduced to mulch because city 
leaders say the ficus topiary doesn't fit in with changes planned for downtown 
(B1). . . . Instead, they want to put in palm trees, similar to the ones that 
stalk around Ventura City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 CYBER COLLEGE: Cal Lutheran is wired for the leap into cyberspace. . . . Over 
the summer, work crews laid 58 miles of fiber-optic cable connecting classrooms 
and dorm rooms alike (B4). Beginning next month, the Thousand Oaks university 
will bring all 3,500 students, faculty and staff on line to CLUnet. Soon 
they'll be firing off e-mail and surfing the Internet.

TAILHOOK PLAINTIFF'S LAWSUIT GOES TO TRIAL; HARASSMENT: FORMER NAVY LIEUTENANT 
WHO BLEW THE WHISTLE IN THE 1991 LAS VEGAS CONVENTION SEX SCANDAL FAILS TO 
REACH A SETTLEMENT WITH THE HOTEL WHERE MILITARY AVIATORS PARTIED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The whistle-blower in the Tailhook scandal is taking her lawsuit to trial 
today after failing to reach a settlement with the hotel where the 1991 
convention was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Navy Lt. Paula Coughlin alleged that the Tailhook organization of Navy 
and Marine aviators and the Las Vegas Hilton were negligent in allowing her to 
be groped during the boisterous parties at the convention. She is seeking 
unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailhook and Coughlin agreed to a settlement Thursday but disclosed no 
details. Lawyers for Coughlin and the Hilton met briefly Friday but were unable 
to reach a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a 500-person witness list and motions that were measured "by the 
pound," U.S. District Judge Philip Pro had encouraged both sides to look for a 
possible settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin, 32, was an admiral's aide when she complained she was sexually 
assaulted at the convention. More than 80 women later alleged that they, too, 
were fondled as they were forced down a gantlet of drunken revelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy and Marine Corps pursued 140 harassment cases, but none led to a 
court-martial. Coughlin resigned from the Navy in February, saying "covert 
attacks" and the strain from the case made it impossible for her to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro ruled last week that a Pentagon report on the convention cannot be used as 
evidence. The report is a summary of events, and Pro ruled that many of the 
conclusions were based on hearsay testimony of people not subject to 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen other women have sued Tailhook and the hotel. Some contended that they 
were assaulted at the 1990 convention, and again in 1991. Those cases are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have said many incidents that took place the night of Sept. 
7, 1991, were consensual. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton attorney Eugene Wait filed court documents last month contending that 
Coughlin had her legs shaved at a Tailhook party, then returned later wearing a 
miniskirt and tank top. Coughlin has denied attending that party.

WATER'S LOBBYING NETS A $3-MILLION WINDFALL; GRANT: REPRESENTATIVE'S EFFORTS 
HELPED REVERSE EARLIER SNUB BY LABOR DEPARTMENT. MONEY WILL AID JOB CREATION, 
TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters, through personal lobbying, has helped obtain $3 million in 
Labor Department funds for a South-Central Los Angeles riot recovery 
organization she was instrumental in launching and that weeks earlier had been 
denied money from the same agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funding, which still faces City Council action, is being hailed by 
Councilman Mike Hernandez as a big boost for an impoverished inner-city 
neighborhood. But Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, in whose district the program 
would be centered, says he has concerns about a lack of competitive bidding for 
the grant and about the limited track record of the private, nonprofit group 
that is slated to receive the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant calls for the opening of a youth job-training and placement center 
near Manchester and Vermont avenues by Community Build Inc., which was touted 
by Waters (D-Los Angeles) after the 1992 civil unrest as a grass-roots 
alternative to the much-criticized Rebuild L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grant strikes me as rather unusual," said Ridley-Thomas, who has had 
several clashes with Waters in the past over South Los Angeles development 
projects. "It's a red flag that it's no-bid. It will be a red flag for a number 
of members of the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, who was responsible last year for freeing funds for the $50-million 
federal training program as part of an otherwise unrelated Midwest flood 
disaster relief bill, says she is pleased with helping win funds for Community 
Build. "I'll support any organization that's trying to get some money for our 
city, my district and our area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a competitive bid process, 16 communities across the nation, including 
Los Angeles, were recently awarded an average of $3 million each from the Labor 
Department to establish coordinated programs to attack such inner-city youth 
problems as limited job opportunities, drug and gang involvement and teen-age 
pregnancy. The program, called Youth Fair Chance, is aimed at improving 
long-range opportunities for residents aged 14 to 30 who live in impoverished 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 communities submitted applications, according to the Labor 
Department, and the winning bidders were selected on such criteria as the 
quality of the proposed project and the level of poverty in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Build, seeking funding in an Inglewood neighborhood, was not among 
the 25 finalists, according to Ray Uhalde, deputy assistant secretary of the 
Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 winners were announced in late June. A couple of weeks later, Uhalde 
said, department officials decided to use monies for the new fiscal year that 
began July 1 to award Community Build a no-bid, discretionary grant to operate 
a Youth Fair Chance Plus pilot program focusing on job creation and training at 
a site at Manchester and Vermont avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Uhalde said that in making the decision, department officials considered both 
Waters' input and the needs of the riot-scarred Manchester-Vermont 
neighborhood, which has a 35% poverty rate. "Yes, we were very well aware of 
the interest of the congresswoman and her active support for the project," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Community Build center will have a stronger focus on jobs than other Fair 
Chance centers and will give federal officials a chance to test whether such 
programs bring results, Uhalde said. "Given the riots and earthquakes and 
Congresswoman Waters' advocacy for a job component, it seemed like the right 
program in the right place in the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Uhalde also acknowledged that Community Build has limited experience in 
running job-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do have some experience in jobs programs, certainly not of this scale," 
the Washington official said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a Community Build proposal submitted to the city, the agency 
found full-time jobs for 60 youths during a 12-month period beginning in June, 
1993. In addition, it supplied assistance for child care, transportation or 
clothing to 150 youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Build President Brenda Shockley said in an interview that the 
organization currently helps find about 20 jobs a month for graduates of job 
training programs run by other organizations. The jobs are in such fields as 
cable television and banking, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are already a number of job trainers in the target area," Shockley 
said. "We'll coordinate these services and provide the part that's missing. Job 
placement, job retention case management and life skills management -- 'how-to' 
skills, such as what do you do when something happens after you have a job. For 
example, the car breaking down on the way to work." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the grant may also be used to provide stipends for participants of 
job training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shockley acknowledged that Waters used her influence to help win the money for 
the Leimert Park-based agency, which has shown limited progress in fulfilling 
its initial list of ambitious post-riot projects, most notably a Ben & Jerry's 
ice cream plant that has yet to materialize in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Waters was very, very vigorous in her support, making sure more funds 
came to this area," said Shockley. "She was very instrumental in directing 
these resources and identifying and assisting the Department of Labor in 
identifying Community Build." 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative federal contract faces City Council approval because the Labor 
Department wants the city to help administer the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was scheduled to be heard Aug. 29 by the Community and Economic 
Development Committee, but was postponed until today at the request of 
Councilwoman Rita Walters, portions of whose district lie in Community Build's 
target area. Walters says she needed more time to study the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity was not afforded me before it came to committee to even see 
it, let alone study it," she said. "I want to see what the proposal is, what it 
purports to do, how it plans to operate and how many people it will serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas expressed concerns about Community Build receiving the federal 
grant after losing out in the nationwide competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Job training programs, economic development programs, entrepreneurial 
programs are all critically important," he said. "It is equally important to 
have such programs operated by entities and individuals that have a track 
record in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas said that no-bid contracts automatically raise the question of 
whether the best agency has been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Community Development Department has recommended that the City 
Council give its approval. Hernandez, who chairs the council's economic 
development committee, says that regardless of the way Community Build was 
selected, he supports the program because of the unemployment problem in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he has no problem with the fact that Community Build has 
relatively little experience in the field. "It gives us an opportunity to be 
innovative and different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with Maxine," Hernandez said. "I'm sure she is aware 
it's her program, her reputation" on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Waters: "There has not been a lot of money or resources that have been 
directed at our area since we've been hit so hard by the earthquake and the 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing unusual about me working hard to get resources," she added. 
"There are no problems that should get in the way of young people getting 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Community Build and Rebuild L.A., the private riot recovery agency that was 
established at the request of city and state officials, were each granted $3 
million in federal funds to undertake their tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 While RLA has drawn much attention -- and flak -- for its lofty goals and 
meager successes, Community Build has received little scrutiny since it 
announced its own far-ranging but subsequently unfulfilled goals, which 
included the ice cream plant and conversion of a 352-room hotel into senior 
citizen housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shockley said Ben & Jerry's has given Community Build coupons for free pints 
of ice cream and may supply ice cream carts for a small youth entrepreneurial 
training program. But plans for the plant have not moved forward. "Their own 
fiscal realities were such that they weren't in a position to expand," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Community Build is currently administering earthquake repair 
assistance and home loan programs and has purchased the site of a supermarket 
in Leimert Park that burned during the riots to construct a 12,000-square-foot 
commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the organization, along with Waters, sought to block a 
development supported by Ridley-Thomas along Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opposed to a $10-million-plus First Interstate Bank proposal to build an 
ambitious low-income housing and retail complex, Community Build offered to 
purchase the bank's option on the land, suggesting the bank instead join with 
Community Build to develop a strictly commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank "can take my check for $90,000," said Waters at the time, referring 
to the organization's offer. "I'll give it to them tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank refused and its project continues to move forward with a decision on 
an architect due this fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new federal grant, Community Build proposes purchasing and 
renovating a 5,000-square-foot building at 8730 Vermont Ave. for its 
young-adult resource center, coordinating activities with a nearby federally 
supported alternative high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Build says it also plans to work with area colleges, unions, 
hospitals and the YMCA to provide job and recreation opportunities for school 
dropouts and adults aged 22 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city program, which received a $3-million grant in the 
nationwide competition, will serve youngsters in the Westlake area from a 
center in the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce building, due to be vacated 
in October. Among the organizations that will help operate the center are the 
L.A. Unified school district, Rebuild L.A., the Ketchum-Downtown YMCA and the 
Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment.

GEORGE RAMOS: SMALL VICTORIES MAKE A WORKING VACATION WORTH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Ruiz gave me that look when I told him I planned to stay in town for most 
of my summer vacation. "Well, if you're not jetting off to Europe," he offered, 
"maybe you'd like to help put L.A. back together?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," I replied, thinking Ruiz, who is a thoughtful Angeleno, was interested 
in his hometown's future and wanted to talk over ideas about improving the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I was only partly right. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of just talking, Ruiz, 44, a licensed contractor, literally put me to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with others he recruited with the same come-on, I helped rebuild three 
chimneys in South-Central and El Sereno that had been damaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. I cleared away trash and abandoned cars from two vacant lots in 
east Hollywood scarred by the rioting two years ago. And, in stifling 
three-digit heat, I helped repave the driveway of a couple in South Gate who 
couldn't pay for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the hardest, dirtiest vacation I ever took. But I'll remember it 
fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz's idea is simple. With all of the earthquake repair work going on in the 
city, there might be some opportunities to donate his expertise, time and 
materials to help those who couldn't afford repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposed to concentrate his efforts in the inner city and perhaps spread a 
little understanding and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's enough paying jobs out there to keep me busy but I thought it might 
be nice to just help out some people who need it," he explains. "If I hear of a 
job that needed doing, I can do it for nothing. Bring in some volunteers to 
help out and maybe, just maybe, some of us can talk to others in our city and 
figure out what's going on. What's wrong with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded like a neat idea. I'm no construction worker, but I was willing to 
be a volunteer in Ruiz's little enterprise. So were John Garcia, Marcus Little 
and Jason Kim, who all work for governmental agencies in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the four of us work in offices, we wondered if we could handle the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 At John Harris' modest stucco home in South-Central, our fingers ached as we 
hauled away bricks and trash. My right shoulder throbbed as we rebuilt Mabel 
Adams' chimney in El Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some small victories. 
</P>
<P>
 I got to drive a tow truck to haul away an abandoned car. I taught my fellow 
volunteers how to clean bricks since I had some experience at it as a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 As we made the rounds at Ruiz's direction, it was clear that many appreciate 
his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe you guys want to help me when you all should be in Hawaii or 
something," Harris said. "God bless you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you doing this?"asked Mabel Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" Ruiz replied. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the cold cups of water Harris gave us, Jason taught him how to 
say water in Korean. I still can't pronounce the word. 
</P>
<P>
 At the home of Salvador and Yolanda Alvarez in South Gate, Marcus was taught 
the proper way to make flour tortillas from scratch. In return, he instructed 
the couple from Guatemala on the "real way" to cook barbecue chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really good," Salvador Alvarez said after biting into a chicken wing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the work, we chatted among ourselves and others about little things -- 
like how to persuade one's kids to study harder in school or how to weed a back 
yard. There was no forced conversation about the city. Heck, we didn't even 
talk about O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh please," Mabel Adams thundered. "If he's into fixing chimneys for free, 
then I'll get interested in him." 
</P>
<P>
 We got some stares from the skeptical when our mission and purpose were 
explained. "Nobody does something for nothing," one man said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we did. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz is set to do more free work in the fall. More chimneys need to be 
rebuilt. More good vibes need to be sent out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may sound crazy, but we need each other," he says. "This is no time to 
ignore the city and just make money. Let's clean up the city and maybe we can 
clean up our own act in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I did manage to do some other things on my L.A. vacation. I drove the Century 
Freeway for the first time. I finally got around to seeing CityWalk at 
Universal Studios. For $1.35, I rode the Blue Line all the way to downtown Long 
Beach, which is undergoing a renaissance of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 When I returned to work at the newspaper, Ruiz called to ask what I had 
planned for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew what he wanted to hear and eventually gave in. "Football, football, 
football," I replied, ". . . and a chimney or two."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; A 
TRIP ABROAD 'MADE ME CLING TO MY ROOTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI MORRISON, The Washington-based National Council on U.S.-Arab Relations 
sponsored a national competition for high-school juniors to foster better 
understanding. Heidi Morrison, now a senior at Palisades High School, was one 
of 30 to win a Malcolm H. Kerr scholarship to study abroad. She and nine other 
students spent a month in Egypt this summer.

<P>
 I experienced culture shock while in Egypt. It wasn't necessarily the sights, 
the sounds, the smells or the tastes that surprised me most but rather the 
seeming lack of structure throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 I first observed it at the Cairo Airport. There was one small center for 
lost-luggage claims. People were crowded all around the counter shouting out 
their problems. The attendant did not focus on any one person but tried to 
please them all. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also no concept of lines. Many times I would be standing in what I 
thought was a line, when suddenly a cluster of Egyptians would appear in front 
of me and I would get really upset. But who is to say the American mind-set of 
order, of taking things one-by-one, is is correct? Maybe the Egyptians have a 
system of ordered chaos. Yet I couldn't help but wonder if their seeming lack 
of efficiency and management contributes to why Egypt is a Third World country. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest eye-openers came when we celebrated July 4 at the American 
High School in Cairo. For the first time on the trip, Americans were in the 
majority. The celebration was full of American food, clothes, talk, music and 
people. As a sign of respect toward Egyptian culture, we had dressed according 
to their conservative standards. But I donned shorts for the festivity and 
realized how much I had missed wearing them. It made me appreciate the American 
belief in freedom and individuality, even in the way we dress. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole Islamic idea of unity and assimilation, through conservative 
apparel, is in stark contrast. Muslims see everything in the "we" form, whereas 
Americans tend to see everything in the "I" form. Each view has its strengths 
and weaknesses. But, on the whole, I thought Muslims encompassed more of a 
good-will attitude. It was at the July 4 bash, back with all the other 
Americans, that I started worrying about theft. Yet when I was with Egyptians, 
I felt a sense of trust and morality and didn't worry about that. No one in my 
group in this poverty-stricken nation experienced any theft or other problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only real danger I encountered was in traffic. There are lane 
lines on the street (sometimes) and traffic signals (sometimes) but you'd 
hardly know it from all the constant honking. I think there might be some 
credence to the Egyptian saying that to get your driver's license you have to 
drive in reverse at 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, being in the minority made me cling to my roots. I felt a 
special pride at representing my country in a nation that is overall fond of 
Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 Before I went, I associated the Middle East with terms like aggression and 
violence. But I realized that was a misconception stemming from ignorance. I 
have a newfound understanding of Egypt, America and the world in general. We 
must look beyond each culture's differences and see our common bonds.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When policy-makers offer up solutions to the nation's social problems, 
education often is the No. 1 cure. Gangs and crime? Education. Drugs and 
alcohol? Education. Teen-age parenthood, unemployment, the economy? Better 
education, of course. Right on these pages, we describe how Bell Gardens seeks 
to send more of its residents to college (In the Neighborhood). Yet the people 
who do the educating are often treated as an underclass. Even in the best of 
situations, teacher salaries are low compared to those of lawyers or 
accountants, for instance. In the worst situations, teachers are grossly 
underpaid and work in overcrowded classrooms full of barely literate students. 
The result, at least in Los Angeles, is more teachers than ever quitting to 
teach elsewhere or take other kinds of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Working People, high school teacher Barry Smolin defends his 
profession. But why does teaching have such a hard time gaining respect? 
</P>
<P>
 "The most honored and respected professions in our society are those that have 
status based on power, privilege, prestige and possession," says Jon Johnston, 
a sociology and anthropology professor at Pepperdine University. "Teachers just 
don't have those four 'P's." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many teachers complain that they are not even treated as 
professionals. "We in this country think that teachers shouldn't be paid for 
the time they are not standing in front of their students, without paying 
attention to their need to keep abreast of their field," says Peggy Funkhouser, 
president of the Los Angeles Educational Partnership, a business-funded group 
that helps public schools and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors and lawyers must be current and companies wouldn't decentralize 
without massive training," Funkhouser says. "At the same time we're loading 
teachers up with responsibility, the school and education becomes the whipping 
boy (for society's problems)." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, teachers face a Catch-22 when it comes to earning respect. As long as 
the educational system is blamed for not meeting the needs of its students, 
teachers will be regarded as the problem and not the solution. But unless the 
community supports the public schools, teachers will not be able to overcome 
the perception that they are powerless to influence the next generation of 
adults, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plight of the teacher has everything to do with the cultural value shift 
in this country," Johnston says: "Our Judeo-Christian values have disintegrated 
and we have a humanistic model where good and right are relative. The schools 
are being called upon to meet many of the needs that were previously reinforced 
by the family. The schools are doing more because the family is not doing the 
job right, but the 'thank you' is not forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a problem of perception and schools don't have a public relations 
office," acknowledges Linda Clinard, staff development liaison at UC Irvine's 
Education Department. But "there are a lot of teachers who are individually 
respected and students will remember them."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON 
LIBERATING THEOLOGY FROM SEXUAL, RACIAL BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOUNG LEE HERTIG, The Rev. Dr. Young Lee Hertig is an assistant professor at 
Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena and pastor at the Korean Sae Han 
Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles. This article first appeared in the KoreAm 
Journal, a monthly publication based in Gardena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I feel unconnected with the word fem inist. This must be because I do not 
necessarily embrace all the issues that white middle- and upper-class women 
advocate in seeking to represent women across all cultures and classes. We 
cannot talk about gender issues without race and class because they are 
interlocking. The terms gender, man and woman are status- and class-loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 There are definite differences in the way white feminists and minority women 
experience life. Women of different classes and races struggle with different 
issues. Despite the feminists' impact of bringing some equilibrium in gender 
hierarchy, one of the shortfalls is that white women excluded minority women 
while seeking to be included in a man's world. 
</P>
<P>
 People dealing with gender issues need to be far more sensitive to racial and 
class variations without superimposing certain class agendas as if all women 
are represented. Likewise, I see deliberate blind spots in many men. Minority 
men tend to be hypersensitive and indignant about racism. However, when it 
comes to sexism, they tend to be oblivious. They conveniently hide behind a 
patriarchal culture. 
</P>
<P>
 While Christian women are being swept into a more progressive view on gender, 
what still haunts us are phrases like, "Women should be silent in the church" 
and "The woman should be submissive to the man." Patriarchal interpretation of 
the Scripture, just like white feminists' interpretation of the women's 
movement, is exclusive and culturally biased. There is no culture-free 
theology. Thus we need to stay humble in our claiming Bible verses for a 
particular group's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 When we follow how Jesus interacted with women of all classes, we realize how 
much transformation has to take place in gender relationships. The book of John 
summarizes beautifully how Jesus broke down the most difficult gender, class, 
and race barriers with which people today still struggle. Our ethnicity and 
gender are like computer hardware: They are givens. But class and status are 
like software: They are achieved. Thus racism and sexism are unjust because 
race and sex cannot be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Samaritan woman's response to Jesus' request for a drink of water is a 
good example. Imagine what must have gone through her mind: "You are a Jew and 
I am a Samaritan. You are a man, I am a woman. You are a rabbi, I am nobody. 
You are not even supposed to talk to me." Jesus not only refuses to buy into 
her stereotypes, but through his dialogue, he gives her back her original 
"software" that helps her see that she is created in God's image and worthy to 
meet his need. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus transforms power to rule and power to serve; transcending human 
exclusion through inclusion. It is important to remember that both men and 
women need to be liberated to be who they really are. Whether man or woman, 
whoever rules over the other is also enslaved. Jesus models empowerment rather 
than enslavement.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: WORKING PEOPLE; 
SOCIETY 'DEMEANS TEACHERS, THEN EXPECTS MIRACLES'; RESPECT: PARENTS SEEM TO 
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD TEACHING. SO WHY DON'T THEY WANT THEIR KIDS 
TO BECOME TEACHERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY SMOLIN, Barry Smolin is chairman of the English department at 
Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I am a teacher." I believe those are four beautiful words. Yet when I do 
utter those words at social gatherings, I am made to feel very uncomfortable by 
those who think I am crazy for engaging in such low-paying work, by those who 
snicker like so many eternal footmen at what they automatically presume to be 
my lack of success in some previous endeavor, by those who consider me and my 
colleagues one great big worthless abomination and who contend, "When're ya 
gonna start teaching these kids something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, I teach these kids something every day. In fact I do more than 
that. Not only do I educate them, I advise them, inspire them, love them, 
provide them with a depth and richness they do not get outside the walls of 
school, out in the great big American pit of television and empty consumer 
products, out in a culture that creaks with superficiality, decay and 
bankruptcy. I deliver the message every day with warmth, humor and high 
expectations. And I am not alone in this mission. Tens of thousands of my 
colleagues in the L.A. Unified School District can tell you the same story. 
</P>
<P>
 People want their children to have good teachers, but they don't want their 
children to become teachers. Inherent in this discomfiting truth is the very 
fundamental lack of respect that society has for those who teach. Teaching is 
looked upon as a last resort for those who have failed in other careers, a 
dumping ground for the mediocre and the inept. "Those who can't do, teach," 
smirks the snidely familiar apothegm. Yet the very consensus that demeans 
teachers perpetually expects them to work miracles under daunting conditions 
for minimal pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents realize, if only intuitively, the importance of excellent 
teachers in the lives of their children. Why then is the back of the community 
turned, year in and year out, on the educational system, refusing to support 
the public schools either financially or morally? 
</P>
<P>
 The problem stems from the radically incorrect assumption that teaching is 
easy. One hears it all the time: "What are you complaining about? You work six 
hours a day, you've got three months off every summer; I wish I was that 
lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Being "instructionally involved" with a classroom of 40 -- or more -- 
unmotivated and sometimes heavily armed students five or six times a day is not 
the sinecure some perceive it to be. People who do not teach cannot know the 
thousands of split-second decisions one must make constantly to avert chaos, 
the tenacity required in attempting to reverse so much social and family 
dysfunction, the evenings and weekends spent marking papers, preparing lessons, 
copying materials, phoning parents, completing mind-numbing paperwork, the 
summers spent in graduate courses and conferences learning more about one's 
subject and emerging theories of educational reform. 
</P>
<P>
 A vacancy in our English department provided another example of the pervasive 
misconception that teaching is easy. Of the 16 individuals interviewed one day, 
only three possessed valid teaching credentials and only five had any classroom 
teaching experience. These were nice, sincere people, clearly desiring careers 
in teaching, and that is admirable. However, they came to us with an elemental 
misunderstanding of the task, that one simply walks into a classroom and "turns 
kids on." But just as one cannot simply show up in an operating room and 
perform surgery, one cannot simply show up in a classroom and conduct the 
business of education. We did find two qualified, credentialed professionals to 
add to our faculty, but I am quite disturbed by what I have been seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially troublesome is that, due to a shortage of teachers, the L.A. 
Unified School District has been -- and will continue -- issuing emergency 
credentials to untrained individuals. I understand our classrooms must have 
teachers; however, it seems as if the Board of Education itself regards 
teaching as a relatively easy chore, something that, oh, anybody can perform.  
</P>
<P>
 Things must change. I am not calling simply for higher teacher salaries, even 
though I believe we deserve that. What I am calling for is those who desire a 
career in education to take the profession seriously: Get your student-teaching 
experience with a master teacher who can show you the complicated ropes. 
Qualify for a valid teaching credential. Dedicate yourself to the highest 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 I am also asking every parent, every member of the community, to begin 
honestly respecting what we do, for it is the community that ultimately 
benefits from the fruits of our labors.

<P>
 Thank you for your article, "Mixed Couples: What Are the Issues You Have to 
Deal With?" (Aug. 1). I also believe that much fear and hostility can be 
avoided by respect and attention given to them. 
</P>
<P>
 I am 71 and the daughter of a Jewish Polish father from Vienna and a Catholic 
Austrian mother. 
</P>
<P>
 To be of mixed race nationality or religion requires enough of sorting out and 
awareness of values at any time. But to be there at a time of "pure race 
consciousness" (during the rise of the Nazis to power) is almost too much for a 
young person. It was a no-man's land created by rejection on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 You can understand how my heart goes out to the children of mixed races: May 
they experience acceptance as members of the human family of this world.

 The comments made by John Dan, Orange County superintendent of schools, and 
Paul Hurley, associate professor of philosophy at Pomona College, in the 
Today's Topic of Aug. 1 prompted me to write. Their contention seems to be that 
because of the differences between families and the diverse cultural groups 
that are in our country, society's hands are tied as far as establishing ethics 
and values.I disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't think of one successful culture that doesn't believe that there should 
be honesty, personal responsibility, fairness under the law and nonviolent 
problem solving. We forget that the reason that so many immigrants are here is 
because they fled for societies that didn't uphold these values. They are 
seeking a better way of life that these values represent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, why are these values breaking down in America? With so many 
two-income families, single-parent families and intellectuals who are 
cautioning us that we might do harm if we stand up for values, our resolve is 
giving way to helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people are always going to test the limits of the family, of the 
society. Without those limits they feel insecure, unimportant and without 
direction.

 Executives at supermarket headquarters think highly of Bob. He is considered 
one of their best managers: Employee turnover is low; Food receipts are high, 
and he capably caters to the special food needs of his large multiethnic trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone informs Bob, who is not Jewish, that the Jewish High Holy Days occur 
very early this year, right after Labor Day. Accordingly, Chapman arranges for 
a prominent display of Jewish foods. He creates an attractive presentation of 
matzos and matzo meal products. However, when one of his Jewish customers 
catches sight of his handiwork, she bursts into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Bob's intentions were good, but he had his Jewish holidays confused. Matzos 
and matzo meal products are a necessity at Passover time, observed in the 
spring. They have no relevance to Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. At this 
time, leavened bread may be eaten, especially a round holiday egg bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Errors are bound to occur when we live in a multicultural society: A Latino 
student innocently served roast beef to her strictly Hindu classmate; an 
American teacher naively brought a bottle of wine to her Pakistani hosts, 
unaware that alcohol was forbidden; and an engineer barbecued slabs of pork 
ribs for his Muslim coworkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: When we make cultural blunders, we should apologize. At the same time, 
we should inform others gently when they have broken our cultural rules.

By LE LY HAYSLIP of San Diego is founder and executive director of the East 
Meets West Foundation, which provides medical care and schooling in Vietnam. 
The Oliver Stone movie Heaven and Earth was based on two books by Hayslip about 
her experiences growing up during the Vietnam War and later marrying an 
American and living in the United States. Hayslip was interviewed for The Times 
by Trin Yarborough. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past few months I have been attacked many times in the 
Vietnamese-language press of Orange County and around the United States, and 
also in large demonstrations (against improved ties between the United States 
and Vietnam) What shocks me is that after all we Vietnamese have been through, 
including fighting and killing each other during our civil war, there is still 
so much anger and resistance among Vietnamese living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Vietnamese who attack me, including some former officers of the 
South Vietnamese Army, came from well-off educated families and lost everything 
to the communists. Some were put in re-education camps and suffered a lot from 
the communists. Yet these same Vietnamese cannot seem to understand the lives 
of people born less fortunate. They insist that the only reason anyone helps 
the people of Vietnam is to help the communists. 
</P>
<P>
 My generation growing up in the Vietnamese countryside never had a chance to 
get education or training. I finished fifth grade, the highest grade then 
offered. Country women uneducated as I was had only one way to support 
themselves and their families -- prostitution. I have already told that about 
myself, so what is the point of the Vietnamese who were educated and wealthy 
bringing this up (against me)? I travel to Vietnam for my work with East Meets 
West, and I know that the children there are still not getting any education. 
In my home of Da Nang, less than one in five children finish the fifth grade. 
Only one in 15 graduate from high school. I want this younger Vietnamese 
generation to be smarter than the uneducated farm girl I was. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 20 years after the war, the toxic chemicals like Agent Orange and the 
thousands of still-unexploded land mines that people keep accidentally setting 
off while plowing and so forth continue to cause birth defects and injuries and 
deaths. The small, bare clinic that East Meets West has established does good 
work, but it is a tiny drop in a huge bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Vietnamese in this country are very good. They want to understand 
the present reality and to help when they can. Many Southern Californians and 
other Americans, including veterans, are helping East Meets West. And some 
South Vietnamese who used to be protesters have been back to visit Vietnam 
since 1990. They saw the terrible situation there, and had to ask themselves: 
"How can I turn my back when so many are suffering?" 
</P>
<P>
 I was happy to learn about the delegation including Vietnamese immigrants from 
Orange County that will soon go to Vietnam to discuss business ties. I hope 
when they return they will openly discuss what they have seen and the situation 
of the Vietnamese people. I cannot expect everybody to like me or my books. But 
there's no need to divide, no need for this hatred. Everybody, especially every 
Vietnamese, has a story to tell, a scar on his or her life. If we Vietnamese 
want to go on with our lives and finally heal in this peaceful country of the 
United States, we can do it.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; VENICE 
VANDALISM: 'VIGILANTISM IS NOT THE WAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Aug. 28, four concrete tables along the Venice Boardwalk that had been the 
site of nighttime noise and violence were pulverized, some say by a group of 
sledgehammer-wielding residents. Some call the vandalism vigilantism; others 
say the unresponsiveness of officials to complaints fueled the frustration. 
Here's how several Southern Californians see it: JOEL POST 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner, Fairfax district, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Vigilantism is abhorrent to the average citizen. Yet the homeowners or renters 
who are the heart and soul of a community are made to feel powerless, 
frustrated and completely left out when they try to work within the system. 
They are confronted by unsympathetic, unresponsive municipal agencies who all 
claim to be so overworked and understaffed that they "have to deal with the 
bigger problems first." We need a system of community ombudsmen who can access 
and mobilize municipal agencies so that minor problems can be effectively dealt 
with before they become major problems that destroy neighborhoods. MARK RYAVEC 
</P>
<P>
 Executive director, Venice Boardwalk Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not condone or accept vigilantism as an appropriate way to solve 
problems. That said, I think we see things occur because we no longer have 
local government in this society which provides the tools for people to solve 
these neighborhood problems themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In Venice there are four interrelated problems: homelessness, drug dealing, 
vandalism and noise. The immediate answer is regular police presence. It's 
interesting that this council district voted for more police; but the Valley 
voted at such low levels it dragged down the citywide vote. Basically, the 
people in the Valley keep us from having enough cops that, by a two-thirds 
vote, we are willing to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 When L.A. was founded, you had 15 council members for 100,000 people. You now 
have 15 council members representing 3.5 million. Those council people and 
their staffs cannot duplicate the level of attention to community problems 
available in smaller cities. JEFFERSON DAVIS 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment manager, Venice 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago there were the old pagodas in front of our building and someone 
was so frustrated because nobody would do anything he took a pickup truck and 
demolished them. And it was much much quieter. Then they put those tables there 
and all of a sudden it was back to where we were. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning a year and a half ago we sent a petition to Ruth Galanter's office 
signed by all 31 tenants that said that those tables were put there illegally, 
without a permit from the California Coastal Commission. We were calling the 
police three or four times a night. One tenant called because someone was 
selling a gun there. They (sold) drugs and the noise level was unbelievable. We 
started going to the Venice city meetings as a group and said we want those 
tables removed. The community knew what was going on; and they were aware that 
something had to be done with those tables. LINDA LUCKS 
</P>
<P>
 Chairwoman of Venice Beach Area Police Advisory Council 
</P>
<P>
 Vigilantism frightens me. I cannot condone taking the law into one's own hands 
under any circumstances, even though I certainly understand the feelings of 
frustration and anger that people feel when a problem is not easily resolved.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact is the tables were installed without permits and the Recreation and 
Parks Commission ordered its staff to go back and get permits or else remove 
them immediately. As far as I know, nothing was done. Residents unhappy with 
the situation had various options they could have pursued -- the local council 
office, the police advisory council, the media. To my knowledge, none were 
explored. The perpetrators were just too lazy and impatient to do it the right 
way. ROBERT HELTON  
</P>
<P>
 Lieutenant, Santa Ana Police Department 
</P>
<P>
 We've had situations where, at a meeting, citizens will become very vocal, 
frustrated, and say 'If you can't deal with the problem, we will.' That's when 
we have to establish a dialogue and point out that law enforcement's not their 
responsibility. They can make citizens' arrests, but what if they confront an 
armed individual?  
</P>
<P>
 What they don't realize is that we have at our disposal a variety of other 
resources -- code enforcement, planning and building -- we can go to within 
city government. We try to find out exactly what their problem is, develop a 
strategy, put them in touch with the people who can help them and get them to 
step back and really take a broader look at the picture. DIANE BUSH 
</P>
<P>
 Venice Action Committee board member 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot condone vigilantism at all. I think the incident was the result of a 
pressure valve that was released. That doesn't make it right. But sometimes you 
can only take so much and then you have to blow off steam. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been very frustrating. We're always being told that if we choose to live 
at the beach that we have to accept the noise and the crowds. All of us know, 
and I think accept, that. I wouldn't live anyplace else in this world. I just 
wish that our city government was more responsive to the people they work for.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
BELL GARDENS: BETTING ON THE EDUCATION OF ITS YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, the jobless rate is more than 13%, compared to the state rate 
of 9%, and the average family earns less than $25,000. This puts college out of 
financial reach for many otherwise qualified Bell Gardens High School 
graduates. In fact, only about one in six high school graduates go on to 
college. The irony is that the city has ample financial resources. Thanks in 
large part to fees generated by the Bicycle Card Club, Bell Gardens has 
maintained a balanced budget for the last 10 years and accumulated a reserve 
fund of $15 million. Officials decided to help local teens get a higher 
education by using its surplus to generate interest-free educational loans in 
exchange for community service. To date, nine residents have received up to 
$5,000 each in loans to begin or continue their studies. THE IDEA 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1993, Councilman George Deitch suggests that the city offer 
interest-free loans to Bell Gardens students in exchange for community service. 
The loans would be repaid over 10 years or could be reduced by additional 
community service. THE DEAL 
</P>
<P>
 After researching the issue, the city council votes in February to use 
$180,000 in interest from a portion of reserves to underwrite the Academic 
Pursuit Program. Of the 179 students eligible, 25 meet the May application 
deadline. Nine loans are given out in July to those who have have a cumulative 
GPA of 2.5 or better and agree to submit transcripts at the end of each 
academic year. Students can reapply each year for more loan money. 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE THE CITY'S MONEY COMES FROM 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle Club fees: 65% 
</P>
<P>
 Property taxes and other sources: 19% 
</P>
<P>
 State sales tax: 8% 
</P>
<P>
 Motor vehicle fees: 8% THE PAYOFF 
</P>
<P>
 For the Students: 
</P>
<P>
 SERGIO TAPIA, II., Third year law student, University of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really came at an opportune time because I was looking for another source 
of aid to finish my final year. I was very lucky. I'm doing my final year at 
Whittier Law School. I'm planning to transfer my final (credits) back to Iowa 
so I can graduate. As part of my community service, I'm going to put together a 
report reviewing the legal services (the city is) providing now and make 
suggestions how the city can improve on those services or offer new ones." 
</P>
<P>
 For the city: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ten hours of community service for each $1,000 loaned. Projects are designed 
by the student to reflect their academic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * A more educated community, with closer ties to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * A way to attract families to settle and stay in the city. THE NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens is investigating ways to: 
</P>
<P>
 * offer educational grants in addition to loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * include support for students in trade and technical programs.

'MAIN STREETS' ALL OVER TOWN; PROGRAM WILL SEEK FRIENDLY AMBIENCE FOR EIGHT 
NEGLECTED THOROUGHFARES ACROSS L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's newly announced program to create a friendlier, "Main 
Street" ambience along some of the busiest yet least charming streets in Los 
Angeles is exactly the sort that politicians love. Any infusion of federal 
dollars brings kudos to local and federal officials alike; private 
contributions reap positive attention for the companies involved. But this 
program, if it unfolds as promised, is also just the sort to work a real 
improvement in the lives and spirits of pavement-weary city dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative will provide funding to build new 
storefronts, plant trees and make other improvements in eight blighted 
neighborhoods. Residents and business people along the streets involved will 
recommend improvements; funds from the Federal Transit Administration and other 
agencies will pay for the changes. The city also hopes to receive state and 
private funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight areas are Virgil Avenue in east Hollywood; 1st Street in Boyle 
Heights; Figueroa Street in Highland Park; Jefferson Boulevard in South Los 
Angeles; Crenshaw and Leimert boulevards in the Leimert Park section of 
Southwest Los Angeles; Magnolia and Lankershim boulevards in North Hollywood's 
NoHo arts district; around Sunland Boulevard and San Fernando Road in Sun 
Valley; and Vermont Avenue and 54th Street in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Each area is expected to receive $250,000 this year and up to $2 million next 
year. But there are as yet no guarantees; delivering on those funds will be a 
major hurdle for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The first and in some respects tougher challenge will be forging consensus on 
each area's improvement plan among local residents and merchants. To some, for 
example, it's self-evident that planting trees along barren urban sidewalks 
enhances a neighborhood. To others, those same trees represent a commitment of 
money and time for maintenance -- commitments they may be reluctant to make. 
Benches that might be welcome in some communities could attract drug dealers in 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups and city agencies long accustomed to top-down planning are 
becoming more adept at facilitating the sort of sidewalk-level dialogue that 
must occur for neighborhood beautification to succeed. The ongoing Nuisance 
Alley Program, which helps residents to convert some of the city's most 
debris-filled alleys into common gardens and recreational areas, is but one 
example. We hope the new Neighborhood Initiative will be another.

GREETINGS, CONGRESS -- GUESS WHAT'S WAITING; RETURNING LEGISLATORS AGAIN FACE 
HEALTH CARE REFORM ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As members of Congress return from vacation today they will find the matter of 
health care reform waiting for them: As much as many might wish otherwise, the 
issue just won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd alliance, liberals and conservatives have locked arms in hopes of 
blocking any health care reform this year. It is true there is virtually no 
chance that comprehensive change will occur in this 103rd Congress, but it 
would be a mistake for legislators to make no improvements at all simply 
because every worthwhile change is not politically possible now. 
</P>
<P>
 The two forces opposing reform have very different motivations. The liberals, 
usually Democrats who support a "single payer" Canadian-style health care 
system, see anything less than a system overhaul as a failure; conservatives, 
in this situation usually Republicans, are looking to pick up some GOP 
victories in November and don't want to hand President Clinton anything that 
could be seen as a political victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither agenda seems to us to move toward what most Americans want: gradual 
change that doesn't threaten what works in the U.S. health care system, and 
help in getting and keeping affordable health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some facts that Congress should bear in mind whenever it discusses health care 
reform: 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of Americans lack health insurance. Among the employed, the 
uninsured are concentrated in the nation's smallest firms, 73% of which do not 
offer employees insurance coverage. Small businesses, many of which are 
struggling, say they simply cannot afford to offer employees the insurance 
coverage offered by 98% of large firms. 
</P>
<P>
 So what can Congress do to make it easier for employees of small business, and 
the self-employed, to get affordable coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 One way is through health insurance purchasing cooperatives, which allow small 
groups of employees to band together to get better rates and greater variety in 
insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Small employers should be obliged to join such cooperatives, though not to pay 
for employee coverage. The Health Insurance Plan of California, set up by the 
state but privately run, has driven down premiums 10% for members during the 
last year. That's not exciting stuff for politicians looking for big flags to 
wave, but it's real improvement. And it is duplicable. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue on which Congress could agree is insurance reform. Washington 
must take care not to repeat the mistakes of New York state, which barred 
insurers from setting premiums based on age, sex or health status. That sounds 
good on paper, but the effect was to send the rates of young, healthy people 
skyrocketing -- and when the young and healthy abandoned the system, premiums 
shot up as much as 170% for everyone else. Premiums should be adjusted by age, 
because they must somehow reflect the fact that an average 25-year-old's 
medical bills are one-fourth that of a 60-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
 The moderates on the Hill who still have hopes of enacting some measure of 
reform know the pitfalls of a little reform done badly. But they also know the 
virtues of a little reform done well. Comprehensive health care reform cannot 
and should not be hurried through this year. But it can and should be begun, 
and there will never be a better time than now.

DEATH PENALTY: ONLY FOR STRANGERS?; WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS KNOWN AS A PERSON, AS 
IN THE O.J. CASE, JURIES OFTEN CRINGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision announced last week by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty 
against O.J. Simpson appears to spring as much from pragmatism as from any 
rarefied balancing of punishment against the alleged crime. Given that Simpson 
was an appealing celebrity with no felony record, prosecutors surely feared 
that seeking the death penalty could jeopardize their ability to win a 
conviction for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, apparently weeks in the making, was obviously not an easy one 
for prosecutors, under pressure after recent losses in several headline cases 
and anxious to win a conviction in Simpson's approaching trial. The D.A.'s 
decision to seek life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if Simpson 
(who has pleaded not guilty) is convicted speaks to this nation's ambivalent 
views of how best to respond to crime and our notions of appropriate punishment 
for criminal offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty has rested uneasily on the conscience of many Americans, as 
it has on ours. And often, those closest to the gas chamber are most 
uncomfortable with execution. Members of Congress, at some distance from a 
criminal courtroom, extended the death penalty to more than 50 federal crimes 
this year. A number of state legislators, with support from Gov. Pete Wilson, 
have for some years sought to extend the death penalty to more state felonies, 
such as drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors in all but the most heinous crimes, for example those 
involving the torture and murder of children or the cold-blooded slayings of 
total strangers, often remain reluctant to seek the death penalty even where 
current law permits it, because juries often balk at conviction if they know 
the defendant may be executed. A mock jury on the Simpson case that prosecutors 
assembled last month in Phoenix, Ariz., showed reluctance to convict Simpson, 
particularly if he faced the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 We are ambivalent as well about criminal defendants themselves. There is 
strong, even shrill, support for the imposition of swift, certain and 
increasingly harsh punishment for criminals in the abstract. In fact, the 
D.A.'s decision in the Simpson case came the day after Gov. Wilson signed into 
law a bill imposing life terms for some first-time rapists; the state's new 
three-strikes-and-you're-out law is in effect. Yet when jurors come to know 
individual defendants during a trial, they can balk at those stiff punishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case is already a symbol for what many regard as society's failure 
to take seriously domestic violence against women. The prosecutor's decision 
not to seek the death penalty may make this case a symbol, as well, of our 
conflicting feelings toward capital punishment.

POPULATION CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Daniel Maguire's "It's the Best Hope for Our Planet . . . " and 
George Weigel's " . . . It's Voodoo Science," Commentary, Sept. 5: No one can 
deny the reality of anle expanding human base on the globe. But, contrary to 
the claims of population doomsayers, no "tragedy of the commons" awaits us, 
that is, not unless we are collectively herded into subscribing to the notion 
that the poor will naturally and indiscriminately breed themselves several 
times over and quickly consume what's left of "our" resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Development economists and demographers have underscored for years that what's 
at stake in the poorest regions of the world is the capability of individuals 
to control and develop available resources, not paternalistic considerations 
regarding the number of mouths to be fed. In other words, it has been 
repeatedly shown that when literacy is improved among both women and men, when 
peasants are empowered to grow and harvest their own crops, and when other 
basic needs and services are easily available, the rest will follow in terms of 
higher agricultural production, lower birthrates and greater overall 
prosperity. Rather than combat the bogy of overpopulation, then, those 
interested in averting global crises need to focus on sustainable development, 
education and public health in both poor and rich nations. 
</P>
<P>
 SUDHIR CHELLA RAJAN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Weigel compares "population science" to astrology, witchcraft and alchemy. 
Perhaps he has not heard of the 1992 proclamation of the U.S. National Academy 
of Sciences and the British Royal Academy on the subject of overpopulation and 
overconsumption. These scientists warn of "irreversible degradation of the 
environment or continued poverty for much of the world." Presumably, he is also 
unaware that the Union of Concerned Scientists, a body composed of 104 Nobel 
laureates as well as thousands of other scientists, has also issued "Warning to 
Humanity." An important recommendation in their plan for avoiding environmental 
disaster is population stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
 One must assume that he is ignorant of these statements since it is hard to 
imagine that he would place these distinguished scientists in the same category 
with witch doctors, alchemists and astrologers. 
</P>
<P>
 DEBBIE GARDNER 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Vice President Al Gore's commentary ("What We Really Want: Less Need 
for Abortion," Sept. 2): 
</P>
<P>
 It is high time that Gore and the Clinton Administration stop pushing their 
liberal, anti-family agenda on America as well as the rest of the world. It is 
this Administration's design to force its way into every aspect of private life 
even to the point of dictating to the families of the world how best to 
determine the size and quality of family life. The family has always and shall 
always be the basic unit of society. The government's responsibility therefore 
is to ensure that the integrity of the family unit is preserved against all 
forms of destruction including coerced contraception, sterilization, 
infanticide, euthanasia and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 This conference (supported fully by the U.S. government and the Clinton 
Administration) reduces the freedom and rights of the family by forcing immoral 
decisions as solutions to family issues. No government has the right to usurp 
from parents the authority that was bestowed by God.  
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD C. LANER 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideological Crackup on the Road to Cairo?" (editorial, Sept. 2) was most 
thought provoking and timely. However, the statement "crusading against 
promiscuity and birth control, the Vatican . . . " needs clarification to avoid 
misunderstanding about the teaching of the Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican has always crusaded against artificial birth control and has 
consistently promoted natural family planning as a method to limit family size. 
Consequently, as you correctly state, the Pontifical Academy of Sciences 
recommended a worldwide average of two children per couple, which can be 
achieved by the natural family planning method. The technology and science are 
there, but it does take information, training, motivation and a modest degree 
(not heroic) of discipline or self-control. Most Catholic diocesan newspapers 
in the United States list locations and times for classes on natural family 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 EDWARD C. REA 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican accuses those who would address the overpopulation of this planet 
of being guilty of "biological colonialism" (Sept. 1). They ought to know a lot 
about this subject. Those in the world who subscribe to the prohibition of 
family planning, birth control and abortion fill the pews and coffers of the 
oldest biological colonists in the world. Let's not forget the dead and dying 
of AIDS who think using a condom is a sin. 
</P>
<P>
 May it be that Pope John Paul II is as successful in Cairo as he has been at 
home. Italy, a predominantly Roman Catholic country, has legal family planning, 
birth control, abortion and consistently maintains the lowest per capita 
birthrate in the world. You can't tell me they all practice "Vatican roulette."

SOUL IN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Gazing at One's Navel, Politically," Commentary, Sept. 3: 
</P>
<P>
 le Marlene Adler Marks' article decries the current preoccupation with the 
soul (we weren't aware there was one) in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 We, on the other hand, are delighted.In our view, the soul represents the 
good, the true and the beautiful. If our nation is, indeed, looking for that in 
politics, we cry "Huzzah!" 
</P>
<P>
 Marks questions the suitability of the soul in politics. Doesn't integrity 
belong in politics? Harmlessness? Dedication to the greater good? These are 
soul qualities and certainly couldn't hurt politics. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot agree with her that "in the world of commerce and politics, the true 
virtue is getting the job done." The true virtue would be in getting the job 
done with integrity and civility while serving the needs of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Yea, soul!

LIBRARY ASSESSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The L.A. County Board of Supervisors, by a three-to-two vote, approved the 
imposition of a lespecial "library" tax, to be added to our property tax bills 
(Aug. 31). This will produce about $16 million per year for the county library 
system.These are the same supervisors who voted themselves a huge pension 
increase three years ago, which was created by "spiking" their final 
compensation to include all fringe benefits in the pension. The annual cost of 
such spiking is not less than $100 million per year. They refuse to reverse 
their positions on that matter, even though L.A. is the only county in the 
state to have adopted such a self-serving (almost criminal) scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 I say: Give back the pension money, men and women of the board, and you will 
have plenty of money "left over" for libraries, playgrounds, pools and all the 
other niceties and necessities of life in our glorious county.

 When confronted with declining revenues and apparent disinclination to reduce 
government expenditures, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors just succeeded 
with the latest round of fiscal treachery. Instead of cutting an unpopular 
department or service, they instead held funds back from the sacrosanct library 
system. Then they presented the fabricated choice of slicing libraries to the 
bone or adding a new tax. Guess which one they picked? Howard Jarvis just 
reached 10,000 r.p.m.

LINE UP THE CLUES, AND THE IDENTITY OF 'DEEP THROAT' COMES INTO FOCUS; 
WATERGATE: MANY SIGNS LEAD TO WILLIAM CASEY AS THE INSIDE SOURCE WHO HELPED 
BRING DOWN THE NIXON PRESIDENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON LATHAM, Aaron Latham, a former Washington Post reporter, is a writer 
in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was in the White House on the day that Richard Nixon lost the battle. I was 
a young reporter asking and listening to lots of questions. Would he really 
abdicate? Would there be a coup d'etat? What was going to happen to poor Diane 
Sawyer, the assistant press secretary, whom everybody liked so much? 
</P>
<P>
 And who was Deep Throat? 
</P>
<P>
 Now all of these questions have been answered except the last one. I would 
like to propose an answer to it, too. Deep Throat would have to be somebody who 
had something to lose if he were to step forward. Or he would have to have 
died. Otherwise the temptation to go down in history -- and probably make 
millions writing "I Was Deep Throat" -- would be irresistible. The candidate 
whom I have in mind meets both of these tests. He had something to lose and now 
he is dead. So don't expect to see him on Oprah. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep Throat would also have to be somebody who loved playing spy games. 
Remember the red flag in the flower pot that Washington Post reporter Bob 
Woodward would place on his balcony if he needed to meet with Deep Throat? 
Remember the signal Deep Throat himself would leave -- a clock face on page 20 
of Woodward's home-delivered New York Times -- if he needed a meeting? 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Deep Throat was also somebody to whom Woodward owed a lot. And 
Woodward would attempt to repay that debt someday. He wouldn't offer money or 
gifts. He would offer recognition. Not recognition as Deep Throat but 
recognition in a different way. Woodward would write a book about his anonymous 
benefactor. That book would be titled "Veil." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward's book "Veil" about the Central Intelligence Agency is his one work 
that doesn't really fit with the others. It has a hero. And that hero's name is 
William Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 When Woodward was working on the book, his friends couldn't understand why he 
had chosen Casey as a protagonist. It was even said that Casey -- who ran the 
CIA from 1981 to 1987 -- was conning him. Why was Woodward defending the man 
who had helped orchestrate the Iran-Contra double-dealing that ended in 
scandal? Why was this hard-to-impress reporter telling everybody how smart 
Casey was? What was going on in this relationship? 
</P>
<P>
 I propose that it was a relationship that went back much further than Casey's 
stewardship of the CIA. It went back to all those dark meetings in underground 
garages. That was why Woodward had the temerity to beard Casey in that hospital 
room when he was dying. He knew Casey loved this kind of derring-do. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey had developed a taste for such spy games when he served with the Office 
of Strategic Services during World War II. Working out of London, he was 
responsible for parachuting spies behind Germany lines during the war. Toward 
the end of the war, he had 58 teams inside Germany. All of the OSS officers 
were basically amateurs, making it up as they went along and enjoying the whole 
boys-club adventure of it. In "Veil," Woodward describes Casey as a man who 
loved "the cloak" and "a little of the dagger" too. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey was in a position to know the kind of information that Deep Throat 
revealed to the Washington Post. As Woodward writes in "Veil," "His years of 
government service, 1971 to 1975, had been the scandal years." And Casey had 
felt abused, which is what often motivates informers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the man who told Woodward: "Follow the money." He knew something about 
the Nixon money trail because he himself had gotten tripped up on that trail. 
It began when renegade investor Robert Vesco secretly delivered $200,000 in 
cash to the Nixon reelection campaign. Shortly thereafter, Nixon's attorney 
general, John Mitchell, repeatedly called the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and tried to quash an investigation of Vesco, who had been looting 
his companies. The person on the other end of those phone calls was William 
Casey, then head of the SEC. Soon Casey himself was being investigated and he 
resented it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the ITT affair. The SEC leadership decided to ignore an ITT 
fraud charge that the SEC staff wanted to pursue. Again Casey was drawn into a 
Nixon Administration scandal. He was even accused of perjury but was never 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey left the SEC in 1973 to become undersecretary of state for economic 
affairs. According to Bob Haldeman's diaries, Casey was in and out of the White 
House during this time because Nixon wanted him to wage war on the State 
Department bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey knew how the Nixon Administration worked -- especially how it worked 
when it came to money -- and so was in a position to coach a young reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 (Woodward, asked this week whether Casey was indeed Deep Throat, said "This is 
an endless game. I'm not going to get involved. Have at it.") 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time several years ago when Woodward told friends that Deep Throat 
was going to come forward. But then the Throat changed his mind. That would 
have been about the time that Bill Casey started managing Ronald Reagan's 
presidential campaign. In such a sensitive position, he must have felt that now 
was not the time to reveal that he had brought down a Republican President. Why 
not wait? There would be plenty of time to step forward and go down in history 
later on, wouldn't there? 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward may have even gone to the hospital that night to ask if Deep Throat 
wanted to unmask himself before he died. But Casey was too sick to answer him.

PERSPECTIVE ON GAMBLING; WE ALL LOSE ON THIS ROLL OF THE DICE; BIG MONEY IS 
TRYING TO SELL LEGISLATORS ON CASINOS AS FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT, A TREACHEROUS 
TREND THAT CRIES FOR REGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Westside of Los Angeles.

 Gambling suddenly is a hot issue. Amid furious debate in Sacramento, a measure 
to create a gambling regulatory commission was defeated on the final night of 
the legislative session. So was a last-minute amendment permitting Hollywood 
Park race track to branch into card clubs of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, serious schemes are being laid for a casino hotel near the new 
Downtown Convention Center, promoted yet again as an effort to rebuild L.A. Its 
advocates lobbied successfully in Sacramento last month for an amendment to 
prevent any interference with Downtown casino development. That amendment died 
with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation for the gambling control measure's defeat was partisan 
politics. Gov. Wilson and Democratic leaders could not agree on who would 
appoint the proposed commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But that only skims the truth. Gambling is integral to the vision of a new 
entertainment economy shared by many powerful decision-makers, and regulation 
might interfere with their interests. 
</P>
<P>
 With the demise of defense contracts and shrinking investments in the inner 
city, these advocates ask, what better economic strategy is there for America's 
fantasy capital than a gambling casino for the whole family? 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment economy is now the growth engine of Southern California, and 
according to Business Week, "gambling is humming the fastest." We are becoming 
a "Gambling Nation," headlines the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Card clubs in Southern California alone took in $7.5 billion in wagers last 
year. More than $15 billion was wagered on Indian reservations last year, much 
of it in California. Nationally, legal gambling revenues were $30 billion in 
1993, more than the combined revenue of movies, books, records and arcades. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling their new respectability and clout, the new defenders of gambling ask, 
"What's wrong with gambling anyway?" It's outmoded Puritanism, they say, to 
oppose bingo, lotto and blackjack, not to mention those slot machines on Indian 
reservations. And for clinchers they say gambling means jobs, jobs, jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not a prohibitionist. But you don't have to be Puritan to question whether 
kids should be exposed to gambling as family entertainment. Gambling is an 
addiction for many, a fantasy for many. It creates no new wealth and yet, for 
the first time in our economic history, this non-productive sector is being 
proposed as an anchor of growth. 
</P>
<P>
 With anarchy, hunger, racism and joblessness rising all over the globe, what 
does it say about our character that we devote so much of our high-tech 
potential to inventing better gambling machines? Gambling, not religion, is the 
opiate of the people, and those sponsoring it are new Neros. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, there is the cancer of political corruption spread by gambling. 
Local regulation of card clubs has been lax in cities like Bell Gardens and 
Commerce which depend on gambling revenues. For example, federal prosecutors 
proved the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens was built from laundered drug money. It 
is now under federal receivership. A long-time operator at the club is on trial 
for loan sharking and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even clean, publicly traded gambling corporations can corrupt and dominate the 
democratic process with their massive lobbying efforts, usually conducted 
against penniless opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, gambling interests have spent $5.3 million on campaign 
contributions and lobbying in Sacramento. Hollywood Park gave $441,370 to 
politicians, spent $364,917 on lobbying and threw in another $490,000 to the 
Inglewood voter referendum that approved their casino by 52%. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosive growth of gambling makes statewide campaign finance reform more 
needed than ever. In addition, a tough, independent state gambling commission 
should be created; those who hold or seek gambling licenses should be 
prohibited from making campaign contributions to the attorney general or to 
local referendums on casinos; and any advertising that promotes gambling as 
"family entertainment" or healthy for kids should be regarded as deceptive and 
be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a Downtown L.A. casino, state law requires local voter approval. The 
gambling lobby is betting that, in hard times, voters can be lured to vote for 
Lady Luck. That's all the more reason for getting a serious gambling commission 
in place by 1995.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE, BY DEFINITION, CRIMINALS; PROP. 187: NEWCOMERS WHOSE 
FIRST ACT HERE IS TO BREAK THE LAW HAVE NO ENTITLEMENT TO AMERICA'S BOUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the crime bill passed, Americans are discussing options and debating 
solutions to a variety of crimes. One of the most common and devastating crimes 
committed in America is committed by people who are not even American citizens. 
To many, it is not even considered a crime, even though its name, illegal 
immigration, makes it clear that is is. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans and Californians in particular are concerned with illegal 
immigration and the attendant problems. There are those who argue that the 
economy is taxed by the unexpectedly speedy increase of people using public 
institutions such as hospitals and schools. Others respond that the economy 
receives a boost through a large labor pool and the taxes and other benefits 
generated. Some argue that illegal immigrants strain our criminal-justice 
system, while others say the strain has nothing to do with an individual's 
residence status. On each point, proponents and opponents counter one another's 
arguments. The arguments get weak, however, when the issue is criminality. 
People who enter or stay in this country illegally are criminals by definition. 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who argue that the law is unfair. Some say we stole this land. 
Some say there should be open borders. Some say that these are pioneers in the 
tradition of those who brought America west to the Pacific Ocean. Some want to 
compare them to those who entered this country through Ellis Island. Some feel 
today's illegal aliens are in a situation similar to homosexuals and Jews in 
Nazi Germany or Japanese Americans in Manzanar during World War II. Some even 
want to compare today's illegals to people who were brought to this country 
against their will. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that fairness is a matter of opinion, but border laws are 
universally considered necessary to maintain sovereignty. The truth is that our 
immigration laws do not attack anyone who belongs in our country, which was not 
true of Nazi Germany, the United States during World War II, slavery or Jim 
Crow. The truth is that the history of humanity has seen the ownership of land 
change hands countless times and that it is counterproductive to speak of it 
being stolen. Ellis Island, moreover, is the very symbol of legal immigration: 
people struggling to do whatever they had to to be legal residents of this 
country. And I have yet to figure out any connection between today's illegals 
and the stolen Africans of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate issue, the reality that so many wish to ignore, is that we do 
have borders. The sanctity of our borders and the logic behind protecting them 
and returning illegals can be grasped by all but the most opaque of minds. Our 
state is overrun with people whose first experience here teaches them that the 
most valuable thing they ever did was to break the laws of the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 We can forget trying to teach that "crime doesn't pay." These people will know 
firsthand that crime can pay, big time. What they find is an America with open 
arms, ready to give her bounty away. With so many public benefits there for the 
taking, it's like the way some people used to explain rape: She was asking for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Proposition 187, the "Save Our State" initiative. Proposition 187 
will deny this criminal class benefits that are wearing thin for those of us 
who pay for them -- and thereby discourage them from coming altogether. And, 
Proposition 187 will, through the inevitable lawsuits, force the federal 
government to face its responsibility for maintaining its borders while putting 
this issue on every American's plate.  
</P>
<P>
 There are people (including some members of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District Board of Education) who have sworn that even if voters pass this law, 
they will not uphold it. These 187 opponents say they are the new civil-rights 
fighters. As one who was tear-gassed during the 1960s, I resent the comparison. 
In the '60s, we were trying to get America to treat Americans like Americans. 
Illegal aliens have no right to be treated like Americans. Unless they are 
willing to do what immigrants have done for decades -- enter and remain legally 
-- they have no right to our bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 I sympathize with those living in poor conditions. But if I were to come home 
with enough groceries for my family only to find that two people had broken in 
and wanted to eat, I might try to make my food stretch. But if more and more 
people showed up, eventually there would not be enough for any of us. Neither 
the financial condition nor -- contrary to what opponents of 187 might like you 
to believe -- the race of those people would matter. Something would have to 
give. 
</P>
<P>
 After the legal challenges have fine-tuned it, Proposition 187 will allow us 
to regain our strength as a state. From that position, we will be able to do 
one of the things we do so well: help our neighbors in this hemisphere and 
throughout the entire sphere improve their lot and make a legal life in their 
own countries more desirable than an illegal life here.

RAIDERS SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS; PRO FOOTBALL: THE COLISEUM IS RESTORED, 
BUT L.A.'S PERFORMANCE AGAIN IS A SHAMBLES AGAINST THE SEAHAWKS, 38-9. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 No arm. No legs. No depth. 
</P>
<P>
 And no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Depleted by injuries, demoralized by ejections and distracted by a critical 
defection, the Raiders were thoroughly and decisively beaten by the underdog 
Seattle Seahawks at the Coliseum on Sunday, 38-9. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Raiders' first appearance at the Coliseum since the January 
earthquake that caused $60 million in damage to the 71-year-old structure. 
While all the cracks and holes in the stadium have been nicely smoothed over, 
the cracks and holes in the Raiders seem to be widening daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it really only a week ago that this club was thought to have a shot at 
winning the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, winning a game seems beyond its reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raiders have lost both their games, by a cumulative score of 82-23. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their quarterback, Jeff Hostetler, either has a sore elbow, which he 
vehemently denies, or has simply lost his ability to throw a spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their running game, already hurt by the season-ending injury to Napoleon 
McCallum a week earlier, remains inconsistent with no one able to step forward 
and claim the starting tailback job. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their players continue to lack the discipline to avoid costly penalties, 
three of them -- Chester McGlockton, Aundray Bruce and Derrick Hoskins -- 
getting ejected from Sunday's debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their defensive line, already hurt earlier in the week when end Scott Davis 
left the team because of "personal problems," was further weakened Sunday when 
Jerry Ball suffered a pulled hamstring. With the earlier ejections of 
McGlockton and Bruce, the Raiders were down to four defensive linemen for most 
of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And finally, even their most dependable big-game performer, Tim Brown, had 
an uncharacteristic day. Brown was unable to hang onto the ball, fumbling away 
a punt and letting a pass slip through his fingers for an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's problems can be excused as a one-time thing. The others might be 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest concern has to be Hostetler, who looked at times Sunday as if he 
were throwing in a wind tunnel. That might have excused his performance a week 
earlier in Candlestick Park when he was throwing soft, fluttery passes that 
were often off target. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no excuse Sunday. And no wind to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing physically wrong with him," Coach Art Shell said of his 
quarterback. "He made some good throws. We dropped some balls om him. He missed 
a couple of shots. I think Jeff is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't look it. Several times, he had wide open receivers, but overthrew 
them. At times, he seemed to push the ball. The zip that enabled him to 
complete a club-record 15 consecutive passes in one game a year ago was 
missing. The arm that enabled him to throw for a club-record 424 yards in 
another game last season was malfunctioning. 
</P>
<P>
 And on those occasions when he reared back and fired, the long, smooth tight, 
perfectly placed passes of the past had been replaced by soft, high, wobbly 
throws that looked more like punts than passes. Some of them resembled the 
birds lazily sailing over the Coliseum on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't appeared right since the week of practice before the last 
exhibition. Hostetler started wearing a protective sleeve over the elbow at 
that point and sat out the final exhibition against the Houston Oilers. At the 
time, Shell said it was to protect Hostetler from the harsh artificial turf of 
the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Hostetler was still denying there was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing there," he said in response to reports of an ailing arm. "If 
I had underthrown the ball, you could maybe say it had something to do with it. 
I had a couple of wide-open passes I needed to complete. We have to have those. 
(The fact that he didn't complete them) may have had something to do with my 
arm, but it wasn't anything to do with being hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler completed 17 of 36 for 181 yards. But he threw three interceptions 
and failed to complete a scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those numbers are misleading. On one play, he attempted to hit Brown over 
the middle, but the ball was so far off target it sailed down the field and 
landed in the arms of teammate Alexander Wright, 15 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with all the problems, the Raiders were in the game for the first half. 
Chris Warren's four-yard run had given Seattle (2-0) the early lead. 
</P>
<P>
 An exchange of field goals, a 26-yarder by the Raiders' Jeff Jaeger and a 
33-yarder by the Seahawks' John Kasay, made the halftime score 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most disastrous play of the game for the Raiders also occurred before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 After a nine-yard run by Seahawk quarterback Rick Mirer, Raider linebacker 
Winston Moss hunched over Mirer and appeared to hit him in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Seahawk lineman Ray Roberts, who chased Moss down and shoved him. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter McGlockton, who went after Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Bruce, who shoved Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit McGlockton, Bruce and Roberts, all ejected, and along with the two 
Raiders went the effectiveness of their defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ball was injured early in the third quarter, the Raiders were playing 
converted tight end John Duff and rookie Austin Robbins along with veterans 
Nolan Harrison and Anthony Smith. At times, the Raiders were forced to go to a 
three-man line. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirer threw three touchdown passes in the second half, a five-yarder to Brian 
Blades, a 40-yarder to Michael Bates and a 38-yarder to Warren. Seattle 
fullback Tracy Johnson closed out the scoring with a two-yard run. Twenty-four 
of the Seahawks' points came after turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Terry McDaniel accounted for the Raider scoring after intermission 
by returning a fumble 41 yards for the team's only touchdown of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in that locker room is very low," Shell said when the game had 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot lower than anybody dreamed the Raiders would be only one week ago. 
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive back Albert Lewis suffered a concussion when he collided with 
teammate Eddie Anderson, but the injury is not thought to be serious. . . . The 
Raiders were guilty of 13 penalties for 85 yards. . . . Seattle broke an 
eight-game losing streak against the Raiders.

RAMS LEAVE ATLANTA WITH RISON TO BELIEVE; PRO FOOTBALL: FALCON RECEIVER BACKS 
UP GUARANTEE WITH TWO TOUCHDOWN CATCHES IN 31-13 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Andre Rison guaranteed a victory, and as Atlanta Coach June 
Jones fretted, the Rams had the videotape to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were so angry Sunday that they rushed out and scored a season-high 
two touchdowns on offense, pulling within 18 points of the Falcons by game's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad would it have been had the Rams not been fired up? 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons pounded the Rams, 31-13, before 55,378 in the Georgia Dome, 
providing Jones with his first NFL victory as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing about this game," Ram safety Anthony Newman said, "is that we 
get to meet again." 
</P>
<P>
 A guarantee of revenge? Or a death wish? 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (1-1) cruised to victory with Bobby Hebert mopping up for starting 
quarterback Jeff George and Rison mugging for the cameras along the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media ran with (the guarantee)," said Rison, who had two 16-yard 
touchdown receptions. "June didn't like it a lot, and Chuck Knox showed it to 
his team to fire them up. I came in with a little added pressure with the 
guarantee, but I've got some teammates that can play." 
</P>
<P>
 George can throw, and for the sixth time in his career he threw three 
touchdown passes. George, who was playing in his 53rd NFL game, topped the 
10,000-yard mark after completing 29 of 38 passes for 287 yards. He has thrown 
277 consecutive passes without an interception -- the third-best streak in NFL 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff George threw the heck out of the ball," Knox said, "and we tried to 
cover Rison. We had double coverage on him, but still he beat the coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison had seven catches for 50 yards in the first quarter, including a 16-yard 
touchdown reception to give Atlanta a 14-0 lead. Rison tortured Ram cornerback 
Steve Israel with catch after catch, even when Israel thought he had perfect 
coverage on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can do is get better -- I can't do any worse than I did today," Israel 
said. "I mean, damn, he had an excellent game." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison had Israel spinning in a circle with a 16-yard scoring reception in the 
fourth quarter -- his 22nd touchdown in his last 21 games -- and by game's end 
he had a dozen catches for 123 yards to become Atlanta's all-time leading 
receiver with 368 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes him look all the better now," Ram cornerback Robert Bailey said. 
"The way it's supposed to work is if somebody steps in your back yard, you got 
to fight for your home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he said what he did he kind of stepped across the line. But we didn't 
come out fighting. We just didn't have the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Any spark the Rams (1-1) might have generated was doused early in the second 
quarter. The Falcons had a 14-0 lead, but the Rams had the ball at Atlanta's 
one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis tried three consecutive times to bull his way 
forward for the final yard, but each time was stopped for no gain. Fourth and 
goal from the one, and the Rams desperately needed a touchdown, but Knox sent 
in the field-goal team. 
</P>
<P>
 The snap to quarterback Chris Chandler, the holder for kicker Tony Zendejas, 
hit him in the hands and bounced away, aborting Zendejas' try. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's early in the ballgame and if we get three points there, that's a big 
three points," Knox said when asked about his decision. "We tried three times 
to get it in, and were not able to get it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had gone on fourth down and didn't make it -- running the ball or 
throwing the ball -- they would have said we should have kicked the field goal. 
That's the business, do whatever you want to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Second guessing, Part II: Later, in the same quarter with the Rams still 
trailing, 14-0, and at the Falcons' 34 on fourth and 17, Knox went for it. And 
the Rams scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller, who was booed soundly upon his return to Atlanta, 
threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to rookie Isaac Bruce, his first NFL reception, 
to pull within a touchdown of the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Rams' kickoff, the Falcons had 1:07 and 66 yards to travel before 
halftime, but George placed his team in field-goal position, and Norm Johnson 
was successful from 48 yards on the final play of the half for a 17-7 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons squandered an opportunity on their first possession in the third 
quarter when they asked rookie wide receiver Bert Emanuel to play quarterback 
on third and goal from the two. After scrambling right and then left, Emanuel 
threw a pass that was intercepted by linebacker Roman Phifer in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' next three drives ended in interceptions, including Darnell Walker's 
44-yard return for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams compiled 421 yards in offense, but a week after committing 10 
penalties, they had nine against the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson caught five passes for 154 yards, including a 
41-yard touchdown pass play from Chandler in the final minutes of the game, but 
tight end Troy Drayton has gone two games without a reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ran for 102 yards in 24 carries, but losing as badly as they were, the 
Rams did not give him the ball in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to bounce back," cornerback Todd Lyght said. "We have to play the San 
Francisco 49ers next week, and supposedly from what I've heard, they are one of 
the best teams in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Any guarantee on who wins? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't guarantee anything -- I don't play offense," Lyght said. "I can't put 
any points on the board."

GOLF ROUNDUP; PRICE SOARS WITH EAGLE FOR CANADIAN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nick Price continued his domination of world golf, nailing down the Canadian 
Open title Sunday with a magnificent two-iron that set up a decisive eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his 16th victory in 54 starts, dating to the 1992 PGA championship, for 
the man from Zimbabwe who is unchallenged as the outstanding player in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Price nailed down this one with a 217-yard two-iron second shot that rolled 
within 30 inches of the flag for a tap-in eagle-3 on No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the best two-iron I've ever hit in my life," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 It came as a door-slamming response to Mark Calcavecchia, who was playing two 
holes ahead of Price and chipped in from 30 feet for an eagle on 18. 
</P>
<P>
 That pulled him even with Price at 12 under, but it lasted only a moment. When 
Price tapped in his eagle putt the lead was back to two with two holes to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Price finished with a closing 68 and a 13-under-par 275 on the Glen Abbey Golf 
Club course at Oakville, one ahead of Calcavecchia. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was Price's fifth of the year on the PGA Tour, the most by any 
player since Tom Watson won six in 1980. That total doesn't include Price's 
victory in the British Open two months ago, the first of his two majors this 
year. He also won the PGA. 
</P>

 On a day when Betsy King or Amy Alcott seemed headed for the LPGA Hall of 
Fame, Missie McGeorge came from three shots back in the final round to win the 
Ping-Cellular One Championship at Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 McGeorge shot a six-under-par 66 to tie the tournament record at nine-under 
207. 
</P>
<P>
 King and Alcott each need one victory to join the Hall of Fame and both were 
on the leader board through much of the final day at the 6,319-yard 
Columbia-Edgewater Country Club course. King finished second, three shots 
behind at 210. Alcott, who began the final round with a one-stroke lead, shot a 
76 and wound up at 214. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Eichelberger ended a 13-year winless streak with a two-shot victory in 
the Quicksilver Classic at Midway, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Eichelberger, the fifth first-time PGA Senior Tour winner this year, overcame 
an erratic driver to shoot a one-under 71 and finish at seven-under 209. Ray 
Floyd (70) and Homero Blancas (69) tied for second at 211. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-time PGA Tour winner, Eichelberger hadn't won since the 1981 
Tallahassee Open.

MORNING BRIEFING: MCCORD WORKING ON A PLAN TO GET LAST WORD AT AUGUSTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary McCord, banned by the Masters Tournament for "distasteful" remarks as a 
CBS television golf commentator, is planning to get back to Augusta National 
next year -- as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to practice my butt off," McCord told the Augusta Chronicle. "I've 
got seven tournaments to play in (on the PGA Tour) before Augusta next year. 
What a story it would make if I made it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, the Masters' hierarchy would be thrilled.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Masters: Bob Kravitz of the Rocky Mountain News writes that announcers 
should learn the new Masters lexicon:  
</P>
<P>
 "A missed putt will now be referred to as being 'directionally challenged.' A 
bad lie will be 'an unfortunate topographical anomaly.'  
</P>
<P>
 "And a parking-lot fight between John Daly and a golfer's father will be noted 
as a 'gentlemen's disagreement on principle.' "

 Trivia time: Who holds the Ram record for most field goals in a game?

<P>
 Table trauma: Earl Strickland was frustrated after he was eliminated in the 
first round of the Challenge of Champions billiards tournament on Sept. 2 at 
the Mirage hotel in Las Vegas.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the table playing surface, Strickland said: "They forgot to mow the 
greens," adding, "Jack Nicklaus wouldn't play on this surface."  
</P>

<P>
 Demolition man: Howie Long, former Raider star defensive lineman, on his 
dreams of a Hollywood career:  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not interested in doing a 
shimmering-moonlight-through-the-Venetian-blinds, sweaty-bodies type of movie. 
I just want to blow stuff up."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 About time: Tom Weir of USA Today: "Chinese women have dominated the World 
Aquatic Championships, continuing to raise suspicions about whether they know 
how to beat the drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dunno. With over a billion people to recruit from, a better question might 
be what took them so long to get good?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 FYI: The 41-41 tie between Stanford and Northwestern on Saturday was well 
short of the NCAA Division I-A record for highest-scoring tie game -- a 52-52 
standoff between Brigham Young and San Diego State on Nov. 16, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Highest-scoring tie game for USC was 31-31 twice, against San Diego State in 
1992 and California in 1990. For UCLA, it was 27-27 against Purdue in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oddity: Arizona State scored 10 points in losing to Miami, 47-10, in a most 
unusual manner -- two safeties and two field goals.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders must think there is a football strike. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They still haven't shown up for work this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Their 38-9 loss to the Seattle Seahawks at the Coliseum on Sunday was even 
more humiliating than their 44-14 loss to the San Francisco 49ers at 
Candlestick Park last Monday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Another defeat against Denver next Sunday at Mile High Stadium and the team 
that was ranked among the favorites to reach the Super Bowl can start saying 
goodby to its playoff chances in the middle of September. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the only punching bag in the AFC West resides in L.A. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City beat San Francisco. Enough said. Seattle and San Diego are 
improved and also unbeaten. Denver is 0-2 but has lost by a total of six 
points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are winless and reeling because they have shown little energy, 
imagination or organization, slumping quarterback Jeff Hostetler has been 
outplayed by Steve Young and Rick Mirer, the running attack is nonexistent, and 
the defense isn't making big plays. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The defense didn't make many small plays, either, after the ejections of 
Chester McGlockton and Aundray Bruce in the second quarter left Art Shell in 
need of volunteers for the line. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton and Bruce were involved in a scuffle that also resulted in the 
ejection of Seattle offensive tackle Ray Roberts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They joined several fans who also were kicked out of the Coliseum for 
fighting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the third quarter, thousands of other fans left on their own and 
the remnants of what had been an enthusiastic crowd of 47,319 booed the home 
team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Rison sure picks his spots when he guarantees a victory, doesn't he?. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 The way USC performed against Penn State on Saturday, the Trojans must have 
been caught looking ahead to their next opponent -- BYE. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they seemed to be intimidated. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Penn State, with a well-balanced offense and a tough defense, might be as good 
as anybody in the nation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Like last season, the USC defensive line appears unable to stop a quality 
rushing attack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Against a national power on the road, the Trojans desperately needed some 
senior leadership. Quarterback Rob Johnson didn't provide it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Touted as a Heisman Trophy candidate, Johnson is off to a poor start. He 
misses Johnnie Morton, and his new receivers aren't running the proper routes 
yet. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But before you write off the Trojans, consider that their opening-day victim, 
Washington, beat Ohio State at Seattle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies' victory was one of the few bright spots for the Pacific 10 
Conference, which apparently was overrated. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC, Arizona State and Oregon were routed. California was upset by San Diego 
State, Stanford was tied by Northwestern in the SAT Bowl and UCLA needed a 
goal-line stand to hold off SMU. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A week before playing Nebraska in Lincoln, the Bruins, who were without J.J. 
Stokes, wanted to pad their record against an inferior opponent and escape 
without any major injuries. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They are 2-0 for only the second time in the last six years, but suffered a 
couple of injuries that will sideline their best defensive back, cornerback 
Carl Greenwood, and dependable right tackle Paul Kennedy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At least, UCLA was able to get some experience against a big, option-type 
quarterback, Ramon Flanigan, who is a poor man's version of Cornhusker Tommie 
Frazier. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bruin tailback Sharmon Shah's hard-running style reminds me of Charles White. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's Ron Powlus reminds NBC of Joe Montana and every other great 
quarterback in the history of football. . . . Powlus is a talented sophomore 
with a 1-1 career record. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but it was Michigan quarterback Todd Collins who turned in the play of 
the game, completing a pass under duress that set up the winning field goal. 
Collins also had better numbers than Powlus -- 21 of 29 for 224 yards, compared 
to 15 of 27 for 187 yards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, Powlus' parents, sitting in the stands, got more up-close and 
personal attention on TV than Collins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There must be a middle ground between NBC's approach and this observation from 
ABC analyst Bob Griese: "Notre Dame has one problem. They've got a young 
quarterback.". . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Never underestimate the greed, arrogance and stubbornness of major league 
baseball owners and players.

PRO FOOTBALL / ATLANTA FALCONS 31, RAMS 13; RAM REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Quarter: Welcome to Georgia Dome, site of last year's Super Bowl, 1996 
Olympics and Final Four in 2002 -- coincidentally, the same year Rams expect 
Wayne Gandy to make first NFL start . . . Rams announce publicly before game 
Shane Conlan will be inactive; guess it just goes without saying they won't 
throw ball to tight end Troy Drayton . . . Rams begin game with dropped pass by 
Tim Lester aka Venus de Milo . . . Crowd is informed Andre Rison has set club 
record with 360 catches; 296 seemingly coming in first 15 minutes of this game, 
which is also believed to be NFL mark. . . . Falcons 14, Rams 0 
</P>
<P>
 Second Quarter: Good news from Hollywood: Jim Carrey has agreed to lend Gandy 
"The Mask" . . . Jerome "How 'bout 200 yards or bust?" Bettis has four rushes 
for 10 yards, but no truth to rumor Rams have approached authorities about 
weekend furlough and $2 million bond to free Mike Tyson to play left tackle . . 
. Isaac Bruce catches TD pass, runs around like he's won lottery, will realize 
in week or so his luck ran out when Rams drafted him . . . Darryl Henley 
update: He's still here . . . Fourth and goal from the one and Chuck Knox gives 
offense the boot. . . . Falcons 17, Rams 7 
</P>
<P>
 Third Quarter: Jeff George passes the 10,000-yard mark, no, not for the game . 
. . Limo driver seen holding card up at end of field: "Mr. Israel." Seems Jerry 
Rice is a little eager to make sure Steve Israel reports for duty next week . . 
. Tattoo in mouth reveals that was no ringer after Flipper Anderson makes 
diving catch . . . Holding on Leo Goeas, and after game Knox accuses refs of 
picking on his players. Local Atlanta attorney by name of Matlock agrees to 
defend men in stripes . . . Drayton asks Knox if he can be introduced to 
Miller. . . . Falcons 24, Rams 7 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Quarter: Rison scores again, and no wonder: Rams had Richard Buchanan 
impersonate Rison in practice; that's like asking Rosanne to be Sharon Stone's 
body double . . . Miller is right on target: Completes third pass of the day to 
his former teammates . . . Gandy asks if he can go on CNN Studio Tour, but 
instead is put in game. Refs notice, flag him for holding . . . Craig 
(Ironhead) Heyward throws fear of God into Rams until Pope intervenes, forces 
fumble . . . Falcons 31, Rams 13 
</P>
<P>
 Game Summary: Bettis runs for 102 yards, but frankly, my dear, who gives a 
damn . . . NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue denies George & Rison's request to 
play Rams every week . . . In an up-and-coming episode on "Coach," Hayden falls 
ill, and Luther is asked to make the critical call: Down, 14-0, fourth and goal 
from the one, do you go for it? He thinks out loud: "What would Coach Chuck 
Knox do in a situation like this?" Dauber interjects: "Punt." T.J. SIMERS

THIS TIME, THE BUCCANEERS' OFFENSE IS CATCHING; INTERCONFERENCE: ERICKSON 
PASSES FOR 313 YARDS AS TAMPA BAY'S RECEIVERS MAKE THE BIG PLAYS IN 24-10 
VICTORY. FAULK IS AGAIN IMPRESSIVE FOR THE COLTS.

 Craig Erickson's receivers caught passes that counted and the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers now count themselves in the victory column. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching his teammates drop four passes in last week's loss to Chicago, 
Erickson threw three touchdown passes and the Buccaneers beat the Indianapolis 
Colts, 24-10, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dropped a pass, fine, but not a lot and not crucial passes this week," 
Coach Sam Wyche said. "That's the mark of a good team. We'll find out how good 
in time." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson passed for 313 yards, including touchdowns pass plays of 50 yards to 
Charles Wilson and 48 yards to Jackie Harris, as the Buccaneers (1-1) withstood 
another 100-yard plus day by Colt rookie Marshall Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest crowd for a home opener in Tampa Bay history (36,631) watched 
Erickson record the second-highest passing total of his career with 19 
completions in 24 attempts. He put the game away with a 3-yard touchdown pass 
to Courtney Hawkins in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive week, the Buccaneers had no turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, however, was receivers held passes instead of bobbling away 
scoring chances in a 21-9 loss to the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk, who had 143 yards in the Colts' 45-21 victory over Houston last week, 
had 104 yards in 18 carries and seven catches for 82 yards against the 
Buccaneers. He sprained his left wrist on the first play of the game and missed 
the series, but played the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's good, probably one of the top running backs in the league," Tampa 
Bay linebacker Hardy Nickerson said. "He's able to turn routine plays into big 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers, led by Nickerson's 18 tackles, kept Faulk out of the end zone, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts (1-1) gained 364 yards -- only three less than the Buccaneers -- but 
were held to Dean Biasucci's 26-yard field goal and an eight-yard touchdown run 
by Roosevelt Potts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense played as well as their defense, but their offense made the big 
plays," Faulk said. "Offensively, we just didn't explode like we did last 
week."

SPIKES' PARTY GIVES THE DOLPHINS PUNCH; INTERCONFERENCE: ROOKIE RUNNING BACK 
GAINS 70 YARDS AND HELPS SET UP TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN MIAMI'S 24-14 VICTORY OVER 
THE PACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie running back Irving Spikes has played against the Green Bay Packers 
twice in his fledgling career, and both times he made it look like his party. 
</P>
<P>
 Spikes, a free agent who made Miami's roster after an exceptional exhibition 
season performance against Green Bay, set up two first-half touchdowns that 
triggered the Dolphins' 24-14 victory over the Packers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by Miami after being ignored on draft day, Spikes ran 13 times for 70 
yards before leaving early in the fourth quarter with a twisted right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to prove that I can run the ball," said Spikes, who added that 
his knee felt fine. "This means a lot to me. Hopefully, they'll have confidence 
in me to keep giving me the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 In the exhibition victory over the Packers, Spikes had three kickoff returns 
for 146 yards and ran for the winning touchdown. However, Spikes ran just once 
for five yards in Miami's season-opening, 39-35 victory over New England. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins (2-0) scored on four of their first five possessions, including a 
pair of touchdown passes by Dan Marino, and boosted their regular season record 
against the Packers to 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino has beaten Green Bay (1-1) all five times he has faced them, but he 
said the job this time was easier with the 5-foot-8, 215-pound Spikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's small and elusive," Marino said. "He did a great job of accelerating 
through the holes. We wanted to get him into their secondary and he did a great 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 "Spikes seems like he always has a great game against us," Green Bay safety 
LeRoy Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packer linebacker George Koonce agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still going to face a running back like Barry Sanders, and runners like 
that, so we can't let a little Spikes do that to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Miami ahead, 3-0, late in the first half, Spikes, who had the fourth-best 
rushing average in the nation (149.5) last year at Northeast Louisiana, gained 
41 yards in three consecutive plays, setting up Marino's 3-yard touchdown pass 
to tight end Keith Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, who shredded the Patriots for 473 yards and five touchdowns last week 
in his first regular-season appearance since undergoing surgery to repair a 
torn Achilles' tendon, completed 17 of 25 passes for 177 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He executed a perfect play-action fake on fourth-and-one, finding Jackson 
alone in the left side of the end zone, to end a 12-play, 86-yard drive that 
made the score 10-0 with about five minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 After recovering a fumble near midfield, Spikes again put the Dolphins in 
position for a Marino touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 On that drive, Spikes ran five times for 35 yards, and Terry Kirby dived for a 
first down on fourth-and-one at the Packers' six. On second-and-goal, Marino 
passed to a wide-open Keith Byars in the left flat for a touchdown with 27 
seconds left before halftime. The reception marked the 105th consecutive game 
he has caught at least one pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he said: "To be honest, I don't just want to be a return guy 
because I love to run the ball. I want to be the main guy on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby burst up the middle for a six-yard touchdown run to make the score, 
24-0, midway through the third period.  
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre completed 31 of 51 passes for 362 yards, but 
much of that came on short yardage after Miami had the game well in hand. Green 
Bay ran just seven times. Green Bay didn't score until midway through the 
fourth quarter when Favre connected with Ed West and Sterling Sharpe on scoring 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe extended his team record by catching a pass in his 89th consecutive 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 "Flat? Yeah, that's a real good word," Packers coach Mike Holmgren said. "We 
weren't ready for whatever reason."  
</P>
<P>
 Chris Jacke missed a 46-yard field goal attempt in the first period, failing 
to tie Chester Marcol's club record of 120 career field goals.

TOUGH VIKING DEFENSE DOMINATES LIONS, 10-3; NFC: DETROIT QUARTERBACK MITCHELL 
IS SACKED SIX TIMES AND FUMBLES THREE TIMES AND BARRY SANDERS IS HELD TO 16 
YARDS AS MINNESOTA'S LINE CONTROLS GAME. 
</P>

<P>
 John Randle and Henry Thomas up the middle, James Harris and Roy Barker around 
the ends. They were relentless, punishing. They drove Scott Mitchell to the 
turf and tore the football from his grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mitchell brings a new dimension to their team. There's no question 
they're more potent," linebacker Jack Del Rio said Sunday after his Minnesota 
Vikings beat Mitchell and the Detroit Lions, 10-3. "But today, he met John 
Randle." 
</P>
<P>
 Randle had two sacks, as did Harris and Barker. Thomas wasn't in on any of 
Minnesota's six sacks, but his pressure from the nose tackle position 
consistently freed his linemates to attack; he also was the main force that let 
the Vikings (1-1) hold Barry Sanders to 16 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't block them up front," Lion Coach Wayne Fontes said. "We resorted 
to a passing game and our quarterback was running for his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, the celebrated newcomer with a three-year, $11 million contract, 
threw three touchdown passes last week when the Lions opened with a 31-28 
victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he completed 18 of 40 passes for 212 yards, fumbled three times and 
was intercepted once. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Moon, who ended up here only because Minnesota couldn't match Detroit's 
$5 million signing bonus for Mitchell, completed 22 of 35 passes for 221 yards 
and a touchdown in his Vikings home debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he outplayed Mitchell, he wasn't happy with his performance. Moon, 
acquired from Houston last April, missed some open receivers and threw a 
potentially costly interception at Minnesota's 32-yard line with 4:54 left. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense saved him -- again -- when Barker sacked Mitchell and forced a 
fumble that Del Rio recovered with 3:25 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't have been as hard as it was, especially the way our defense was 
playing," Moon said. "We're not where we want to be on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit kicker Jason Hanson missed field goals from 42 and 46 yards.

BILLS BOUNCE BACK, BUT NEED LATE KICK; AFC: KELLY AND THOMAS LEAD THE WAY, BUT 
CHRISTIE'S FIELD GOAL IS THE DIFFERENCE IN BUFFALO'S 38-35 VICTORY. BLEDSOE AND 
PATRIOTS ARE AGAIN ON THE LOSING END OF A SHOOTOUT. 
</P>

<P>
 Steve Christie's 32-yard field goal with 52 seconds left lifted the Buffalo 
Bills to a 38-35 victory over the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this win against a divisional opponent like New England," 
quarterback Jim Kelly said. "We came in thinking it was a must win. You can't 
get down 0-2 in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the Patriots, who lost their opener, 39-35, in Miami, find 
themselves after the Buffalo defense slipped and blew a 28-14 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On the winning drive, Kelly led the Bills from their 43-yard line to the New 
England 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills -- held to a field goal in a season-opening upset by the New York 
Jets -- got four touchdown passes from Kelly and 106 rushing yards from Thurman 
Thomas.  
</P>
<P>
 So their offense is back, but the defense still must convince doubters that 
the club can win a fifth consecutive AFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know the season's going down the tubes if they don't get going," New 
England Coach Bill Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
 They did, but the Patriots had some things going themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 35-21, in the fourth quarter, the Patriots capitalized on 
interceptions on consecutive series to score two touchdowns. The first set up a 
12-yard touchdown pass play from Drew Bledsoe to Michael Timpson, and the 
second led to Marion Butts' six-yard touchdown run -- his second touchdown of 
the game -- with 4:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo defensive end Bruce Smith wasn't surprised that his team had trouble 
stopping the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect a shootout, but I did expect their team to play well," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The off-season departure of defensive backs Nate Odomes and Mark Kelso and 
offensive tackle Howard Ballard fueled talk that the Bills, losers of the last 
four Super Bowls, wouldn't get a fifth chance. 
</P>
<P>
 And the opening 23-3 loss to the Jets added to it. Kelly knew the Bills had to 
turn their season around quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said the Bills also had expectations of themselves to 
live up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win games solely on our reputations," Levy said. "We talked about 
that. Kelly, Thurman Thomas and Bruce Smith, among our star players, took 
charge all week."  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas played up to his reputation after gaining five yards in seven carries 
against the Jets last week. After the first two plays Sunday, he passed his 
rushing total against the Jets: He had two five-yard gains to start the 80-yard 
drive that gave Buffalo a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to move at a faster pace. It seems to help us execute better," he 
said. "I loved the tempo we set in the first half but we got tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bledsoe's reputation is growing. The top pick in last year's draft 
passed for 380 yards and three touchdowns one week after passing for 421 yards 
and four touchdowns. But Dan Marino had five touchdown passes for the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel drained," Bledsoe said. "When you lose by 25 points, you feel 
embarrassed. A close game like this, anyone can see that one play could have 
made all the difference. That makes it that much harder to digest." 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe couldn't make it at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 He had led the Patriots downfield after getting the ball at his 27-yard line 
with 46 seconds left and no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 On third-and-five with 24 seconds left, a four-yard pass to Ben Coates put the 
ball at the Buffalo 39. With no way to stop the clock, Bledsoe raced to the 
line of scrimmage and ran for a three-yard sneak as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have thrown the ball to the sideline," he said. "It was a bad 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe became the first New England Patriots quarterback with three 
consecutive 300-yard passing games. His 380 yards against the Buffalo Bills on 
Sunday followed a 329-yard performance in last year's finale against Miami and 
a 421-yard day in this year's opener against the Dolphins. He has 11 touchdown 
passes in those three games.  
</P>
<P>
 The 70 points the Patriots have scored in their first two games is the most 
they have scored in the first two games of any season. The previous high was 69 
in 1979. Last season, the Patriots scored their 70th point in their fifth game. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo coasted through the first half as the New England secondary gave up a 
37-yard pass play to Andre Reed, a four-yard pass play to Thomas, a 12-yard 
pass play to Bill Brooks and a 14-yard pass play to Don Beebe. Bledsoe threw 
two scoring passes to Coates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly's four touchdown passes set a Bills team record with 183. Joe Ferguson's 
old mark was 181.

GIANTS HAND RYAN, CARDINALS ANOTHER LOSS, 20-17; NFC: BROWN PASSES FOR TWO 
TOUCHDOWNS AND NEW YORK DEFENSE SACKS MCMAHON TWICE LATE IN GAME TO PRESERVE 
VICTORY.

 A winner in town? Not quite yet, Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan's first public utterance when he was hired in February to coach the 
Arizona Cardinals came back to haunt him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's Dave Brown completed a pair of 1-yard scoring passes to Howard 
Cross in the first half, and Michael Brooks and Keith Hamilton sacked Jim 
McMahon on consecutive plays late in the fourth quarter to preserve a 20-17 
victory that dropped Ryan's Cardinals to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who came to the Cardinals from his job as defensive coordinator at 
Houston after punching fellow assistant coach Kevin Gilbride in the final game 
of the 1993 season, was 43-35-1 in five years with the Philadelphia Eagles and 
predicted quick success for himself in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 He had organized an honors-laden defense, hiring former players like Seth 
Joyner, Clyde Simmons and Wilber Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Giants had Ryan's vaunted "46" defense on the ropes in the end, 
running off 10 consecutive plays to kill the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question about it, whenever you don't beat people in your own conference, 
it's pretty bad. We're treading water, but that doesn't mean we can't get 
there," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon replaced Steve Beuerlein, who completed 10 of 22 passes for 108 yards 
in his second subpar performance in a row, with 5:47 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon's second pass became Phillippi Sparks' second interception, but the 
Cardinals got the ball back and the 35-year-old McMahon pumped up the crowd of 
60,066 with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Ronald Moore with 10:52 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to make a decision. I felt we needed something at that time," Ryan 
said. "We had gotten down. It worked because the fans got into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown responded by taking the Giants on two consecutive time-consuming 
marches. The first ended with an interception by Lorenzo Lynch and a 23-yard 
return to the Arizona 34. But Brooks and Hamilton threw the Cardinals back to 
the 16 with the sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time, New York drove from its 34 to Arizona's 15, and Brown knelt on 
three snaps.

FRIESZ GETS COMFORTABLE, REDSKINS POUND SAINTS; NFC: HIS FOUR TOUCHDOWN PASSES, 
PLUS TWO KEY RETURNS BY BRIAN MITCHELL, LEAD WASHINGTON TO A 38-24 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 John Friesz played like a guy who plans on sticking around. 
</P>
<P>
 Supposed to baby sit Washington's quarterback job until top draft pick Heath 
Shuler is ready to take over, Friesz threw four touchdown passes Sunday as the 
Redskins defeated the New Orleans Saints, 38-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Mitchell scored on a 74-yard punt return and set up another touchdown 
with an 86-yard kickoff return, helping rookie head Coach Norv Turner earn his 
first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Friesz completed 15 of 22 passes for 194 yards. His performance kept Shuler on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I played well today," said Friesz, who had never thrown even three 
touchdown passes in a game during his five-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Friesz threw two touchdown passes to Henry Ellard, and one each to Cedric 
Smith and Desmond Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a drop throughout the game," Friesz said. "I really didn't get 
hit much. And we had great success running the ball, which made the passing 
game open up that much more." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell also helped open up things. He returned two punts for 87 yards and 
three kickoffs for 138 yards. He also rushed for 27 yards on seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
 A Saint punt in the first quarter went out of bounds on the Washington 31, but 
New Orleans (0-2) was penalized five yards and forced to punt again. Mitchell 
caught it on the 26 and ran through the Saints' coverage for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Friesz's one-yard pass to Ellard was set up after a punt by the Redskins hit 
Saints cornerback Tyrone Legette and was recovered by Lamont Hollinquest at the 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Mitchell caught Morten Andersen's kickoff one-yard deep in 
the end zone and ran it back to the New Orleans' 15. Six plays later, Friesz 
connected with Smith on a one-yard touchdown for a 21-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Friesz went to Ellard again in the third quarter for a 41-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint quarterback Jim Everett, who was under pressure most of the day, 
completed 31 of 46 passes for 376 yards and two touchdowns.

COWBOYS SURVIVE SCRAMBLING RICHARDSON, 20-17; INTERCONFERENCE: SWITZER DOES 
LANDRY, JOHNSON ONE BETTER IN FIRST YEAR IN DALLAS WITH THE VICTORY OVER 
OILERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 In only two games, Barry Switzer has won more times than any other first-year 
coach for the Dallas Cowboys. He discovered Sunday how difficult it can be to 
win in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time Super Bowl champion Cowboys held off Bucky Richardson in his 
first start and beat the Houston Oilers, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win but we're not going to brag about it," Switzer said. "We did what 
we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Landry was 0-11-1 with the expansion Cowboys, while Jimmy Johnson was 1-15 
in his first year with the team. Although Switzer inherited a championship 
club, there were questions about how he'd handle his first coaching job in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 While Richardson had the Cowboys worried, Dallas still managed four sacks and 
two interceptions in its home opener. Richardson was subbing for Cody Carlson, 
who wasn't activated because of a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith, who had 171 yards last week in going for his fourth consecutive 
NFL rushing title, had 90 yards in 27 carries. Richardson completed 20 of 42 
passes for 242 yards. Troy Aikman was 14 of 25 for 228 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Woodson and Charles Haley had interceptions for the Cowboys, who beat 
Houston (0-2) in the regular season for the first time since 1985. But 
Richardson took Houston on two touchdown drives and his scrambling kept the 
Oilers in the game.

 "We underestimated Bucky and he proved to everybody he can play in the NFL," 
Woodson said. "Houston is going to win a lot of games with him."

 The Oilers stacked the line of scrimmage and it proved to be their downfall

 "Before the game, I didn't want to play against him (Richardson)," Switzer 
said. "He scares me to death the way he scrambles."

<P>
 Houston coach Jack Pardee was pleased with Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bucky gave a gutsy performance," Pardee said. "He took a couple of rough 
hits. Cody is still our quarterback and, if he is healthy next week, he will 
start."

COWBOYS HOLD OFF RICHARDSON AND OILERS; INTERCONFERENCE: SWITZER BECOMES 
DALLAS' ALL-TIME WINNINGEST FIRST-YEAR COACH IN HIS SECOND GAME AFTER 20-17 
VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In only two games, Barry Switzer has won more times than any other first-year 
coach for the Dallas Cowboys. He discovered Sunday how difficult it can be to 
win in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time Super Bowl champion Cowboys held off Bucky Richardson in his 
first start and beat the Houston Oilers 20-17 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win but we're not going to brag about it," Switzer said. "We did what 
we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Landry was 0-11-1 with the expansion Cowboys, while Jimmy Johnson was 1-15 
in his first year with the team. Although Switzer inherited a championship 
club, there were questions about how he'd handle his first coaching job in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 While Richardson had the Cowboys worried, Dallas still managed four sacks and 
two interceptions in their home-opener. Richardson was subbing for Cody 
Carlson, who wasn't activated. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith, who had 171 yards last week in going for his fourth straight NFL 
rushing title, had 90 yards on 27 carries on Sunday. Richardson completed 20 of 
42 passes for 242 yards, while Troy Aikman was 14 of 25 for 228 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Woodson and Charles Haley had interceptions for the Cowboys, who beat 
Houston (0-2) in the regular season for the first time since 1985. But 
Richardson took Houston on two touchdown drives and his scrambling kept the 
Oilers in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We underestimated Bucky and he proved to everybody he can play in the NFL," 
Woodson said. "Houston is going to win a lot of games with him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers stacked the line of scrimmage and it proved to be their downfall 
when Aikman hit Alvin Harper with a 53-yard touchdown pass in the third period 
for a 20-10 lead. Harper had single coverage on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson twice scrambled for first downs, once on fourth-and-18 from the 
Dallas 38, to position Houston for Gary Brown's 2-yard TD run, his second score 
of the game, with 4:03 left. 
</P>
<P>
 A costly mistake by Dallas wide receiver Michael Irvin gave the Oilers a 
chance in the first half after the Cowboys built a 10-3 lead. Irvin bobbled a 
long pass from Aikman and Cris Dishman caught the carom and returned the 
interception 38 yards to the Dallas 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Questionable strategy by the Oilers help position the Cowboys for a 29-yard 
field goal by Chris Boniol that gave Dallas a 13-10 halftime lead. With 
third-and-1 from the Oilers 9, Richardson passed incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas took the punt and drove 40 yards for the field goal as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston coach Jack Pardee said problems with the radio helmet caused a mixup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was first down," Pardee said. "That was a big mistake on me."

JETS' MOORE DOES BANG-UP JOB ON BRONCOS; AFC: RECEIVER SCORES ON LATE TOUCHDOWN 
AFTER GETTING KNOCKED OUT OF THE GAME BRIEFLY, THEN LOWERY'S FIELD GOAL IN 
OVERTIME WINS IT, 25-22. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Rob Moore should always wear a cast and get his bell rung. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore had his second consecutive big game while playing with a broken wrist, 
catching a 35-yard touchdown pass and a two-point conversion from Boomer 
Esiason in the fourth quarter Sunday. That gave the New York Jets the lead and 
set up their 25-22 victory over the Denver Broncos in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Lowery's 39-yard field goal 3:57 into overtime won it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, signed as a free agent to help the Jets win just these kind of games, 
enjoyed the clutch situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my kicks are real close, but this one sailed right down the middle," 
said the NFL's No. 3 career scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's touchdown came four plays after he was knocked to the ground by Steve 
Atwater and went to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore thought it was a cheap shot and told Atwater as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more ticked off than anything," Moore said. "I was really angry. It 
actually fired me up a little after that." 
</P>
<P>
 He was so fired up that he easily beat Ben Smith on a post pattern to put New 
York (2-0) in front, 22-19. 
</P>
<P>
 "The middle of the field opened up, because the safety left," Moore said. 
"When I saw him leave, I thought, 'Oh, this is going to be great.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moore caught the ball in full stride for the score, then ran a quick out for 
the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it wasn't enough. It rarely is when you leave John Elway 4:15 on the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway guided the Broncos (0-2) 53 yards in 2 1/2 minutes and Jason Elam's 
29-yard field goal tied it. 
</P>
<P>
 But they lost the coin flip to start overtime, and the Jets' old pros -- 
Esiason, Art Monk and Lowery -- took over. 
</P>
<P>
 That irked Denver Coach Wade Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame we lost the coin flip," he said. "I think they'd have lost the 
game if we'd have won the coin flip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said it before, in overtime it is just too big an advantage to get the 
ball on the 30- or 35-yard line. Not during regulation time, I think it helps 
the game. But it is too big an advantage in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Esiason took the Jets 45 yards with the overtime kickoff. Monk made the key 
play of the drive with a 24-yard reception on which he got some help from an 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to use the man as a pick to my advantage," Monk said. "He just 
happened to be an official." 
</P>
<P>
 Esiason and Elway staged a sizzling duel down the stretch. Esiason completed 
26 of 37 passes for 297 yards, with two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "My couple mistakes the last couple of weeks have been major mistakes," said 
Elway, who was victimized for a 67-yard interception return by Mo Lewis. "We 
could've had two wins."

CHARGERS REACH MILESTONE, DEFEAT BENGALS; AFC: HUMPHRIES AND MEANS LEAD EASY, 
27-10, VICTORY OVER CINCINNATI. CHARGERS ARE 2-0 FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 1981. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems every time the Cincinnati Bengals come to town, the San Diego 
Chargers reach some kind of milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Humphries passed for 299 yards and two touchdowns, Natrone Means ran for 
107 yards and a touchdown, and San Diego's defense forced three turnovers deep 
in its own territory as the Chargers won their home opener, 27-10, over the 
Bengals on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 When these two teams met here on Dec. 13, 1992, the Chargers were playoff 
bound. They beat the Bengals, also 27-10, to become the first team in NFL 
history to clinch a winning record after starting with four consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers are 2-0 for the first time since 1981, when Air Coryell was 
reaching its zenith. Cincinnati fell to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In past seasons, this might have been the kind of game the Chargers would 
lose. They were coming off a 37-34 victory at Denver, and there were questions 
about how well they would handle their sudden success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was what kept us out of the playoffs last year," Humphries said. 
"We didn't take care of business at home, and we should have. I think maybe 
this team has grown up a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Chris Mims noted that consistent playoff contenders usually 
start strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always starting off 0-4 or 0-something," Mims said. "We're starting off 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries was 18 of 29, including touchdown passes of 49 and 4 yards to Mark 
Seay. He was not sacked by a defense that includes tackle Dan "Big Daddy" 
Wilkinson, the first pick in last April's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's excellent," said second-year left guard Joe Cocozzo, who faced 
Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries has yet to be sacked this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's hard to do in the NFL, go two games without giving up one," left 
tackle Harry Swayne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries moved San Diego 80 yards on merely five plays for a 20-3 lead with 
26 seconds left in the third quarter. On third-and-8 from the Bengal 49, he 
found Seay -- his third option -- wide open at about the 20 and he outraced a 
defender for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been this wide open in my whole entire career," Seay said. "But 
I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay barely kept his feet in-bounds on a 4-yard touchdown catch with 4:12 left 
in the game that set the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay, whose first NFL catch was for a 29-yard touchdown last week, had eight 
receptions for 119 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati quarterback David Klingler was 21 of 34 for 180 yards with one 
touchdown, but committed two of the Bengals' three turnovers.

DEL MAR; LYKATILL HIL WINS AS DELAHOUSSAYE MAKES RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lykatill Hil kicks up his heels in the barn and in the paddock and in the 
post-parade. But he ran so well from the starting gate to the wire Sunday that 
he was able to kick up his heels in one more venue. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from behind under Eddie Delahoussaye, the 4-year-old gelding won the 
Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap over a small but formidable field. 
Front-running D'hallevant finished second and longshot Stuka rallied for third. 
Favored Brocco ran last. 
</P>
<P>
 The race offered a $200,000 purse, but the winner diminished that by $55,000. 
Because Lykatill Hill was not Breeders' Cup eligible, he did not get the 55% 
share of the $100,000 the Breeders' Cup Fund adds to the basic $100,000 value 
of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, the Grade II victory was the biggest of Lykatill Hills' career. He 
had won eight races and earned $366,700 in his previous 21 starts, but none at 
this level. His last Grade II start, for example, produced a fourth-place 
finish in the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes to kick up his heels," trainer Art Sherman said, "but he's perfect 
on the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye was the fifth jockey Lykatill Hil has had in six races this year. 
Delahoussaye was riding for the first time since being injured when he went 
over the rail on a horse the previous Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm black and blue in some spots and sore some," Delahoussaye said, "but I'm 
OK. Art did a good job with this horse and I thank him for riding me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sherman: "A strong rider has to be at his peak because he's such a 
handful, but Eddie's been on a lot of champions and I felt good about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco, making his first start since the Kentucky Derby, did not fare well as 
the only 3-year-old in the field of older horses. He ran last all of the way 
under Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't show much today," Stevens said. "I don't think he cares much for 
this track. I hope that's his problem." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The entries for Wednesday's closing-day feature, the $250,000 Del Mar 
Futurity, came and went Sunday and the probable favorite, Mr Purple, was left 
out. The Hollywood Juvenile Championship winner had not been nominated and, 
thus, was ineligible to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominations were due June 10, but a horse that had not been nominated could be 
supplemented. But the $10,000 supplementary fee was due last Friday. At that 
time, the nomination oversight had not been discovered by either trainer Ron 
McAnally or the racing office. It would have been the trainer's responsibility, 
but the racing office probably would have prompted him in a case such as this. 
By Sunday morning, when the field was drawn, it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Two horses were supplemented Friday, the Canadian-import A.J. Jett and Desert 
Mirage, but the undefeated Mr Purple was not. He had lost before he could 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally still has a strong entrant in On Target. He broke his maiden in his 
first start with a five-length victory at Del Mar on Aug. 7. Horse Racing Notes

 Phone Chatter, the 1993 Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner, takes another step on 
her comeback today when she makes her second 1994 start in the Vieille Vigne 
Handicap. She's the 4-5 morning-line favorite after her easy victory in the 
C.E.R.F. Stakes.

MOTORCYCLES / U.S. GRAND PRIX; ITALY'S CADALORA RIGHT AT HOME IN WINNING TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Luca Cadalora of Italy ended the American domination of the U.S. Motorcycle 
Grand Prix with an easy victory at Laguna Seca Raceway on Sunday, but in a way 
it had all the trappings of a hometown victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadalora rides a Yamaha for Marlboro Team Roberts, owned and managed by Kenny 
Roberts, who has a home in Carmel Valley, and coached by Wayne Rainey, a 
three-time world champion who lives in the hills above Monterey, overlooking 
the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like I won a home Grand Prix," Cadalora said after finishing 7.8 
seconds ahead of defending champion John Kocinski of Little Rock, Ark., and 
almost 25 seconds ahead of world champion Mick Doohan of Australia. A crowd 
estimated at 28,000 sat in on round 12 of the 14-race world championship 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Cadalora's victory, U.S. riders had won all five USGP events at Laguna 
Seca. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Cadalora took the lead from pole-sitter Doohan on the second turn of lap 
8, he was never challenged for the remainder of the 33-lap, 73-mile race. He 
averaged 90.974 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not much I could do," Kocinski said. "I could feel my toes dragging 
the ground and I was leaning over so far that my elbows were touching the curb, 
but it didn't do any good. I knew I was at my limit and couldn't gain on Luca, 
so I decided to finish as high as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kocinski and Doohan complained of tire slippage caused by a surprisingly 
warm track. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Cadalora's third 500cc GP victory and his second at Laguna Seca, where 
he won the 250cc race in 1991. The third-place finish was Doohan's worst since 
the opening race in Australia, where he was also third. 
</P>
<P>
 From lap 10, when Kocinski passed Doohan for second, there was not a lead 
change among the first six riders for the remainder of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinichi Itoh of Japan was fourth on a Honda and Doug Chandler, who lives a 
few miles away in Salinas, was fifth on a Cagiva in a photo finish. Only .005 
separated Itoh and Chandler. Japanese teen-ager Norifumi Abe, Cadalora's 
teammate, was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kocinski's finish moved him 20 points closer to the injured Kevin Schwantz for 
second place in the world standings behind Doohan. Schwantz, who suffered a 
dislocated left hip in a fall during practice Saturday, did not start and 
announced that he will also sit out the season's final two races in Argentina 
and Spain. He has 169 points to 140 for Kocinski. Cadalora is fourth with 139. 
</P>
<P>
 The follow-the-leader 500cc race was in sharp contrast with the 250cc, in 
which there were seven crashes and numerous passes among the leaders before 
Doriano Romboni of Italy powered his Honda across the finish line ahead of 
fast-closing Massimiliano Biaggi, an Aprilia rider also from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshi Tsujimura of Japan won the 125cc race on a Honda. Grand Prix Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Roberts Jr. completed a 250cc race for the first time this season, 
finishing eighth after qualifying 13th. Roberts sat out the first 10 races 
after suffering a broken arm in preseason practice and he crashed in his only 
other start, two weeks ago in the Czech Republic GP. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Rainey, who became Roberts Jr.'s team manager after a crash last year 
left Rainey paralyzed from the chest down, was given a lap of honor before the 
races. Laguna Seca officials also announced that turn nine would be known as 
"Rainey Corner." Rainey, who lives in the Monterey hills overlooking the track, 
won three USGPs at Laguna Seca.

<P>
 The British driver scored his seventh career Formula One victory -- and his 
second in a row at the Monza autodrome -- by taking the lead at the halfway 
mark and holding off a challenge from Berger in the 53rd and final lap. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, Hill's fourth this season, narrowed his deficit to Schumacher in 
the world championship standings to 11 points. Schumacher did not compete while 
serving the first half of a two-race suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 The German driver also will sit out the Portuguese Grand Prix at Estoril on 
Sept. 25. Schumacher, who was punished for ignoring a black flag during the 
British Grand Prix, will be eligible to return for the Grand Prix of Europe in 
Spain on Oct. 16.

 Jacques Villeneuve outfoxed Paul Tracy and Al Unser Jr. to win the 
Texaco-Havoline 200 Indy-car race at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wis., as 
Unser clinched his second PPG Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve, 23, son of the late Formula One star Gilles Villeneuve, took the 
lead with a daring pass that moved him from third to first on a restart only 15 
laps from the end of the 200-mile event on the four-mile, 14-turn road circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The second full-course caution flag of the 50-lap race came out on lap 32 when 
Arie Luyendyk slid off-track, hit a barrier and wound up stopped sideways 
across the track. 
</P>
<P>
 When the green flag waved again for the start of lap 36, Tracy, who started 
from the pole and led from the start, was challenged by teammate Unser on the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve, whose uncle Jacques, Gilles' brother, earned his only Indy-car 
victory at Elkhart Lake in 1985, took advantage of the situation, driving to 
the inside. He moved alongside the momentarily distracted Tracy and passed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indy-car rookie, who lives in Monte Carlo, held off Tracy until an engine 
failure put Tracy out of the race on lap 44, then kept Unser behind him to the 
end, earning the first victory of his career. His previous best had been second 
place -- behind Unser -- at the Indianapolis 500 in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser's points victory gave team owner Roger Penske his ninth series title, 
but first since Danny Sullivan won in 1988.

FREITAS LEADS HAWAII TO 36-16 VICTORY OVER OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Freitas, making his first start at quarterback, rushed for two 
touchdowns and linebacker Junior Faavae returned an intercepted pass 44 yards 
for another score Saturday night to power Hawaii to a 36-16 victory over 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Freitas rushed for 117 yards in 22 carries and completed five of 15 passes for 
another 92 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Faavae's interception return, Hawaii (1-1) picked off two other 
Danny O'Neil passes and recovered two fumbles. The turnovers resulted in two 
touchdowns and a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon (1-1) got to within 10 points with Herman O'Berry setting up a 42-yard 
drive with a 52-yard return of the second-half kickoff. Ricky Whittle made it 
20-10 with a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Hawaii scored the next 16 points to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil, who had a four-touchdown game against Portland State last week, was 13 
of 28 for 161 yards with 134 coming in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the three interceptions, he was sacked twice.

SEATTLE KEEPS SALSA OFFENSE SILENT; SOCCER: THE SOUNDERS WIN, 1-0, AS THE 
EXPECTED GOAL RUSH TURNS INTO A DEFENSIVE STRUGGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The top four goal-scorers in the American Professional Soccer League took the 
field at Titan Stadium on Sunday night, but it turned into a defensive duel 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Sounders handed the Salsa its first loss in five matches at home, 
1-0. The victory solidified Seattle's hold on first place with 96 points and 
dropped the Salsa into third with three games left in the regular season. 
Seattle is 11-6; the Salsa is 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal moved into second place with 83 points. The Salsa now has 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Dunn scored the match's only goal in the 44th minute on an assist from 
his brother, James. The Salsa's one-two punch of Paulinho and Paul Wright were 
shut out, as was the Sounders' Chance Fry. Wright had two shots on goal and 
Paulinho one. Fry had none. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of hype coming in about the scorers, but those kinds of 
things never seem to materialize the way you think they will," Salsa General 
Manager Rick Davis said. "When you get down to it, it was a solid effort 
defensively by both teams. Seattle did a good job of keeping our top two 
goal-scorers at bay all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was disappointed his team couldn't capitalize on its five scoring 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a couple of good chances in the first half, but when we did strike the 
ball well, it was getting blocked," Davis said. "And it was just one of those 
nights when we didn't play that well." 
</P>
<P>
 Paulinho, the APSL scoring leader with 23 points, gave the credit to an 
aggressive Sounder defense. "I had very little space to move around," he said. 
"Seattle is a team that marks very close, and I just didn't have the kind of 
space I need to work. They play hard, and they mark hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa goalkeeper Mike Littman called Dunn's goal, his ninth of the season, "a 
good, clean one." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our shots, too, but we just couldn't get them in tonight," Littman 
said. "I guess that's soccer. I still think we're two equal teams. I still 
don't think they're superior to us. They just got their goal tonight and we 
didn't get any." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle victory gave the Sounders a 2-1 advantage in the three matches 
between the two teams this season. Each team had won earlier games at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Dunn felt the victory would be a big boost to his team the remainder of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to come in here and win one this way," Dunn said. "We needed it 
with them as close as they were to us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disappointing loss to Davis. "If we could have gotten a win it would 
have made us pretty even," he said. "Seattle winds up getting seven points 
tonight and we don't get any. It makes it a lot tougher for us now." 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Perez, the U.S. World Cup midfielder who signed Friday to play the 
remainder of the 1994 season with the Salsa, did not play against Seattle but 
is expected to play Saturday against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez is on loan to the Salsa from the U.S. Soccer Federation. He is a 10-year 
veteran of the national team. He was U.S. Soccer's male athlete of the year in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he is confident Perez will strengthen the Salsa the remainder of 
the season and into the playoffs if the Salsa qualifies as one of the top four 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives us a lot of experience and can complement our other top 
goal-scorers," he said. Salsa Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa defender Jeff Agoos played for the U.S. national team in its match 
against England on Wednesday at London's Wembley Stadium. England won, 2-0. It 
was the first match for the U.S. team since the World Cup. Agoos missed the 
team's home match last Sunday against Toronto, but was back for Sunday night's 
match against Seattle. Agoos played several seasons for the national team 
before signing with the Salsa for the 1994 APSL season.

 Newport Harbor 
</P>
<P>
 Coach: Bim Barry (sixth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Fourth at the Southern Section Division III-AA finals; fifth in the Sea 
View League. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Ryan Adams, Sr.; Henry Chian, Sr.; Shahram DeZahd, Sr.; Jake 
Swanson, Sr.; Andrew Van Note, Sr.; Aaron Ward, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Dan Overton, Jr.; John Stansbury, Sr.; Ryan White, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Sailors are hoping to put a disappointing 1993 season behind them 
with an experienced 1994 squad. Their top six runners are all seniors, led by 
DeZahd, the Sea View League's 1,600-meter champion last spring on the track. 
DeZahd was fourth at the league's cross-country finals and finished eighth at 
the Southern Section Division III-AA championships as a junior. Chian, Van Note 
and Swanson were all consistent varsity performers a year ago, and Ward and 
Adams were the Sailors' 800-meter runners in track. Adams came out of training 
camp as the Sailors' leader, while Ward turned in a 1:58.67 clocking at the 
league finals. Overton has emerged as the leading contender for the seventh 
spot.

 Coach: Rick Martinez (third year).

Championships.

<P>
 Key returners: Daniel Gonzalez, Sr.; Dan Kozak, Sr.; Chris Lore, Sr.; Bobby 
Miske, So.; Brian Mitzel, Sr.; Matt Wickersham, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Adrian Brown, So.; Evan Wride, So.; Michael Zepeda, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: In only his third year on the job, Martinez, a Mater Dei alumnus, has 
the Monarchs near the top of the county's cross-country scene. With four 
outstanding seniors leading the way, the Monarchs should be able to overcome 
any inconsistencies that popped up to bite them last season. At one time, the 
Monarchs broke into the county's top five last season. Mitzel, Kozak, Gonzalez 
and Lore head a solid squad that finished the regular season ranked ninth in 
the Times Orange County poll. Gonzalez finished 10th at year's South Coast 
League finals, where the Monarchs were a disappointing third. Miske was one of 
the county's strongest freshmen runners last fall.

<P>
 Key newcomers: Antonio Baez, Fr.; Luis Carletta, Sr.; Peter Cervantes, Jr.; 
Carlos Cortez, So.; Noe Henriquez, Sr.; Adam Trinidad, Sr.; Kenny Van Hook, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Cavaliers have dominated the Garden Grove League the past two 
season, but this year they should also play a role in determining the county's 
final standings. They are led by the brother combination of Henry and Franky 
Hernandez. Henry won the league individual title last fall, with Frank just two 
seconds behind him as the runner-up. Mejia finished seventh in the league 
finals and will assume the third-man role for Santiago. Lopez and Bayard return 
as experienced veterans. Hernandez needs only a seventh man, but with more than 
60 runners at practice, one ought to emerge. Van Hook, Carletta and Trinidad 
are all seniors with a shot.

 Katella

<P>
 Coach: Mike Cochrane (25th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Third at the CIF State Division III finals; Southern Section II-A 
champions; Empire League champions; runners-up at Orange County Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Edgar Benitez, Jr.; Mike Lopez, Sr.; Erick Miramontes, Jr.; 
George Pinto, Jr.; Juan Venegas, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Jaime Benitez, Fr.; Gabe Casas, Jr.; Mike Cisneros, So.; Lucas 
Neubauer, So.; Alex Smith, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: After a four-year hiatus, Cochran returns to take over a successful 
program built by Dave Wilson, who left after last season to coach in New 
Mexico. The Knights are loaded despite having only one senior among their top 
10 runners. Second at the Orange County Championships last season, Katella is 
the odds-on favorite this time around behind the leadership of Benitez and 
Miramontes. Benitez finished fourth at the Empire League finals last year, and 
Miramontes was seventh. Pinto and Venegas are also seasoned varsity veterans. 
Pinto helped the Knights to third place at the State Meet with his 61st place 
finish.

 Santa Ana

<P>
 Coach: Roger Nava (second year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Won Orange County Championships and Sunset League titles; second at CIF 
State Division I finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Juan Chavez, Sr.; Wenceslado Morales, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Jesse Lopez, Jr.; Jesus Loza, So.; Julio Paz, Jr.; Raul 
Quinonez, So.; Danny Rivero, Jr.; Andres Roman, Jr.; Luis Zaragoza, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Losing your top five runners is often traumatic, but the Saints 
should have a less painful rebuilding year than most. Morales and Chavez are 
the lone returners for the defending county champions. The Saints also made an 
impact on the state scene last year, finishing second. Chavez placed 26th at 
the Orange County Championships, while Morales was the 31st runner to cross the 
finish line. The latter recovered to gain a share of the Sunset League title, 
tying four other teammates. Nava's team will look for help from Lopez and 
Rivero, two players off the Saints' soccer team. Paz and Zaragoza are hopeful 
of lending some help, and newcomers Loza, Quinonez and Roman are looking to 
gain varsity positions.

OPERA REVIEW; 'FAUST' FALTERS AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Music Center Opera opened its season Friday night with a new -- well, sort 
of new -- version of Gounod's beloved old chestnut, "Faust." The word, I fear, 
is dreary.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the production looked familiar to opera-going fossils cursed with 
half-decent memories. That's because the Gallic devil-may-care opus was staged 
by Frank Corsaro, the bad-boy director responsible for the New York City Opera 
"Faust" frequently seen here between 1968 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Corsaro never was noted for his sensitivity to the musical pulse or the verbal 
text. At his best, however, he illuminated the challenge at hand with 
intriguing flashes of theatrical wit. 
</P>
<P>
 His old "Faust" suffered its share of tasteless gimmicks -- a bleeding statue 
of St. Sebastian providing wine for mean Mephisto, for instance, and a 
perversely grisly ending that denied Marguerite her candy-coated salvation. 
Still, Corsaro heightened the elemental contrasts between good and evil, 
stripped away many a hoary cliche and, with the assistance of an inspired 
designer, Ming Cho Lee, played the drama amid a vibrant, lusty, brightly 
stylized evocation of the Medieval Germany dictated by Goethe and Gounod. 
</P>
<P>
 Where, oh where, is Ming Cho Lee when we need him? 
</P>
<P>
 For his second "Faust," Corsaro has chosen a new designing collaborator, 
Franco Colavecchia. Together, they have managed to get lost on the trendy road 
to devious updating. 
</P>
<P>
 Logically or not, they have moved the erstwhile rustic romance to the age of 
the Industrial Revolution. Everything is urban. Everything is dark. 
</P>
<P>
 A grim unit set -- it looks like a barren warehouse -- harbors all the action. 
Primitive background slides are changed and different window dressings are 
rolled on and off to suggest Faust's morgue (it used to be his scientific 
laboratory), the prison, the town square, the church, and, least convincing, 
the heroine's chaste abode. In this milieu, Faust's ardent apostrophe to nature 
becomes a silly joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic tricks? Forget 'em. Dazzling transformations? Not a trace. Brilliant 
abstractions? No such luck. Imaginative innovations? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 What we see, most of the time, is clumsy, prosaic and contradictory. The aged 
Faust now fondles the hair of a pretty blond corpse in the prologue, adding a 
hint of necrophilia to his list of sins. The rejuvenated Faust addresses 
"Salut! demeure" to a cumbersome cluster of potted plants in front of brick 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The devil gloats that the susceptible Marguerite is opening her window -- 
"Elle ouvre sa fenetre!" -- but there is no window here. The soprano simply 
strolls onto an all-purpose balcony as David Anglin's dishonest supertitle 
declares "she steps into the night." 
</P>
<P>
 Those infernal supertitles can also turn cutesy. The giddy Dame Marthe 
exclaims to herself, in an aside, that she finds Mephisto charming -- "Il est 
charmant!" The translation on the proscenium, however, projects a vernacular 
distortion: "Charmed, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The verbal points may seem small. They are annoyingly symptomatic, however, of 
an interpretive attitude that hinders more than it helps. 
</P>
<P>
 All may not be lost in Corsaro's current Faustspielhaus, yet little is won. 
The martyred Sebastian still bleeds wine (here an ineffectual trickle), but a 
shaft of light now gives Marguerite at least a hint of spiritual triumph at the 
gallows. The original spinning scene, one of Gounod's finest inspirations, has 
at last been restored, and one must be thankful for that. Unfortunately, the 
nervous motion of the wheel, so exquisitely delineated in the orchestra, is 
contradicted by the mechanical loom on the stage. Problems like that arise when 
the plot is pushed forward 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
 By the ever-probing standards of the naughty 1990s, Corsaro now looks like a 
conservative. He doesn't turn "Faust" into a farce, a dream play from outer 
space or a sociopolitical diatribe. He doesn't stretch for phony relevance. We 
should be grateful for large favors. If only he trusted the composer and 
librettist enough to leave the innocent kitsch alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening-night performance could have been salvaged to a considerable 
degree if it had sounded a lot better than it looked. Alas, it sounded only a 
little better than it looked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Foster conducted with much fervor and an obvious appreciation of the 
grand, graceful yet propulsive line. Unfortunately, he slighted finesse in the 
process. Subtle nuances were rare, and the dynamic scale -- onstage and in the 
pit -- seemed to range from forte to fortissimo (and fortissississimo when 
inexcusable microphones blasted sinister offstage voices into the house). 
</P>
<P>
 The totally non-Gallic cast seemed to find the French style as foreign as the 
French language. An exception was Suzanna Guzman, who introduced an uncommonly 
elegant and sympathetic Siebel. Even with the welcome reinstatement of "Si le 
bonheur a sourire, t'invite," however, a strong Siebel cannot save a faltering 
"Faust." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorma Silvasti, the Finnish tenor remembered here as Kimmo in Sallinen's 
"Kullervo," was attempting the title role for the first time. He turned out to 
be theatrically rather stolid, vocally rather tight and dry. Perhaps he fell 
victim to opening-night nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Veronica Villarroel brought compelling poignance to Marguerite's 
agonies, her singing was uneven -- hard-edged and strident one moment, soft and 
suave the next. Her trills in the Jewel Song emerged as weird approximations, 
and her accent implied that this very German heroine of a very French opera 
hailed from a very Spanish clime. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disappointing, perhaps, was the Mephistopheles of Barseg Tumanyan, 
remembered in Los Angeles for his stolid King Philip in "Don Carlo." He rolled 
his pleasant basso through the score with monochromatic competence and, in the 
process, conveyed as much menace as the friendly captain of the neighborhood 
soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 One thought in vain of the dark and delicious evil that used to ooze from 
Norman Treigle on the stage, even when he was standing still. One would gladly 
have settled for the lesser but still imposing demonism demonstrated by Samuel 
Ramey in 1979. With tame Tumanyan, the devil hardly got his due. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons unknown, Rodney Gilfry forced his lovely lyric baritone close to 
the breaking point as a rather stiff Valentin. Martha Jane Howe, stalwart of 
the San Diego Opera, made an auspicious Los Angeles debut as Marthe, and Tod 
Fitzpatrick did what can be done with the aborted song of Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis Brown designed the functional costumes. F. Mitchell Dana presided over 
the dim lighting scheme. Peggy Hickey devised chaotic choreography for the 
Kermesse (the endless "Walpurgisnacht" ballet was mercifully cut, as usual). 
</P>
<P>
 The dressy first-night audience -- which didn't exactly fill the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion to the rafters -- applauded dutifully. The ovations stopped 
well short of delirium. 
</P>
<P>
 If this "Faust" was a triumph, it was a triumph of mediocrity. Co-commissioned 
by the Lyric Opera of Chicago, it moves next to the Windy City. Perhaps the 
bracing breezes of the Midwest will waft some vigor into the project. 
</P>
<P>

Chandler Pavilion. Remaining performances on Friday and Sept. 21, 24 and 28 at

MUSIC REVIEW; TOURING HALLE ORCHESTRA WRAPS UP AT HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pleasantness is a virtue, but what one dreams of in an orchestra is virtuosity 
-- not just the ability to play fast, clean and resonantly, but the skills to 
touch the listener with lyricism, profundity, bombast and nuance, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 A measurable lack of virtuosity marked the disappointing final program by the 
touring Halle Orchestra of Manchester, England, over the weekend at Hollywood 
Bowl.After making agreeable impressions earlier in the week, the ensemble, led 
by principal conductor Kent Nagano, appeared to have run out of steam -- and 
repertory. Friday night, its playing achieved genuine mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 This performance of a cleverly arranged pops program, climaxing in an 
efficient run-through of Gustav Holst's "The Planets" accompanied by a 
diverting and visually busy light-and-laser show, simply did not live up to the 
built-in demands for orchestral brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The most disappointing playing came first, in a lackluster, apparently 
under-rehearsed revival of Benjamin Britten's ever-wondrous "Young Person's 
Guide to the Orchestra," in which actress Lynn Redgrave was the gracious 
narrator. This work offers thrilling opportunities for the instrumental 
ensemble; written as a tour de force, it materialized here as a modest 
overture, weakly shaped by Nagano, and showcasing neither orchestral soloists 
nor choirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another British actor, Timothy Dalton, brought welcome wit, reserve and verbal 
point to the spoken lines accompanying Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf," but 
the unmotivated conducting of Nagano and the characterless playing of his Halle 
band fell short of true effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, an audience counted at 13,511 on Friday (and reportedly sold out 
to the regulation 17,979 on Saturday) greeted the proceedings amicably. The 
Saturday crowd got an encore: Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on "Greensleeves."

MOVIE REVIEW; 'NEXT': A CLEAR REMEMBRANCE OF 'KARATE KID' PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The overt message of any "Karate Kid" movie: Don't fight unless you absolutely 
have to. The implicit message: You'll always have to. Let the smitings begin! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The transparent philosophy continues in "The Next Karate Kid," wherein another 
petulant teen -- Hilary Swank's comely Julie (replacing gray belt Ralph 
Macchio) -- has to learn a few life lessons and the joy of Zen car washing 
before being granted license to knock the solar plexuses out of her tormentors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julie-san right. Now is time," announces Noriyuki (Pat) Morita's Mr. Miyagi 
(never one to use articles), waiting till just before the climax to say the 
words every kid is waiting to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie's not just the cutest lass in her class, but could make dust out of your 
windpipe even before she meets up with Mr. Miyagi, an old war buddy of her late 
grandpa. Julie doesn't need martial-arts tips so much as quiet guidance to get 
past bitterness over the death of her parents. This she gets not only from her 
adoptive sage, but from sweet new boyfriend Eric (Chris Conrad), a rival of 
nasty Ned (Michael Cavalieri). 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys are members of an unlikely paramilitary group sanctioned by their 
Boston high school and led by Col. Dugan (poor Michael Ironside, the embodiment 
of evil again ). These deadly hall monitors are contrasted with Mr. Miyagi's 
pacifist monk pals, who get peeved when Julie tries to kill a cockroach but are 
hep enough to boogie to the Cranberries and bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 If this installment is just slightly less laborious than "Karate Kid II" or 
"III," it's not from Mark Lee's surprise-free script or Christopher Cain's 
placid direction, but because young Swank really might be a find. Early on, 
she's such a convincingly testy teen that parents may flinch, but she does seem 
to blossom before your eyes. And doing her moves, she looks, well, sass-y . 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; SOME STRONG PERFORMANCES POWER THIS 'STREETCAR'; CASTING KANDIS 
CHAPPELL AS BLANCHE IS A GAMBLE, BUT THE FIRST-RATE PRODUCTION SHOWCASES SOME 
MEMORABLE PORTRAYALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Blanche DuBois, c'est moi ," said Tennessee Williams, more or less, admitting 
that he wrote himself into the heroine of what is arguably his most powerful 
work, "A Streetcar Named Desire." And now South Coast Repertory has honored the 
playwright with a searing, first-rate production that opened, incredibly, hours 
before the death of Jessica Tandy, the incandescent actress who first played 
Blanche in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 This production, however, takes too literally the author's identification with 
his crushed Southern belle, who was also based partly on Williams' mother. 
Specifically, the casting of Kandis Chappell as Blanche either shows enormous 
faith in its star by handing her a role for which she is physically completely 
unsuited or it is a misguided attempt to underline the homosexual author's 
autobiographical impulses. A gifted actress, Chappell has captured the soul of 
Blanche DuBois, but, to borrow a Stephen Sondheim lyric, it looks as if "she 
plays Medea later this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanche is a delicate mix, a liar and a poet, pathetic and dignified, 
desperately miming a vanished gentility that may have existed only in her mind 
anyway. As an aging single woman, her mature sexual needs sit uncomfortably 
with her kittenish affectations. Even in the hands of the petite Vivien Leigh, 
who was incomparable in the film version, Blanche walks the line between 
touching and embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell is a big woman with almost masculine features whose stature is mocked 
by the frills that costume designer Walker Hicklin has no choice but to dress 
her in. When she coquettishly wraps a long lace shawl about her head to seduce 
a boy who has caught her fancy, one half expects him to rewrite the text and 
run screaming from the room. Blanche may be pathetic, but she's not ridiculous. 
 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of the time, Chappell manages to overcome this shortcoming with 
a compelling performance that emphasizes Blanche's growing horror as she waits 
for the inevitable act of her "executioner," her brother-in-law Stanley 
Kowalski (Jeff Meek). For all of her sensitivity, Blanche invites brutality 
from Stanley by only seeing the brutishness in him. The brilliance of Meek's 
performance as Stanley is that it enables us to see him not as Blanche does but 
with the loving eyes of his wife, Stella. 
</P>
<P>
 In the famous scene where he screams his wife's name, Meek's Stanley is 
mesmerizing. Goaded by drink, a poker loss and Blanche's incessant insults, 
Stanley has struck his wife and now stands stripped of his male bluster, crying 
out for the arms of his "baby." Very slowly, Stella descends from the safety of 
a neighbor's apartment, down to where her husband waits on his knees, sobbing 
and begging her forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Dennehy's Stella beautifully straddles the role of doting sister and 
passionate wife, torn between self-respect and an addiction to her husband's 
desire. While he is kneeling before her, she first comforts him maternally, 
then submissively bends herself over his shoulder to return to him the role of 
possessor. This is one of several scenes so exquisite that the audience seems 
to hold its collective breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is the scene between Blanche and her suitor, Mitch (Jimmie Ray Weeks), 
that ends act two. In another superbly modulated performance, Weeks' Mitch 
courts Blanche with so much shy honesty that Blanche, the compulsive 
fabricator, responds honestly. The act ends on a bone-chilling note with her 
last line as they embrace, "Sometimes -- there's God -- so quickly!" 
</P>
<P>
 K.T. Vogt is terrific in the small role of Stella's surprisingly sensitive 
white trash neighbor Eunice. 
</P>
<P>
 There are small missteps in Martin Benson's largely unerring direction. The 
music and ominous drums that emphasize the play's most poetic passages are 
heavy-handed, no matter how softly they're played. Otherwise, composer Michael 
Roth's dissonant score, used to evoke the sound of the passing streetcars, 
works well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Michael Devine wonderfully paints the play's hothouse French Quarter 
setting, with intricate ironwork balustrades, wooden shutters, and opaque 
curtains and dark floral wallpaper that climbs up a high wall, appearing 
water-stained and ruined at the top. Jane Reisman's ambitious lighting creates 
a nice, moody ambience, but it is often too harsh in the foreground, providing 
exactly the kind of light that Blanche has made an art of avoiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Benson's motivation for shining a harsh light on the inappropriate 
physicality of his star is anybody's guess. One can imagine both aesthetic 
justifications and personal loyalties for the casting of his longtime colleague 
Chappell as Blanche. But it's an odd choice, a gamble, and one that jars an 
audience to ponder questions outside the drama on stage. One can't help but 
wonder what Tennessee Williams would have made of it.

COUNTERPUNCH: A PAIR OF ADVOCATES FOR 'THE ADVOCATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALISA M. MORGENTHALER and CORINNE FARLEY, Alisa M. Morgenthaler and Corinne 
Farley are attorneys at Christensen, White, Miller, Fink & Jacobs, a business 
and entertainment law firm in Century City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As attorneys -- and animal lovers -- we take issue with Peter Rainer's 
less-than-enthusiastic review of "The Advocate," a quirky medieval period piece 
about an altruistic young Parisian lawyer who finds that he has bitten off more 
medieval muck than he can chew when he takes a job as a defense lawyer in a 
French rural village during the Middle Ages ("When 'The Advocate' Goes to Trial 
in the Middle Ages," Calendar, Aug. 24). (If you liked "The Name of the Rose" 
and "Apartment Zero," you will love this film!) 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the review, "The Advocate" had much more to offer than simply the 
mystery surrounding the identity of the lawyer's client. Indeed, like a fine 
wine, "The Advocate" has layers of complexity blended together for a most 
thoughtful and entertaining composition -- a kind of a meeting of the minds of 
John Grisham, Scott Turow, Graham Greene, Umberto Eco and Federico Fellini, in 
an offbeat satirical tale featuring the re-creation of a number of unbelievably 
bizarre, but nonetheless historically accurate, courtroom trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The young defense lawyer, Richard Courtois (Colin Firth), finds himself 
quickly falling into a medieval morass and is forced to test his commitment to 
his profession when he is confronted with a client who, we'll suffice it to 
say, needs to work on her manners! Courtois likewise struggles with some 
typical medieval social problems, including witchcraft, superstition and 
religious hypocrisy, as well as racism, sexism and anti-Semitism -- issues 
certainly as pertinent today as they were 400 years ago. "The Advocate" gives a 
realistic portrayal of a legal system based on paranoia and superstition and is 
a provocative and thorough examination of complex legal and social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rainer complains that "The Advocate" is "campy" and takes "itself seriously -- 
but not quite seriously enough." We think that Rainer may have taken himself 
too seriously and simply missed all the fun. Indeed, the comedic aspects of 
"The Advocate" prevent the film from being an overly dark and sinister 
depiction of medieval times. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not because we are lawyers and animal lovers. What's not to love 
about a film that grapples with such a heady moral and legal issue as whether 
rats are competent to testify as witnesses at a murder trial? We think Rainer 
is just being a little pigheaded!

COUNTERPUNCH: TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR 'NATURAL BORN KILLERS'; YOUNG VIEWERS MAY NOT 
PERCEIVE THE SATIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MYERS, Jennifer Myers teaches English at Crescenta Valley High 
School in La Crescenta. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The apparent critical and commercial success of the film "Natural Born 
Killers" is more disgusting than the film itself. Oliver Stone has sold the 
critics a bill of goods, and they have willingly forked over the currency of 
their trade. Siskel and Ebert gave the film two thumbs up, and The Times' 
Kenneth Turan lauded the film as a masterwork ("Stone Removes the Gloves in 
'Killers,' " Calendar, Aug. 26). They and others praise the film's "satirical" 
indictment of our "societal fascination" with violence and killers, yet they 
ignore the obvious: The movie exploits and celebrates the very elements of 
society it claims to criticize. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Jonathan Swift wrote his "Modest Proposal" in 1729, satirically 
suggesting the export of babies as delicacies to control overpopulation, the 
public expressed horror; when Stone overreaches, audiences and critics cheer. 
What's wrong with this picture? Are we that much more sophisticated than we 
used to be? Viewing the film with a large group of the general public 
demonstrated to me that most of the audience doesn't "get it." 
</P>
<P>
 I attended a sold-out opening-night screening. The crowd included a fair mix 
of adults and teen-agers, many who looked several years below the MPAA age 
minimum of 17. Most of these teens were unaccompanied by parents or other 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school English teacher, I must sadly admit that if the crowd 
reflects my students, not many of them would recognize the film's intended 
satire unless they were told to look for it. The film's opening murder scenes 
were met with quite a few cheers. The "sitcom" sequence of Mallory's 
nightmarish childhood and rescue at the hands of soon-to-be-killer Mickey got 
some actual guffaws over the canned laughter. The idea that the killers' 
childhood abuse and other experiences excuse their crimes seems close to the 
surface at all times in this film, yet no critic has mentioned this 
irresponsible message. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another aspect of the film left unmentioned by critics is the almost 
pornographic connection between sex and violence in several scenes. Mickey 
holds a knife while making love to Mallory, Mallory seduces men and attacks 
them as a reward for their lust, Jack Scagnetti murders a prostitute as he has 
sex with her and desires to do the same to Mallory. The violence in the film is 
"sexy," shot in such a way as to make it viscerally appealing. The MTV-style 
quick cuts desensitize the viewer to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Turan mentions in his review that Stone wants us to "surrender to the 
onslaught." If we follow his wishes and surrender, how then can we take the 
necessary steps back to view this picture of our society critically? Many of 
the audience couldn't step back on the night I saw the film, as evinced by 
cheers and applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's "visionary" psychedelic imagery has been lifted right out of his 
earlier film "The Doors" and old 1970s "acid trip" movies. Set to a new, 
heart-pounding score, it capitalizes on, rather than criticizes, America's 
fascination with drugs, sex and violence. The audience snapping up tickets for 
this new "trip" doesn't seem to care what critics and P.R. people say it's 
about. They go for the "rush." That, to me, is far more frightening than 
anything in this film.

COUNTERPUNCH: TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR 'NATURAL BORN KILLERS'; STONE'S METHOD ONLY 
SHATTERS HIS MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SOFTLEY, Jeff Softley is a Los Angeles writer who also directs a 
national energy-conservation campaign, the Earth Day Energy Fast, which 
attempts to make Earth Day proactive by providing an activity for the public. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Critic Kenneth Turan's assessment of Oliver Stone's film "Natural Born 
Killers" gave Stone far too much credit ("Stone Removes the Gloves in 
'Killers,' " Calendar, Aug. 26). Turan felt that because of Stone's 
"directorial energy" the viewer "can't help but be affected by its sensory 
barrage," yet also correctly states that Stone's attempt to "mock our societal 
fascination with bloodletting, to hold up a cracked mirror and literally force 
a reconsideration of what we're doing as a culture and where it seems to be 
leading" does not "come off as planned." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Stone's effort is an abject failure, and regrettably will serve as 
yet more fuel for the fire in the glorification of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 This meditation on violence, tabloid media and the public obsession for both 
is an offensive assault by Stone, cartoon-quality bloodletting, carnage on a 
grand scale, all designed as a hyper-surreal meat-cleaver to smash through our 
collective desensitization to violence by giving us a dose too large to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Stone's purgative tonic is just sweet enough that the medicine does not 
cause aversion to violence but rather serves as the latest and most potent 
narcotic to those hooked on blood and fear. The irreverence and campiness in 
the film dilutes whatever rebuke of violence was intended, distorting it even 
(by today's standards) to a quasi-heroic affirmation that if violence is done 
with daring and style, it's cool.  
</P>
<P>
 Stone has borrowed liberally from other filmmakers -- we see Stanley Kubrick's 
"A Clockwork Orange" violence-aversion therapy images played out throughout, as 
if we as viewers paid for a session with our admission ticket. Current blood 
king Quentin Tarantino seems to be the gunslinger the macho Stone is attempting 
to outdo, upping the body count and gore factor beyond the typical Tarantino 
fare ("Natural Born Killers" is based on a story by Tarantino, a 
writer-director); and director David Lynch is represented everywhere in the 
film, from the monstrously hideous yet otherwise mundane characters (Tommy Lee 
Jones' plaid-suited, spittle-spewing prison warden, to character Mallory's 
family), to the flashing strobe effects, to ghost characters floating and 
appearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone seems determined to prove he can play with the modern kids on the 
filmmaking scene, and what Turan praises as "taking the gloves off with a 
vengeance" seems really like so much derivative posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stone shows restraint for once in injecting his stock-in-trade political 
tirades into a film, presumably hoping the actions of his destructive 
characters would say it all, but he does preach. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone obviously sends up tabloid icon Geraldo Rivera with his Wayne Gale 
character, yet humanizes him to the point where the character's ability to 
serve as a vehicle to represent what is wrong with tabloid culture is lost. The 
viewer begins to empathize with Gale (a strong performance by actor Robert 
Downey Jr.), when he should rightfully be despised by film's end if Stone had 
stayed true to his message. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone deserves credit for trying. After all, there are very few filmmakers who 
even attempt to say anything in their films, let alone take on controversial 
and difficult issues. But Stone perhaps needs to contemplate his own hubris, 
for something has gone terribly wrong in his attempt to fashion a clarion call 
that the violence and glorification of violence has reached critical mass and 
something must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 What was meant to be a clear message that violence is not cool, is not good 
and only brings ruin was lost in a sea of MTV-style quick-cuts, projected 
words, heavy-metal demonic imagery and an overall tone that only compounds the 
problem. A faster, freakier ride than David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" (which 
"Killers" closely resembles), the film is too entertaining, too steeped in 
cliches to have the desired impact in its message . "Menace II Society" was far 
more effective in conveying the sense of anomie and fear at work in creating 
heartless killers. "Killers" has no such subtext to resonate or illuminate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone seems too self-important and too self-assured to consider that his 
singular vision could be wrong. While I find it admirable that there is a 
filmmaker in America like Stone, who will fight to put what he believes on the 
screen, it is my hope that he will consider more carefully what impact his 
future films may have before releasing another one like this.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LONG BEACH OFFERS EVERY HUE OF THE BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You'd be hard-pressed to find a more concise presentation of all the varieties 
of styles covered by the term the blues than what was on display Saturday, the 
first day of the 15th annual Long Beach Blues Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The music on the Cal State Long Beach athletic field ranged from the spirited, 
gospel-inflected singing of 92-year-old Diamond Teeth Mary McClain to the 
hyped-up, frat-rock of thirtysomething Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey, from the 
haunted, rural moans of 90-year-old Jack Owens to the innovative urban hybrids 
of Robert Cray. 
</P>
<P>
 McClain (a half-sister of Bessie Smith) charmed the sun-drenched crowd of 
7,000 with earthy performances of secular and spiritual songs, part of a 
"Ladies Sing the Blues" segment that also featured Barbara Morrison and Big 
Time Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Owens was even earthier, performing with his partner, 64-year-old 
harmonica player Bud Spires, in a rare appearance by the pair outside of their 
homes in Mississippi. This is about as primal as the blues gets: brittle, yet 
determined picking and craggy voices that sound as if they've grown right up 
from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana native Jesse Thomas offered a more citified take, reflecting the 
time in the '40s and '50s that he made Los Angeles his base of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the younger performers, headliner Cray took the day with grace, finesse 
and, above all, imagination, avoiding blues-rock cliches in both his singing (a 
low-key descendant of Sam Cooke and Otis Redding) and stunning yet subtle 
guitar playing. He and his band shifted from full-bodied Memphis-style R&B to 
delicate, jazz-like interplay and back with deceiving ease.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Healey and his band seemed all flash. The guitarist, who plays 
with his instrument lying flat on his lap, reeled off slick licks in settings 
that drew on such role models as Cream and Stevie Ray Vaughan. But he relied on 
showy party tricks in which the speed of his guitar flurries seems to count 
more than the content. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's conclusion of this well-run festival, produced by public radio 
station KLON-FM (88.1), was to include a tribute to Chess Records featuring, 
among others, Bo Diddley, Junior Wells and Lowell Fulson.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; COLE ACHIEVES AN ARTISTRY ALL HER OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Natalie Cole just keeps getting better and better. Her performance at the 
Greek Theatre on Friday night was one of the highlights of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting out in instant overdrive, she quickly spun into the musical fast lane 
with a superbly delivered set of rhythm tunes associated with her father, Nat 
Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, no surprise there. "Unforgettable" made it clear two years ago that she 
could handle the Great American Song Book with style and panache. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cole didn't just handle tunes such as "Route 66," "Straighten Up and Fly 
Right" and "Paper Moon." She made them her own -- a startling accomplishment, 
given the power of her father's memorable original interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem for Natalie. Singing with enormous confidence, scatting jazz lines 
with Ella Fitzgerald-like ease, kicking the time back and forth with her 
accompanying quartet and a driving big band, Cole brilliantly took charge of 
the tunes, blurring the line between pop music and jazz as she did so. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that wasn't enough, she opened the second half of the show with a 
costume change, an added string section and a collection of gorgeous ballads: 
"Too Young," "The Very Thought of You," "As Time Goes By" and a perceptive 
reading of the often misread Billy Strayhorn standard "Lush Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as an encore, she brought on a large, combined church choir and 
ripped through a high-spirited, foot-stomping pair of gospel-styled tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unforgettable? Yes, indeed -- all of it. But not because Cole was grabbing 
anybody's musical coattails. Unforgettable because she finally has achieved the 
kind of versatile artistry that surely would have made her father proud. DON 
HECKMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JAZZ-FUNK FEST AT OCCIDENTAL A SLOPPY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Occidental College's amphitheater is a lovely setting for an evening of jazz 
and hip-hop, but the music itself at Saturday's Jazz-Funk Festival isn't likely 
to linger in anyone's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems stretched from the sloppiness of the Pharcyde to the clumsiness 
of Branford Marsalis' Buckshot LeFonque. 
</P>
<P>
 That's too bad because BRASS -- the promotion team that sponsored the concert 
-- has been a valuable force in the acid-jazz club scene here for years and it 
could enrich the L.A. music scene by spreading its multiethnic musical 
celebration to a larger platform. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pharcyde seemed a good choice to headline. At Lollapalooza '94 two weeks 
ago, the likable L.A. quartet proved a formidable team with its disarming 
street-life observations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening moments Saturday, however, the members interrupted each other 
and missed lyrics and cues. Things did become more focused, eventually serving 
up one of the most amusing lines in hip-hop -- Ya mama's got a glass eye with a 
fish in it . 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, though, the set unraveled again with novelty rapper Tone-Loc and 
everyone in sight passing the mike in an MC free for all. This kind of 
improvised free-styling can sometimes be exciting, but this was simply chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckshot LeFonque, a jazz/hip-hop group that was a last-minute addition to the 
show, only performed two songs, with saxophonist Marsalis explaining that he 
only found out about the gig two days before and couldn't even get all the 
regular band members together for it. From what we heard, he might have been 
better off staying home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Solsonics, a Hollywood funk 'n' jazz ensemble that followed opening sets 
by sometimes inventive Greyboy All-Stars and the conventional Cleveland Lounge, 
proved the evening's main troupers, entertaining the half-filled venue with a 
stylish dash of music that is strongly groove-oriented, yet soulful. HEIDI

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BARRISTER: MORE OF A SOCIAL THAN MUSICAL STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Sikiru Ayinde Barrister's performance at the Westwood Playhouse on 
Saturday was notable more for social factors than musical ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The sparse crowd at the loosely organized concert was dominated by Nigerians 
in formal robes and headgear -- not surprising, since Barrister's 
all-percussion-and-vocal "fuji music" sound is devoid of any pop touches to 
make it more than an inside Nigerian thing. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the 15-man ensemble played talking drums of different timbres. The 
lone trace of something different was the almost subliminal marimba/keyboard 
sound of a mounted set of what looked like cowbells. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening, hourlong set was plagued by a multitude of technical problems 
that prompted a constant switching of microphones and a fuzzy sound. Even so, 
Barrister's singing seemed less impressive than on earlier visits here.  
</P>
<P>
 Barrister's second set started with an extended display of "spraying" -- the 
Nigeria custom of presenting money to the performer by plastering bills on his 
brow. It produced the evening's one galvanizing moment with the arrival onstage 
of a spirited woman who chose two very young boys as her partners for some 
equally wild dancing. DON SNOWDEN

OPERA REVIEW; A QUIRKY AND TROUBLED 'ELEKTRA' RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mixed feelings greeted "Elektra" when the Music Center Opera first ventured 
Richard Strauss' taut little masterpiece of mythological shock and 
psychological resolution in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 David Pountney's fussy yet undeniably thoughtful staging relied heavily on 
potentially risible gimmicks, reinforced by John Bury's expressionist designs. 
The plot unraveled not in the recognizable Mycenae of antiquity but in a 
strange blood-pink pueblo strategically adorned with huge pieces of a broken 
statue of Agamemnon (helmet, hand and, we fear, phallus). The characters moved 
in mysterious ways, and the semi-symbolic costumes played loose with both time 
and logic. 
</P>
<P>
 It was weird, but, for a while at least, it was fascinating. Fortunately, the 
music-making was strong enough to make sight overpower sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, on the second night of our sporadic opera season at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion, "Elektra" was back -- not a moment too late and, alas, quite 
a bit the worse for wear. The dramatic elements, now overseen by Clare West, 
are beginning to flirt with caricature, and the musical elements -- part old, 
part new -- are problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Behr, the management's longtime favorite maestro, has inherited the 
baton from Lawrence Foster. He conducts carefully, conscientiously and often 
very slowly. He does little in the process to sustain tension, to propel the 
cataclysmic drama, to define subtle details or to imprint his own interpretive 
personality on the massive score. This is generic Strauss, safe and soupy. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Zschau was something of a revelation when she first braved the 
superhuman title role three years ago. In the interim, she has repeated this 
and similarly strenuous challenges, even adding a few Brunnhildes. The strain 
shows, and the voice -- never intrinsically heroic -- now seems to be a thing 
of shreds and patches. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she paced herself wisely on Saturday, she still had to resort to more 
cries and whispers than the composer sanctioned. Her tone spread and wobbled 
under pressure, and the melting pianissimo phrases of the great Recognition 
Scene had to be taken on faith. One admired her vocal daring, not to mention 
her expressive intensity. One also lamented the price she seems to be paying 
for forcing her repertory beyond its natural boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Also returning from the class of '91 was Ealynn Voss, a Chrysothemis larger in 
voice and body than her presumably dominating sister. She sang with the 
plangent force we fondly remember, but her lustrous tone now seems to be taking 
on a dangerous metallic edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important newcomer to the cast was Leonie Rysanek. Having spent most 
of her long career as a much-applauded Chrysothemis, she has turned on the eve 
of her retirement to the maternal agonies of Klytamnestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Strauss intended the rewarding, complex role of the guilt-ridden queen -- half 
heroic, half pathetic -- for a full-blooded contralto. Ernestine Schumann-Heink 
was 47 when she sang the premiere in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, the vehicle has become a favored property for low-voiced 
divas at twilight, some of whom make the mistake of playing the troubled 
antagonist as an evil witch. Rysanek isn't like that. Even at 67, her soprano 
is brighter, lighter and higher than any tradition dictates, and, thank 
goodness, she consistently stresses vulnerability over grotesquerie. Cast 
against type, she achieves success on her own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 She makes Klytamnestra a still-formidable woman desperately fighting the 
shadows of decay. She sings with fine verbal point, floats some exquisite 
pianissimo lines, fakes the low notes with imposing gusto, and consistently 
sustains sympathy against the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Rysanek's best days, she was an ideally impassioned Senta in "Der Fliegende 
Hollander," a magnetic Lady Macbeth and a gloriously radiant Kaiserin in "Die 
Frau ohne Schatten." On her worst days, she was an artist prone to self-serving 
exaggeration and distortion, both histrionic and musical. Her valedictory 
Klytamnestra in Los Angeles found her at her disciplined best. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of the male principals suggested economic compromise. Richard 
Bernstein's handsome lyric basso isn't exactly ideal for the Heldenbariton 
utterances of Orest, and he could do little to enliven a figure reduced by the 
director to a robot in a silly red wig. Jonathan Mack tried valiantly to make 
his light tenor sound heavy as an Aegisth in oddly sporty modern dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Outstanding in bit parts were Lesley Leighton as the burly whip-snapping 
Overseer, Louis Lebherz as Orest's Tutor, and Michael Gallup as the Old Servant 
(too bad the director, who may not understand the niceties of German, implied 
that he was one of the dogs in the courtyard). The others faded into the adobe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Strauss' "Elektra," presented by the Music Center Opera at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Remaining performances Tuesday and Sept. 20 and 23 
at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2. Tickets $21-$115. Information: (213) 972-7211.

TV REVIEWS; 'PARTY' SHOWS CLASS; 'BLUE SKIES' CLOUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 In prime time's duel of orphan families, Fox's "Party of Five" wins handily 
over ABC's "On Our Own." 
</P>
<P>
 The similarity ends with their nearly identical premises. "On Our Own" is 
arguably the new season's jerkiest sitcom, while "Party of Five" -- as viewers 
will learn from tonight's premiere -- is one of the better newcomers, a 
generally pleasing drama series that draws you in with capable acting and 
likable, intelligent characters. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit too intelligent at times, as two of the parentless Salingers, 
11-year-old Claudia (Lacey Chabert) and 16-year-old Bailey (Scott Wolf) -- the 
family's bookkeeper -- regularly exhibit wisdom and maturity vastly beyond 
their years, tainting their credibility. ABC's "My So-Called Life" has a better 
grip on youth.  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's opening hour is also a bit gooey, wearing its warmth and sensitivity 
like a blinding halo. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are not major quibbles, though, for, more importantly, "Party of Five" 
has a certain seductiveness, immediately inviting you to care about its 
appealing young characters and their quest to remain a cohesive family 
following the deaths of their parents in an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four-year-old Charlie (Matthew Fox) is the family's surrogate 
patriarch, having been named legal guardian of his younger siblings, who also 
include 15-year-old Julia (Neve Campbell) and 11-month-old Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Salingers live in a nice house in San Francisco and have a trust 
at their disposal, the money reaches them in periodic chunks, and a major 
financial crisis occurs when Charlie loses one of those chunks in a bad 
investment. Meanwhile, Bailey interviews nannies to look after the younger 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Party of Five" lacks the edge of truly superior drama, at the very 
least it deals honestly with emotions, as Julia faces rejection from a 
boyfriend, musically gifted Claudia faces the prospect of life without costly 
violin lessons, Charlie faces the realities of the workplace and the two older 
brothers clash over finances. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a nice start for a series that may bring some class to Fox's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A woman answers the phone and says hello. The audience laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just this sort of biting humor that typifies the premiere of the ABC 
comedy "Blue Skies." 
</P>
<P>
 Just kidding, of course. As the phone sequence shows, toothless is a better 
fit than biting when it comes to defining this series, which hopes to 
manufacture laughs from the contrasting styles of three people running a 
back-to-nature catalogue business for yuppies, called Blue Skies. Their model 
is L.L. Bean. 
</P>
<P>
 The two bachelor owners are close friends Joel Goodman (Corey Parker) and 
Russell Evans (Matt Roth), who take on brilliant-but-flaky Harvard MBA Ellie 
Baskin (Julia Campbell) as a partner. They're turned on as much by her good 
looks as by her brain, and her arrival will restructure their lives -- and, 
they hope, their company -- irrevocably. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellie's responsibilities will include taking care of the books, following Joel 
and Russel's discovery that their previous auditor, a cousin Kenny (Richard 
Kind), stole their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the first episode doesn't show much, rarely progressing beyond a few 
lame back-packing jokes, "Blue Skies" is not without an occasional silver 
lining. When the guilty auditor faces jail, Russell cracks, "At least now Kenny 
will get to see his father." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, overcast. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Party of Five" premieres at 9 tonight on Fox (Channels 11 and 6). "Blue 
Skies" premieres at 10:30 tonight on ABC (Channels 7 and 10; 9:30 p.m. on 
Channels 3 and 42).

TV REVIEW; MET DELIVERS UNEVEN VERSION OF 'ELEKTRA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Opera's 2-year-old production of Strauss' "Elektra," taped 
last season and shown tonight on television, has had more than its share of 
difficulties, most of them attributable to the shifting vocal fortunes of its 
protagonist, Hildegard Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
 The German soprano courted disaster on opening night and canceled all her 
subsequent performances that season. She redeemed herself splendidly when the 
opera returned to the repertory last year, but found herself in trouble again 
at some of the repetitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, she was in good form for the telecast. She conveys real sensitivity 
and pathos in the Recognition Scene. Even when simply listening to others, she 
dominates with her riveting presence. She never mugs, always sustains the 
character. She does show occasional signs of strain, and the middle voice 
sometimes falters. But the top still sails out admirably and, in this context, 
the weaknesses seem insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 The healthiest voice in the cast belongs to Deborah Voigt as Chrysothemis. Her 
soaring climaxes are thrilling, though her physical size hampers dramatic 
credibility. Far more damaging to musical and artistic integrity, however, is 
Brigitte Fassbander's grotesque Klytamnestra -- a performance more ranted than 
acted, more growled and barked than sung. There is no trace here of the woman's 
former regal status, no trace of pathos. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald McIntyre is too mature to suggest the youthful Orest, but he adds 
welcome vocal nuances to the towering duet with Elektra. James King (now 69) 
actually sings Aegisth's music, and does so with fervor. James Levine's 
virtuoso orchestra functions as a whirlwind partner to the singers. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, staged by Otto Schenk, is a pedestrian exercise in a German 
style already old-fashioned. Jurgen Rose's set reveals a tilted courtyard 
outside a decaying palace with a fallen equine statue and extended hoofs 
suggesting all too obvious phallic symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Elektra" airs at 8 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28, and at 7 p.m. on KVCR-TV 
Channel 24. It will also be shown at 3 p.m. Saturday on KPBS-TV Channel 15.

COUNCIL MEMBERS BATTLE OVER $3-MILLION GRANT; RIOT RECOVERY: LOBBYING BY REP. 
WATERS HELPS WIN U.S. FUNDS FOR JOB TRAINING. BUT RIDLEY-THOMAS QUESTIONS 
QUALIFICATIONS OF THE GROUP THAT WOULD ADMINSTER PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters, through personal lobbying, has helped obtain $3 million in 
Labor Department funds for a South-Central Los Angeles riot recovery 
organization she was instrumental in launching and that weeks earlier had been 
denied money from the same agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal funding, which still faces City Council action, is being hailed by 
Councilman Mike Hernandez as a big boost for an impoverished inner-city 
neighborhood. But Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, in whose district the program 
would be centered, says he has concerns about a lack of competitive bidding for 
the grant and about the limited track record of the private, nonprofit group 
that is slated to receive the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant calls for the opening of a youth job-training and placement center 
near Manchester and Vermont avenues by Community Build Inc., which was touted 
by Waters (D-Los Angeles) after the 1992 civil unrest as a grass-roots 
alternative to the much-criticized Rebuild L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grant strikes me as rather unusual," said Ridley-Thomas, who has had 
several clashes with Waters in the past over South Los Angeles development 
projects. "It's a red flag that it's no-bid. It will be a red flag for a number 
of members of the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, who was responsible last year for freeing funds for the $50-million 
federal training program as part of an otherwise unrelated Midwest flood 
disaster relief bill, says she is pleased with helping win funds for Community 
Build. "I'll support any organization that's trying to get some money for our 
city, my district and our area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a competitive bid process, 16 communities across the nation, including 
Los Angeles, were recently awarded an average of $3 million each from the Labor 
Department to establish coordinated programs to attack such inner-city youth 
problems as limited job opportunities, drug and gang involvement and teen-age 
pregnancy. The program, called Youth Fair Chance, is aimed at improving 
long-range opportunities for residents aged 14 to 30 who live in impoverished 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 communities submitted applications, according to the Labor 
Department, and the winning bidders were selected on such criteria as the 
quality of the proposed project and the level of poverty in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Build, seeking funding in an Inglewood neighborhood, was not among 
the 25 finalists, according to Ray Uhalde, deputy assistant secretary of the 
Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 winners were announced in late June. A couple of weeks later, Uhalde 
said, department officials decided to use monies for the new fiscal year that 
began July 1 to award Community Build a no-bid, discretionary grant to operate 
a Youth Fair Chance Plus pilot program focusing on job creation and training at 
a site at Manchester and Vermont avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Uhalde said that in making the decision, department officials considered both 
Waters' input and the needs of the riot-scarred Manchester-Vermont 
neighborhood, which has a 35% poverty rate. "Yes, we were very well aware of 
the interest of the congresswoman and her active support for the project," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Community Build center will have a stronger focus on jobs than other Fair 
Chance centers and will give federal officials a chance to test whether such 
programs bring results, Uhalde said. "Given the riots and earthquakes and 
Congresswoman Waters' advocacy for a job component, it seemed like the right 
program in the right place in the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Uhalde also acknowledged that Community Build has limited experience in 
running job-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do have some experience in jobs programs, certainly not of this scale," 
the Washington official said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a Community Build proposal submitted to the city, the agency 
found full-time jobs for 60 youths during a 12-month period beginning in June, 
1993. In addition, it supplied assistance for child care, transportation or 
clothing to 150 youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Build President Brenda Shockley said in an interview that the 
organization currently helps find about 20 jobs a month for graduates of job 
training programs run by other organizations. The jobs are in such fields as 
cable television and banking, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are already a number of job trainers in the target area," Shockley 
said. "We'll coordinate these services and provide the part that's missing. Job 
placement, job retention case management and life skills management -- 'how-to' 
skills, such as what do you do when something happens after you have a job. For 
example, the car breaking down on the way to work." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the grant may also be used to provide stipends for participants of 
job training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shockley acknowledged that Waters used her influence to help win the money for 
the Leimert Park-based agency, which has shown limited progress in fulfilling 
its initial list of ambitious post-riot projects, most notably a Ben & Jerry's 
ice cream plant that has yet to materialize in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Waters was very, very vigorous in her support, making sure more funds 
came to this area," said Shockley. "She was very instrumental in directing 
these resources and identifying and assisting the Department of Labor in 
identifying Community Build." 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative federal contract faces City Council approval because the Labor 
Department wants the city to help administer the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was scheduled to be heard Aug. 29 by the Community and Economic 
Development Committee, but was postponed until today at the request of 
Councilwoman Rita Walters, portions of whose district lie in Community Build's 
target area. Walters says she needed more time to study the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunity was not afforded me before it came to committee to even see 
it, let alone study it," she said. "I want to see what the proposal is, what it 
purports to do, how it plans to operate and how many people it will serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas expressed concerns about Community Build receiving the federal 
grant after losing out in the nationwide competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Job training programs, economic development programs, entrepreneurial 
programs are all critically important," he said. "It is equally important to 
have such programs operated by entities and individuals that have a track 
record in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas said that no-bid contracts automatically raise the question of 
whether the best agency has been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Community Development Department has recommended that the City 
Council give its approval. Hernandez, who chairs the council's economic 
development committee, says that regardless of the way Community Build was 
selected, he supports the program because of the unemployment problem in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he has no problem with the fact that Community Build has 
relatively little experience in the field. "It gives us an opportunity to be 
innovative and different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with Maxine," Hernandez said. "I'm sure she is aware 
it's her program, her reputation" on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Waters: "There has not been a lot of money or resources that have been 
directed at our area since we've been hit so hard by the earthquake and the 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing unusual about me working hard to get resources," she added. 
"There are no problems that should get in the way of young people getting 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Community Build and Rebuild L.A., the private riot recovery agency that was 
established at the request of city and state officials, were each granted $3 
million in federal funds to undertake their tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 While RLA has drawn much attention -- and flak -- for its lofty goals and 
meager successes, Community Build has received little scrutiny since it 
announced its own far-ranging but subsequently unfulfilled goals, which 
included the ice cream plant and conversion of a 352-room hotel into senior 
citizen housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shockley said Ben & Jerry's has given Community Build coupons for free pints 
of ice cream and may supply ice cream carts for a small youth entrepreneurial 
training program. But plans for the plant have not moved forward. "Their own 
fiscal realities were such that they weren't in a position to expand," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Community Build is currently administering earthquake repair 
assistance and home loan programs and has purchased the site of a supermarket 
in Leimert Park that burned during the riots to construct a 12,000-square-foot 
commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the organization, along with Waters, sought to block a 
development supported by Ridley-Thomas along Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opposed to a $10-million-plus First Interstate Bank proposal to build an 
ambitious low-income housing and retail complex, Community Build offered to 
purchase the bank's option on the land, suggesting the bank instead join with 
Community Build to develop a strictly commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank "can take my check for $90,000," said Waters at the time, referring 
to the organization's offer. "I'll give it to them tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank refused and its project continues to move forward with a decision on 
an architect due this fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new federal grant, Community Build proposes purchasing and 
renovating a 5,000-square-foot building at 8730 Vermont Ave. for its 
young-adult resource center, coordinating activities with a nearby federally 
supported alternative high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Build says it also plans to work with area colleges, unions, 
hospitals and the YMCA to provide job and recreation opportunities for school 
dropouts and adults aged 22 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city program, which received a $3-million grant in the 
nationwide competition, will serve youngsters in the Westlake area from a 
center in the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce building, due to be vacated 
in October.

GRAND HOPES FOR CITY CORE; DOWNTOWN: BACKERS SAY A $64-MILLION PROJECT OF 
APARTMENTS, SHOPS AND OFFICES IN THREE HISTORIC BUILDINGS WILL HELP CREATE A 
FUNKY DISTRICT LIKE N.Y.'S GREENWICH VILLAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surely somewhere in this city are a few people who love cities. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the bet developer Ira Yellin is making as he directs a 
$64-million renovation of Downtown's Grand Central Market -- an innovative 
project that restores the aged grace of three historic buildings, mixes 
low-income and luxury apartments and capitalizes on easy access to the region's 
budding rail transit network. 
</P>
<P>
 Its backers hope the Grand Central Square project at Broadway and 3rd Street 
will serve as a catalyst for the creation of a funky residential district akin 
to such places as New York's Greenwich Village or Denver's Lower Downtown, 
neighborhoods where different cultures and classes mingle willingly in a noisy, 
unpredictable environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Broadway can eventually become a real city walk," said Yellin, referring to 
Universal CityWalk, the city-themed entertainment complex built two years ago 
in a parking lot at Universal Studios, 10 miles northwest of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is finished next spring, Yellin's project will include a mix of 121 
apartments, office space and retail shops as well as a refurbished Grand 
Central Market, the 77-year-old open-air food bazaar that serves up everything 
from cow brains to guava nectar. 
</P>
<P>
 One- and two-bedroom apartments will occupy the upper floors of the six-story 
Homer Laughlin Building above Grand Central Market. In the 12-story Million 
Dollar Building next door, apartments will rise above ground-floor retail shops 
and the Million Dollar Theater, a baroque movie palace built in 1918 by Sid 
Grauman -- who also built the Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. The 
adjacent Lyon Building on Hill Street will include 20,000 square feet of office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartments in the project will range from subsidized units for low- and 
moderate-income residents to market-rate. Rents have not yet been calculated, 
but Yellin predicts the project will attract a range of tenants -- from 
Downtown professionals to poor immigrants dependent on the bus and subway to 
get around. 
</P>
<P>
 Three apartments on the top floor of the Million Dollar Building, once the 
headquarters of the Metropolitan Water District, will be marketed as historic 
penthouses. The living room of one, for instance, will be the mahogany-paneled 
board room where William Mulholland planned a water system that laid the 
foundation for the modern metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a part of Downtown that has a human dimension; the streets and 
sidewalks are of a human scale," said Yellin, a lawyer turned developer who 
earned praise for his careful restoration of the 1893 Bradbury Building across 
Broadway from Grand Central. "It has a history." 
</P>
<P>
 When it opened in 1917, Grand Central Market catered to society matrons who 
descended the Angel's Flight funicular railway with butlers in tow from their 
ornate wooden palaces atop Bunker Hill. Over time, as the wealthy moved farther 
and farther from Downtown, their mansions became flophouses and finally were 
splintered under bulldozers making way for towers of concrete and glass during 
the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Silent movie stars Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish and Charlie Chaplin attended 
the opening of the Million Dollar Theater, Grauman's first Los Angeles theater 
venture. The MWD occupied the upper floors for more than 30 years, but since 
the agency moved in 1963, the building has been mostly vacant. In 1984, one 
critic described it as "an aging Miz Kitty in her dated dance-hall finery." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That finery remains evident in intricate facade carvings that include bison 
heads and longhorn cattle skulls. Construction crews have stumbled upon hidden 
treasures such as ornately carved ceilings hidden under plaster, and canvas 
murals of cherubs behind false walls. Inside, marble floors are preserved 
whenever possible, as are original tiles. A sweeping staircase spirals down 12 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as its exteriors darkened with urban smear, Grand Central Market 
survived and even thrived as one of the few truly urban places left in Los 
Angeles. Its shops remain busy serving food as eclectic as its clientele -- 
from lawyers to bums. Yellin said his intent is to make the neighborhood as 
vibrant as the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are people who like living in a city, then they will like this 
project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While this sort of mixed-use undertaking has long been common in cities such 
as Boston or San Francisco, it is a new concept in Southern California, a 
region that has been historically scornful of urban-style development. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming that prejudice is among the toughest tasks in the marketing of 
Grand Central Square. But even the project's doubters admit that if it is 
successful, it could signal the rebirth of a slowly dying district as well as 
serve as a prototype for other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its significance as a major historic renovation, the Grand Central 
project is a model of cooperation between public officials and private 
developers as well as an example of new ways to build in urban neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, two of the city's most powerful public agencies -- the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Community Redevelopment Agency -- 
are pooling their resources to back a project that could not get traditional 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellin said private banks initially were excited about his plans -- which 
originally included more office space instead of apartments -- but backed away 
after they visited the neighborhood, a largely Latino shopping district lined 
with sagging buildings and garish signs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the bottom fell out of the office market. Even top-notch 
space in new buildings on Bunker Hill was empty. Yellin's own Bradbury 
Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is still 60% 
vacant. So he shifted the Grand Central project's emphasis to housing and 
attracted the attention of the CRA and the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the CRA issued a $44-million bond to combine with the $20 million 
Yellin had raised to finance the project. Part of the public debt will be 
serviced by the MTA, which in turn will share in part of the project's 
revenues, said Bill Lewis, manager of special projects for the transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such an arrangement was possible because of the proximity of the Metro Red 
Line; an entrance to the Pershing Square station is just down the block from 
Grand Central. MTA officials hope that sort of link will both give people a 
reason to ride public transit and make it more convenient when they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project will create what we think will be a catalyst," Lewis said. "A 
lot of people already use rail and bus transit to get to the market. It just 
really became in our minds a real potential." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, such so-called "transit-oriented" development is gaining favor in 
Southern California. Other cities such as San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego and 
San Jose already are concentrating development along transit lines. And the 
concept is a major component of the city's new long-term growth strategy being 
formulated by Los Angeles planners. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning experts said Grand Central's proximity to transit may be the wild 
card that helps it succeed where other residential projects Downtown have 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a complex question for Downtown," said Edward Soja, head of UCLA's 
urban planning school. "The history has been a failure to attract significant 
numbers into Downtown. Mass transit is the big question." 
</P>
<P>
 Transit of a different kind is being counted on to bridge the gap between the 
old Downtown along Broadway and the new Downtown atop Bunker Hill, adjacent 
neighborhoods that are worlds apart. "There is this massive barrier at Hill 
Street where a huge wall of condominiums divides Downtown into First and Third 
World halves," Soja said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin next year on a new Angel's Flight, which 
will ferry passengers up and down between Bunker Hill and Hill Street -- just 
as it did during Downtown's heyday. The Angel's Flight station will be directly 
across the street from Grand Central. Yellin and others expect the Grand 
Central project to be the link that connects old to new, luring people first 
onto Broadway and then into the rest of the historic core. 
</P>
<P>
 "That whole neighborhood is really going to jump-start," CRA General Manager 
Ed Avila said. "What's happening is that Grand Central is the pivotal point for 
the revitalization of this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the plan. But the very urban unpredictability that Yellin sees 
as central to the project has a history of dashing even the best-laid plans. 
Yellin, however, likes the odds and thinks his bet will pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always believed that places like this have inherent value," Yellin 
said, peering through vertical blinds at the freshly scrubbed facade of his 
Million Dollar Building. "You just have to know how to use it."

OFFICERS KILL MAN WHO OPENS FIRE IN STATION; SHOOTING: A CARSON DEPUTY SHERIFF 
IS IN STABLE CONDITION AFTER BEING SHOT BY A GUNMAN IN THE LOBBY. INVESTIGATORS 
BEGIN SEARCH FOR MOTIVE.

<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies shot to death a gunman who walked into 
their Carson station Saturday night and, without saying a word, opened fire at 
a deputy, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Sheriff Robert Frank, 25, was in stable condition Sunday after 
undergoing surgery on both his arms at Arcadia Methodist Hospital, spokesman 
Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson identified the dead gunman as Robert Almeida, 25, of Carson. He said 
there was no known motive in the incident, which began when Almeida entered the 
lobby of the Carson station on South Avalon Boulevard at about 10:30 p.m., 
approached the public counter -- at which Frank was seated -- and began firing 
a .38-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bullets went through one of Frank's arms, then lodged in the other, 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the shots, three deputies inside the station promptly returned 
fire, hitting Almeida in the upper body, Erickson said. The gunman died in the 
lobby soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Sheriff's Department and the Los Angeles Police Department 
could not recall a similar shooting incident at their stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty stupid. It's absolutely an act of suicide," said Los Angeles 
Police Officer Lorie Taylor, who has been on the force for six years. 
"Everybody in a sheriff's or police station is armed with guns. I've never 
heard of anything like this happening while I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said investigators knew little about Almeida and were trying to find 
out what might have motivated him. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Almeida and Frank, several private citizens were in the lobby 
at he time of the shootout, but none were wounded, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank was alone at the counter, he said.

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: FOR TICKET WRITERS, IT'S NOT ALL THAT THE TRAFFIC 
WILL BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Silent contempt is the least of their worries. It's outright hostility and 
violence that Terri Spencer-Frakes and her fellow traffic officers worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer-Frakes has been cursed at, her car spat on. Some of her colleagues 
have been scratched, shoved and punched. Others have been stalked by motorists 
angry at receiving a routine parking ticket. In dire instances, a few have been 
shot at. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can get pretty rough out there," says Spencer-Frakes. "I don't know what 
people's impressions of us are, but it's not good." 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the lives of the 484 officers employed by the city Department of 
Transportation who direct traffic when stoplights are down, who clear our 
roadways of hazards and, yes, who work around the clock to nail those of us who 
would disobey parking regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Their jobs are thankless but crucial to a city strapped for money. In the last 
fiscal year, traffic officers issued 2,723,279 citations -- one for every 
resident of driving age -- netting $62 million for the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public gets much more benefit than they know," declares Fred Johns, a 
senior traffic supervisor in the department's Hollywood division. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer-Frakes has worked out of the Hollywood division for four years, opting 
for a good, steady job after the uncertainties of running her own beauty-supply 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:30 each morning, she and her co-workers assemble for the daily roll call, 
where supervisors alert officers to any special events that might affect 
parking: parades, concerts, funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she climbs into her car and rolls out to her beat -- a corridor along 
Hollywood Boulevard that is the busiest area in the division, the busiest in 
the entire city for the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 With a practiced eye, she spots five expired meters within half an hour, 
jumping out of her car to make sure the meter is not broken, and then writing 
the ticket. Spencer-Frakes scribbles down the information quickly, partly to 
avoid an encounter with the car owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize we're taking money from people. To somebody running to 
get a gallon of milk, and their kid's in the car hollering and screaming, and 
they pull up in a red zone, I'm all kind of bad names," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, as she fills out a citation on Las Palmas Avenue, the owner of 
the car comes running up, full of protests and explanations of how he was gone 
for just a few minutes to deliver a chair to a nearby office building. 
</P>
<P>
 To no avail. He receives the $20 fine. "For five minutes, that's crazy," he 
mutters under his breath, leaving a trail of exhaust as he speeds away. And his 
reaction is mild compared to some. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Spencer-Frakes was paired with an officer who was socked in the chest 
and had her ticket book snatched away by an irate driver. On another occasion, 
a burly man grew increasingly threatening until Spencer-Frakes summoned backup 
officers on her "rover" -- the radio that all officers carry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have Mace or pepper (spray). We have nothing but our radios," she 
says. "That's our lifeline. Without it, it'd just be me and my car. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "People think we're out here just lollygagging, writing tickets. The book 
always looks good on the cover, but when you open it up and look inside, it's 
not so nice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The work can indeed leave no time for lollygagging. 
</P>
<P>
 On a good day, a traffic officer can write up to 100 tickets, depending on the 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common citation is for parking during posted street-cleaning hours, 
which will set you back $30. Interestingly, it costs less for parking on the 
sidewalk ($30) than it does in a no-stopping zone ($55). 
</P>
<P>
 The most expensive ticket is for illegally staking out a handicapped space: 
$330, please. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we're not on commission," says Spencer-Frakes, rolling her eyes at a 
commonly asked question. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are no quotas, officials say, although there are expectations based 
on the number of tickets issued the year before -- 568,690, in the case of the 
Hollywood division. 
</P>
<P>
 But the traffic wardens object to being characterized as meter maids who 
quiver with anticipation at issuing a citation. Officials point out that 
traffic officers fulfill a wide variety of duties. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, says traffic supervisor Johns, it was his crew, not the police, 
that directed cars around Hollywood High School last week after a student was 
fatally shot one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, the officers were put on tactical alert, and 
were key to keeping traffic flowing at intersections where stoplights failed. 
</P>
<P>
 And because they are out patrolling all day and night, they are often the 
folks who first tip off authorities to abandoned or stolen cars, who stumble 
across ruptured water mains, who report chemical spills, who spot fires, who 
even witness purse snatchings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers are at the scene of a lot of things that involve public safety," 
Johns says. "We don't have 'ticket writers.' We have traffic officers."

MAN MISSING AFTER JUMPING FROM PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lifeguards searched in vain Sunday for a 29-year-old Manhattan Beach man who 
was presumed dead after he and his roommate jumped from the city pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, who had apparently been drinking, jumped into the ocean near the 
end of the long pier and were pulled out to sea by a strong current.Lifeguards 
and police were called to the scene after witnesses heard one of the men 
yelling for help about 1:15 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty good size surf and rough conditions," said Lt. Robert 
McGowan, a Los Angeles County lifeguard. "If you have had a few drinks and 
aren't that well oriented to begin with, it is considerably more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards pulled the man's roommate to safety. But because of the strong 
currents, they were unable to hang onto the victim, who was in full cardiac 
arrest, and carry him to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Assisted by a helicopter and two boats, lifeguards spent hours Sunday looking 
for the body of the man, whose name was not released pending notification of 
relatives.

MIKE PENNER: MILLER CAN'T FIND BIRD OF PARADISE IN DOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time he saw these fans, he flipped them the bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his return visit, for the first time as an ex-Atlanta Falcon, he flipped, 
in his own words, a "couple wounded ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, if you're asking, Chris Miller has changed his approach to playing 
quarterback inside the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knox kept looking at Miller float the ball up there Sunday afternoon and 
kept thinking back to the playbook he handed to the players in July. All the 
new guys did get a copy, right? 
</P>
<P>
 But there was Troy Drayton, down and out and open for the first time all 
season . . . and there goes the football, soaring over Drayton's head and into 
the arms of Falcon cornerback D.J. Johnson for an interception at the Atlanta 
four-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was Flipper Anderson a few minutes later, streaking into the end 
zone a step ahead of Johnson . . . and there goes the football again, its 
animation suspended in the air long enough for Johnson to leap in front of 
Anderson and pick it off again. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Knox could corner Miller on the sideline and remind him that 
throwing to the guys in the black shirts was advisable in 1993 but not such a 
good idea in 1994, it was too late. Falcon defenders intercepted Miller's 
passes three times, combining for nine fewer catches than Andre Rison, and just 
like that, it was 31-13, Atlanta, and a proud Ram winning streak had come to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't me on those floaters, Miller told reporters, scanning the crowd 
for familiar faces. Surely, they could vouch for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've seen me throw deep before," he said. "I don't throw ducks. I throw 
good, tight spirals. 
</P>
<P>
 "But two balls today just got away from me. The deep ball to Flipper and the 
ball that sailed on Troy. They looked like they came out of a ball machine. 
Punts. A couple wounded ducks. I don't throw the ball like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller seemed to be trying to convince himself. He mentioned that he talked 
with June Jones, his old offensive coordinator and the Falcons' new head coach, 
after the game and Jones told him, "You still throw the best deep ball in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he shook Jones' hand and replied, "Thanks, I appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened to those passes that fluttered and quivered and will never be 
confused, in any league, for the best deep ball in the game? 
</P>
<P>
 Moisture was the best response Miller could muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was wet," Miller claimed. "It slipped out of my hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Wet? 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the plastic carpeted, hermetically sealed, climate-controlled, 
always-69-degrees-and-bright Georgia Dome? 
</P>
<P>
 How does that happen? 
</P>
<P>
 "You figure it out," Miller snapped as he spun on his heel and slipped into 
the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 So that's it. The Falcons must store their footballs in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, fails to explain how the football dried itself in between 
punts, enabling Atlanta's quarterback, Jeff George, to complete 29 of 38 passes 
for three touchdowns and throw no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 No, must be something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Falcon defensive linemen are sneaking oil cans onto the field in 
their hip pads. Or maybe they spit on the ball just as Miller is winding up. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller returned from the shower stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "You figure it out yet?" Miller said to a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, still working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 A stab in the dark is taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Perspiration, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 Miller smiled and continued to finish dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if it was perspiration, how did it get there? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get into it," Miller said as he stood up. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he lowered himself into a center's position and mimicked someone 
snapping the ball against a sweaty right calf. And he winked. 
</P>
<P>
 There it is, then: The problem with the Ram offense Sunday was between Bern 
Brostek's legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton would have liked to have testified on Miller's behalf, but, as usual, 
he didn't touch the football. Drayton never does. He remains the most 
physically imposing and impressive decoy in the NFL -- to be seen, not targeted 
-- and the only football that came his way in Atlanta flew over his head like a 
747 lifting off the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just overthrew it," Drayton said. "Nothing you can really do about that. 
Chris said it slipped on him a little bit. Nothing you can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Same thing the boos, which followed Miller everywhere he went. Falcon fans 
booed him before his first play and after his last, cursing him as he walked 
into the tunnel after the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard worse, believe me," Miller said, shrugging. "Fans are fans. 
They've got the right. I'm a visitor now. And I didn't please everybody while I 
was here. We had a couple good years, but things went downhill after that." 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, however, Miller noted that he escaped serious injury on 
the field that reached up and chomped on his knee twice during his five seasons 
with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a relief to come off that field healthy," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time Miller returns, be sure to remind him: Bring a towel.

ATLANTA'S RISON TO OCCASION; PRO FOOTBALL: RECEIVER SCORES TWO TOUCHDOWNS, 
HELPING FALCONS POUND RAMS, 31-13. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Andre Rison guaranteed a victory, and as Falcon Coach June Jones 
fretted, the Rams had the videotape to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were motivated Sunday, enraged really, so angry that they rushed out 
and scored a season-high two touchdowns, pulling as close as 18 points of 
Atlanta by game's end. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad would it have been had the Rams (1-1) not been fired up? 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (1-1) pounded the Rams, 31-13, in front of 55,378 in the Georgia 
Dome, providing Jones with his first NFL victory as a head coach and vaulting 
Rison right up there with Carnac and the Amazing Kreskin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing about this game," said Anthony Newman, Ram safety, "is that we 
get to meet again." 
</P>
<P>
 A guarantee of revenge? Or a death wish? 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons not only won, but cruised to victory with Bobby Hebert mopping up 
for starting quarterback Jeff George and Rison mugging for the TV cameras along 
the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media ran with (the guarantee)," said Rison, who had two 16-yard 
touchdown receptions. "June didn't like it a lot, and Chuck Knox showed it to 
his team to fire them up. I came in with a little added pressure with the 
guarantee, but I've got some teammates that can play." 
</P>
<P>
 George, for one, can throw, and for the sixth time in his career he threw 
three touchdown passes. George, who was playing in his 53rd NFL game, topped 
the 10,000-yard mark after completing 29 of 38 passes for 287 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 George doesn't get to play against the Rams' secondary every week, and yet he 
still has thrown 277 consecutive passes without an interception -- the 
third-best streak in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff George threw the heck out of the ball," Knox said, "and we tried to 
cover Rison. We had double coverage on him, but still he beat the coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison had seven catches for 50 yards in the first quarter, including a 16-yard 
touchdown reception to give Atlanta a 14-0 lead. Rison tortured Ram cornerback 
Steve Israel with catch-after-catch, and when Israel thought he had perfect 
coverage on him, Rison caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can do is get better; I can't do any worse than I did today," Israel 
said. "I mean, damn, he had an excellent game." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison had Israel spinning in a circle with a 16-yard scoring reception in the 
fourth quarter -- his 22nd touchdown in his last 21 games -- and by game's end 
he had a dozen catches for 123 yards to become Atlanta's all-time leading 
receiver with 368 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes him look all the better now," said Robert Bailey, Ram cornerback. 
"The way it's supposed to work is if somebody steps in your back yard, you got 
to fight for your home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he said what he did he kind of stepped across the line. But we didn't 
come out fighting. We just didn't have the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Any spark the Rams might have generated was doused early in the second 
quarter. The Falcons had a 14-0 lead, but the Rams had the ball at Atlanta's 
one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis tried three consecutive times to bully his way 
forward for the final yard, but each time was stopped for no gain. Fourth and 
goal from the one, and the Rams desperately needed a touchdown, but Knox sent 
in the field goal team. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Chandler, the holder for kicker Tony Zendejas, had the snap 
from center hit him directly in both hands and then bounce to the ground, 
aborting Zendejas' 19-yard field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's early in the ballgame and if we get three points there, that's a big 
three points," Knox said when challenged about his decision. "We tried three 
times to get it in, and were not able to get it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had gone on fourth down and didn't make it -- running the ball or 
throwing the ball -- they would have said we should have kicked the field goal. 
That's the business, do whatever you want to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Second guessing, Part II: Later, in the same quarter with the Rams trailing, 
14-0, and stuck at the Falcons' 34-yard line on fourth and 17, Knox went for 
it. And the Rams scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller, who was booed soundly upon his return to Atlanta, 
threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to rookie Isaac Bruce, Bruce's first NFL career 
reception, to pull within a touchdown of the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Rams' ensuing kickoff, the Falcons had 1:07 to travel 66 yards 
before halftime, but George placed his team in field-goal position, and Norm 
Johnson was successful from 48 yards on the final play of the half for a 17-7 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons squandered an opportunity to bury the Rams on their first 
possession of the third quarter when they asked rookie wide receiver Bert 
Emanuel to play quarterback on third and goal from the two. After scrambling 
right and then left, Emanuel threw a pass to Ram linebacker Roman Phifer in the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on offense, the Rams' next three drives each ended in interceptions, 
including Darnell Walker's 44-yard return for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just made too many mistakes, too many penalties," Knox said. "I'm 
encouraged, but discouraged. I'm encouraged by the way we moved the ball, but 
I'm discouraged by all the penalties and turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams compiled 421 yards in total offense, but a week after committing 10 
penalties, they had nine against the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson caught five passes for 154 yards, including a 
41-yard touchdown pass from Chandler in the final minutes of the game, but 
tight end Troy Drayton has gone two games without a reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ran for 102 yards in 24 carries, but losing as badly as they were, the 
Rams did not give him the ball in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to bounce back," said Todd Lyght, Ram cornerback. "We have to play 
the San Francisco 49ers next week, and supposedly from what I've heard they are 
one of the best teams in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Any guarantee on who wins? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't guarantee anything; I don't play offense," Lyght said. "I can't put 
any points on the board. . . . "

 Coach: Bill Sumner (11th Year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Sea View League runners-up; sixth at the Orange County Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Tyler Beardslee, So; Andrew Gwin, Jr; Brian Slingsby, Sr; Kohei 
Tsujimoto, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Kevin Clougherty, So; Brian Coombe, Fr; Richard Hossfield, So; 
Erik Logan, Jr; David Long, So; Bill Stow, So; Shawn Young, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Sumner has big aspirations for his relatively young squad. "I 
wouldn't be surprised if this team is the second-best I've ever had here." 
Sumner said only his State championship team of 1989 had more talent. Slingsby 
had a disappointing junior season as evidenced by 11th-place finishes at the 
Orange County Championships and the Sea View League finals. Beardslee was one 
of the county's top freshmen last fall and has shown marked improvement heading 
into his second season. Known for cultivating young talent, Sumner has five 
sophomores and a talented freshman to shuffle around until he finds the perfect 
fit within his top seven spaces.

MIKE DOWNEY: GIVE THIS BAD SHOW THE HOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I love pro football. This isn't it. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. The Raiders look terrible. 
They have been beaten and beaten badly. They've gone from black and silver to 
black and blue. You call this team a Super Bowl contender? Right now, this team 
doesn't look like a Bud Bowl contender. No rushing game. None. Dreadful. No 
resemblance to the old passing game. None. Woeful. No heart or character on 
defense. None. Guys getting kicked out and guys not even showing up. Pitiful. 
Art Shell should start screaming in their faces and Al Davis should stop 
payment on their checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks old and the season is already in double jeopardy. I'll take "NFL 
Flops" for a hundred, Alex. Overreacting? You tell me. The Raiders are in last 
place. They have been outscored, 82-23, over a span of six days. Four of their 
next five games are against teams quarterbacked by John Elway, Drew Bledsoe, 
Dan Marino and Jeff George, the league's hottest passers. This team could be 
out of the playoffs by October. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of everyone who overrated them, I humbly apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes Shell. Even he felt compelled to say: "Maybe I overrated the 
talent on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 No maybe about it, baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's sorry-excuse-for-an-effort, 29-point, complete-and-unconditional 
surrender to Seattle was the worst loss for a Raider team at home since a 55-21 
defeat to San Diego on Nov. 22, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as lousy a performance at the Coliseum as I have ever seen, and that 
includes concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Davis, the AWOL defensive end, didn't show up. Scott Davis is about as 
reliable as a $2 wristwatch. Aundray Bruce, another defensive end, and Chester 
McGlockton, his sidekick at tackle, got bounced from the game on the same play. 
These three miscreants deserted their teammates. They can blame personal 
problems, temper, opponents, whatever they like -- doesn't matter. None of them 
were there when their friends needed them most. They jumped ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Raider defense disintegrated. Derrick Hoskins also got the 
heave-ho, right after Albert Lewis got the cuckoo knocked out of his clock. By 
game's end, the Raiders were playing people like Austin Robbins, Rob Holmberg 
and Rob Fredrickson, playing rookies who were supposed to break into the system 
gradually. They were using John Duff at defensive end. Fans in the stands were 
turning to one another and asking: "Who are these guys?" 
</P>
<P>
 I don't blame them. I don't even recognize this team right now. Was that 
really Tim Brown fumbling punts and butter-fingering passes? Was that really 
Jeff Hostetler throwing footballs no farther or harder than a referee's flag? 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Tom Rathman, paging Mr. Tom Rathman? (Five carries in two games for 16 
yards.) Who is Tyrone Montgomery and what is he doing starting at tailback? 
(Nine carries in two games for 15 yards.) Why is the leading Raider 
ground-gainer after two weeks Harvey Williams, who has rushed for exactly 38 
yards? Emmitt Smith gets 38 yards falling out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought the Raiders would be great. Like Humphrey Bogart, we were 
misinformed. They're not even good. They had better do more at Denver next week 
than pick fights. Or else they could be 0-3 going into the San Diego game. 
That's followed by back-to-back trips to New England and Miami, two of the 
NFL's highest-scoring teams. Good luck. The bad, bad, bad, bad Raiders are 
giving up 41 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 They fooled me. They fooled lots of us. 
</P>
<P>
 I never counted on Hostetler overshooting and underthrowing receivers, right 
and left. I never expected him to heave 36 passes in one afternoon and not 
complete one of them for 20 yards. I never expected Hostetler and Vince Evans 
to rank No. 2 and No. 3 on the Raiders after two weeks -- in rushing . 
</P>
<P>
 This team had better find its heart in a hurry. It can't find Davis, but 
that's only one of the coach's problems. Shell wouldn't be able to point out 
enough blame for this game if he had 45 fingers. I can already hear the Raiders 
now, saying this week: "Hey, we didn't say we would be good. You guys said we 
would be good." 
</P>
<P>
 If only getting into fights could earn you points, the Raiders could be 
unbeaten. Even their old friend Steve Smith, now of the Seahawks, went away 
from this one muttering: "As a group, they were taking cheap shots all day. I 
don't know if they were trying to prove their manhood or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Over two seasons, the Raiders have lost four of their last six games. They 
aren't nearly the team I thought they were. They aren't nearly the team they 
thought they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they'll score touchdowns against Denver next week, between fights. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt it.

HERSHISER MOURNFUL OVER TALKS; BASEBALL: DODGER PITCHER LAMENTS POSSIBLE LOSS 
OF POSTSEASON GAMES; FINAL WORD FROM SELIG LIKELY TODAY OR TUESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser, pitcher and player representative, sat in a Manhattan coffee 
shop Sunday a long way from the Dodger Stadium mound and still a long way from 
a settlement in the strike he is here to support. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 31st day of the stoppage, there was no movement and no productive 
contact between owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring an 11th-hour settlement, acting commissioner Bud Selig is expected to 
foreclose on the remainder of the season either today or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death of a friend," Hershiser said of the possible loss of the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger right-hander also said that as a potential free agent uncertain of 
what system will be in place if the owners unilaterally implement their salary 
cap proposal, he might not be signed until mid-summer because the strike 
probably will resume next spring. He ultimately hopes to return to the Dodgers, 
he said, but that, too, is in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing $16,939 a day on the $3-million a year contract that paid him $9 
million in salary, incentives and signing bonus during the 1992 and '93 
seasons, Hershiser said he has been too involved trying to "protect the rights 
of the players and what the players believe is good for the industry" to think 
about his own situation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, any time his future was discussed with the Dodgers it was always in 
the context of waiting until the bargaining agreement is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be as early as spring training or as late as the All-Star break 
before we even talk," he said, adding that a dysfunctional system could leave 
rosters in chaos and the courts besieged by unsigned players. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs, he said, will be hammered economically. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go past the World Series (without a settlement) I don't see the leagues 
functioning in terms of spring training and maybe not until the All-Star break 
of next season when again there's a pressure point on owners to have baseball 
on TV," he said, confident he can wait it out, that his rebuilt shoulder can 
sustain another three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran of 11 major league seasons will turn 36 on Friday. He was 6-6 with 
a 3.79 earned-run average when the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting times and hard to predict," Hershiser said. "We've seen 
organizational players of the past who seemed certain to end up dying in a 
Dodger uniform finishing in another. There are a lot of new stadiums and 
attractive places to play baseball now other than Los Angeles, but I don't 
think anything could surpass the experience of being with the Dodgers and 
finishing my career with the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser hopes to finish the 1994 season with the Dodgers in the new playoff 
format. "It's the reason we play," he said, "and to have that opportunity taken 
away is frustrating and disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't gone yet, but there's no sign of a miracle. Hershiser has been at the 
table as a member of the union's negotiating committee. The executive board, 
made up of the 28 player representatives, will meet today and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser said he was mystified by the control of the small markets and the 
absence of any role or rhetoric involving the teams in baseball's two most 
important media and entertainment markets: New York and Los Angeles. He said 
there is no clear indication of who has had the real negotiating authority for 
the owners and no clear indication they have wanted to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just grandstand, just a show," he said, endorsing the view of union 
leader Donald Fehr that the owners' objective is to implement the cap and break 
the union. The owners' out-of-hand dismissal of the tax plan proposed by the 
players Thursday after being encouraged to pursue that concept in 
behind-the-scenes meetings with club executives underscores the belief that the 
owners have never intended to deviate from those objectives, both Hershiser and 
Fehr said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly been a joke," Fehr said. "The few times someone said we have to 
try and work things out, either their authority was stripped, or they never had 
any." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig swept in Friday to make sure his negotiating committee rejected the 
proposal, then left as soon as the announcement was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser shook his head, reflecting on the obvious conflict of a club owner 
serving as acting commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he acting in the interest of the industry or his own club?" Hershiser 
said. "How is it that the center of power is in Milwaukee and not New York or 
Los Angeles? Commissioners are hired and fired by the owners. They are never 
truly unbiased, but now you have a commissioner who operates his own club. Fay 
Vincent and Peter Ueberroth were totally neutral by comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 The cap, he said, will destroy free agency and depress salaries. Championships 
will be won and lost by teams that have flexibility under the cap. Competitive 
balance? The owners are really talking about financial balance and guaranteed 
profits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fans? "They must be wondering how all these brilliant people can be so 
stupid," Hershiser said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should be so arrogant to think the fans will come back 
automatically. But I think we can be confident they'll come back eventually. 
We've definitely hurt baseball in the short term. We can only hope we haven't 
damaged it in the long term."

PROF. MONTANA TEACHES: THE GOLDEN STILL RULES; PRO FOOTBALL: IN FIRST GAME 
AGAINST FORMER 49ER TEAMMATES, HE LEADS THE CHIEFS TO A 24-17 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He stole the game from his former team, stole the headlines from his former 
rival, stole the hearts of those who had stopped believing. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was finished, this celebration of greatness under fire, Joe Montana 
then stole the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading the Kansas City Chiefs to a 24-17 victory over the San Francisco 
49ers on Sunday, Montana grabbed the ball from the last play and held it high 
above his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagging it with the boisterousness of a boy who had swiped it from his younger 
brother, he rushed from the field and into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he gave the ball to the equipment manager, a really strange thing to do 
for Joe, who is not very sentimental," said Dave Szott, Chief guard. "All week 
he said that winning this game wouldn't be anything special . . . but right 
then, we knew that it was very special." 
</P>
<P>
 That ball will undoubtedly be signed and mounted for Montana's living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "The master showed he had more to teach the student," said Steve Young, the 
49er quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Montana paraded, Young limped, dragging his tired body from the field, 
his white shirt as disheveled as it had been throughout the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 While the master celebrated amid 79,907 screaming Arrowhead Stadium fans, the 
student was left alone with his welts and his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a pretty good beating out there," the student said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who has ever wanted to prove somebody wrong could learn from Sunday 
when Montana, in his first meeting with his former team, attacked them with the 
vengeance of a jilted lover. 
</P>
<P>
 So the 49ers thought he was too old and brittle when they traded him here in 
spring of 1993. Wonder how they liked his two touchdown passes and his 19 
completions without an interception? 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder how they liked that 57-yard drive in the third quarter that resulted in 
the Chiefs' go-ahead touchdown after they had trailed by 14-7? It came on a 
perfect eight-yard pass to Kerry Cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Or what about that 62-yard drive to end the game and clinch the victory? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's magic, he's just magic," said Chief offensive lineman Joe Valerio, who 
scored the game's first touchdown on a fourth-down, one-yard pass from Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Young played as if bewitched. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampered by a depleted offensive line, he threw two interceptions in a span of 
three offensive plays in the third period. He also lost a fumble in the fourth 
period, one of three sour endings to their three drives during their attempted 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 The second drive ended with a field goal after Young's bootleg run from the 
two-yard line was halted by a flying tackle from another former 49er, David 
Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The third drive ended with a lost fumble by John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Young completed more passes than Montana (24-19) and threw for more yards 
(288-203). But somehow, there was no comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a chance to win, and I didn't get it done," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a chance to seal the victory, Montana behaved a tad differently. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down at his 31-yard line with 2:23 remaining, instead of handing the 
ball to Marcus Allen in hopes of killing the clock, he threw a perfect sideline 
pass to Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old running back beat rookie linebacker Lee Woodall for 38 yards. 
The 49ers spent the rest of the game hitting themselves in the helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two guys who worked out that play were the only two guys in this league 
who could have done that," Valerio said. "This was the kind of game you dream 
about playing in." 
</P>
<P>
 Long after the media horde had left -- there were nearly 100 more media 
members here than usual at an NFL game -- even Montana acknowledged that the 
game caused his heart to race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, this was very emotional for everybody," Montana said. "You could just 
look around out there, see how many guys going down, see how many fights." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Montana and Young aren't particularly close, they weren't the 
combatants. In fact, they even briefly shook hands before the game, even if 
Young did have to run 35 yards across the field to find Montana, who made no 
motion in his direction even though he saw him. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me not to go over and say hello to Joe, after all we've been through 
together, that would have been awkward," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young spent most of the game meeting with Montana's defensive linemen, who 
took advantage of the absence of starters Harris Barton, Ralph Tamm and then 
Jesse Sapolu for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Derrick Thomas, playing defensive end for most of the game, had 
three sacks, seven tackles, and a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana rewarded him, and all the defensive players, by buying them post-game 
hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a typical gesture for a guy who said he prepared for the game on 
Saturday by "playing nine holes of golf and driving my kid's go-kart down the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was atypical in that Montana erred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gave us all double meal burgers," Thomas said, wincing. "I would rather have 
a beer." Tale of the Tape

SWIMMING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; COACHES CALL FOR ESCALATION OF DRUG BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China's foes -- or is it foils? -- joined in a show of force on the final day 
of swimming's World Championships on Sunday. But, unfortunately for them, it 
did not come in the Foro Italico pool as the Chinese women ended the meet the 
same way they started it six days before, sweeping all three events and 
breaking another world record. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Sunday, coaches from Australia, Great Britain, Sweden and Canada 
appeared at a news conference to release a petition signed by officials from 18 
countries and the World Swim Coaches Assn. that called upon swimming's 
international federation, FINA, to escalate its battle against banned 
substances. Among those signing was Dennis Pursley, U.S. Swimming's national 
team director. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . The apparent re-emergence of the extensive use of 
performance-enhancing drugs, especially in women's competition, constitutes the 
single greatest threat to the progress and integrity of our sport," the 
petition read. 
</P>
<P>
 FINA President Mustapha Larfaoui of Algeria, who did not attend the news 
conference, said he was not consulted about the petition but agreed with its 
intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to improve all the conditions of our doping control and do the 
maximum number of tests possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No representative of China signed the petition. The team's head coach, Chen 
Yunpen, said he was not even aware of it until it was shown to him by a 
reporter late Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we have been saying," Chen said. "We are ready to be tested at 
all times. But this must also be for the Americans and all of the other 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches at the news conference said they did not decide to draft the 
petition until Saturday and they did not have time to contact representatives 
from all 103 nations competing. They said they did not know whether anyone from 
China had been approached, but they emphasized that the petition did not single 
out any nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's coach, Dave Johnson, made it clear, however, that the effort was 
inspired by the success of China's women. He said the coaches decided they 
could not remain silent, as a majority of them did when East Germany's women 
dominated the sport in the 1970s and '80s. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
their suspicions that the East Germans benefited from the systematic use of 
banned drugs were confirmed by documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parallels between the East Germans and the Chinese has left everyone with 
a fairly cynical attitude toward what they are seeing in the pool," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At their most productive, East German women won 13 of 16 events and 24 medals 
during the 1986 World Championships in Madrid. The Chinese women almost matched 
that in Rome, winning 12 of 16 events and 19 medals. 
</P>
<P>
 They also set five world records, including Le Jingyi's 50-meter freestyle 
time of 24.51 seconds Sunday. Their other two victories on the final day 
resulted in meet records, Liu Limin's 2:07.25 in the 200 butterfly and He 
Cihong's 2:07.40 in the 200 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the results of the Chinese are a sham," said the U.S. women's coach, 
Richard Quick of Stanford. "It sounds like sour grapes, but it's a completely 
unfair playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Quick said if FINA does not deliver on its promise to intensify its fledgling 
program of out-of-competition, unannounced drug tests, he will recommend that 
the United States and other countries withdraw from the next World 
Championships, in either late 1998 or early '99, in Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Quinlan of Australia, vice-president of the World Swim Coaches Assn., 
said his organization will have a battle plan to present at a FINA meeting next 
August in Atlanta. One possible proposal, mirroring the NCAA's death penalty, 
would call for a four-year suspension from international competition for a 
country after the fourth positive drug test involving its swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 If that were the rule now, China would already be sidelined. Four Chinese 
women swimmers have tested positive for anabolic steroids since March of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting impatient that things aren't being done through the channels 
where they should be done, for whatever reason," said Don Talbot, Australia's 
coach. "If the suspicions are allowed to fester, we're not going to have a 
sport. We might as well disband." 
</P>
<P>
 The exploits of the Chinese, and the discussions of them, overshadowed some 
outstanding performances in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 world records set, five were not accomplished by Chinese women. One 
that was not came Sunday night, when Finland's Jani Sievinen swam the 200 
individual medley in 1:58.16 to erase the previous record of 1:59.36 set in 
1991 by Hungary's Tamas Darnyi. Australia's Kieren Perkins, who earlier set a 
world record in the 400 freestyle, won his second gold medal, finishing the 
1,500 freestyle in 14:50.52. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's Alexander Popov swam the second-fastest 100 freestyle split ever, 
47.68, on the final leg in the 400 medley relay, but American Gary Hall's 
teammates gave him too much of a lead to lose as the United States won in a 
meet-record 3:37.74. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the United States' 21st medal, the fourth gold. Both totals are 
all-time lows for the team in the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Pursley said the Americans will have to improve if they expect more success in 
the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

PRO FOOTBALL SPOTLIGHT; THAT'S SPELLED S-P-I-K-E-S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dolphin rookie Irving Spikes is making sure all the NFL scouts who ignored him 
on draft day are becoming familiar with his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Spikes, who went undrafted and made Miami's roster on the strength of his 
three impressive kickoff returns against the Packers in an exhibition game, 
duplicated his feats Sunday. The 5-8, 215-pound dynamo ran 13 times for 70 
yards, sparking the Dolphins to a victory over Green Bay at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Spikes, who had the nation's fourth-best rushing average (149.5) last year at 
Northeast Louisiana, ran for 41 yards on three consecutive plays to set up a 
touchdown by Dan Marino that gave the Dolphins a 10-0 lead. He left the game 
early in the fourth quarter after hurting his knee, but he later said the 
injury wasn't serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to prove that I can run the ball," he said. "This means a lot to 
me. Hopefully, they'll have confidence in me to keep giving me the ball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I don't just want to be a return guy because I love to run the 
ball. I want to be the main guy on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Marino has beaten Green Bay all five times he has faced them. This time was 
easier, he said, because Spikes was on his side. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's small and elusive," Marino said. "He did a great job of accelerating 
through the holes. We wanted to get him into their secondary and he did a great 
job." A FAILING GRADE FOR PASSING 
</P>
<P>
 It's predictable that Vinny Testaverde will find his receivers. To the dismay 
of Testaverde and the Browns on Sunday, the Steelers found those receivers 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Darren Perry's career-high three interceptions, Pittsburgh intercepted 
Testaverde four times Sunday in its 17-10 triumph.  
</P>
<P>
 Testaverde's passes have landed in opponents' hands six times in Cleveland's 
first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to put pressure up the middle and get him rattled, disguise 
our coverages so he wouldn't know where the hole in the zone was going to be," 
Perry said. "I don't think he could figure out what coverages we were actually 
playing today." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to accepting blame, though, Testaverde couldn't be faulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough day obviously, but you have to keep fighting," he said. "I 
take my share of the responsibility, my share of the blame. Now I want to 
bounce back and be there for my teammates next week. I didn't play a very good 
game, but I don't think my confidence will be affected." CHRIS WHO? 
</P>
<P>
 After the Vikings traded right defensive end Chris Doleman, a six-time Pro 
Bowl participant, no one expected their pass rush to be much of a threat. But 
James Harris, who replaced Doleman, teamed with John Randle, Henry Thomas and 
Roy Barker to sack Lion quarterback Scott Mitchell six times in Minnesota's 
10-3 victory over Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has been hammering us with, 'Hey, you lost Doleman.' OK, we lost 
Doleman. It's over with," Barker said. "Do we miss Doleman? No, we don't miss 
Doleman. Doleman is gone and we're still good." 
</P>
<P>
 Randle, Harris and Barker each had two sacks. Thomas was the main force that 
let the Vikings hold Barry Sanders to 16 yards in 12 carries, Sanders' worst 
rushing game since a 10-yard performance against New Orleans on Oct. 28, 1990. 
GUSHING ABOUT THE OILERS 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys couldn't stop praising Oiler quarterback Bucky Richardson, who 
stepped in when Cody Carlson was idled by a shoulder injury. Of course, they 
could afford to be gracious after they defeated Houston, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what, before the game I didn't want to play against him," 
Dallas Coach Barry Switzer said. "He scares me to death the way he scrambles. 
He's a great competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday wasn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came close but that doesn't mean much," said Richardson, who scrambled 
seven times for 37 yards. "I evaluate my performance on wins and losses." 
NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay's Sterling Sharpe extended his team record by catching a pass in his 
89th consecutive game. . . . Keith Byars' touchdown just before halftime for 
Miami marked the 105th game in a row he has caught at least one pass. . . . A 
five-yard carry by Marcus Allen in the second half moved him past Earl 
Campbell's 9,407 career yards and into ninth place on the all-time list. Allen, 
who had 69 yards and a touchdown, needs one more touchdown to tie John Riggins 
for fourth on the all-time list. . . . Jerry Rice did not catch a pass against 
the Chiefs until 3:27 was left in the first half. His first catch was the first 
pass thrown to him. . . . It was the eighth time Kansas City's Derrick Thomas 
has made three sacks. He got the 70th sack of his career. . . . Chief Coach 
Marty Schottenheimer had been 0-3 against the 49ers at Cleveland and Kansas 
City. . . . The crowd of 79,907 was the second largest in the history of 
Arrowhead Stadium. A crowd of 82,094 watched a game with the Raiders Nov. 5, 
1972. . . . The Steelers and Browns have split the season series each of the 
last five years. Pittsburgh has not swept a season series from Cleveland since 
1981 but could do so by winning at Three Rivers Stadium on Dec. 18. . . . Gary 
Anderson had five points for the Steelers on a field goal and two extra points. 
He moved past former Cincinnati kicker Jim Breech into 11th place on the career 
scoring list with 1,248 points. . . . In five career starts against Cleveland, 
Pittsburgh's Neil O'Donnell is 106 of 170 (62.4%) for 1,242 yards, an average 
of 248.4 yards per game. The Steelers, however, are 2-3 in those five games. . 
. . The Vikings have won eight consecutive home openers since Detroit beat them 
in 1986. . . . Warren Moon moved into eighth place on the all-time lists for 
passing yardage (33,906) and completions (2,654). . . . Jeff George's 38 pass 
attempts without an interception lifted his streak to 277, third-best in 
history behind Bernie Kosar's 308 and Bart Starr's 294. . . . George also went 
over the 10,000-yard mark in career passing with 287 yards, giving him 10,119 
after the second game in his fifth season. . . . Andre Rison set a Falcon 
career record for receptions, his 12 in the game lifting his total to 368. The 
old record was 359 by Alfred Jenkins from 1975-83. . . . Ram tackle Jackie 
Slater, 40, appeared in his 249th game, sixth on the all-time list and only one 
shy of fifth place Pat Leahy. Slater is No. 1 among offensive linemen and 
current active players in games played. . . . Drew Bledsoe became the first New 
England Patriot quarterback with three consecutive 300-yard passing games. . . 
. Jim Kelly set a Bills team record with 183 touchdown passes after throwing 
four. Joe Ferguson's old mark was 181. . . . The 70 points is the most the 
Patriots have scored in the first two games of any season. Last season, the 
Patriots scored their 70th point in their fifth game. . . . Washington's Brian 
Mitchell, the Redskins' hero, played quarterback at Southwestern Louisiana, 
where he became the first player in NCAA history to pass for more than 5,000 
yards and run for more than 3,000. . . . It was the first time Washington 
quarterback John Friesz has passed for three or more touchdowns in his 
five-year NFL career. . . . Saint kicker Morten Andersen's 29-yard field goal 
in the first period extended to 160 the number of consecutive games in which he 
has scored, the second longest such streak in history. . . . The Jets' Art Monk 
has caught a pass in 166 consecutive games, 11 short of the record by Steve 
Largent. AS THOMAS GOES, SO GO THE BILLS 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bills running back Thurman Thomas was held to five yards on seven 
carries and Buffalo's offense produced only three points. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Thomas rushed for 106 yards, and the Bills overcame the Patriots, 
38-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence? Hardly. When Thomas moves, the Bills do. "We decided to move at a 
faster pace. It seems to help us execute better," Thomas said. "I loved the 
tempo we set in the first half but we got tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kelly threw four touchdown passes as the Bills picked apart the Patriots' 
defense, which allowed Dan Marino to throw five touchdown passes last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dumbfounded," Patriots nose tackle Tim Goad said. "I expected our defense 
to be pretty good. We faced the two best quarterbacks in our division the first 
two weeks and we haven't proven we can stop anybody." IT MUST BE CATCHING 
</P>
<P>
 A hands-on approach didn't work for Tampa Bay's receivers last week against 
the Bears, when they dropped four passes. 
</P>
<P>
 They got it right on the second try, catching three of Craig Erickson's 
touchdown passes in a 24-10 victory over the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 But not many fans caught this performance. The smallest crowd for a home 
opener in Tampa Bay history -- 36,631 -- saw Erickson complete 19 of 24 passes, 
the second-highest passing total of his career, for 313 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game was more indicative of the type of games we're capable of having," 
said Jackie Harris, who had four catches for 96 yards after catching three for 
20 against the Bears. "Everybody wonders after a game like Chicago. Everybody 
was saying the receivers can't catch. This tells the world. . . . that we're 
able to bounce back." THEY'D COST A FEW BUC(K)S 
</P>
<P>
 The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, responding to reports that a prospective buyer is 
prepared to offer up to $175 million for the team, issued a statement saying 
the club is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers' future has been the subject of speculation since the death 
last month of Hugh Culverhouse, the only owner in the club's 18-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts businessman Socrates Babacas has said he intends to send the 
team a letter this week offering to purchase the franchise for between $165 
million to $175 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago real estate developer Bruce Frey, who made an unsuccessful bid to buy 
the Dolphins last year, also has expressed interest in the team. INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 New York Giant running back Rodney Hampton was hospitalized after bruising a 
kidney during the Giants' victory over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton was expected to be kept overnight at St. Joseph's Medical Center in 
Phoenix after blood was found in his urine. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time Pro Bowl selection, who has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in 
three consecutive seasons, had 39 yards in 17 carries when he left the game 
midway through the third quarter. He scored on a 3-yard run in the second 
quarter. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana, to Chief president Carl Petersen, who offered him the stat sheet 
after the Chiefs' 24-17 victory over Steve Young and the 49ers: "No, thanks. We 
won. That's all that counts."

<P>
 Packer safety LeRoy Butler after the Dolphins' 5-foot-8 Irving Spikes set up

RAIDERS STAY THE SAME, BUT SEAHAWKS SHAKE THINGS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After losing eight consecutive games over a four-year period to the Raiders, 
the Seattle Seahawks had a difficult time trying to explain what happened after 
Sunday's 38-9 victory over their AFC West nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks couldn't help but ask themselves: Are they that good or are the 
Raiders that bad? 
</P>
<P>
 With two road victories to open the season, the Seahawks can start claiming 
that they have arrived as an AFC contender. By defeating Washington by 21 
points and the Raiders by 29, Seattle's plus-50 point differential is the best 
in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people expect us to be the same team that finished 2-14 two years ago or 
the team that finished 6-10 last season, they are going to be sadly mistaken," 
Seattle safety Eugene Robinson said. "We are a totally different team. We have 
better players, we run different plays and we use different schemes. We are a 
team to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on their success against the Raiders, Robinson might be right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks seemed to be toying with the Raiders on both sides of the ball in 
racking up 332 yards and 22 first downs on offense, and forcing four turnovers 
and keeping the Raiders without an offensive touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle kept drives alive on half of its 14 third-down attempts and made a 
first down on its only fourth-down try early in the second half. That led to a 
five-yard touchdown pass from Rick Mirer to Brian Blades that gave Seattle a 
17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never easy out there, but they did do everything we expected from them," 
Seattle wide receiver Michael Bates said. "They really didn't vary much with 
their defensive coverages. They basically stayed with their same stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates should know because he and Mirer took advantage of the predictable 
Raider secondary late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Raiders trailing, 17-3, Bates went in motion and ran a deep post 
pattern in front of cornerback Lionel Washington and scored on a 40-yard play 
to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that we would get them in a defense where (Washington) would be 
playing me back deep and to the outside," Bates said. "Once I got over top of 
the defender, it was just like we drew it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle had the Raiders' number on defense as well. Because they did not have 
much respect for the Raiders' running game, the Seahawks concentrated on 
putting pressure on quarterback Jeff Hostetler to stop their passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks learned from watching the Raiders' opening loss to San Francisco 
that they had plenty of time to get a pass rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw in film that they held the ball a long time on their passing plays," 
Seattle cornerback Carlton Gray said. "On almost all of their pass plays, 
Hostetler held the ball at least three seconds and that is too long in this 
league.  
</P>
<P>
 "So, we figured that with a big-play offense like they had, we had to get as 
much pressure on them as we could. Things just worked out the way we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Do the Seahawks think the Raiders are that bad? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that they are a good team, but I am surprised that they go out and 
lose two games in a row like that," said Seattle fullback Steve Smith, who was 
waived in June after eight seasons with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what their problem is, but they are not playing with confidence. 
Not the way they played in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Seahawks said the Raiders looked like a different team doing the 
same things from years past. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really haven't changed much in that they line up the way you expect them 
to," Robinson said. "Don't get me wrong, they are still a very physical team 
that hits hard, but you get what you expect from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said that he noticed that Hostetler's deep passing game was not sharp, 
which created a problem for the Raiders' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "On his deep passes, he did have more air under his ball than usual," said 
Gray, who played at UCLA. "But it might have been from the pressure we were 
able to get on him." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Seattle tight end Trey Junkin, who played with the Raiders in the 
late 1980s, the Raiders might be doing more fighting than playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to have lost focus on what they were doing," Junkin said. "They 
were too worried about getting in that one extra punch or push, instead of 
playing football. They don't need to do that. It just takes them out of their 
game."

RISON PROVES A MAN OF HIS WORD AGAINST RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After catching 12 passes for 123 yards and two touchdowns in Atlanta's 31-13 
victory over the Rams on Sunday, Falcon wide receiver Andre Rison still wasn't 
finished with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison, part-time football prophet, part-time trash-talker, helped the Falcons 
deliver on his guarantee that the Falcons would beat the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the locker room after the game, Rison hinted that the Rams had put a 
bounty on him and accused Ram cornerback Steve Israel, whom he had beaten all 
day, of taking a cheap shot at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel took a shot at me about five yards out of bounds," Rison said. "I 
guess that comes with the territory, when you make a comment (the prediction) 
and it all gets blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my performance against No. 31 (Israel) shows that I know what I'm talking 
about. After he took a shot at me, I went back and (gave him a shot) to let him 
know where I was coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 And the bounty? 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I say a bounty?" Rison asked. "You better go ask the Rams about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Told of Rison's allegations, Israel shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," he said. "Nobody put a bounty on him and nobody took a 
cheap shot on him. I told him that on the field, that I wasn't trying to 
cheap-shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was coming up to make a tackle and he was along the sidelines. I'm just a 
player trying to get better. There wasn't any bounty on him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' six-defensive-back strategy was no match for Rison, who often found 
himself in one-on-one coverage with Israel on short sideline routes. When Rison 
did go downfield, he beat Israel over the middle for a 16-yard touchdown catch 
late in the first quarter, and added another 16-yard touchdown early in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat there the whole first half and wondered what type of defensive back 
would be able to stop Andre," said James Lofton, the former All-Pro receiver 
who now does football previews for CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would a Lester Hayes or Michael Haynes be able to stop him? Would Ronnie Lott 
be able to punish him enough? The guy is so tough, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams tried with Israel, sometimes with help from free safety Anthony 
Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was Rison, strutting in the end zone after his second touchdown, and 
having a laugh with Falcon tackle Irv Eatman, a former Ram no less, as he 
pointed at a sign that read "Guaranteed" hanging from the second deck of the 
Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre saw that sign and told me, 'I told you so,' " Eatman said. 
"Fortunately, we made good on his prediction." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of Sunday's game, Rison had rubbed it in even more by setting the 
Falcons' career receiving record. 
</P>
<P>
 He now has 368 catches, surpassing the 359 by Alfred Jenkins from 1975-83. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison, of course, was on his best behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams' whole sideline was talking trash to me all day and I didn't say one 
word," Rison said. "I just did what I had to do on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Which was catch everything new Atlanta quarterback Jeff George threw his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison has 26 receptions for 316 yards and four touchdowns in two games, a 
reflection of what he and George are capable of in the Falcons' run-and-shoot 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 So with the Kansas City Chiefs coming to Atlanta on Sunday, is Rison ready to 
offer another prediction? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not messing with Joe Montana," Rison said. "No way."

PRO FOOTBALL / ATLANTA FALCONS 31, RAMS 13; RAM NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY; 
DRAYTON WANTS TO PLAY A BIGGER ROLE IN OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram tight end Troy Drayton's statistics from the Rams' 31-13 loss to the 
Atlanta Falcons on Sunday at the Georgia Dome -- no catches and one bruised 
ego. 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton, a second-year player who figured to be a go-to receiver for 
quarterback Chris Miller, has yet to catch a pass in two regular-season games. 
"You can't imagine how I feel right now," Drayton said. "Coming into the season 
I thought I was going to be a big part of this offense. Now, I don't know what 
my status is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I have a niche. I don't know anything. It's frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 What can Drayton do to become a bigger part of the offense? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can do," he said. "That's a question you have to ask the 
offensive coordinator (Chick Harris) and the head coach (Chuck Knox). 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said last week that Miller twice tried to throw to Drayton in the 
season-opening victory over Arizona. On Sunday, Drayton was open again inside 
Atlanta's 15-yard-line, but Miller overthrew him and D.J. Johnson intercepted 
the pass at the Falcons' four-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have so much anger and frustration right now," Drayton said. "Hopefully, as 
the season goes on, I can be a bigger part of it (the offense)." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, wide receiver Flipper Anderson was a beacon of hope for the Ram 
offense. Anderson caught five passes for 154 yards, including a 54-yarder from 
Miller and a 41-yard scoring reception from backup quarterback Chris Chandler 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram coaches had hoped that Anderson, who caught only one touchdown pass in the 
final 10 games last season, would return to the deep threat he once was. They 
thought they remedied the situation when they signed Miller to replace Jim 
Everett at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the road again: Cornerback Darryl Henley, playing in his first road game in 
nearly a year, got into the game in the fourth quarter and finished with one 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams re-signed Henley, indicted on federal drug-trafficking charges, last 
week after a federal judge ruled that a court-appointed officer would not have 
to escort the player on trips as part of his bail restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irv Eatman, a backup tackle with the Falcons, took a shot at the Rams for not 
re-signing him in the off-season. Eatman was the Rams' starting left tackle 
last season, but was cut for salary-cap reasons and because the coaching staff 
wasn't satisfied with his pass blocking. He later signed with Atlanta, where he 
lives in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Knox said it was a money thing," Eatman said. "Looking back at it, it 
doesn't make a lot of sense considering that they have a $5 million guy (rookie 
tackle Wayne Gandy) sitting on the bench and have another guy (veteran Clarence 
Jones) starting in place of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told I played well. But they made the decision based on things other 
than football." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bad Moon Rison: Former Ram wide receiver James Lofton, now with CNN, attended 
Sunday's game and said he thinks Atlanta wide receiver Andre Rison has a great 
shot at breaking the NFL single-season pass reception record of 112 set last 
season by Green Bay's Sterling Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way he's going," Lofton said, "he could have a 140-catch season." 
</P>
<P>
 With 26 catches in his first two games, Rison is on pace to catch 208 passes 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta players presented Falcon Coach June Jones a game ball in honor of his 
first NFL victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones admitted making a rookie mistake -- having rookie wide receiver Bert 
Emanuel, a former quarterback at Rice, line up at quarterback instead of Jeff 
George on a third-and-goal situation at the Ram three in the third quarter.

 "Bert is supposed to either run or look to Andre on that play," Jones said. 
"He could have run it in there. I probably shouldn't have called that play." 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Falcon quarterback Jeff George completed 29 of 38 passes for 287 yards, had 
three touchdowns and no interceptions. He surpassed 10,000 career passing yards 
and extended his streak of passes without an interception to 277, third-longest 
in NFL history. . . . Offensive guard Keith Loneker left the game with a sore 
left arch and tailback Johnny Bailey pinched a nerve in his right side.

SAMPRAS WILL FACE SWEDEN IN DAVIS CUP

<P>
 Pete Sampras surprised the U.S. Tennis Assn. by changing his mind and agreeing 
to play in the Davis Cup semifinals against Sweden Sept. 23-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gullikson, Davis Cup captain, announced his team Sunday and said the No. 
1-ranked Sampras, who had suffered from exhaustion and badly blistered feet in 
an upset loss last week in the U.S. Open, had called a few days later saying he 
would not play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just said he changed his mind," said Gullikson, whose twin brother, Tim, 
is Sampras' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the team includes ninth-ranked Todd Martin and a doubles team of 
Jonathan Stark and Jared Palmer, among the top doubles players in the world, 
but never before a team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davis Cup tie against Sweden will be held in Goteborg. The other semifinal 
will match Russia and Germany. BILL DWYRE

cross-country. . . . The teams from Capistrano Valley and San Clemente could 
supply two of the biggest surprises in the county this year. . . . Saddleback's 
depth could make the Roadrunners a force in the newly formed Golden West 
League. . . . El Toro figured to be among the county's best, until a automobile 
collision sidelined standouts Tomas Mejia and Martin Pennell.

1994 PREP PREVIEW / BOYS' CROSS-COUNTRY; SANCHEZ READY, WILLING, ABLE TO GO 
DISTANCE FOR COUGARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He's not the kind of athlete who tells you he's going to beat you. He's not 
the kind of athlete who looks intimidating. But Adalberto Sanchez is the kind 
of athlete who knows how to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Valley senior is Orange County's top boys' cross-country 
runner, partly because of his strong work ethic and partly because he wouldn't 
have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, at 5 feet 2 and 105 pounds, has a competitive style that punishes 
most of his opponents. He takes the lead at the start of every race, sets a 
brutal pace early and makes everybody play catch-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I run that way because I don't like to lose," said Sanchez through an 
interpreter. He has been enrolled in the English as a Second Language Program 
since he arrived in the United States from Mexico in eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely a front-runner," said Gary Gross, Capistrano Valley boys' 
cross-country coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Sayles, who coaches Sanchez and his distance-running teammates during 
track season, sees his leading pupil's strategy as a warning to some and a 
challenge to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way he runs, it's saying, 'If you want to go with me, then go.' 
Unfortunately at the very elite level, some kids can do just that," Sayles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section Master's meet competition proved to be just elite enough 
last track season, as Sanchez led the section's top eight 3,200-meter runners 
for most of the race at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. But his early pace came 
back to haunt him and he was caught in the final 100 meters, finishing sixth 
and missing by one spot the final qualifying position for the State meet. 
Sanchez lowered his personal best by nearly three seconds to 9 minutes 13.48 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross says the longest distance prep runners are allowed to run -- 3,200 
meters -- is not sufficient to showcase Sanchez's talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is destined to be a marathoner or 10,000-meter runner," said Gross of 
Sanchez, who has expressed an interest in running the 26.2-mile marathon 
distance for his native Mexico on the international level. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, Sanchez will have to settle for the three-mile and 
five-kilometer courses offered during the fall's cross-country season. And if 
last year was any indication, the distance seems to suit him fine for now. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Sanchez won the South Coast League final in the fall, then came 
back in the spring to win the 1,600 and 3,200 races in track for the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 He also enjoyed success outside the county, winning the section Division I-AA 
race and finishing 12th in the State Division I cross-country race. Sanchez was 
selected to The Times' all-county first team in cross-country and second team 
in track. 
</P>
<P>
 He has the fifth-best time among returning underclassmen in the State's 
large-school division, 13 seconds behind the State's top returner, Jeff Fischer 
of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 One of California's other top runners, Eliasar Hernandez of Camarillo High, 
hails from the same region in Mexico as Sanchez. Both grew up in the town of 
Nepantla, Mexico, just outside Mexico City. Hernandez turned in a 15:27 
clocking at the State Division II race; Sanchez finished in 15:39 in the 
Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 Running is not the only feature that sets Sanchez apart from the crowd. The 
spiked, straight-up hairstyle has also become a trademark of the Cougar 
workhorse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my real hair. No hair spray," insisted Sanchez with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez has yet to secure a spot on the Foot Locker National Team, but it 
remains one of his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to win the State and be able to run in the Nationals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The top runners from the West Coast battle at Fresno's Woodward Park at 
season's end for the right to wear the West team jersey at the Dec. 12 event 
held annually in San Diego. Only the top eight athletes from each region 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows how hard he works and he knows what it takes to win," Sayles said. 
"So anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross believes the same and has pointed Sanchez's training toward the end of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't run last year because we felt his best was run at the State meet," 
Gross said. "At his rate of progression, I really don't see why he can't make 
the (West) team."

 The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana has received a grant of 
$112,500 in general operating support from the Institute of Museum Services, a 
federal agency that assists museums of all disciplines. One of 1,159 museums 
nationwide to apply for an IMS grant this year, the Bowers was one of 300 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach has replaced two members of its 
development staff who resigned recently, and in doing so has restructured the 
development department somewhat. Debi Barker will fill a newly created 
position, assistant director of development, in which she will help coordinate 
individual giving, membership and grant proposals. Barker is now special events 
coordinator for the Foundation for Deep Ecology in San Francisco, which allots 
grants for ecological projects. Holly Jenks, previously in product development 
at W.J. Bradbury, a printing firm in Santa Ana, has been named development 
assistant, another new position. Jenks, who will implement fund-raising events, 
will begin work Sept. 19; Barker will start the following Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the museum has been granted $5,000 from the Taco Bell 
Corporation for staff computer training.

JAZZ REVIEW; CHUCK MANGIONE IS TOOT SWEET AT OCC CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a performance by Chuck Mangione, you probably won't find yourself asking 
where the melody was. Almost like a good Broadway musical, the veteran 
trumpeter-fluegelhornist's shows leave you with tunes you are likely to find 
yourself humming, not only as you go out the doors but the next morning as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a sold-out house of 916 at Orange Coast College's Robert B. Moore 
Theatre, Mangione -- playing his first Southern California concert date in 
years -- offered the selections on which he has built his substantial and loyal 
following. 
</P>
<P>
 Included were "Chase the Clouds Away," "The Land of Make Believe," a medley 
from "The Children of Sanchez" and of course "Feels So Good," the ditty that 
made it to No. 4 on the Billboard pop charts in 1978 (the album of the same 
name reached second place on the Billboard Top 100) and has sold more than 2 
million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 The melodies that drive these songs are simple, direct and tuneful, and have 
held up remarkably well over the years (even if, at 53, Mangione himself is 
looking a bit gaunt). There is heart in these songs, and there was heart in the 
interpretations Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the brassman from Rochester, N.Y., (who played with Maynard 
Ferguson and Art Blakey before his hit records) took a lot of flak from fans 
and critics for turning out lackluster tunes and equally irrelevant 
performances. At the Moore, he dealt those naysayers a solid smack, putting 
life into his deliveries and fire into his solos. 
</P>
<P>
 He filled out the show with non-originals including a vibrant opener, "Manha 
da Carnival," and a Dizzy Gillespie blues, "Here 'Tis (You Heah?)." But it was 
the Mangione favorites that the audience came to hear and, decked out in one of 
his trademark hats, he gave the listeners a bouquetful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chase the Clouds Away," slow and sweet and pretty, was rendered with flair 
and precision -- and like each of the numbers was smartly arranged, so that if 
often felt as if a much larger band than a quintet was up there. 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrical melody was heard in four distinct voices: Gerry Niewood, a member 
of Mangione's original quartet in the early '70s, played it on piccolo, flute 
and the longer, deeper-toned alto flute, and Mangione rendered it in ringing 
tones on electric piano. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing a sense of snap with lush lyricism, "The Land of Make Believe" included 
an up-tempo section in which lines leaped agilely as Mangione played 
fluegelhorn with verve. The showcase, though, was the medley of three tunes 
from "The Children of Sanchez," music written for Hall Barlett's film of Oscar 
Lewis' novel about a lower-class Mexican family. Mangione's arrangement segued 
seamlessly from one section into the next, featuring Niewood on flutes and 
soprano sax and Bob Sneider on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle -- a solo segment over a boiling rhythm set up by drummer 
Charles Ruggiero and bassist Tom Brigandi -- both Mangione and the crack, 
commanding Niewood improvised with zeal.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: SOCIAL AGENCIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 GROCERY LIST: Welfare cutbacks have channeled more of the needy to private 
charities in Orange County, and among those most affected is Share Our Selves 
in Costa Mesa. The volunteer organization now is helping to support 1,400 
people, the highest number in its 23-year history. . . . On any given day, the 
organization dispenses 348 ounces of peanut butter, 4,464 ounces of jelly, 
5,859 ounces of chicken noodle soup, 558 pounds of tomatoes, 558 pounds of 
spaghetti, 558 grapefruits, 279 pounds of frozen corn, 1,674 hamburger patties, 
558 quarts of powdered milk and 558 loaves of bread. 
</P>
<P>
 KICKOFF: During its last campaign, United Way of Orange County raised $19.3 
million on behalf of its 1,000 member agencies, somewhat below a record $21.4 
million raised in 1990. Still, that's not bad for a recession year, says 
spokeswoman Lucianne Amaral, and she expects the new campaign to exceed that 
amount. . . . The campaign begins at an invitation-only breakfast Friday in 
Irvine where diners will get the pleasure of seeing corporate executives 
flipping pancakes and pouring coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 BOREDOM: Latch-key kids in Irvine now have an alternative to simply hanging 
around after school waiting for their parents. Dial Irvine Kid Phone at (714) 
756-WARM is open school-day afternoons to take calls from bored or lonely kids 
5 to 15 years old. . . . For the most part, callers just want someone to talk 
to about what's on their minds, says coordinator Linda Zuba. "We call it a 
'warm line' because hot lines are usually more crisis-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 SAY WHAT? There was such an overload of callers to the county's child abuse 
hot line -- about 126 calls a day -- that 25% were hanging up or being put on 
hold for up to 40 minutes. One of the big reasons: frivolous complaints. . . . 
Social workers say one straight-faced caller reported a mother "abusing" her 
children by giving them food from McDonald's. . . . Grandparents call to 
complain about their grandchildren's rearing. And many exaggerated complaints 
come from child custody combatants.

STREET SMART: IN SETTING THE TIMING OF TRAFFIC SIGNALS, IT'S EVERY CITY FOR 
ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 How long do I have to wait at an intersection for the light to change? Here in 
Irvine, there are several intersections that are set at an abnormally long time 
before the light changes.  
</P>
<P>
 Earle G. Wolfrom 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 In California, no law limits the timing of traffic signals. There are no 
federal guidelines, either. It's every city or county for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, if the signal is operating correctly, the longest wait should be 
114 seconds, said Bonnie Burton, senior transportation analyst for the city. 
But a red light of that length would be extremely rare, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest cycle length for all traffic signals in Irvine is 120 seconds, 
Burton said. This means a signal goes through all its light changes and allows 
time for every direction of traffic to make a move, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the traffic signal detector loops are not functioning, the malfunctioning 
light would remain red for 15 minutes, Burton said. Then the signal 
automatically realizes something is wrong and goes through a series of light 
changes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We have a dangerous traffic problem since the opening of the extension of 
Cabot Road from Pacific Park Drive to Crown Valley Parkway. Cabot Road is 
effectively an extension of Interstate 5, with heavy traffic routinely 
traveling at freeway speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is access to Cabot Road exiting from Moulton Ranch via Vista 
Viejo, and attempting to turn left across four lanes of high-speed traffic. 
There are several hundred cars exiting each day, especially during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic light is desperately needed at the intersection of Vista Viejo and 
Cabot to slow down traffic and allow safe entry onto Cabot. High-speed traffic 
coming down the hill from Crown Valley has limited visibility of traffic 
entering from Vista Viejo. Traffic heading toward Crown Valley is also coming 
downhill at a high rate of speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Please note that it took a fatal accident at our other entrance (Bridlewood 
Drive at Pacific Park) for a light to be installed. I'd like to see this 
avoided this time.

 Shirley Land, traffic engineer for Mission Viejo, said her city did monitor 
the intersection of Cabot Road and Vista Viejo because of the changes in volume 
and speed on Cabot, along with evaluations of all the city's intersections. 
That intersection ranked seventh in priority, and funds are available for only 
the top two priorities, Land said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo have joined forces to petition the county 
for money for a light there, she said. A letter was sent to the county earlier 
this month. County traffic engineer Ignacio Ochoa said this kind of request is 
usually answered within one month, after the county has a chance to do its own 
traffic evaluation of the intersection.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Do the local police departments or the Department of Motor Vehicles do 
anything about forcing out-of-state drivers to purchase California plates once 
they've established residency in California? 
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
 A new arrival has 20 days to register a car and get new license plates from 
the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The penalty for not doing so is 
hefty. Late fees begin accruing immediately and if you're more than a year 
late, the cost of registration also racks up. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV, the CHP and law enforcement agencies each use their own method of 
tracking registration scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's the CHP observing the same out-of-state car over and over again 
on the roads, or the DMV receiving input from the public, the result is 
essentially the same: a form letter or notice to errant vehicle owners 
apprising them of the law and telling them how to make amends. 
</P>
<P>
 If you know of out-of-state vehicles with owners who are legal residents of 
California, you can blow the whistle by calling the DMV's Registration and 
Compliance Unit at (916) 657-6718. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, you can write a letter to the Department of Motor Vehicles, Registration 
and Compliance Unit, P.O. Box 942869, Sacramento, Calif. 94269-0001. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter include the make, model, state and license plate number of the 
car. In the lower left corner of the envelope write, "Unit 86A."

CARVING OUT A BRAND-NEW LIFE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Lee Sundstrom spends much of her day with a small sharp knife between her 
fingers, meticulously crafting pieces of soft Asian wood into popular storybook 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the Santa Paula woman is busy making 100 wooden reproductions of 
Alice from the 1865 Lewis Carroll classic, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 10 years, she's carved other dolls. But none have been as 
popular as Hitty, a simple country doll less than seven inches high that is 
based on the heroine of a decades-old children's story. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those dolls sold for $1,000 each, Sundstrom, 68, said recently from 
her bright and airy home in the foothills of Santa Paula's Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some collectors are so desperate to get one of Sundstrom's limited-edition 
dolls that they ply Sundstrom's mailbox with letters, each asking how and when 
they can get their own Hitty. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman's letter to Sundstrom begins: "Where have you been for the last 45 
years?" The woman explains that is how long she has been searching for a 
faithful reproduction of Hitty, the title character from the 1929 book "Hitty, 
Her First Hundred Years," written by Rachel Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundstrom's success with Hitty took even those well-versed in the doll 
collector's market by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems people are just intrigued by the story of Hitty," said Caroline 
Cook, publisher of the Doll Reader, a Pennsylvania-based magazine for doll 
collectors with a circulation of 100,000 readers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is sort of a romance for that little creature," Cook said. "I don't 
quite understand it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Sundstrom, a retired illustrator, had no intention of tapping into a hidden 
Hitty cult when she began carving dolls about 10 years ago. She just wanted 
small, lifelike figures that would fit perfectly into a two-story dollhouse 
given to her by her husband, Al. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned to carve, starting with soap, as a young girl growing up in 
Washington state, Sundstrom said. She quickly moved on to wood, which remains 
her favorite sculpting material, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For her dolls, she uses a soft, fine-grained wood called Jelutong. It comes 
from gum trees found in southeast Asia, the same trees that are used to make 
latex, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love wood," Sundstrom said. "It smells nice and it's soft enough so you 
don't have to fight it, but hard enough that it holds its shape." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the relationship a carver must have with wood. You have to coax it 
into shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Sundstrom said it takes total concentration to carve her finely featured 
dolls. The pieces are first "rough carved" on a machine by Don Reinke, a Santa 
Paula neighbor who runs a doll-carving business with his wife, Sandy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundstrom then fine-tunes the carvings, paints and assembles them. Sandy 
Reinke, an accomplished seamstress who is also a doll collector, stitches the 
detailed costumes the dolls wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Sundstrom uses only high-quality wood for her dolls, Reinke said she 
tries to find the best materials for the clothes. She buys tiny satin ribbons 
from Salt Lake City, for example, and orders fine cotton cloth from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the women's craftsmanship that makes the dolls so desirable for 
collectors, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sundstrom's scale is so accurate," Cook said. "So many other Hitty dolls are 
way out of proportion and don't look like the original." 
</P>
<P>
 Field's book chronicles the adventures and misadventures of a doll named 
Hitty. The author based the book on a tiny doll she actually found at an 
antique shop, Sundstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Hitty doll is now housed in a Massachusetts museum, Sundstrom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundstrom said she decided to make reproductions of Hitty after reading about 
the doll in a periodical for collectors. At first, Don Reinke was skeptical 
about making such a tiny doll, his wife recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we sold the first one for $800, he changed his mind," Sandy Reinke said. 
</P>
<P>
 All 100 copies of Hitty have been sold, Sundstrom said. She is now 
concentrating on making eight-inch-high versions of Alice from the Carroll 
book.

HELP OF OJAI OFFERS ARRAY OF SERVICES FOR SENIORS; ELDERLY: THE AGENCY GIVES 
ITS 500 VOLUNTEERS A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WHILE PROVIDING SOCIAL PROGRAMS 
AND AN ADULT DAY-CARE CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 7 a.m., the 76-year-old volunteer handyman has been chopping up and 
hauling away a 20-foot-long eucalyptus limb that crashed through a gazebo 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hours later, sweat pouring off his brow and his yellow shirt soiled, the 
silver-bearded local priest says of his toil for HELP of Ojai: "It's absolutely 
a blessing, because it gives you places to go and things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was asked by his bishop 2 1/2 years ago to give 40 hours a week to 
HELP, Father David Grant swears that he isn't working any harder than many of 
the other 500 senior volunteers who propel the nonprofit organization, one of 
the largest community service providers in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people here who volunteer as much or more time than I do," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 HELP of Ojai, which opened in 1968 with a handful of volunteers, runs a 
variety of year-round services geared toward senior citizens, the handicapped 
and others in need of social programs, Executive Director Marlene Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
 HELP's five vans travel around the Ojai Valley making about 2,500 round-trips 
per month. An estimated 250 senior citizens and handicapped residents are 
transported to and from its multipurpose center and adult day-care center, both 
next to Ojai's City Hall. Another 250 or so are given rides for other 
activities and needs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Little House multipurpose center, senior residents meet daily. They 
play bridge and bingo, learn computer skills, receive group counseling or take 
such classes as Spanish, creative writing, Oriental brush painting or hula 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Across a small parking lot at the adobe-styled Oak Tree House day-care center, 
five paid staff members provide mental and physical stimulation for Alzheimer's 
patients and other ailing senior citizens. It allows care-takers at home -- 
often overburdened spouses -- a chance to rest, project director Lynn Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 HELP also runs a food bank and offers counseling groups for residents of all 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, HELP raised about $314,000 -- with only about $70,000 coming from 
federal and state grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest, Spencer said, was gathered from the community. About $95,000 was 
brought in at its 2nd HELPings Thrift Store in Ojai on Fox Street, and about 
$16,000 was collected through a utility bill collection service in which the 
organization keeps 30 to 35 cents per bill. The group also held three 
fund-raising community events, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said HELP of Ojai's senior center and adult day-care center are the 
only ones of their size in the county that are primarily funded by community 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we're doing is unique because so much of the type of services 
we're providing are usually provided by cities and / or parks and recreation," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at Thousand Oaks, they have a humongous senior center," but it's 
administered by parks and recreation. "But we are a nonprofit group providing 
the services here." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura and Oxnard, senior citizen centers are also administered by 
recreation agencies, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai group can more freely engage in a variety of services, such as 
transportation, Spencer said, because it is less likely to be sued than 
government bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities run scared to do the type of things we do . . . (such as using) 35 to 
40 volunteer drivers," she said. "I think people look at what we do 
differently. It would be like biting the hand that's feeding you if you sued 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen House of the Ventura County Area Agency on Aging said HELP of Ojai is 
the only nonprofit group solely responsible for running a senior center in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do an excellent job," she said. "They have been in the vanguard for the 
county in testing and developing many new senior services in the last 15 years, 
such as their day-care center and their transportation for seniors." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer pointed out that the city of Ojai leases HELP its land for $1 and 
provides some money for the van services. About $46,000 of the $70,000 in grant 
money, she said, comes from the federal government for HELP's service to people 
over 55 under the Retired Senior Volunteer Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ojai Councilwoman Nina V. Shelley: "I don't know what we do without it. . 
. . The city could not provide at this point in time -- because of limited 
revenue -- the services to the seniors in the community that HELP provides." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other HELP services: Volunteers fill in for hospice caretakers, deliver 
meals for the home-bound, provide a security patrol for checks on homes of 
people on vacation, run Neighborhood Watch seminars and fingerprint 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a lifesaver for me," Jo Huber, 69, said as she drove back to the 
center in a specially equipped van after dropping off some lunch recipients. 
"My husband died suddenly about three years ago. We were married for 46 1/2 
years. It's pretty much my social life, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grant of Ojai's Our Lady and All Angels Church, in between tasks at the 
center: "(HELP) treats Alzheimer's patients, the invalid, the house-locked, the 
friendless -- it's an outreach program that services the silent need of a 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Many at HELP point to a large senior segment in the Ojai Valley and a 
communitywide spirit of helping as reasons for its success and its ability to 
recruit droves of hard-working volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the ambience of Ojai itself," said 79-year-old Hope Baker, who helps 
iron the clothes donated to the thrift store each week. "The more you give, the 
more you get back." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Mira Monte resident sprayed, ironed and creased a pair of purple slacks 
while chatting with four other volunteers, she added that the center keeps her 
busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we grow older, the more active we can remain, the better we are 
health-wise, both mentally and physically," she said. "And doing something for 
someone else makes you feel good. It does so much for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker -- a former retail manager who voluntarily directed the thrift store for 
10 years and worked for the center's old crisis hot line -- said that for many 
retirees, caring for others and having social time at the center are a golden 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people would have no other place to go," she said, adding that 
HELP's annual Christmas party can be the only holiday gathering for some. "What 
HELP does is it gives people the opportunity to experience a feeling of 
self-worth and contact with other people. We offer understanding and acceptance 
. . . camaraderie." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the stark white ironing room, 82-year-old Mary DeVito works briskly, 
her hands worn from working for years in a Los Angeles steel factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know about this kind of thing -- they don't do this in L. A.," said 
DeVito, who has been volunteering for various jobs at HELP since she retired to 
Ojai in 1978. "Everybody makes you feel at home, you know, like a big family." 
</P>
<P>
 At Oak Tree House, state law requires one licensed paid staff member per eight 
senior citizens enrolled. But volunteers are also on hand to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This provides a group activity that the family can't provide, and it also 
provides a respite for the care-givers (at home)," Lewis said as she watched a 
couple of staff members and about 15 senior citizens sit in a large semicircle 
playing Trivial Pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Kennedy was married to Ethel?" asked an elderly woman seated at the head 
of a table. "Robert," answered a woman as other game players conferred softly 
while nibbling on cookies and sipping punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right!" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lewis: "We are providing mental and social stimulation to help them 
function at a higher level. . . . It allows them to stay out in the community 
longer before they are put in nursing homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis added that many of the Alzheimer's patients and others served at Oak 
Tree House used to volunteer for HELP. Some still believe that they are working 
when they come to the center, she said, giving them more self-esteem and 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, the afternoon van returned to take game players home. For 
some of those who had to wait for the second or third trip, anxiety about 
leaving took over. To ease the tension, staffers broke out a giant inflated 
globe and had the seniors push it around on tables in a game of "table ball." 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't remember where they live and it's a very stressful time, so this 
kind of distracts them," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, the same group members were back at Oak Tree House, where many 
come five days a week, learning how to create picturesque water-color 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Maynard, 94, the oldest person in the room, who started with HELP as a 
volunteer, admired her purple-shaded painting of hot-air balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very enjoyable group, and I always find plenty to do," she said. "It's 
good for me; why wouldn't it be good for others?"

STREET SMART: CITY ANSWERS RESIDENT'S REQUEST FOR INCREASED PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I live in Ventura in a townhouse on Corvallis Court, and I am very concerned 
about the lack of parking on nearby Telephone Road west of Saticoy Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of parking spaces in my complex is limited, and when I have guests, 
it becomes almost impossible to find parking for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be possible to allow off-peak street parking on Telephone? 
</P>
<P>
 I sent a letter to the city about this in January, but they have not addressed 
this matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce M. Littlejohn, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The city did receive your letter and in response has added two parking spaces 
on Telephone, Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about the best the city can do, Lalani says, because most of the 
stretch of Telephone near your house is taken up by a fire hydrant red zone and 
a bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 West of the hydrant, the road narrows and there is not enough space to 
accommodate both street parking and the existing bike lane, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of parking, perhaps your guests could take advantage of that 
convenient bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The timing seems to be off on a traffic light near my home in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal is at Loma Vista Road and Hillmont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens is the signal from Hillmont onto Loma Vista is red for 90 seconds 
and green for only seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite often, I see cars running the red light because they don't want to wait 
that long for the light to change. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be more green time and less red time for cars coming from 
Hillmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Cates, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, often there is more green time for Hillmont traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The light works on a special, recently installed traffic loop that keeps the 
Hillmont signal red -- and the signal for traffic on Loma Vista green -- until 
a car shows up on Hillmont. 
</P>
<P>
 When a car appears, it triggers seven seconds of green -- ample time to make 
it though the intersection, Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Each additional vehicle traveling from Hillmont to Loma Vista triggers an 
additional two seconds of green time, up to a total of 30 seconds, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most efficient way to carry traffic from a side street of this 
type onto a main roadway," Lalani said. "We have signals like this all over the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As both a motorcyclist and bicyclist, I am continually plagued by "on demand" 
traffic control lights that are triggered by sensors in the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, a bicycle or motorcycle is not heavy enough to trigger the 
sensor. This is especially a problem with left-turn signals. 
</P>
<P>
 I either have to wait for an auto to come along or run the light. Neither 
option is very desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible to realign these traffic sensors so that they can detect 
bicycles and motorcycles? 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donovan, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, traffic signals are sensitive enough to detect motorcycles 
but not bicycles, Simi Valley Traffic Engineer Bill Golubics says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cities cannot afford equipment sensitive enough to trigger a signal 
change for a comparatively lightweight bicycle, Golubics says. Only towns such 
as Davis, where there are a lot of bicyclists, invest in the extra-sensitive 
equipment, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the kind of demand to make it cost-effective to buy the extra 
equipment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most signals are rigged to react to motorcycles. If you come across 
one that doesn't, call the city's traffic department at 583-6700, and the 
problem will be fixed, Golubics says. Simi Sewer Work 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, traffic will be reduced to one lane in each direction on Los 
Angeles Avenue between Tapo Canyon Channel and Crater Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is shutting down part of the roadway to install a sewer line for the 
nearby Cultural Arts Center. The sewer work is scheduled to be completed by 
Sept. 23.

500 VISITORS ENJOY A TASTE OF GERMANY AT ANNUAL OKTOBERFEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Matt Foldesi of Newbury Park clutched a handful of Ping-Pong 
balls at Conejo Creek Park in Thousand Oaks on Sunday and leaned as far forward 
as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Methodically, he tossed them one by one onto a table full of small glass 
tanks, each containing a tiny goldfish. He dropped two of his three balls into 
fishbowls, winning two bright orange additions to his aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to put them in my fish tank," said the boy, one of more than 500 
people who turned out Sunday for Oktoberfest 1994, the eighth annual 
fund-raiser hosted by the Newbury Park Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
 All things German filled the park behind the Thousand Oaks Library off Janss 
Road on Sunday, including beer, music, smoked bratwurst and sauerkraut. 
European culture was not the only one represented. There was an African 
elephant on display, and American contributions included crafts and potato 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, local politicians handed out brochures detailing their campaigns while 
Rotary Club members sold T-shirts commemorating the day for $7 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money goes to the Rotary scholarship fund," said event chairman Francois 
Zanni, a restaurateur from Newbury Park. "Our goal this year is to raise 
$15,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Zanni said last year's Oktoberfest generated almost $14,000 for various high 
school scholarships and local nonprofit groups, such as Meals on Wheels and 
Polio Plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do this event partly to raise money," Zanni said. "But we also offer free 
admission so that as many people as want to can come. They don't have to spend 
a dime." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carolyn Dydyk of Newbury Park thought enough of a handcrafted wooden bird 
feeder to pay $24.95 for the hanging gift, which was shaped like a cat with a 
box around its belly and a sign reading "Let's do lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought this as a Christmas present for my friend," the homemaker said. "She 
owns cats, so she'll see the humor in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Dorman of Newbury Park, who made the bird feeder, said business was 
good Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sold four of them and there's only been a crowd here for about an hour," 
Dorman said at noon. "I've been out here the last four years because they 
organize it really well. It's a good local fund-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
 At the far end of the park, Rotary Club volunteer Suzanne Guggenheim was 
collecting $1 bills as fast as children could hand them her way. The bills 
bought three minutes inside a dinosaur- or elephant-shaped Astro Jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good place to have some fun and use up energy," Guggenheim said. "This 
is fun for kids of all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a display by new car dealers, Sherry Horn of Canyon Country was 
offering rides on her 10-year-old elephant, Nellie, to children for $1 and 
adults for $2. 
</P>
<P>
 At noontime, however, the uncomfortable elephant was apparently scaring away 
any takers and cutting down on ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Ingrid Szczesiak of Simi Valley said the Rotary Club-sponsored 
Oktoberfest was pretty authentic for a local fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife's German, so we both wanted to come," said Robert Szczesiak, a 
developer and apartment manager. "I've never been to an Oktoberfest (outside 
Germany). This is the American version, but it's pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingrid Szczesiak said the Rotarians did a good job of creating a German 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Berlin," she said, having just finished lunch. "The sauerkraut was 
very good and the bratwurst was excellent, but the potato salad was American -- 
not very good."

CAL LUTHERAN GETS WIRED FOR AGE OF INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY: CAMPUS'S NEW 
FIBER-OPTIC CABLE LINES PROVIDE COMPUTER ACCESS TO E-MAIL, LIBRARY CATALOGUE 
AND CLASSROOMS AS FAR AWAY AS KENTUCKY.

<P>
 A minute past midnight and the doors of Cal Lutheran University's library are 
locked. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to read Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" for a 9 a.m. class, 
but you have searched the dorm from top to bottom and cannot find a copy of the 
play to save your life. What to do? 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, you probably gave up and slept through the class to avoid 
meeting the disappointed eyes of your professor. In the days of 
high-technology, there is an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Return to your dorm room, flip on your computer, dial into the Internet and 
tap into the Shakespeare files, where scripts of all his plays, complete with 
analysis and commentary, are at your fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, while students were off working as waiters, lifeguards and the 
like, crews were busy wiring Cal Lutheran, laying 58 miles of fiber-optic cable 
throughout the Thousand Oaks campus. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,500 students, faculty and staff will be able to access Internet to use 
e-mail, browse through the library catalogue, do research, and share classroom 
cyberspace with students as far away as Kentucky and as close as Oxnard. Its 
official name is CLUnet, pronounced "clue-net" on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really taken a giant step forward," said Ken Pflueger, Cal Lutheran's 
director of information services. "We've put in the infrastructure to do things 
that haven't even been thought of yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Installing the system cost the university $1.8 million. Pflueger said he 
expects that Cal Lutheran will spend about another $1 million over the next two 
years enhancing and improving the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran will start issuing user accounts to everyone on campus Oct. 1. 
But the buzz about the new technology has already spread across campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone got hold of this," said Pflueger, picking up a Xeroxed draft of a 
pamphlet for students explaining the services. On the back is an order form for 
user accounts. "It's been photocopied and passed out by someone, I don't know 
who. We've already got a stack of them filled out already even though we 
haven't printed the real pamphlet yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many students are already familiar with computer technology and using 
Internet, Pflueger said he expects some of Cal Lutheran's 300 faculty members 
to balk at the leap to high-technology. Electronic mail alone might baffle 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to admit that they don't know things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the more technologically aware professors on campus have volunteered to 
mentor their colleagues, teaching them one on one about the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Several professors were instrumental in designing the system and have already 
been using it in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Harry Domincone, an assistant professor in Cal Lutheran's School of 
Business, began using Internet in his classes for research. One student working 
on a term paper about the European holdings of a U. S. food conglomerate was 
able to use Internet to get obscure information from a library in Pisa, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Domincone also used Internet to hook his students up with a business class at 
the University of Louisville in Kentucky. They worked on a joint project all 
semester, sharing ideas and research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students here had the benefit of engaging in group discussion with people 
with different kinds of world experience," Domincone said. "They also had 
entire libraries at their fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's electronically sophisticated college students demand this kind of 
technology, Domincone said. "Cal Lutheran will be one of the first 
internationally to get it going," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The system was designed by Fugitsu Business Communication Systems and National 
Systems Research Co. Fugitsu plans to use Cal Lutheran as a selling model to 
line up other universities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the original aluminum-siding house that everyone wants to drive their 
clients by," Domincone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Huvard, a biology professor and director of Cal Lutheran's Center for 
Instructional Multimedia, has big plans for the new network. She will put her 
course syllabus on the network, as well as lecture outlines and diagrams. 
Eventually, she hopes to be able to put slide shows of marine life in the 
system, contributing to the general store of information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 She also plans to use multimedia presentations in class, using technology to 
show students three-dimensional images of invertebrates and marine animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But she does have some doubts about technology replacing traditional teaching 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may spend three or four hours putting together a multimedia lecture that I 
deliver," Huvard said. "It's fun, but did they actually learn more about marine 
biology that day than if I had just drawn on the chalkboard? It's a question 
that I'm constantly struggling with." 
</P>
<P>
 Rorik Melberg, 21, a senior majoring in computer science, is already 
well-acquainted with Information Age technology, particularly the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you use it, it's so easy," Melberg said. "It's great. I love it. The 
Internet has tons and tons of information on any subject." 
</P>
<P>
 He was happy to get a letter in the mail from the university this summer 
telling him that he would be able to access the network from his dorm room. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computers in the library are slow," he said. "And they close at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing for me is going to be being able to download pictures and 
files, just like that," he said, snapping his fingers. "You won't have people 
waiting for computers behind you. Twenty-four-hour access."

FIRM'S PROPOSAL FUELS TRAFFIC, NOISE CONCERNS; MOORPARK: MINING COMPANY SEEKS 
COUNTY'S OK TO EXPAND OPERATION, WHICH WOULD MEAN MORE TRUCKS PASSING THROUGH 
CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A company mining sand and gravel four miles north of Moorpark is applying for 
a county permit to nearly double the size of its operation, increasing truck 
traffic and noise in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark officials are warning that the expansion by Transit Mixed Concrete 
Co. could lead to more than two large trucks through the city every minute of a 
12-hour workday. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said activity at the site would be no greater than in the 
past, but a recently released environmental analysis indicates otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The mining operation, which was run by Blue Star Ready Mix until it sold out 
in 1993, delivers from 1.2 million tons to 1.8 million tons of gravel and sand 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit Mixed is asking to increase its operation to 3.4 million tons a year 
for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scope of the project will remain where it has always been," said Chuck 
May, vice president and general manager of Transit Mixed. "We don't want people 
to assume that 'My God, it's going to mushroom into something huge.' We are 
going to operate like we always have." 
</P>
<P>
 May would not comment on the numbers in the environmental report. But he said 
the proposal is no different from one first submitted in 1991 by Blue Star. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints from nearby homeowners about noise, dust and traffic have plagued 
the operation since 1986. Mining began there in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Star mined the site for almost seven years without a permit, but with 
county acquiescence. Transit Mixed is also operating without a permit, but it 
is now seeking one from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A Planning Commission hearing is set Oct. 26, and the issue would then go to 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 If the expansion is approved, the mine would eventually employ about 195 
people, far more than now, May said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are still reviewing Transit Mixed's proposal and have not yet 
submitted their comments to the Planning Commission. But truck traffic remains 
their biggest concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a truck hauling three tons of sand from the site crashed in front 
of Moorpark's City Hall, tipping over and dumping its load on a lawn adjacent 
to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief City Planner Jim Aguilera was reviewing the report's traffic analysis 
when the crash occurred. He said it was not the first time that trucks from the 
mine had crashed in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to impress upon the county how much this is a real-life issue for 
us," Aguilera said. "It's not just a document." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the environmental report, the company listed options to routing 
traffic through town on California 23. One is a proposed bypass through Happy 
Camp Regional Park and a planned community by Messenger Investment Corp. on the 
east side of town. The bypass road eventually connect with the Simi Valley 
Freeway east of Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Austin, Messenger vice president, said he doubted that such a road would 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't get the feeling that they are recommending that alternative," he 
said. "But we will emphasize that we would not like to see them build an 
alternative route through our property." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to traffic, the proposed expansion is expected to destroy about 
147 acres of native grasslands. The mining operation would also be visible from 
hiking trails in Happy Camp park, and the company predicts that about 60 times 
a year the site will be lighted for a round-the-clock shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the environmental report are at the county Planning Department at 
the Government Center in Ventura until Oct. 20.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; MEXICAN FIESTA RAISES $4,000 FOR SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bright colors, rich foods and great sounds of the 28th annual Ojai Valley 
Mexican Fiesta drew some 1,200 people to Ojai's Libbey Park on Sunday for the 
closing day of the two-day fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival raised an estimated $4,000 for a scholarship fund to help young 
Ventura County Latino residents attend college, fiesta committee President Tony 
Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the turnout," Sanchez said. "It's great to see the 
community get behind what is such a good cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's crowd brought the weekend total to nearly 3,000 people, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Sunday, the crowd swayed to the vibrant rhythms of a variety of 
Mexican music while feasting on homemade tamales, enchiladas, tacos and cold, 
frosty drinks. Colorful pinatas suspended by ropes overhead vied with the 
musicians on stage for the attention of children. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's events also sought to expose people to authentic Mexican culture, 
said Peter Aguirre, organizer and master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so important to preserve our heritage," Aguirre said. "Events like this 
go a long way in helping our community showcase our roots. The gratifying part 
has been to watch this event grow year after year." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre said the event will benefit an estimated 20 college-bound students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a full ride, but the program does provide scholarship funds during 
all four years of their college program," he said. "With the cost of tuition 
these days, those funds can really help." 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Diaz, owner of a Ojai pest-control business, echoed those sentiments. 
As mariachis sang in the background, she sold cold cans of soft drinks for the 
scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important event for our community because it brings people 
together," Diaz said. "I believe in this day and age, that's important." J. E.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON REDESIGN OF PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Architect Curtis Stiles' pride and joy -- his redesign of the plaza at the 
beach end of California Street, for which he gave up his seat on Ventura's 
Planning Commission to avoid a conflict of interest -- will have to be scaled 
back, city engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
 After bids for Stiles' plaza design came in well over-budget, engineers cut 
some of the amenities and simplified some of the accents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, will vote on the 
new, toned down redesign tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiles contracted with the city in the spring to sketch a revamping of the 
space along the beach Promenade between the Holiday Inn and a parking garage. 
After Stiles had begun sketching his ideas for the job, council members told 
him that he could not retain his seat on the Planning Commission and still 
accept the $25,000 contract. 
</P>
<P>
 So Stiles, declaring himself humiliated, quit the commission in a huff and 
nearly walked away from the project as well, until friends persuaded him to 
stay with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura landscape architect had grand plans for the plaza, including 
terra-cotta paving, a fountain shooting darts of water out of the pavement and 
an overall design loosely resembling a fish. The tail of the fish was to be a 
series of steps leading from the Promenade to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city sent the project out to bid, engineers expected to spend about 
$435,000 on its construction, which is set to start in October and be completed 
in mid-February, Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only valid bids ranged from $684,000 to $770,000, according to city 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 So Ventura engineers reconsidered, honed the design a bit and set a new limit 
-- $615,000 and no more, to come out of the city's Redevelopment Agency budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were the tail-steps, worth about $100,000, Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fancy paving patterns have been simplified. The benches and trash 
receptacles now cost less. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiles says he will miss the fish tail, but he can live with the new look. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do?" he asked. "You gotta make budget." CONSTANCE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SKATEBOARD RAMPS DONATED FOR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Goleta skateboard manufacturer has donated thousands of dollars worth of 
ramps to Ojai, moving the small town one step closer to the construction of a 
skateboard park. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Walker, an Ojai parks and recreation commissioner, said Powell 
Skateboards decided last week to donate the majority of its ramp equipment from 
the Powell Skate Zone in Goleta to Ojai. The corporation is shutting down its 
24,000-square-foot indoor skateboarding park because it was losing too much 
money, owner George Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of it they've offered to us, which is really an expensive and a 
very generous gift, probably worth $30,000," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, the city can only accept some of that equipment because of 
storage and moving difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said Powell Skateboards thought of donating the ramp equipment after 
reading in recent weeks about Ojai officials approving a skateboard facility in 
concept. The collection of ramps, half-ramps and other wooden, 
Masonite-surfaced shapes probably adds up to 8,000 or 9,000 square feet of 
skating area, he said. Ojai will only take a portion of that equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said the donation will save thousands of dollars toward construction of 
a skateboard park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ojai's task force of local skaters and city, school and 
police officials will investigate the best way to use the ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas for the equipment so far include using the equipment as is, or covering 
it with a more durable steel or cement surface, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "However we decide, having these ramps is just going to further us along" in 
our proposal to the City Council, he said. The Council has said that outside 
funds or grant money must be found for the construction of a facility, if one 
is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first task force meeting on Thursday evening, Walker said, teen-age 
skateboarders were asked which ramps they would like the city to acquire. JASON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY TO HEAR PLANS TO EASE PLAZA 
TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To deal with an expected crush of theatergoing traffic, the Thousand Oaks City 
Council on Tuesday will consider widening or re-striping stretches of Hampshire 
Road and Thousand Oaks Boulevard near the newly built Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works Director Donald Nelson has drafted six options, ranging in price 
from $5,000 to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said his first choice would be to restrict parking around the 
intersection of the two streets, ban U-turns and install new left-turn lanes 
along with a right-turn arrow. Those efforts would cost about $90,000, Nelson 
said, and would significantly ease bottlenecks. 
</P>
<P>
 But any proposal to tinker with parking at that intersection alarms several 
nearby business owners, who earn most of their money from customers who park on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitive to the business owners' concerns, several council members have 
objected to any re-striping or road widening that could eliminate parking. 
Still, they acknowledge that they may have to convert some sidewalk into 
roadway to improve traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough one," Councilman Frank Schillo said. "If we take away parking 
spaces, those businesses are going to be out of business." STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: $5 DONATIONS SOUGHT FOR VENTURA CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of a four-year public college in Ventura County are being asked to 
contribute $5 each to have their names enclosed in a time capsule to be opened 
in 20 years at the proposed Cal State University campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds from the "Stand Up for Education" effort will go toward paying for 
spring classes at the Cal State Northridge Ventura Campus, which has been left 
short of funds after the state budget cuts of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising event will culminate Oct. 1 with participants joining hands 
to spell out CSUN-VC at the county fairgrounds for an aerial photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be disappointed if there aren't 1,000 people at the fairgrounds 
standing up for education," Ventura Campus Director Joyce M. Kennedy said. 
"People need to make a political statement on the need for increased access for 
public education in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the county missed its chance for a university at a bluff west of 
Ventura known as the Taylor Ranch. But a new campus is being planned west of 
Camarillo, though it is several years behind the planned Taylor Ranch campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no point in people wringing their hands" over what was lost, she 
said. "The public needs to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser is one of two planned events leading to the Class Act Telethon 
in March. The Ventura Campus also plans a comedy night at Hornblowers at 
Ventura Harbor on Sept. 30 with shows at 8 and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Headliner Bruce Baum will lead the show, with local attorneys Larry Matheney 
and Jim Spencer also taking the stage to help the higher education cause. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to add a name to the time capsule, call the Ventura 
Campus at 654-4575, or send payment to CSUN, Ventura Campus, 2151 Alessandro 
Drive, Suite 140, Ventura 93001. JOANNA M. MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; ANAHEIM RESORT PLAN: QUESTIONS LINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On paper, plans to rejuvenate the area known as the Anaheim Resort look fine: 
lavish landscaping, wide walkways, utility lines below ground, discreet 
commercial signs rather than neon monstrosities (if businesses follow the 
official encouragement). All in all, it would be an improvement over the 
slightly seedy look that now exists in some of the area around Disneyland. 
Still, the city will have to answer questions and objections to its plan -- as 
officials should have realized during the five-hour meeting to discuss the 
proposal two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting ended with the Planning Commission approving the $172-million 
plan. One commissioner aptly noted that the area is heavily dependent on 
tourists, who need to feel they have arrived somewhere nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officers and other business people questioned city officials on who 
will have to pay for the proposed sewer, street and landscaping improvements. 
That is a good question, one that must be answered sooner than later. Even a 
deputy city manager admitted that he was uncomfortable with the vagueness of 
the plan's financing. But it will be up to the City Council to hold public 
hearings and decide who pays what. 
</P>
<P>
 The current proposal envisions an increase in the hotel bed tax from 13% to 
15%, plus federal, state and county funds to help with the financing. 
Developers in the area would also be dunned, based on a formula that remains to 
be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment is a companion to Disney's proposed $3-billion resort, to be 
known as Westcot. There are no guarantees that Disney will actually build the 
resort, but Anaheim nonetheless is smart to do its own planning. Even if the 
expansion falls through, the area around the existing park could stand 
improvement. The city also is wise to consider renovating its Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 If Westcot were built, there would be other problems. Nearly 2,000 new hotel 
rooms would be added, which would attract more low-income workers who will need 
affordable housing -- already in short supply. And local schools rightly noted 
that they would need many more new classrooms for additional students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Resort district includes Disneyland, the Anaheim Convention Center 
and many of the area's big hotels. City officials said the area currently 
brings in between $7 million and $10 million a year in net revenue to the city. 
If all the proposed development goes through, the tally would be likely to 
increase by more than half. Those are dollars worth seeking, so long as the 
questions are answered properly.

SHOP TALK: CAN WORKER WHO QUITS QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it to 
Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or call 
(714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message with your name and where you 
live. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column on Mondays. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Question: My employer is often late paying my salary and on occasion has 
bounced my payroll check. If I quit, am I eligible for unemployment benefits 
until I secure a new job? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Generally, when an employee quits his or her employment, particularly 
without another job, that employee is unqualified for unemployment benefits. To 
quit for "good cause" -- a phrase used in the Unemployment Insurance statute -- 
means "a cause" that would reasonably motivate an average able-bodied and 
qualified worker in a similar situation to give up employment with its wages in 
order to enter the ranks of the compensated unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly appears that you have good cause to leave a job where the 
employer failed to pay your full salary on time. Since the employer has a cash 
flow problem and your salary checks were not paid regularly or fully on a 
number of occasions, you should receive a favorable decision by Unemployment 
Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Please remember that for your claim to be valid there are also specific 
earning requirements that must be satisfied; also there is a limit to the 
maximum number of weeks you can receive unemployment compensation. If your 
decision is to quit, you should file a claim with the unemployment office. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: I was hired by a company in Buena Park as a communications 
technician after leaving prison and was living in a halfway house. The company, 
which hired me to do field work, knew I did not own a vehicle and said it was 
no problem -- that a co-worker could transport me. After a while, I was given a 
company car, but eventually the company said it needed it back and that I would 
have to get my own vehicle. This was at a time when we weren't working a full 
40 hours; I was averaging about three days a week. I need to know what my 
obligations are to an employer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.B., Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is no legal requirement that employers provide vehicles for 
their employees, even if a vehicle is necessary for the performance of the 
employee's duties. Therefore, your company can require you to obtain a vehicle 
as a condition of your continued employment, but they are required by 
California law to reimburse you for your work-related use of that vehicle. 
Usually, this is accomplished via a mileage reimbursement for all miles driven 
on business. 
</P>
<P>
 -- James J. McDonald Jr., attorney, Fisher & Phillips, law instructor, UC 
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I work for a large Orange County employer that has a retirement 
policy where a person can retire at age 50 if they have 10 years of service. My 
job classification was abolished and I was laid off at nine years and seven 
months. Is there any law that prohibits an employer from laying you off when 
you're so close to retirement? 
</P>
<P>
 -- M.H., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) prohibits 
an employer from discharging an employee for the purpose of preventing that 
employee from receiving retirement benefits. Discharging an employee who is 
close to retirement may be evidence of such an improper purpose, but by itself 
would not necessarily be conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 To investigate further, you should probably consult with an attorney who 
specializes in this area. For assistance in finding one, call this Orange 
County Bar Assn.'s Lawyer Referral Service at (714) 835-8811.

Western State University College of Law 
</P>
<P>
 Question: My wife was in an accident. She was employed as a registered nurse 
in a surgical center. The accident occurred in February and she has been 
disabled since then, although she will be able to go back to work this month. 
However, during the time she was off her job was terminated. Is that proper 
procedure? 
</P>
<P>
 -- T.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: An employer generally has no obligation to hold an employee's job 
during his or her disability. If the employer is an "at will" employee, i.e. 
can be terminated without cause, then the employer is free to terminate the 
position at any time. If, however, the employer-employee relationship is one 
where termination can only be for "cause" then it is necessary to inquire as to 
the reasons for the job termination. Poor performance, misconduct, absenteeism, 
inability to perform the job, financial distress and other business reasons 
would constitute "cause." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, termination because of discrimination based upon race, color, 
gender, religion, national origin, age and disability where the person 
otherwise would be able to perform the job with reasonable accommodation could 
be considered illegal. Whether or not her termination was proper requires 
asking the employer the reason for the termination. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thomas M. Apke, attorney, professor of business law, Cal State Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Question: My husband works for a large company that makes its employees make 
up the time they take off for national holidays. Workers don't get the choice 
of working the holiday either. How cheap can a company get? Have you heard this 
before? 
</P>
<P>
 -- R.L., Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Companies are allowed to prohibit work on a national holiday, to pay 
compensation for the holiday and require employees to make up the time later. 
They are restricted however, as to how the work is to be made up. 
</P>
<P>
 The employer cannot require a non-exempt employee to work more than eight 
hours in any day or more than 40 hours in any week, along with other 
requirements, without paying appropriate overtime compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempt employees have flexibility in work schedule requirements to meet 
productivity requirements of the employer. To the extent that an employer 
requires an exempt employee to make up time missed on one day on another or 
give credit on one day for excess time worked on another, the exempt status may 
be destroyed. As a result, the employer may have to comply with all of the 
rules for non-exempt status, including overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 If an employee is not able to make up the time on a Saturday or a Sunday 
because of religious beliefs, or family care commitments, the employer must 
reasonably accommodate such concerns to avoid legal liability. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don D. Sessions, employee rights attorney, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I read a story that suggested that even if you feel secure in your 
job that you should take additional training (college courses or vocational 
programs) to make yourself more marketable in the event of an unexpected 
layoff. How should you go about deciding what to study? And how can you afford 
it if your current employer doesn't have a tuition reimbursement program? 
</P>
<P>
 -- T.D., Sunset Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Continued self-improvement, whether it be personal improvement or 
job-skill development, is always a good idea. Increasing job-related skills or 
knowledge not only increases your marketability as a potential worker, but it 
can also enhance your value to your current employer (perhaps even making it 
less likely that you would be laid off). 
</P>
<P>
 In order to determine a course of study, do a personal "skill assessment." Ask 
yourself: What skills do I lack, or which could use updating? (Computer skills 
are often a good area for training or retraining, given that technology and 
software evolves rapidly). What kinds of skills are critical for the 
performance of my job, and how can these be enhanced? How can I broaden myself 
to increase my present marketability as an employee?  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to evaluating your training needs, look into the types of training 
programs available through public institutions of higher learning, federally 
subsidized training programs and through professional and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Although continuing education through the regular programs offered by 
community colleges, the Cal State University and University of California 
systems costs money, higher education in California is still quite a bargain. 
Regular students in California state colleges and universities pay only a small 
portion of the cost of the education they receive. Extended education programs 
through the universities, although more costly, are still quite affordable, and 
if they enhance your work-related skills they are cost-effective in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Riggio, professor of industrial psychology, Cal State Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Question: My previous employer, which was a private company, made yearly 
contributions to an Employee Stock Ownership Program. I left the company last 
year and asked for a distribution to my new retirement program, since my last 
ESOP statement received in 1991 showed a significant value. However, I was told 
that the company had incurred significant debt and therefore the company -- and 
my ESOP account -- had little or no worth. Consequently, the ESOP administrator 
said that no new financial statements would be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 When I contacted the Department of Labor's pension benefits department, I was 
told that the government is unable to force distributions from such qualified 
retirement programs. Can a qualified retirement program like an ESOP really be 
manipulated by company owners? 
</P>
<P>
 -- K.B., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No. The persons who operate an Employee Stock Ownership Plan are 
"fiduciaries," which means that they must operate the plan solely for the 
benefit of plan participants. If fiduciaries manipulate or use an ESOP for any 
other purpose, or if they mismanage the ESOP, they can be held liable for any 
losses that results. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the fiduciaries of an ESOP normally would not be 
responsible for a loss that the plan incurs from mismanagement of the company 
itself that causes a loss in the value of the stock unless they imprudently 
failed to take steps that were within their power that would have minimized or 
prevented the loss. The Department of Labor, by the way, can bring lawsuits to 
recover ESOP benefits for participants. Because of limited resources, however, 
it rarely does.

in our latest exciting contest!" the Enquirer says. Insurance Image Adjuster 
</P>
<P>
 Forget last night's Emmy Awards for excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 The real drama is a contest by Woodland Hills insurance agent Hank Frazee -- 
celebrating his 11th year in the business -- to find the five people who have 
done the most to hurt the image of insurance agents and investments advisers 
and those who improved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazee's winner is Orange County dentist William Clark. His answers included 
the financial advisers to Los Angeles Kings President Bruce McNall, now in 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, President Clinton's health advisers and 
financial advisers to baseball's owners. On the positive side, Clark nominated 
insurance agents who handled the recent brush fires and earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For being the winner, Clark gets a San Fernando Valley limousine tour, a 
subscription to Life Assn. News, a five-minute cellular phone chat with the 
chief executive of Connecticut Mutual Life and a round of golf with Frazee and 
his accountant. Turkey Keeping Abreast 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's recent bankruptcy filing has attracted the interest of numerous 
creditors, but now even a foreign government is monitoring it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republic of Turkey has filed papers requesting to be kept up-to-date on 
the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Spiegler, a lawyer representing Turkey, said that officials there just 
want to stay on top of McNall's bankruptcy because of some past dealing with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he said, Turkey back in 1988 had a McNall company return some 
ancient coins scheduled for an auction that the country claimed had been taken 
out of the company improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegler added that Turkey has not filed any claim to McNall assets. Briefly. 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Good reason to justify the trip: An upcoming California Assn. of Realtors 
trade show has scheduled a seminar on "How to Get More out of Attending a Trade 
Show." . . . More on seminar topics: A recent UFO show near the Los Angeles 
International Airport featured as a topic "New Evidence for a Bigfoot/UFO 
Connection." . . . An ad for a Portland office building reads, "It's not the 
Trump Tower, but then you're not Trump."

HOT JOBS: WAITRESS MAKES THE GUEST FEEL AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tamara Rawles became a waitress 15 years ago to put herself through school in 
Michigan. "The money was good and I liked the people, so I decided to stay," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 years ago, she came to California and began working at Tutto Mare in 
Fashion Island. About the clientele, she said: "We have lots of repeat 
customers, and I enjoy making them feel special. That's something I learned 
from our manager, Claudio Arena. He says the Italian approach is to make 
customers feel like they are guests in your home." 
</P>
<P>
 Rawles arrives at work at about 11 a.m. during the week to help prepare for 
the lunch crowd. "It's busy from noon to about 2, and then it slows down a 
little," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rawles, working as a waitress means learning about food and wine. "We have 
food tastings every month so the staff knows each dish on the menu. When we add 
a new wine to the wine list, we have wine tastings. This helps when I'm 
serving, because most people ask for guidance when ordering wine and I'm able 
to help." OCCUPATION: Waitress 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Serving food and beverages at restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most have at least a high school education. Restaurants 
often provide on-the-job training. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of waiters and waitresses in the county is 
expected to increase 6.3%, to 22,690. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $22,000-$26,000 per year for full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Flexible hours and good pay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Job requires standing through most of a shift. Must also be able to 
handle customer requests and complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Waiters and waitresses may advance to restaurant managerial 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "Extra effort pays off in terms of repeat customers and tips. Making 
them comfortable is very important. People like to be treated special." --

</P>
<P>
 * Flip-flops much faster on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * His doughy white thighs have a blush of pink to them now. 
</P>
<P>
 * Already finished with his '96 concession speech.

 Comedy writer Mark Miller, on Sen. Bob Packwood's 62nd birthday, Sunday: "In a 
touching display of affection, each of the women he's sexually harassed chipped 
in and got him a gold-plated restraining order."

<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills reports that when Dan Quayle was asked why he 
considers "family values" so important, the ex-veep replied: "It's very 
valuable to be born into a rich one." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on news that the average adult has put on eight pounds 
since 1980: "What do you say to someone who's gained weight because of all his 
bad habits? Nice to see you, Mr. President ." 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Argus Hamilton, on Sen. George Mitchell's health plan: "The medical 
coverage is about what you'd expect from a compromise. If you lose an arm or 
leg, two guys from Washington will come out and help you look for it." 
</P>
<P>

 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on reports of rifts between O.J. lawyers Johnnie 
Cochran and Robert Shapiro: "The first signs came at a recent press conference, 
where the two men stood next to each other both wearing 'I'm With Stupid' 
T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 After a private screening of "Quiz Show," a new movie about his large role in 
the 1950s game show scandals, Charles Van Doren called it "terrific . . . a top 
contender at Oscar time." Peyser reports that "he later admitted he hadn't seen 
the movie, was paid by the producers to praise it and was given answers to 
reporters' questions beforehand." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, on scientists showing videos of mating apes to two gorillas to help them 
procreate: "Results are mixed. They are not interested in each other, but they 
both know how to work the VCR's rewind."

THE LOVELIEST LADIES IN HADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Faust" audiences have a hard act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, the heroine rolls around on the floor in a tiara and so many pounds 
of jewelry that it looks as if she pulled the Tiffany's heist. Satan cuts a 
dashing figure in long hair, a cutaway with tails, tight pants and thigh-high 
leather boots that could do justice to the most notorious playboys hanging out 
at The Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 While the audience on Friday may not have been quite as showy as all that, the 
opening event of the opera season is still among the city's best-dressed nights 
of the year, proving that we don't need a billion TV viewers to put on our 
finest garb. 
</P>
<P>
 The decade-long spell of all-black clothes appeared to be broken by the gala 
invitation suggesting red. Out came a crimson tide of velvet, chiffon and 
satin. Those women who chose the safety of black often did it in a new way -- 
long columns (done with either slender dresses or separates) spiced up with 
some kind of interesting accessory, such as a turban, a long antique scarf or 
sheer voluminous ball skirt. The mix included equal shares of short and long, 
with only a handful of women going for full-on ball gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The night's best dressed included Patricia Kennedy in a one-of-a-kind 
stained-glass dress by Hubert de Givenchy; Nancy Olson Livingston in a coral 
Bill Blass column with '40s coral brooch; Beverly Todd in a Donna Karan dress 
and on the arm of Robert Guillaume; Eileen Zimmerman in a treasured red and 
black suit by the late Travilla, and Annette O'Malley in a new fall Chanel 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally elegant were a few who picked up fashions that didn't require a pact 
with Mephistopheles to afford. Diane Ferguson found her Pamela Dennis slip 
dress at Neiman Marcus' Last Call sale. Christina Kim bought a long Carole 
Little with ivory scarf at The Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 A few men gussied up their tuxes with devil-may-care touches; in the case of 
Paul Erskine, that meant a red tie with black polka-dots and matching 
cummerbund. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell was spotted re-pinning a woman's ruby brooch to 
a more complementary place on her lapel, and heard to whisper "next time wear 
real" in her ear.  
</P>
<P>
 But wearing fake jewelry wasn't the biggest faux pas of the night, Blackwell 
said later. "Women need to get out of those ugly leather shoes when they go out 
at night," he said, discreetly nodding toward a woman in ungainly office flats. 
"They should get into evening shoes and heels. And learn how to walk."

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; DEVIL-MAY-CARE GALA IGNITES OPERA SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Event: Hellfire, damnation and the worst of the summer heat were banished 
in style as the Los Angeles Music Center Opera opened its eighth season with a 
new production of Gounod's "Faust." The performance was followed by a gala 
benefit dinner on the Music Center plaza, where guests danced to the big-band 
music of Rudy Varon. Five hundred gala patron subscribers and others paid $650 
to attend the event, benefiting the Opera. They partied with the care-free 
innocence of the just, lingering long after the musicians and the caterers 
closed up shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather Forecast: Opening night of the Opera traditionally launches the fall 
social season. For most in attendance, the evening's performance was a 
delightful way to send off both the devil and the hellishly hot summer, 
although a few reluctant husbands seemed to view the milestone the way most 
schoolchildren see Labor Day. "My husband said no! But then he didn't fall 
asleep once," laughed Nancy Olson Livingstone, who was nominated for an Academy 
Award for her role in 1950's "Sunset Boulevard" and is now married to Alan 
Livingstone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mood: Is it fair to call "Faust" the "Natural Born Killers" of opera? L.A. 
society seems to find solace in this tale of the saved and the damned: The 
sense of catharsis was palpable as the audience floated dreamily across the 
plaza. "It's interesting that this opera used to be so popular, and then went 
out of fashion," said Patricia Mitchell, deputy general director of the Opera 
and one of many sirens who turned out in drop-dead red. "I think it's back now 
because it's all right to be that emotional again." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Pavillion Catering wisely chose to depart from the evening's red theme, 
providing delicate fare that would not prevent one from passing through the eye 
of a needle, including veal-stuffed free-range chicken followed by white 
chocolate and macadamia nut ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Co-chairs Alice Coulombe and Peggy Parker Grauman were joined 
by General Director Peter Hemmings and his wife, Jane; Chairman of the Board 
Bernard Greenberg and his wife, Lennie; Vice-Chairman Warner Henry and his 
wife, Carol; and board members Roy and Lila Ash, David and Kay Ingalls, Tara 
Colburn and Flora L. Thornton. Also in attendance were Caroline Ahmanson, actor 
Robert Guillaume, actress Beverly Todd, L.A. Rams owner Georgia Frontiere, and 
Ardis Cranwick of the Chicago Lyric Opera, which co-produced "Faust." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: From board member Carol Warner: "I've heard that wine and beer song on 
just about every compilation of opera drinking arias there is." Happily for us, 
the well-rounded Mrs. Warner is in charge of special events.

TOUCHING TALE OF TENACIOUS HUMAN SPIRIT; BOND OF IRON: MASTER AND SLAVE AT 
BUFFALO FORGE BY CHARLES B. DEW ; W.W. NORTON & CO. $27.50, 429 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abrilliant biologist can look at a drop of pond water through a powerful 
microscope and see the building blocks of life. An intuitive archeologist sifts 
through Anatolian detritus and reconstructs the daily life of Troy.  
</P>
<P>
 And Charles Dew, who holds an endowed chair in American history at Williams 
College, can painstakingly examine the crabbed handwriting of ledgers found at 
a backwater ironworks in antebellum Virginia and bring to touching, disturbing 
light aspects of the complex economic and emotional relationships that existed 
between slave and master. 
</P>
<P>
 The product of many years of detailed research, "Bond of Iron" accomplishes 
the seemingly impossible: Not only does it portray the turbulent interactions 
of ambitious, sometimes ruthless, sometimes unexpectedly humane -- relatively 
speaking, of course -- white people, but it gives equal space, and great 
poignancy, to individual African Americans and extended generations of their 
families during a period, in the Old South, when they were cruelly defined as 
mere property. 
</P>
<P>
 That Dew manages this feat at all is remarkable; that he pulls it off in the 
absence of any extensive diaries or personal journals is testimony to the 
quality both of his prose and of his rare ability to penetrate the available 
facts -- who spent what on whom, when -- and find the only possible story that 
explains them. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of this long, thorough book is the complicated character of 
William Weaver, son of an antislavery Pennsylvania family, who came to Virginia 
in the early 19th Century. Through will and ambition -- and slavery -- he 
established a lucrative regional iron-making empire. A man with more enemies 
than friends, a person from whom one would want every detail of a contract in 
boldface print, Weaver eventually operated two charcoal-fired blast furnaces 
and two forges for the production of bar iron. 
</P>
<P>
 He owned 70 slaves outright and annually hired from other owners more than 100 
more, men and women who held virtually every job in the operation after white 
sub-management employees uniformly proved themselves to be unreliable or less 
proficient. In effect, Weaver's business created a mostly unpaid labor force of 
highly skilled artisans, their talents and expertise passed down from parent to 
child.  
</P>
<P>
 The evidence suggests that Weaver recognized their value and the advantage of, 
within the tight confines of the system, positively encouraging their 
cooperation as opposed to coercing it.  
</P>
<P>
 He assigned people to key jobs only after ascertaining their "voluntary 
consent" and willingness to apprentice themselves to experienced craftsmen, and 
"there is no indication that Weaver ever whipped one of his slave forge workers 
at any time during his forty years in the Valley." Instead, he followed a 
policy known as paid overwork, a practice whereby a slave could earn cash or 
store credit by performing above and beyond the average weekly expectation of 
output.  
</P>
<P>
 Careful accounts of this accumulated capital were kept and, more than 150 
years later, these records have enabled Dew to make highly educated guesses as 
to the daily lives and loves of people who not only survived an inhumane 
bondage, but found within its nooks and crannies the wherewithal to assert 
their devotion and loyalty to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 We read of the expenditure of $2 for a length of calico, of $5 for Christmas 
gifts for children, of $12 for wedding clothes, of sugar and coffee for aged 
parents -- money accumulated penny by penny through backbreaking toil measured 
by the ton and done after 12-hour workdays or on Sundays, and it speaks of 
generosity and kindness beyond any largess showered by the wealthy.  
</P>
<P>
 Tracing purchases made over a lifetime, Dew is able to discover the 
personalities of individual African Americans -- loving spouses, grieving 
children, devoted friends, small acts of grace that shine like diamonds in the 
blanket of silence imposed by oppression and exploitation.  
</P>
<P>
 "Slavery," Dew writes, "was inherently a brutalization of the human mind and 
spirit. . . . The overwork system acted to minimize the use of force at Buffalo 
Forge, and thus is served well the needs of the master. But it also served the 
needs of the slaves, for they took the system and used it to enhance the 
quality of their own lives in ways Weaver probably could never imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Dew's capable tutelage -- and what a teacher he must be! -- the 
unexpected dances on the page, correcting our stereotypes, deepening our 
understanding of social life and of the enduring tenacity of the human spirit 
under the most trying of circumstances, informing us of a time and place long 
denied a voice but that, once released, speaks both to the mind and to the 
heart.

THE 46TH ANNUAL EMMY AWARDS; THE SHOW: A CRITIC'S VIEW; BIG WINS FOR 'FENCES'

 There are so many awards telecasts that they congeal in your mind. Sunday 
night was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Statuettes, acceptances, self-congratulations, jokes, yadda yadda yadda. You 
knew it wasn't the Oscars, the Tonys or the Grammys, though, when the 
off-camera announcer dramatically proclaimed: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen, Heather Locklear!" 
</P>
<P>
 And when the show's 1993-94 highlight reel included that great kidder Bobcat 
Goldthwait torching part of Jay Leno's set. 
</P>
<P>
 And a sweet tribute to actress Jessica Tandy, who had died earlier that day, 
was immediately followed by a Coke commercial featuring a swimming elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was the Emmys, as always a telecast as uneven as the medium that it 
celebrates, as always giving "this thing called television" -- as TV academy 
president Rich Frank described it -- a chance to pat itself on the back once 
more. It was a mocking Jerry Seinfeld who perfectly captured the tone of all 
awards programs, calling the Emmys "a chance to say congratulations to us on 
another year's job well done." 
</P>
<P>
 At least most of the self-love was relatively unpretentious. And for the 
second consecutive year, in fact, the ABC telecast from the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium was much more lovable than lamentable, three generally rewarding 
hours whose success was due largely to executive producer Don Mischer and his 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to past Emmys telecasts, there was no over-staging of production 
numbers, nothing to detract from Bette Midler's swell form in belting out her 
signature song from "Gypsy," nothing to overwhelm the refreshing light humor of 
Jason Alexander's parody of series theme songs from "All in the Family" to "The 
Brady Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two co-hosts, "Home Improvement" star Patricia Richardson was all 
right, but clearly this wasn't her thing. "Ellen" star Ellen DeGeneres, on the 
other hand, was fresh and funny behind her mobile mike, at one point surfacing 
in the ABC control room and directing camera shots, another time showing up in 
the Emmys press room as winner Michael Richards of "Seinfeld" was being 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, mocking public television pledge drives, she implored viewers who wanted 
to keep the Emmys going to "call the number on the screen, and please, please 
give generously." Unlike some stand-up comics who appear on awards shows, 
moreover, DeGeneres knew not only when to joke, but also when to shut up and 
emcee. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other bits of humor in the telecast. Gathering herself for her 
close-up, Emmy winner Faye Dunaway declared to America: "I'm here to tell you: 
This town has a heart." If that wasn't funny enough, Emmy winner David 
Letterman topped it a little later by asking: "Is she talking about Hollywood, 
or is she talking about Pasadena?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the evening's jokes were better unsaid, however. That included 
envelope-opening Jay Leno hoping "O.J.'s knife" wouldn't fall out. And another 
presenter, Garry Shandling, cracked a joke about a joke about Tom and Roseanne 
that was so raunchy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How raunchy? 
</P>
<P>
 So raunchy that Roseanne herself laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other failures was a segment on TV's Invasion of Stand-Up Comics. It 
didn't begin to convey the multitudes heading their own sitcoms, to say nothing 
of their impact on contemporary TV comedy. And speaking of misfires, it was 
Jeff Greenfield, one of the brightest lights of ABC News, of all people, who 
was just boggling in his role as the telecast's official sage and Ethical 
Conscience of Television, decrying the medium's excess of tabloid-style 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many of those pictures are we going to splash across the screen before we 
begin to demean the audience and cheapen this remarkable medium?" he asked. 
Greenfield didn't seem to know himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He did know how to take a time cue, though, and he left the stage, leaving us 
to wonder why he'd been deployed in the first place and whether his words were 
an indication of ABC's intent to turn down the heat on the O.J. story and other 
sensational crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't have to contemplate long, for at a subsequent commercial break, 
there was Diane Sawyer promoting her next interview on ABC's "PrimeTime Live": 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, Nicole Brown Simpson's family speaks out!" 
</P>
<P>
 I'm here to tell you: This network has a heart.

THE 46TH ANNUAL EMMY AWARDS; THE SCENE: BACKSTAGE SPIN; BIG WINS FOR 'FENCES' 
LEAVE 'NYPD' BLUE; CBS SHOW GETS SEVERAL KEY AWARDS, INCLUDING BEST DRAMA, BUT 
BEST ACTOR GOES TO FRANZ. 
</P>

<P>
 The small town beat up on the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its record-setting 26 nominations and more controversy and publicity 
than you could shake a nightstick at, ABC's gritty police drama "NYPD Blue" had 
much of its thunder stolen at the 46th annual nighttime Emmy Awards on Sunday 
by "Picket Fences," the quirky drama about the fictional town of Rome, Wis. The 
CBS entry was named best drama series and also won for best supporting actress 
and actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had a chance," "Picket Fences" creator and executive producer 
David E. Kelley told reporters backstage at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. "We 
knew we had good competition. If we were to believe everything we read and 
heard, we would have been sensible to predict 'NYPD Blue.' But the only thing 
we knew going in was that all the episodes had to be screened and looked at, 
and we knew if the panel sat in the room and watched 'NYPD Blue' and 'Picket 
Fences,' we would do well." 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the best drama award, Kelley beat out his former boss, "NYPD Blue" 
co-creator Steven Bochco, who also co-created the acclaimed "L.A. Law," giving 
Kelley his start as a television writer and then turning the show over to him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second year in a row that "Picket Fences" scored a surprise victory 
in the drama series category despite lackluster ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of hoped it would give us a big kick-start last season and our 
ratings would improve," Kelley said. "We would hope that will be compounded 
this year. With two Emmys, we hope people will stay home Friday nights and 
watch us. It's a difficult time slot." 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" still came out the biggest winner of the night with six Emmys, and 
probably the most eagerly applauded award was Dennis Franz winning as best 
actor in a drama series for his coarse police detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the show, Franz walked into the press room clutching his Emmy and 
said, "What a shocker. Big surprise, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Franz's co-star, David Caruso, who is leaving "NYPD Blue" in a controversial 
salary dispute, had been the favorite. "I thought David would win," Franz said. 
"I thought the ball was in his court." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to his show's loss to "Picket Fences," the actor said, "This is a 
bittersweet night. There were so many nominations, and there were certain ones 
we thought were shoo-ins. The show, we thought, was pretty much a lock. We 
expected to win that. But I told ("Picket Fences" co-star) Kathy Baker that, if 
we were going to lose, 'We would rather lose to your show.' It is a 
disappointment, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz would not speculate on whether Caruso's decision to leave the series -- 
made shortly before voting on the Emmys took place -- might have had a backlash 
effect with the judges. "That's hard to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz has been supportive of Caruso with the news media, but he did not thank 
his co-star in his onstage acceptance speech. That was an oversight, he said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot to thank the entire cast, if you want to know the truth," he 
explained. "I'll show you the (note) card. (Caruso's name) was on the card. I 
sort of skipped over that one, and I feel bad about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Former "L.A. Law" star Jimmy Smits has been cast to replace Caruso after four 
episodes this season. When Ann Biderman stepped backstage after picking up an 
Emmy for writing an episode of "NYPD Blue," she was asked if she was writing 
the script introducing Smits and, if not, whether she could reveal how he will 
be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not, and no, I can't," she responded coyly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer spoke for the cast and crew of the show, which 
won as best comedy series, in saying he was pleased: "It's flattering. 
Sometimes it feels like it's deserved. You work a lifetime trying to get 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Emmys for him and the show will result in greater expectations 
before the comedy's much-touted move to Tuesday nights, where it is pitted 
against ABC's "Home Improvement," the No. 1 show on TV, Grammer said, "Well, it 
couldn't hurt. I'm sure NBC will take every opportunity it can to plaster the 
news all over. This will keep a lot of people at the network busy. But I think 
we would hold up in whatever time slot we were in." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Casey, one of "Frasier's" executive producers, commented on the move 
when he came backstage to accept his Emmy for outstanding writing in a comedy 
series. "We don't really have a whole lot to say in the matter," he said. "So 
we're just going to go in with the best show we can produce, and do the things 
that have made it a pretty popular series to this point." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kirstie Alley, who beat out the favorite, Bette Midler, as best actress in a 
miniseries or movie for her role in the CBS film "David's Mother," had to live 
down some notoriety when she stepped backstage. A reporter asked what her 
husband would say now, referring to the fact that when Alley won an Emmy in 
1991 for her role on "Cheers," she joked about her husband, actor Parker 
Stevenson, giving her "the big one." 
</P>
<P>
 "He will probably say thank you, and to keep my mouth shut," she said with a 
laugh. "He's never been quite the same. He's never been looked at the same, 
I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone hoping for Alley to turn up on "Frasier" -- a "Cheers" spinoff -- as 
Rebecca, the character she played on "Cheers," may be in for a long wait, she 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think at some point you have to pretend like you have another job," said 
Alley, who is getting ready to star in a movie for horror director John 
Carpenter. "Those women on the show are so wonderful -- they really are -- and 
fresh. We're not," she said, referring to the former "Cheers" barflies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Spelling said his award for producing "And the Band Played On" was the 
culmination of 4 1/2 years of difficult work. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why he took on the project when he is known for lighter fare, such 
as "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Melrose Place," he said, "There were too many 
friends that were dying, too many friends who had died of AIDS, having a young 
daughter and son," and to get out the truth that "AIDS is not a homophobic 
disease. That is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "The band is playing on, and Washington hasn't done a damn thing 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Miller didn't seem to be in a mood to take any shots at Tribune 
Entertainment or those who canceled his syndicated talk show two years ago. And 
unlike his caustic demeanor on HBO's "Dennis Miller Live," which won for best 
writing for a variety or music program, Miller was relatively subdued.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get into any (stuff) about whether I feel vindicated or not," 
he said backstage, flanked by his fellow writers, who shared the award with 
him. "You do feel screwed for a while. But it's nice to have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that his show will return on HBO this fall, and the big change is "I 
got rid of all my body hair" while it was on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Candice Bergen was genuinely flustered backstage after winning her fourth Emmy 
for best actress in a comedy series for "Murphy Brown." She was listing off all 
the people she didn't thank -- CBS, the producers, her co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually prepare something in case I win, but I was sure it was going to be 
Helen Hunt for 'Mad About You,' " Bergen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Letterman, whose late-night show on CBS was named best comedy, variety 
or music series, had kind words for Madonna, who caused a ruckus on his program 
with her coarse language. They appeared together at the MTV Video Music Awards 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She called me on Thursday and asked if I would go with her to the awards," 
Letterman said. "She was very nice and very pleasant about it and, other than 
the other 98.9% of the show, I really enjoyed myself." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Manchurian Candidate" director John Frankenheimer had never won an Emmy, 
despite being nominated six years in a row from 1955 to 1960. He revived his 
directing career this year on cable television, and he finally broke through 
for a golden statuette with the HBO prison drama "Against the Wall," about the 
Attica prison uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a great feeling," he said. But he noted that after directing for 40 
years, "It has never gotten easier. It's harder now because I don't want to 
repeat myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenheimer's latest film, "The Burning Season," starring Raul Julia as 
murdered Brazilian activist Chico Mendes, premieres Saturday on HBO. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Michael Richards, who scored a best supporting actor award for "Seinfeld," 
said he felt strange beating co-star Jason Alexander for the second year in a 
row: "I think he should have one of these. Everyone on the show should have one 
of these." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his silent acceptance speech, he explained, "I was blown. I didn't 
think I would win. The clock was going by so quickly, and there were so many 
people to thank."

APPRECIATION; JESSICA TANDY: SHE WAS JUST WHO SHE WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If they ever get this time travel thing down and we could attend three 
performances, here's what I'd see: Richard Burbage's Hamlet, Barbra Streisand's 
Fanny Brice and Jessica Tandy's Blanche DuBois, the last of which made the 
actress a star in this country and, later, a legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy didn't get to preserve her 1947 role on film because another British 
actress, Vivien Leigh, was fated to play out the saga of an aging Southern 
belle for all time in the 1951 movie. But Tandy's performance in the Tennessee 
Williams play -- which inspired Brooks Atkinson to write, "It does seem almost 
incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and 
that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, 
revealing and true" -- somehow has made itself felt throughout the decades even 
by people who can only imagine it. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the death Sunday in Connecticut at age 85 of this incomparable 
actress, we will continue to imagine it. The reason we can imagine it is that 
so many of Tandy's performances have been graceful and seamless. Onstage she 
often seemed to touch perfection, notably in the last decade as the Appalachian 
widow who momentarily recalls the euphoric courtship of her youth in "Foxfire." 
</P>
<P>
 Youth was something she never lost. On film she demonstrated how a seemingly 
selfish elderly woman could learn and achieve surprising compassion in "Driving 
Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. Offstage, she aged so gracefully in a youth-oriented culture and 
business that she was an inspiration simply to look at. No plastic surgery, no 
vanity -- she was just who she was. To her great credit, she always seemed 
straightforward and plain-speaking, despite her film stardom and the fact that 
she played opposite some of the greatest actors of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 By the age of 31, she had appeared with Laurence Olivier in "Twelfth Night" 
and "Henry V," and with John Gielgud in "Hamlet" and "King Lear." When she 
moved to this country from London in 1940, she became associated with the work 
of some of our greatest and most popular modern playwrights, including 
Williams, Edward Albee, as well as with Peter Shaffer and Samuel Beckett. With 
her husband, actor Hume Cronyn, she also graced the plays (such as "The Gin 
Game") of lesser-known authors who would certainly never have gotten to 
Broadway without America's premier acting couple.  
</P>
<P>
 Offstage, her 52-year marriage to Cronyn seemed to glow with an enviable, 
quiet contentment. Tandy was that unusual great actress whose private life 
appears to have been as rich and rewarding as her public one. 
</P>
<P>
 Having come somewhat late on the scene, my memories of her onstage are 
somewhat limited. In fact, the last time I saw Tandy was in 1983 in a Broadway 
revival of Williams' "The Glass Menagerie." British director John Dexter 
supplied what seemed to me a textbookish production that respected the play's 
reputation as a masterpiece without proving it definitively. As Amanda 
Wingfield, Tandy struck me as too cold. I now believe I didn't have the 
maturity to understand what I was seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet her performance somehow stayed with me -- several years later I dreamed of 
it. That is the kind of legacy she leaves, a truly theatrical one, ephemeral 
and yet as powerful as a dream.

ART MOVEMENT WITH A HOLLYWOOD BACKDROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's part of Tinseltown lore: Aspiring actors waiting on tables while striving 
toward stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, however, the arrangement was reversed, at least as far as 
severalfine artists of the '30s and '40s were concerned: They took work in 
Hollywood to support their true calling. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gibson, one of the so-called California Regionalists who painted 
thepristine natural beauty around them, also created scenic backdrops at MGM 
for nearly 36 years, putting in six days a week at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It put a big crimp in my artistic activities in the '30s," Gibson -- whoturns 
90 next month -- said recently. "But I still managed to paint and get 
exhibited." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson and artists like him are the focus of "Visions of California: TheStory 
of California Scene Painting," an original three-part series produced by KOCE 
Channel 50 in Huntington Beach. It is being shown tonight, Tuesday and 
Wednesday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The era of the Great Depression and World War II offered plenty of subject 
matter for Gibson, Millard Sheets, Phil Dike, Barse Miller and Rex Brandt and 
the rest, who turned out mostly representational views of burly surfers, 
rolling hills, tenement life, flophouses or dead soldiers. The KOCE series is 
something of a narrated gallery tour of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone from his home in Morro Bay, Gibson -- one of several artists, 
collectors, curators and art historians interviewed in the series -- recalled 
that Hollywood's need for representational artists was his ace in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motion pictures never dealt with anything but utter realism, and I was 
already painting what was practically utter realism," said the native of 
Edinburgh, Scotland, who resume includes backdrops for "The Wizard of Oz" and 
"Brigadoon." He worked for MGM from 1934 through 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a preference for "well-defined outlines" over "realistic detail" 
was helping other artists find animation work at the Walt Disney Studios, 
according to Susan M. Anderson, the acting director of the Laguna Art Museum 
who appears in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 In "American Scene Painting: California, 1930s & 1940s," a related 
publication, Anderson noted that "the artists were also masters of 
characterization and the depiction of action or movement. Phil Dike's 'Echo 
Park' (1935) personifies the happy, clean-up world of American life that Disney 
loved to portray." 
</P>
<P>
 One way or another, Hollywood helped greatly to support these painters who in 
turn, according to the series, helped California move "from the margins to the 
mainstream of American art." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson says he was well aware of the impact he and his contemporaries were 
making. "We were developing something that was essentially a California 
creation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Visions of California: The Story of California Scene Painting" was produced, 
written and directed by Paul Bockhorst, who has produced such other KOCE 
projects as "Architects of Change" (1992) and "Orange County Centennial 
Snapshots" (1989). It will be made available to public television stations 
nationwide later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Visions of California: The Story of California Scene Painting," a 
three-part series, is being shown on KOCE Channel 50 today, Tuesday and 
Wednesday at 8 p.m. It will repeat Sept. 19, 26 and Oct. 3 at 9 p.m. A related 
exhibition opens Wednesday and will continue through Nov. 12 at the Irvine 
Museum, 18881 Von Karmen Ave., Irvine. 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through 
Saturdays. Free. (714) 476-2565.

VINNIE JAMES LOOKS TO A HIGHER CALLING; MUSIC: THE SINGER-SONGWRITER CHANGES 
HIS NAME AND COURSE; FROM NOW ON HE'S KNOWN AS MASADA AND THE BEAT IS CHRISTIAN

 Vinnie James, the singer-songwriter from Orange County who was praised by 
critics for his debut album in 1991, is back with a new nom de rock and a new 
direction: He will be known as Masada on his next album, which is geared for 
the Christian rock market. 
</P>
<P>
 The almost-completed record, due early next year, will be called "No More 
Plastic Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real raw," said James, who debuted with "All American Boy," a tough, 
heartland-rocking album on RCA Records, then tried to smooth out his sound -- 
something he now says was a mistake -- on a follow-up album that never was 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 James said he hadn't considered working in the Christian market until last 
spring, when he was approached by Thom Roy, an executive at Frontline, a 
Christian label based in Newport Beach. At the time, James was thinking about 
putting his musical career on the back burner after a long, unsuccessful 
attempt to land a new record deal in the secular market. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing from a spiritual point of view isn't new, James said: "It's one thing 
that's always been part of my life. I sang in the choir" as a boy growing up in 
New Jersey. "I've always believed in God and trusted in God for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, at first he resisted the idea of making a Christian album, but 
eventually told Roy, "'I'm going to see if God gives me some songs for this 
record, see if I'm inspired to write this kind of music.' The songs started 
flowing. We cut the record, and it's very good." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Masada was the mountaintop fortress in Judea where the Zealots, a Jewish sect, 
committed mass suicide rather than surrender to an overwhelming Roman force in 
73 AD, ending the first Jewish revolt against Roman rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a sappy Christian record by any means," said Michael Black, vice 
president and general manager of Frontline. "It's kind of biting. I think we'll 
get some controversy on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides pushing the record through customary Christian pop outlets, Black 
said, the label plans to pitch James/Masada's album to secular stations in the 
Adult Album Alternative format.

THE 46TH ANNUAL EMMY AWARDS; THE LOOK: WHAT THEY WORE; SCATTERSHOT GLAMOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressing for the Emmy Awards is no easy feat. For one thing, the Pasadena 
event lands on a seasonal cusp -- not quite fall but no longer summer. And 
there's the gnawing awareness that, hey, it's only the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere between the down-home style of the Rotary Club banquet and the 
glitzy heights of the Oscars lies the right look. The winners of Sunday night's 
best dressed awards left their opera gloves at home and the beauty contest 
hair, well, to beauty contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 In her short black suit, her perfectly cut hair glistening, Emmy winner Leigh 
Taylor-Young made her younger peers look positively vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
 Other exquisite minimalists included Armani-clad Helen Hunt, Marlo Thomas in 
Vera Wang, and Michelle Pfeiffer, sparkling on husband David E. Kelley's arm, 
also in Armani. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, the evening's most striking style moment occurred when the sisters 
from "Sisters" took the stage -- Swoosie Kurtz, Patricia Kalember and Julianne 
Phillips (the good girls), all in white, bad-girl Sela Ward dressed in black. 
(Ward later waltzed off with an Emmy, so we guess nice girls do finish last.) 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of bad girls, Roseanne continued to show the world her, uh, shapely 
legs, this time in an itty-bitty skating dress. Her soft and subtle hair and 
makeup were improvements, though, over the Liz-Taylor-on-a-bad-day look she 
wore for last week's MTV Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other gals who seemed in search of a style, any style. The show's 
co-hosts, Patricia Richardson and Ellen DeGeneres, started off the evening 
dressed like a couple of housewives headed for a rare night on the town. 
Housewives dripping in diamonds, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Each fared better after a change -- DeGeneres switching to a velvet Anne Klein 
smoking jacket and sneakers, Richardson into a flattering cranberry 
off-the-shoulder gown. This neckline does wonders for the post-40 set. Meredith 
Baxter, for example, looked stunning in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Men, of course, have it so much easier. But whose bright idea was it to ignore 
hundreds of years of perfectly good tradition and wear a black shirt underneath 
his tuxedo? Garry Shandling, Dennis Franz, Tom Skerritt and Tim Allen did the 
black shirt look. But at least they were shirts. "NYPD Blue" hunk David Caruso 
couldn't even bother to button up, slapping on a T-shirt instead. 
</P>
<P>
 And, guys, could we go back to the old black tie? When Jerry Van Dyke shows up 
tieless, you know the look has lost its edge.

YOUNG DON'T FEEL AS BOUND BY RACIAL LINES; POLL: NEARLY 60% OF THOSE 18-34 HAVE 
COURTED OUTSIDE THEIR ETHNIC GROUP. THAT DROPS TO 43% FOR RESIDENTS 35-54, AND 
15% FOR THOSE 55 AND OLDER.

 As Orange County's demographics have changed, so have its dating practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Interracial dating has become a fact of life, according to a Times Orange 
County Poll of 500 unmarried people conducted in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 60% of respondents 18 to 34 years old say they have dated someone from 
another racial or ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 A breakdown by age shows older singles were less inclined to mixed-race dating 
-- about 43% of people 35 to 54 had dated someone from another racial group, 
only 15% of those 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 to 1990, the racial makeup of Orange County changed: Latinos went 
from 15% to 24% of the population and Asians increased from 5% to 10%, while 
the white population decreased from 78% to 65%, according to the U.S. Census 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Carroll, 41, of Yorba Linda, a dress shop manager, recalled that when 
she was young, she never dated outside her race because she knew her parents 
would disapprove. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny how those voices of the past stay in your head," Carroll said. 
"I'm still only attracted to other Caucasians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet if my (11-year-old) son brought home a black or a Hispanic or an Asian 
girlfriend someday, I'd have absolutely no problem with it," she said. "In 
fact, I hope he doesn't have some of the silly biases that I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Keefer, 18, is young enough to be Carroll's daughter and said, yes, 
bias against skin color just doesn't count with her and her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an Asian boyfriend for eight months when I was 16," said the white UCLA 
student, who lives with her parents in Irvine. "Skin color doesn't affect my 
feelings about a person. A lot of my Caucasian friends also have dated Asian 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time I felt uncomfortable about it was when somebody asked me if I 
was uncomfortable," Keefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the '80s, the number of interracial married couples in America doubled 
to 1.1 million, according to the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 And numerous studies in recent years reflect a changing attitude among young 
people regarding interracial relationships. For instance, a poll last spring of 
high school students in Andover, Mass., found 94% approve of interracial 
dating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people are more accepting of interracial relationships, especially 
those in urban areas and more affluent areas," said Troy Zimmer, professor of 
sociology at Cal State Fullerton. "Many of them grew up with parents who were 
more liberal and less prejudiced than were their own parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer, a white man who teaches a course titled "Social Relationships and 
Emotions," is married to Janice Oshio Zimmer, a Japanese American. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed since he and his wife wed in 1971. Zimmer recalled that his 
marriage was treated as a curiosity -- and worse -- at first. "We got a lot of 
comments along the lines of 'Why did you do it?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not so sure that, on the whole, the older generations have changed 
their attitudes today -- they are merely less blunt. "Just because people are 
less rude doesn't mean they're more enthused," Zimmer said. "It's not 
politically correct to be a bigot, so people are guarded against exposing their 
bigotry." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he believes that most of his students are genuinely indifferent to 
his interracial marriage. "When I tell them, they seem to think it's no big 
deal," he said. "It's more interesting to them that my wife and I have managed 
to stay together for 27 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia Padilla and Colby Helper, both 21-year-old students at Cal State 
Fullerton, are engaged to be married. Their parents, they said, have never 
expressed any concern that she is Filipino and he is white. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents are both schoolteachers, and they work with every race," Helper 
said. "They are open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla said many of her peers were raised with the same mind-set. "It was 
instilled in us to look at what's inside rather than what's outside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interracial dating is tough without the support of family and friends, Zimmer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a difference between intent and the ability to follow through," he 
said. "People will say they have no problem with dating outside their race. But 
then if they start getting flak from those close to them, they will have 
afterthoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Rubalcava, 25, a Latino software engineer in Fullerton, said he frequently 
dates outside his race -- but his father would prefer he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father wants me to marry a Mexican girl and have Mexican children," he 
said. "But my mother says she doesn't care, as long as I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandparents might be more skeptical of interracial relationships than 
parents. "My boyfriend is Latino," said 23-year-old Kasandra Lay, a white 
Fullerton bank teller. "I haven't run up against any resistance from my 
parents, but my grandparents don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 A belief that those of different races shouldn't date runs deep in many 
people. "I've only dated white women, and my ex-wife is white," said a San 
Clemente salesman, 49, who requested anonymity. "I'm not a bigot -- I have 
friends of every color. I just don't feel comfortable with interracial 
marriage, especially between whites and blacks. It's too tough on the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer and his wife were unable to have children, but he remembers negative 
remarks by strangers about mixed-race children. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would say to us, 'Oh, your poor children will have problems,' " 
recalled Zimmer. "Ironically, it's that very attitude that creates the problems 
in the first place. A lot of people both young and old, who are not necessarily 
hostile bigots, believe that it isn't a good idea for races to mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Corina Espinoza, director of the Cross-Cultural Center at UC Irvine, can 
attest firsthand that interracial marriages work. Espinoza, 33, is Latina; her 
husband of two years, Damon Jackson, 29, is African American. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get our share of curious glances," she said. "And in my family, there was 
a preference for me marrying someone of Latino background. But there's been no 
estrangement or hostility." 
</P>
<P>
 She's witnessed a growing openness to interracial relationships among young 
people on campus. "They are in the process of developing their views of the 
world and people around them," she said. "They're not set in their ways -- 
they're open to everything." 
</P>
<P>
 SUNDAY: Though most are satisfied with single life, they'd trade it for that 
ideal mate. 
</P>
<P>
 TODAY: From picking up the tab to interracial relationships, the dating rules 
are changing. 
</P>
<P>
 TUESDAY: Abundant activities help O.C. attract young, middle-aged and senior 
singles. How This Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 500 unmarried Orange County adult residents was 
conducted from June 22 to 26 on weekday nights and weekend days using a 
computer-generated random sample of telephone numbers. The margin of error for 
the total sample is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points at the 95% confidence 
level. That means it is 95% certain that the results are within 4.5 percentage 
points of what they would be if every unmarried adult resident in the county 
were interviewed. For subgroups, the margin of error would be higher. All 
respondents were guaranteed anonymity; however, some of those polled agreed to 
be re-interviewed for the stories. TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL: Most Singles Have 
Active Lives 
</P>

 Few of Orange County's singles report being lonely very often. Most congregate 
with friends at least once a week. About half are currently dating.

<P>
 It was late afternoon when Larry McCarthy arrived at the recording studio 
where he would begin constructing his next political commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 42-year-old video craftsman, whose ads have shaped the images of 
Presidents, worked into the night, 3,000 miles away Sen. Dianne Feinstein was 
starting to broadcast the first television ad of her reelection campaign -- a 
blistering attack on McCarthy's client, Republican challenger Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy had only a few hours to work. For even as the counterattack flickered 
to life on the screens of the dimly lighted studio, Huffington media buyers 
were lining up air time for the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-second ad took about seven hours to make. By the time McCarthy left the 
studio, shortly before midnight, he had listened to the opening line so many 
times it echoed in his head: "As polls show her dropping, Feinstein attacks 
Mike Huffington on taxes." Tomorrow, he knew, more than 10 million Californians 
would hear that line about the time they sat down to the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers across the country are watching California's U.S. Senate 
race like a bunch of car lovers mesmerized by a Ferrari Testarossa. A 
formidable incumbent and early favorite has been forced into a fight for 
survival by a wealthy, once obscure, freshman congressman willing to bankroll 
the most expensive congressional campaign in history. 
</P>
<P>
 In a state the size of California, campaigns are measured in their ability to 
deliver their messages, and Huffington has been offering a unique display of 
the political power of money and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Good ideas and popular issues are important, but they are like a powerful 
train with no track to run on unless a candidate can reach the voters through 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Most candidates can only afford to use television selectively, often saving 
for a big push in the final days before the election. Huffington, catapulted 
into the spotlight by several million dollars in ads, moved from being 
virtually unknown statewide to running nearly even with Feinstein in the polls 
by early summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the primary campaign, a worried Feinstein decided to launch her own TV 
ads. Huffington's staff -- including a dream team of veteran strategists -- 
responded quickly and forcefully to every Feinstein commercial. In some cases, 
McCarthy and the Huffington team worked around the clock and coast to coast, to 
create, produce and distribute a direct response ad in less than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 And whatever television time Feinstein purchased, the Huffington team bought 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two-month cross fire ended in August, a statewide poll found 
Feinstein clinging to a six-point lead, about the same one she held in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen it (a candidate's counterattack) done this fast before," said 
William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute in 
Washington. "The bottom-line effect is that it just cuts off the effectiveness 
of many (of Feinstein's) charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Most professional campaign managers can only fantasize about such response, 
particularly so early and often in a campaign. Feinstein, for example, has 
responded directly to only one of Huffington's critical ads -- and then after a 
six-day lag. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers from both major parties say Huffington's quick-response strategy is 
what you would expect if you combined a team of top national strategists with 
enough money to finance their best ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 When Huffington's counterattacks began, finance records show, his campaign was 
spending more than $100,000 a day, much of it on television. At the same time, 
Feinstein, one of Washington's top fund-raisers was spending $62,000 a day on 
her campaign, also largely on TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be real candid, I have never worked on a campaign with an open budget -- 
and I work on many campaigns all over the country," said David Bienstock, a 
Republican media strategist currently with Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection 
campaign. "It must be very difficult for Feinstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein adviser William Carrick acknowledges that his side is well aware of 
Huffington's techniques. "I'm glad that we have held our own while we've been 
outspent 3-to-2," he said. "It was our intention to keep him from getting up 
any head of steam." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last-minute decisions in a political campaign can be expensive and difficult. 
When Huffington decided to respond quickly to Feinstein's attack barrage in 
June, he paid premium rates for some of the broadcast time. One Democratic 
media buyer said Huffington paid $18,000 for a spot in Los Angeles that bumped 
another commercial from its prime-time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The logistics are also daunting. After the first quick-response commercial was 
produced in Washington, D.C., more than 40 videotapes had to be delivered to TV 
stations throughout California hours later. The video was transmitted 
cross-country through fiber-optic cables. Then, for some remote stations, 
copies were flown out of San Francisco by a campaign staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Huffington campaign has probably been the most vivid demonstration of the 
advantage of sheer financial firepower," said Darry Sragow, a Democratic 
political consultant. "When you have the kind of money he has available to 
spend, you are, by definition, going to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow and other strategists said most campaigns must weigh the cost of every 
decision -- when to go on television, for how long and even whether to respond 
to an opponent's attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, they said, has the advantage of making decisions based exclusively 
on tactical merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) is paying almost his entire campaign bill from a 
fortune -- estimated at about $70 million -- gained in the 1990 sale of his 
family's Texas petroleum company. Already, he has given his Senate campaign at 
least $10 million, setting a record for the most personal money ever spent in a 
congressional race. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Feinstein spent $8 million to unseat appointed Republican Sen. 
John Seymour in 1992. She has spent about $6.5 million in the current campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 High technology makes it possible for campaigns to attack quickly. But experts 
said the most important ingredient in making a rapid-response strategy work is 
the people involved -- a candidate who can delegate and make up his mind 
quickly and a team of consultants who know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The team at Huffington headquarters in Costa Mesa includes some of the 
nation's most decorated political generals. Their past campaigns include Nixon 
'72, Reagan '80 and '84, Bush '88 and Dole '88. In political circles, most are 
far better known than Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 In campaigns, such shared experience is significant. It means that the 
personalities are well-known, the talents are established and respected, and 
there is a consensus around the table about how campaigns are run. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can basically say something and in 10 seconds the person understands 
you," said McCarthy. "Technology is not the key to the fast response, the keys 
are preparation and decisiveness. You can be in campaigns where you just debate 
about response for two or three days and you've lost your edge. This is a very 
decisive campaign. We don't screw around pondering up or down, right or left, 
red or blue." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy is best known for his work with George Bush's 1988 presidential 
campaign. He created the infamous ad against Michael Dukakis that featured 
Willie Horton, the Massachusetts felon who raped a woman while on a furlough. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy worked on two gubernatorial races in California -- 1984 and 1990 -- 
with Huffington adviser Ken Khachigian, a San Clemente consultant and former 
speech writer for Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Huffington's lead 
strategist, Edward J. Rollins, was Reagan's campaign manager in 1984. In Kansas 
Sen. Bob Dole's 1988 bid for the White House, McCarthy teamed up with 
Huffington's pollster, Richard Wirthlin. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the starting place for fast response is the candidate himself. Aides 
say Huffington has made quick decisions about his commercials and is not 
squeamish about hard-hitting attack ads. They also say he trusts his advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final decision is mine," Huffington said in a recent interview. "But I 
always let them come up with ideas. . . . There is no point in hiring good 
people if you're going to dictate to them what everything is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The planning of the counterattack began on Memorial Day weekend. Huffington's 
team gathered at campaign headquarters for an all-day session to prepare for 
the Feinstein attacks they calculated were soon to air. 
</P>
<P>
 Wirthlin provided a snapshot of where the race stood in the polls. An 
opposition researcher presented the campaign's dirt on Feinstein. McCarthy, 
playing devil's advocate, passed out scripts for five commercials he figured 
the Democrats might use, along with suggested responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, the Republicans picked up the first signs of an imminent 
attack. Feinstein's campaign was calling television stations around the state 
to purchase time for an ad starting June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying TV time in political campaigns is often a game of hide-and-seek or 
bait-and-switch. Frequently, when one candidate buys time for a commercial, the 
station's sales staff will call the opposition to try to tease them into buying 
a spot too. Many times, campaigns will also reserve time with no intention of 
using it, only as a ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's team believed the Feinstein buys were probably authentic and on 
May 31, McCarthy assembled the staff and equipment he would need to respond. He 
reserved a computer graphics staff to construct the ad, hired an announcer and 
found an editing studio where the components could be blended into the final 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign also began purchasing time slots on television stations around 
California to air its counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington's people still had no idea what Feinstein's commercial would be 
about. That would be learned the next afternoon, on June 1, a few hours before 
the commercial went on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of this is like the old child's game, telephone -- somebody tells 
somebody who tells somebody," McCarthy said. "Reporters would call the campaign 
and ask for reaction (to Feinstein's ad), and that's the first inkling we had 
about what exactly she was going to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's attack was sharp. It accused Huffington of being a millionaire 
Texas carpetbagger and suggested he had dodged his California taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy, Huffington, Khachigian, Wirthlin and others joined in a conference 
call to discuss their response. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the theme of Feinstein's commercial matched one of 
McCarthy's predictions. A counterattack script he had already proposed was 
approved on the phone with minor changes. By that evening, McCarthy finally had 
everything in place to begin making the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next several hours, his job was something like that of an orchestra 
conductor. He juggled staffs in three high-tech studios, each working on a 
different part of the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial took shape in a computer graphics room known as the "paint 
box." McCarthy's instructions to Jane Hutchins, the "paint-box artist," were 
simple: "I just said give me a nice background." Hutchins' desk looks like it's 
part airplane cockpit and part sketch pad. When she works, she watches a 
brightly colored video screen to see the scribbles she makes by drawing with an 
electronic pen on her desktop. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer work took about three hours. On top of a powdery, magenta 
background, Hutchins added snapshots of the candidates and words from the 
script. Out of necessity, the ad was structurally simple. There were no moving 
pictures. Only words, still pictures and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to keep the commercial simple, that was my point," said Huffington 
adviser Carlos Rodriguez. "We weren't going to win any creative awards here. If 
you can get creative and effective, that's great. But I'll go for just 
effective anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, but in another building, an announcer recorded the script on an 
audiotape that was carried to McCarthy's studio. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the components were combined onto videotape in the editing studio, with 
McCarthy and his technicians. The editing process took about four hours. 
Shortly before midnight in Washington, the 30-second commercial was completed. 
McCarthy walked it up the street about two blocks to another studio, where it 
was transmitted to dubbing stations in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, the dubbing stations made more than 40 copies. And by morning, they 
were delivered throughout California, some by messenger and some by campaign 
staff. Total cost of producing the ad: about $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial denied Feinstein's charge that Huffington avoided paying his 
California taxes. It went on to attack the Democrat, saying she, also a 
millionaire, had not paid federal taxes in some years. 
</P>
<P>
 By the evening of June 2, more than 10 million people throughout California 
had seen the commercial -- within 24 hours of Feinstein's, and only hours after 
McCarthy stepped into his studio. The Making of a Huffington Ad 
</P>
<P>
 By spending more than $10 million of his own money, Republican Senate 
candidate Mike Huffington has financed unprecedented campaign tactics. 
Huffington has leveled the race with Democrat Dianne Feinstein partly by 
responding quickly and massively to Feinstein's television ads.

'CRY WOLF' STORIES PERMEATE COVERAGE OF HEALTH HAZARDS; JOURNALISM: SCIENTISTS, 
OTHERS SAY ALARMIST ACCOUNTS ADD TO FEAR. FACTS THAT MITIGATE A THREAT OFTEN GO 
UNREPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks before Thanksgiving, 1959, minuscule amounts of a potentially 
cancer-causing weedkiller were discovered in some cranberries grown in 
Washington state and Oregon. The New York Times put the story on Page 1 five 
times in seven days. Other media followed suit. People panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 But a nationwide inspection of cranberries disclosed no contamination other 
than at the original sites, and not one case of illness from tainted 
cranberries was reported anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Such false alarms were uncommon in the 1950s. Oh sure, there were scare 
stories about strontium-90 in milk and about fluoride in toothpaste and in the 
water supply, but these were isolated and largely confined to narrow interest 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990s, scare stories are omnipresent. The perception of risk has become 
so pervasive, there are now organizations, schools, institutes, journals and 
careers dedicated solely to its assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the media's critical role in setting the national agenda -- especially 
on issues as complex and politically charged as those involving potential 
health hazards -- many journalists, scientists and social critics are concerned 
about the alarmist tone that suffuses the media's portrayal of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 They say such coverage can frighten people and prompt them to take unnecessary 
risks -- keeping handguns in their homes, going on rigid, unsound diets or 
avoiding necessary medical treatment. "Cry wolf" coverage may also deprive 
people of the ability to distinguish between serious and not-so-serious risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in danger of surrendering to feelings of helplessness and apathy, 
which paralyze us in the act of coping even in situations where personal action 
can make a difference," medical researchers from the Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta said in a report, "Interpreting Risks to the Public," 
presented to the "Prevention 85" conference in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, asks Paul Portney, vice president of Resources for the Future, a 
Washington think tank that specializes in environmental issues, "If everything 
is as harmful as we're told, how come we're healthier and living longer . . . 
than ever before?" 
</P>
<P>
 The media offer few answers to this seeming paradox. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Cristine Russell, a special health correspondent for the 
Washington Post, who spent a year studying risk while on a grant from the 
Alicia Patterson Foundation, "The media have been a big player in widespread 
public confusion about risk." 
</P>
<P>
 A big player, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies have shown that people get more information about risk and hazard 
from the media than they do from their physicians or anyone else," says Walter 
Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of 
Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Government decision-makers also "get their information from the media more 
than any place else," says Clarence (Terry) Davies, director of the Center for 
Risk Management at Resources for the Future. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the media are a vital link in a fragile but circular information chain 
that connects scientists, politicians and the public. Typically, a few anxious, 
often angry people say they're worried about something -- a toxic waste dump, 
say. The media cover the story. Other people see the story and start worrying 
themselves: Is the dump near them toxic? Are their children in danger? They 
demand answers -- and action -- from their elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials -- primarily in Congress -- read the same stories and listen to 
their constituents and respond by making funding and policy decisions for the 
Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and other 
regulatory agencies created to protect the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a democracy, after all, and it shouldn't surprise us that we have 
set policy according to what the public's been most alarmed about," William 
Reilly, former director of the EPA, said last spring on the ABC News program 
"Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That has resulted in a sort of discontinuous series of crises, episodic 
events which got a lot of publicity, television exposure, press attention, and 
resulted in Congress writing a new law." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those laws have proved flawed, either in conception or in enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in the Washington Post last spring, Estelle Fishbein, vice president 
of Johns Hopkins University, argued that the 1980 Superfund law, designed to 
clean up hazardous waste sites, had "failed miserably." Only 15% of the 1,300 
Superfund sites identified by the EPA have been completely cleaned up, Fishbein 
said, despite an expenditure of $13.5 billion -- 25% of which has gone to 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Puzo, who covers food safety issues for the Los Angeles Times, says 
overheated media coverage of pesticides has resulted in a similar waste of 
federal funds monitoring that risk when the government should be devoting its 
resources to looking for food-borne microbes such as salmonella and E. coli, 
which are "by far the greater danger in terms of maintaining the healthfulness 
of the food supply." 
</P>
<P>
 The Centers for Disease Control say there are 6.5 million cases of food-borne 
illnesses -- and 9,000 deaths -- a year. But only when there's a large-scale 
breakout -- as happened last year when four people died and 500 got sick after 
eating Jack in the Box hamburgers -- do the media or the government seem to 
take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be 70 to 80 reporters covering a Raiders game," Puzo says, "but 
only three or four reporters in the whole country cover food safety full-time. 
The media don't cover it so the government doesn't seem to worry much about it. 
There are so few federal inspectors for the number of food-processing plants in 
the country that it's totally ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly says some of the government's regulatory laws that have proved 
ineffective or misguided should be reconsidered. So do many others. But 
bureaucracies are difficult to reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the Los Angeles Times two days before President Clinton 
nominated him to the United States Supreme Court, federal Judge Stephen Breyer 
said the media are such a powerful force in risk perception and policy-making 
that "once a particular substance becomes a matter of such public interest that 
it's written about continuously in the press, the battle is over;" the initial 
thrust and angle the media provide largely determine the outcome of the 
subsequent debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What constitutes news is not necessarily what constitutes a significant 
public health problem," says John Graham, director of the Center for Risk 
Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. "The bizarre, the mysterious, 
that which people have difficulty imagining happening" -- that's news, that's 
what the media cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Peoples' perceptions about risk are "definitely more closely related to media 
coverage than to actual statistics," says Paul Slovic, the president of 
Decision Research Inc. in Eugene, Ore., and a psychology professor at the 
University of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 There are perhaps no better examples of this phenomenon in recent years than 
the public panics over the pesticide Alar on apples (see accompanying story) 
and the presence of asbestos in New York City schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and '70s, miners and other industrial workers who had worked in 
asbestos-laden environments 20 or 30 years earlier began to show a high 
incidence of lung cancer and other lung diseases. Congress and the EPA 
subsequently took steps to limit asbestos exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 But many officials failed to take into account the enormous difference between 
the exposure of someone working with a toxic substance all day and someone who 
might be exposed to it occasionally and briefly. They also failed to 
differentiate between the kind of asbestos that can be truly dangerous 
(amphiboles) and the white, chrysotile-based asbestos that is used 95% of the 
time in the United States and that repeated studies have shown is "not a health 
risk in the non-occupational environment," as a team of international experts 
concluded in a study published by Science magazine in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But when crumbly chrysotile asbestos was found in several New York schools in 
the summer of 1993 -- after federally mandated reports had pronounced those 
sites free of such "contamination" -- terrified parents, goaded on by the 
tabloid media and local television, demanded action. Then-Mayor David Dinkins 
announced that no school would be allowed to reopen for the new school year 
until it had been inspected anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Classrooms opened two weeks late for the city's 1 million school-age children 
-- a large number of whom may have been "in more danger on the streets than in 
school," as one New York Times story noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection, cleanup and delay occasioned by the asbestos scare cost 
taxpayers more than $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some journalists say they covered the asbestos story more as an expose of 
incompetent and fraudulent government testing than as a health hazard. But the 
testing would not have been nearly as big a story if the purported hazard -- 
cancer -- had not been mentioned so prominently. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, no one would have been outraged if officials had lied about 
removing peanut butter from the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the New York Times, which did emphasize the falsified inspection reports 
in its generally sober coverage, used such words and phrases as "asbestos 
hazards" and "contaminated with the cancer-causing material" and "asbestos that 
posed dangers to children" in its coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were a few brief cautionary phrases in the early New York Times 
coverage, it wasn't until almost a month after the first story on the "crisis" 
that the paper published a lengthy Page 1 story saying health experts and 
school officials thought the risks posed by a few months in schools with 
asbestos were "negligible" -- less than the statistical likelihood of being 
killed by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 The crumbly asbestos may well have offered some risk, but the decision to 
delay the opening of school was "based more on a need to reassure fearful 
parents than on any estimate of health risk," the story quoted health experts 
and school officials as saying. As a trustee of the New York School 
Construction Authority told the New York Times, "Notwithstanding all of the 
evidence, people still have an extraordinary fear." 
</P>
<P>
 The media both cover and exacerbate that fear. But the media are not the only 
thread in the web of fear, whether the issue is asbestos in the schools, fat in 
food or crime on the streets. Human psychology, individually and collectively, 
is also important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perception of risk is a very value-determined thing," says Davies of the 
Center for Risk Management. "There are people who, for whatever reasons -- 
early . . . toilet training or genetics or whatever -- are very risk-averse . . 
. very paranoid in some cases about what society is 'doing' to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The asbestos scare pushed two "hot buttons" for almost everyone -- dread of 
cancer and compassion for children -- both of which far outweighed any 
reassurances from scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Students of risk perception are not surprised by this. They say most people 
look at much more than scientific evidence in responding to all kinds of risks. 
Indeed, they often ignore scientific evidence altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 As Oliver Wendell Holmes, the celebrated U.S. Supreme Court justice, put it: 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think dramatically, not quantitatively." 
</P>
<P>
 In covering risk, most reporters -- who are, after all, lay people, not 
scientists -- generally reflect this attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, a dramatic -- often melodramatic -- approach to risk seems 
"strikingly an American phenomenon," in the media and the public alike, the 
late British journalist Henry Fairlie wrote in 1989. He said this approach is 
"yet another distortion of the philosophy of rights underlying the 
Constitution, as if the Declaration of Independence had been rewritten to 
include freedom from risk among the self-evident rights to life, liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that our individual lives . . . can and should be risk-free has 
grown to be an obsession, driven far and deep into American attitudes," Fairlie 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's exaggerated fears, rather than scientific expertise, may 
increasingly be "setting priorities for regulations and research," says Sharon 
Friedman, chair of the journalism department at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 In her article "Media, Risk Assessment and Numbers" in the current issue of 
the journal "Risk: Health, Safety & Environment," Friedman quotes scientists as 
saying that media attention and the resultant "public pressure on legislators 
and government agencies skew environmental decision-making." The government may 
spend money trying to regulate risks that aren't really risky, while ignoring 
genuine risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA admitted as much in a 1987 report that said, "Overall, EPA's 
priorities appear more closely aligned with public opinion than with our 
estimated risks." 
</P>
<P>
 William Allman, writing in Science 85 magazine, warned that our increasing 
"desire for absolute certainty makes a high probability, such as 85%, seem 
insufficient." The ramifications of that attitude are profound and 
far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say 90% of the toxic material could be removed from many waste sites 
in a relatively reasonable time, for example, at a relatively reasonable cost. 
But in an effort to provide absolute safety, many years and tens of millions of 
dollars are often spent trying to remove the last 10%. Or the last 5%. Or the 
last 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Removing that last little bit can involve limited technological choice, high 
cost, devotion of considerable (Environmental Protection) Agency resources, 
large legal fees and endless argument," Breyer wrote in his book, "Breaking the 
Vicious Circle: Toward Effective Risk Regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Experts calculate that the EPA rules, regulating sources such as benzene 
storage vessels and coke byproduct recovery plants, save a total of three to 
four lives per year, at a cost of well over $200 million," more than $50 
million per life, Breyer says. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, one study has shown that vaccinating 18-month-olds against 
hemophilus influenza Type B, the leading cause of bacterial meningitis, would 
save lives at a cost of $68,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer and others warn that the resources available to regulate and combat 
various health risks are not limitless. What many critics call "headline 
hysteria" about relatively small risks often prompt the government to spend 
money regulating those risks, and that means money may not be available for 
research and for more serious social, medical and environmental problems -- 
prenatal care, childhood immunizations, day care, housing, education, highway 
safety, shelters for battered women, smoke detectors in low-income rental 
housing, hot lunches for poor children. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and consumer advocates disagree vigorously with the Breyer 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government has under-regulated or regulated too late far more 
often than it's over-regulated," says Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health 
Research Group of Ralph Nader's Public Citizen organization. Wolfe ticks off a 
series of drugs and devices, from the arthritis medication Oraflex to the 
Dalkon Shield IUD, which caused serious health problems before being removed 
from the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Meyerhoff, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental organization, says, "If we've learned a single lesson about toxic 
chemicals in the last decade, it's that we cannot trust government regulation 
to protect us from these exposures. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes risk information and communication even more important," he says, 
"because in the final analysis, the public has to protect itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, supporters of strict government regulation argue that it's callous 
to put a price tag on human life and that it's always better to risk wasting 
money than to err on the side of compromise and risk wasting lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a "guns or butter myth . . . a smoke screen . . . very naive," Wolfe 
says, to suggest that money not spent on current regulatory efforts would 
otherwise be spent on more important health and welfare projects. He and others 
worry that money saved on regulation and consumer protection would be funneled 
to deficit reduction or the Pentagon or other projects they think are less 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 But public policy experts say Congress could specifically earmark funds for 
certain health and social programs, and they complain that the media ignore 
this possibility as well as other economic aspects of environmentalism in their 
coverage of risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many economists are intensely frustrated that the media refuse to discuss the 
fact that environmental protection often doesn't stand up to a cost/benefit 
test," journalist Gregg Easterbrook wrote in the New Republic in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press hasn't even begun to address" the cost/benefit ratio, says Lois 
Gold, director of the Carcinogenic Potency Project at UC Berkeley. "There's no 
perspective on cost in the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives have largely co-opted the cost/benefit argument, though, and 
since they are largely seen as being pro-business, many in both the news media 
and the political arena tend to dismiss their arguments out of hand, looking 
only at their ideology, not at their science or their economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Many environmental reporters not only know nothing about economics, they're 
"hostile toward thinking about" risk issues in economic terms, says Rob 
Stavins, who teaches environmental economics and public policy at Harvard 
University. "A lot of people think if you take an economic perspective on the 
environment, that must just be worrying about business and their interests." 
</P>
<P>
 But others argue that the cost/benefit argument should ultimately be a liberal 
argument, not a conservative argument, because government regulations that 
raise the cost of doing business and take money out of the economy ultimately 
hurt poorer people the most, eliminating jobs and raising prices for those 
whose cause has been most often championed by liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they argue, economic well-being is the greatest single factor in 
good health, a point that is rarely discussed in the mainstream media. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mortality rate for higher-income individuals is generally less than that 
for lower-income individuals," Ralph Kenney wrote in a 1990 issue of the 
journal Risk Analysis. "Reasons for this relationship relate to, among other 
things, better nutrition, better sanitation, better health care and better 
education -- all items that are easier to come by with money." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many experts in risk assessment worry that media and political 
emphasis on other, much smaller risks than poverty not only hurts poor people 
but damages the overall economy and social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 The desire for a risk-free society is "one of the most debilitating influences 
in America today, progressively enfeebling the economy with a mass of safety 
regulations and . . . threatening to create an unbuoyant and uninventive 
society," Fairlie wrote in the New Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 As Graham, the Harvard risk analyst puts it, "We all want zero risk. The 
problem is if every citizen in this country demands zero risk, we're going to 
bankrupt the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Modern technology has made it possible to detect tiny amounts of potentially 
harmful chemicals that would have eluded discovery in previous generations. 
This means the government can enact regulations to protect Americans from 
previously hidden dangers. But when this technological capability is combined 
with Americans' zeal for zero risk, the result can, at times, both distort the 
political process and disrupt the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor of the New York Times, attributes our desire 
for zero risk to "something in the American soul that seems to think we should 
all live forever, and therefore, anything that can hurt you is part of a 
conspiracy to prevent that." 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, plays into the peculiarly American determination to look for 
villains (and heroes), to fix blame, to insist on answers, reasons, solutions, 
no matter how random or inexplicable a given event may be. As a people, we are 
uncomfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. We prefer black and white to 
gray. 
</P>
<P>
 People are sick? It must be DDT. Or Dioxin. Or secondhand smoke. Never mind 
that scientists say the evidence isn't in yet. We want answers. Now. 
</P>
<P>
 The media feed that appetite for immediate answers. Reporters aren't 
scientists -- or historians -- waiting for definitive findings. They have daily 
deadlines. Something "might" be dangerous? That's good enough for today's 
story; if there's a new study tomorrow saying it's not dangerous, we'll report 
that story, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an inherent conflict between the business of news and what social 
scientists and others call 'risk communications,' " say social scientists 
Eleanor Singer and Phyllis Endreny in the current issue of the journal Risk: 
Health, Safety & Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "To communicate information about hazards and risks in a way calculated to 
foster rational decision-making means providing detailed and precise 
information and immediate and long-term consequences, to weigh the costs and 
benefits of a hazard and its alternatives for the individual and for society, 
and to discuss the issues, moral and economic, that inhere in hazardous 
processes and events," Singer and Endreny say. 
</P>
<P>
 "But reporting about hazards is ordinarily reporting about events rather than 
issues, about immediate consequences rather than long-term considerations, 
about harms (injury, property destruction, death) rather than risks -- i.e., 
the statistical probability of harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alternatives are almost never considered in a story about a particular 
hazard, and when they are considered, their risks and benefits are not. Moral 
or ethical issues are generally absent from news stories about hazards, and 
even economic issues are for the most part ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 That inherent conflict between the tentative, incremental nature of science 
and the demands for immediate certainty in daily journalism almost inevitably 
leaves the public confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the anti-oxidant beta carotene help prevent lung cancer or might it 
contribute to lung cancer? Does margarine help fight heart disease or does it 
contribute to it? Does chocolate raise cholesterol or does the stearic acid in 
it actually lower cholesterol? 
</P>
<P>
 It all depends on which morning's newspaper you read and which evening's 
newscast you watch. You can't tell the risks without a score card, and in this 
game, they seem to change the numbers almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the New York Times published a story saying "fears about 
electromagnetic radiation from power lines and electrical appliances have 
circulated for years, but . . . scientists say there is no proof the radiation 
harms health." Two weeks later, the Los Angeles Times published a story saying: 
"Electromagnetic fields, previously implicated in triggering leukemia, brain 
tumors and breast cancer, may play a far more important role in Alzheimer's 
disease, a USC researcher will report today." 
</P>
<P>
 Contradictions and confusion about caffeine have been even more striking. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, caffeine has been variously reported to cause cancer, to 
inhibit conception, to induce miscarriage, to cause birth defects, to increase 
cholesterol, to trigger irregular heart beats, to aggravate ulcers and to 
increase urination. 
</P>
<P>
 But caffeine has also been reported to help people lose weight, improve 
hand-eye coordination, increase tolerance for exercise, promote clearer 
thinking, diminish drowsiness, make children more attentive in school and make 
adults less likely to suffer bronchial asthma -- or to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 You would think that with all the advances in modern medicine and technology, 
we could find a simple answer to the simple question "Is a cup of coffee bad 
for you?" But many people are afraid of technology, and many others have lost 
faith in it. Indeed, people's attitude toward technology helps explain their 
attitude toward risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: What we're afraid of -- and why. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacci Cenacveira of The Times editorial library assisted with the research for 
this series. Confusion Over Caffeine 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no substance has been the subject of more conflicting media and 
scientific reports in recent years than caffeine. So, is a cup of coffee bad 
for you or not?

ALPHA BETA AND RALPHS MERGER EXPECTED SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that would create Southern California's largest supermarket chain 
and remove familiar names from the local grocery scene, Ralphs Grocery Co. and 
the owner of Alpha Beta stores are expected to announce a $2.5-billion merger 
on Tuesday, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal between Ralphs Grocery Co. and Yucaipa Cos., which also owns the Boys 
and Viva chains and Food 4 Less warehouse stores, would be the largest 
supermarket merger in California history, creating a grocery giant that would 
surpass longtime leader Vons in sales and store sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the deal in Orange County would be 31 Ralphs supermarkets plus 31 
Alpha Beta stores, three Viva stores and two Food 4 Less locations, operated by 
La Habra-based Food 4 Less. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agreement is finalized today, the companies expect to merge their 
operations in November or December, and Yucaipa would convert all of its Alpha 
Beta, Boys and Viva markets to either Ralphs or Food 4 Less warehouse stores, 
sources said. Currently, there are 131 Alpha Beta, 24 Boys and 15 Viva stores. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, 10 to 30 of the 167 Ralphs stores would be converted to Food 
4 Less warehouse stores to meet growing demand for discount prices and an 
anticipated challenge from Wal-Mart, sources said. Wal-Mart is expected to open 
a number of California grocery operations under its "superstore" format over 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone will be the Alpha Beta chain, which traces it roots to Orange County. 
Shortly after it was established in 1915, Alpha Beta opened a headquarters in 
Santa Ana and took a novel approach to self-service stores. Its markets stocked 
products alphabetically to help customers find what they wanted. Hence the 
name, Alpha Beta, the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 If the merger goes forward, the combined company, which would be called Ralphs 
Grocery Co., may close some poorly performing stores and eliminate some jobs as 
it consolidates operations. Yucaipa and Ralphs have not decided how many jobs 
would be eliminated or which stores would close, or what would happen to Food 4 
Less corporate headquarters in La Habra, where the company also has warehouse, 
bakery and distribution facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland chains controlled by Yucaipa are operated by La Habra-based Food 
4 Less Supermarkets, which is valued at about $1 billion. Yucaipa would acquire 
Ralphs stock from DeBartolo Corp., an Ohio-based real estate development firm 
that controls Ralphs, under the expected agreement. Yucaipa would assume $1 
billion of Ralphs debt and pay about $500 million to Ralphs shareholders, 
making the total value of the merger $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors of Food 4 Less Supermarkets Inc. and the directors of 
Compton-based Ralphs have already approved the merger, but the deal won't be 
final until it is approved by all Ralphs shareholders, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an agreement would face antitrust scrutiny by the state attorney general 
and the Federal Trade Commission. The merger would create a vast chain 
controlling about 27% of the California market. Among the major competitors are 
Vons, the current Southland leader with 19% of the market, Lucky, Albertson's, 
Hughes, Stater Bros. and Smith Food & Drug. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission approve the 
merger, it would mark the end of Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva. 
</P>
<P>
 Presuming the deal is completed, the combined companies would have several 
stores operating near each other in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, the companies would operate three grocery stores within a mile 
of each other. Food 4 Less has an older Alpha Beta on East 17th Street. A few 
blocks away is a Ralphs store, and an Alpha Beta is operating at the Triangle 
Square retail center. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, Ralphs and Alpha Beta stores are located within a few blocks of 
each other on Lincoln Avenue. Alpha Beta and Ralphs also operate stores at La 
Paz and Marguerite in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, Alpha Beta lost its distinctive reputation and became an 
also-ran in the Southland's supermarket industry wars. Analysts said, among 
other things, that Alpha Beta relied too long on stores that were built in the 
early 1960s and that later were surpassed by competition from chains with 
bigger, more modern stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet its corporate parent, Salt Lake City-based American Stores, often was 
preoccupied with its supermarkets in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1988, American decided to buy Southern California's more vigorous Lucky 
Stores chain and to place Alpha Beta under Lucky management to revive the 
faltering stores. Later, when the California attorney general's office objected 
to the merger, American decided to keep the Lucky stores and sell the Southern 
California Alpha Beta operations to Yucaipa. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys, founded in 1924, and Viva, established in 1987, were both acquired by 
Yucaipa in 1989 and placed under the Food 4 Less Supermarkets roof.

CLOSURE OF HUGHES PLANT IN FULLERTON TO BE ANNOUNCED; AEROSPACE: MOST OF THE 
COMPLEX'S 6,800 WORKERS WILL EITHER BE TRANSFERRED OR LAID OFF, INFORMED 
SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE and KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co. will announce today that its sprawling Fullerton aerospace 
complex will be effectively shut down over the next two years, with most of the 
plant's 6,800 workers either transferred or laid off, according to sources 
knowledgeable about the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "An awful lot of good people aren't going to survive this," said one 
well-placed source, adding that some workers would be transferred to Hughes 
sites in El Segundo and Long Beach while others will retire or lose their jobs. 
The source didn't know how many layoffs are anticipated at the Fullerton 
facility, which opened in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will close more than a dozen major buildings at the 350-acre 
Fullerton complex, leaving open only two leased buildings that hold up to 700 
workers, sources said. The vacated buildings and the land, which the company 
owns, are expected to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, a source said, has "the ability to get a premium amount of money for 
that land." 
</P>
<P>
 A sale offers Hughes two tempting benefits: to consolidate operations amid 
continuing defense cutbacks and to sell a prime piece of real estate in 
Fullerton valued at more than $75 million. All that Hughes would retain there 
are the leased Buildings 675 and 676, on the east side of the complex, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The venerable aerospace giant manufactures ship-based radar, air traffic 
control equipment and large-scale air-defense systems. The decision to close 
the Fullerton plant is part of a companywide reorganization that will involve 
the closure of another, still-undisclosed facility in Southern California, 
according to a source. 
</P>
<P>
 After four months of secrecy and speculation, the announcement will cap an 
anxious wait for workers, local officials and business leaders who had lobbied 
Hughes to keep open the city's largest employer, which generates millions of 
dollars in tax revenue and paychecks. Economic losses from the closure are 
expected to ripple across the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what we feared," Frank M. Reid, executive vice president of the 
Fullerton Chamber of Commerce, said after learning about the pending 
announcement. "It's their business decision and it's one they had to make. 
We're going to miss them." 
</P>
<P>
 From local eateries and car dealerships to Hughes' sprawling complex, the city 
of Fullerton was bracing for the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the company's plans remained largely under wraps to Hughes employees 
and local officials, signs were emerging that the news would be bad. Fullerton 
officials were scheduled to meet with Hughes executives following a scheduled 
10 a.m. announcement to employees -- a private session seen as an indication 
that work at the plant will be significantly scaled back or shut down entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials had asked Fullerton police to send an officer to monitor 
response to the announcement, to be delivered by Hughes Chairman C. Michael 
Armstrong over closed-circuit television to plants here, in El Segundo and Long 
Beach, where cutbacks were also feared. Police said the action was merely a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 The site was all but deserted Sunday, and several workers contacted said the 
company had given them no hint what its verdict would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Lary D. Smith, a business area manager and nine-year Hughes employee, said he 
would be relieved at whatever the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just want to know so they can get on with their lives. 
Everything's been on hold, it's been an anxious period," he said Sunday as he 
headed into Building 600, the oldest on the complex. The Fullerton resident 
said he was prepared for the news either way: "I'll work wherever I'm needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton City Council members and business leaders, who had lobbied Hughes 
officials in recent months to keep the defense electronics facility open, held 
out hope for the best, but already sounded resigned to the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "People around town have talked about it," said Councilman Chris Norby. "But 
there's a sense it's like the weather -- it's either going to happen or it's 
not. There's nothing you can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were already contemplating the effects of a plant closing in a 
community where Hughes has been an economic engine, a major donor for local 
charities and had a reassuring presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the plant closes, it's going to really hurt. This is going to really hurt 
all of Fullerton," said Dorothy Petsas, co-owner of the Sunny Hills Cafe, a 
local restaurant that daily serves lunch to about 50 Hughes employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors about the plant's future have swirled like milkshakes at the 
restaurant, which has already felt the effects of previous cutbacks at the 
plant. Diners no longer have to wait in line for tables, one result of cuts in 
the Hughes work force that has gone from a high of about 15,000 in the 
mid-1980s to 6,800 now. About 800 of those live in Fullerton, said Mayor A.B. 
(Buck) Catlin, himself a former Hughes engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Babington Rice, a sales manager at a local Buick-GMC dealership, was keeping a 
watchful eye on developments at the aerospace plant. Employees at Hughes, which 
is owned by General Motors, are among the firm's best customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them are under the impression that it's going to close. I'm hoping 
they'll keep it open and consolidate some plants into this one," Rice said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 3-million-square-foot Fullerton plant, Hughes has two complexes in 
El Segundo -- with 7,800 employees and a combined working area of 3.3 million 
square feet -- and a smaller, leased plant in Long Beach that employs 970 
workers. Altogether, the company has 34,000 employees in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The four defense facilities considered for consolidation are part of Hughes 
Aerospace & Electronics Co., a corporate division formed in March. The 
consolidation, first mentioned to workers in April, reflects the latest efforts 
by Hughes to simplify its operations in the post-Cold War era. The firm has 
already shut plants in Canoga Park, San Diego and elsewhere over the past two 
years, consolidating missile operations and reaping greatly increased profits 
as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutdown of the Fullerton plant would take up to two years in order to 
allow the company to finish projects already underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Although local officials and county business leaders tried to sell Hughes 
officials on Fullerton's vastly lower business operating rates, the Fullerton 
plant was considered vulnerable because of its potential for residential 
development. Hughes was already seeking permission to develop a portion of its 
property for houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business community is understanding of whatever the corporate decision 
has to be, but of course we want Hughes to remain," said Terry Kerr, an area 
manager for Southern California Edison who is president of the Fullerton 
Chamber of Commerce. "I don't know what I expect but you have to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that while a closure would be a severe blow to the local 
economy, Hughes is not the only big employer in town. Cal State Fullerton, the 
second-largest employer, has 2,100 workers and Hunt-Wesson Foods Inc. employs 
1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like a fish-packing plant in Alaska closing and shutting the town 
down," Norby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's big. A lot of people in town have worked at Hughes for years," Norby 
said. "Growing up in Fullerton, people just said, 'I work for Hughes.' You 
didn't even have to say what you did."

BEST SERIES EMMYS GO TO 'PICKET FENCES,' 'FRASIER'; AWARDS: 'NYPD BLUE' FAILS 
TO WIN DRAMA PRIZE. 'AND THE BAND PLAYED ON' IS BEST MOVIE MADE FOR TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 CBS' "Picket Fences," about the life and colorful characters in a small 
Wisconsin town, upset the highly favored ABC police series "NYPD Blue" to win 
as best drama series at the 46th annual Prime-Time Emmy Awards Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the Band Played On," based on the late Randy Shilts' book about the 
emergence of the AIDS crisis, was chosen best made-for-TV movie. It was made by 
HBO after being rejected by NBC and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory by "Picket Fences" marked the second consecutive year that the 
critically acclaimed but low-rated show was the upset winner in the drama 
series category. In 1993, it won over another highly nominated program, 
"Northern Exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 In other key categories Sunday, NBC's "Frasier," which stars the former 
pompous "Cheers" psychiatrist played by Kelsey Grammer, was named best comedy 
series. Grammer, who has moved from Boston to his hometown of Seattle in 
"Frasier" to host a radio advice show, was chosen best lead comedy actor in a 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Candice Bergen won her fourth Emmy as the title character in "Murphy Brown," 
in which she plays a star TV reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Franz, who portrays the heavy-set Detective Andy Sipowicz in "NYPD 
Blue," was chosen as top dramatic actor in a weekly show. And Sela Ward was 
named best lead actress in a series for "Sisters," in which she plays a 
recovering alcoholic and free-spirited artist who has turned to fashion 
designing. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards show, broadcast on ABC from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, paid 
tribute to actress Jessica Tandy, a past Emmy winner who had died at 85 earlier 
in the day in Connecticut. She and her husband, Hume Cronyn, were both nominees 
again Sunday night for the CBS "Hallmark Hall of Fame" special, "To Dance With 
the White Dog." 
</P>
<P>
 In the special, which dealt with aging and renewal, Cronyn played a man who 
must suddenly adjust to being a widower after 57 years when his wife, portrayed 
by Tandy, dies. In real life, they were married 52 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor John Lithgow, in the Emmy tribute to Tandy, noted that she was one of 
the few performers "to receive an Oscar, an Emmy and a Tony." He added: "We 
will all miss you very much." 
</P>
<P>
 The awards program then showed clips from "To Dance With the White Dog," for 
which Cronyn would earn his third Emmy later that evening, for best actor in a 
miniseries or special. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting for Cronyn was presenter Holly Hunter, who said simply, "Hume Cronyn 
is with his family in Connecticut tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Tandy had been a nominee for best actress in a miniseries or special. That 
Emmy was won by Kirstie Alley for CBS' "David's Mother," playing a woman with 
an autistic teen-age son. 
</P>
<P>
 "David's Mother" also copped Emmys for writer Bob Randall and actor Michael 
Goorjian, who played the mentally retarded son. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving the Emmy for "And the Band Played On," which dramatized the early 
days of the AIDS crisis and those who tried to call attention to it in the face 
of indifference and politics, producer Aaron Spelling said: "We accept this for 
Randy Shilts." Shilts, a San Francisco Chronicle reporter who wrote about AIDS 
and other gay issues, died of AIDS in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" had entered Emmy night with a record-setting 26 nominations, more 
than any other series -- drama or comedy -- in the history of television. It 
was widely regarded as a good bet to tie or pass the all-time record for Emmy 
Award victories in a single season -- eight -- held by "Hill Street Blues." 
Both shows were co-produced by Steven Bochco. 
</P>
<P>
 When "NYPD Blue" emerged with three awards -- for editing, art direction and 
casting -- after Saturday night's non-televised presentation honoring the 
Emmys' creative crafts, it seemed to have a shot at a new record. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that it had to sweep all six categories in which it competed 
Sunday. And the combination of its own multiple entries -- which split votes 
and cut down its chances -- was compounded by "Picket Fences," which knocked 
out any hopes of a record early on. 
</P>
<P>
 That happened when two "Picket Fences" performers -- Fyvush Finkel and 
Leigh-Taylor Young -- won as best supporting actor and actress in a drama 
series despite the competition of five performers from "NYPD Blue." The double 
loss meant that "NYPD Blue" could come out with seven Emmys at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the show led the field with six Emmy Awards. "Frasier" and "Picket 
Fences" were next with five each. In fourth place, with four awards, was the 
CBS miniseries "Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All," a tale that spanned 
130 years, from the Civil War to the present, and featured Anne Bancroft as a 
matriarch and Cicely Tyson as the slave-turned-housekeeper with whom she forges 
a strong bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson, winning as best supporting actress in a miniseries or special, thanked 
the Emmy-voting members of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences "for 
acknowledging the fact that I'm still here, trying to get it right." 
</P>
<P>
 "And the Band Played On" was also upset in a sense, taking just three awards 
despite receiving 13 nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 This was something of a surprise because of the Hollywood community's activism 
fighting the disease. One nominee for best supporting actor in a miniseries or 
special for his work in "And The Band Played On" was Richard Gere, who played a 
famous choreographer who was a composite figure representing the many in the 
entertainment industry who have fallen victim to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Other shows with numerous Emmy nominations that fared poorly in the awards 
were CBS' "Gypsy," which starred Bette Midler in an adaptation of the classic 
stage musical, and NBC's "Seinfeld," which last year was named best comedy 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel, who plays the colorful public defender in "Picket Fences," set in the 
fictional small town of Rome, Wisconsin, gave the Emmy show one of its high 
points. Said the 72-year-old performer: "I don't care how much time they gave 
me. I waited 51 years to get on this stage." Taylor-Young played the mayor in 
the series before leaving the show recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest ovation of the evening went to Franz when he was announced 
as the actor winner for "NYPD Blue." Insiders thought the race was between him 
and his co-star, David Caruso, who played Detective John Kelly but is leaving 
the series after the fourth episode this fall to make movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso reportedly was rejected in his attempt to get a big salary boost on 
"NYPD Blue," and the news of a split became widely known before Emmy voters 
cast their ballots for the award. He originally did not plan to attend Sunday 
night's awards show but changed his mind, issuing a statement last week that 
said: "I wish to honor my 'NYPD Blue' character, John Kelly." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz, accepting his award, said: "I am extremely touched." In his list of 
thank-yous, he did not mention Caruso. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, the top-rated network, was also the big winner in the Emmy Awards, 
earning 26, including those handed out Saturday night. NBC was second with 14, 
ABC had 13, HBO and PBS tied with eight each and Fox had two. 
</P>
<P>
 For NBC and "Frasier," the Emmy victory was important strategically because, 
starting next week, the successful series has been switched to go head-to-head 
with TV's top-rated hit, ABC's "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 The matchup of the two comedies is considered network TV's battle of the 
season, and "Frasier" got a further upper hand by defeating "Home Improvement" 
in the Emmy competition for best comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Allen, star of "Home Improvement," was a presenter on the Emmy show but 
failed to compete against Grammer because his representatives did not enter his 
nomination in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting his Emmy, Grammer said he felt proud and "most privileged" to be 
working on the show. Director James Burrows, who won a directing Emmy for 
"Frasier," said Grammer was "wearing the mantle of the leading man 
brilliantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the losers was Angela Lansbury who, despite her huge success in CBS' 
"Murder, She Wrote," failed again to get an Emmy. She has never won in 14 
attempts, many of them nominations for the popular show. 
</P>
<P>
 But CBS' David Letterman, whose show has defeated NBC's "Tonight Show with Jay 
Leno" every week in the ratings in their year-long competition, also bested his 
late-night competitor at the Emmys, winning in the category of best variety, 
music or comedy series.

WILSON SIGNS BILL ENDING NO-PANTS RULE FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a victory for working women that might also translate into women's votes, 
Gov. Pete Wilson on Sunday signed into law a bill that bars employers from 
prohibiting women employees from wearing slacks to work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the governor vetoed a measure to allow gay and other unwed 
couples to register with the state as domestic partners and obtain limited 
benefits now reserved for married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women make important business decisions every day," the governor said of his 
signing the bill. "Indeed, working women should be able to make the simple 
choice on the professional business attire they wish to wear." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is running against Democrat Kathleen Brown for reelection and would 
like to get all the women's votes that he can. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the domestic partners bill, Wilson said, "We need to strengthen, not 
weaken, the institution of marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 "Government policy ought not to discount marriage by offering a substitute 
relationship that demands much less -- and provides much less than is needed 
both by the children of such relationships, and ultimately much less than is 
needed by society." 
</P>
<P>
 But he simultaneously issued an executive order allowing competent hospital 
patients to designate whomever they choose as hospital visitors, which was one 
of the aims of the bill he vetoed. It was supported by homosexual groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation to let women wear slacks in the workplace had been killed 
twice on the Senate floor, but its author, Assemblywoman Diane Martinez 
(D-Monterey Park) and other female Assembly members staged a march on the upper 
house to press their case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If women's legs are covered, our brains still function," Martinez said. 
"Women should be judged on their work performance, not whether they wear skirts 
or pants." The women's pants bill had already passed the Assembly by a 42-30 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, effective Jan. 1, also is designed to help stop gender-based 
price discrimination against women. 
</P>
<P>
 It directs the state Board of Barbering and Cosmetology to notify licensees 
that prices for haircuts must be based on the difficulty of providing the cut, 
not whether the customer is a woman or a man. Critics say many women are 
charged far more money than men for haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 After killing the measure twice, the Senate -- in the final hours of the 
just-ended two-year legislative session -- reversed itself and approved an 
amended measure by Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) on a 21-15 vote, the 
bare majority required for passage, to send it to the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), who previously had opposed the legislation on 
grounds that it trivialized advancements made by women, cast the decisive 21st 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also requires the state Department of Consumer Affairs to develop 
information on how to best fight gender-priced discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The domestic partners bill, authored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), 
would have permitted gay and other unwed couples to register with the state as 
domestic partners, and obtain limited benefits now reserved for married 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
 That measure, too, had a rough time in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 It passed the lower house by a 45-26 vote and the Senate by a 21-17 vote. Sen. 
Leroy Greene (D-Sacramento) (D-Carmichael), recovering from surgery, had to 
leave his sickbed to cast the crucial 21st vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejected measure would have established a legal framework for domestic 
partnerships, required hospitals to grant partner visitation rights and changed 
state law relating to wills and conservatorships. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz argued the bill was "critical to the half-million people who live 
together in California and need to know that they can rely on their partner in 
an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the measure charged it would condone homosexuality, erode the 
sanctity of marriage and demean family values. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 federal census showed 495,223 unmarried couples living in California, 
including 93% opposite-sex couples and 7% same-sex couples. Of the total number 
of unmarried couples, about 7% are senior-citizen couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, in a statement blasting the governor, called the veto message 
"gobbledygook," and a smoke screen to avoid the real issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pathetic, but not surprising, that the governor would ignore the needs 
of 1 million Californians, many of them low and middle-income seniors, to 
mollify the religious right," the Southern California lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the difference between a leader and an also-ran, and it's sad that he 
didn't have the guts to stand up for what's right." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie McBride, the executive director of the sponsoring Lobby for Individual 
Freedom and Equality, Inc., expressed "grave disappointment" at the veto. "It 
was a opportunity for the governor to exercise real leadership in way that 
would truly support all of California's families."

ALPHA BETA AND RALPHS MERGER EXPECTED SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that would create Southern California's largest supermarket chain 
and remove familiar names from the local grocery scene, Ralphs Grocery Co. and 
the owner of Alpha Beta stores are expected to announce a $2.5-billion merger 
on Tuesday, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal between Ralphs Grocery Co. and Yucaipa Cos., which also owns the Boys 
and Viva chains and Food 4 Less warehouse stores, would be the largest 
supermarket merger in California history, creating a grocery giant that would 
surpass longtime leader Vons in sales and store sites. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agreement is finalized today, the companies expect to merge their 
operations in November or December, and Yucaipa would convert all of its Alpha 
Beta, Boys and Viva markets to either Ralphs or Food 4 Less warehouse stores, 
sources said. Currently, there are 131 Alpha Beta, 24 Boys and 15 Viva stores. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, 10 to 30 of the 167 Ralphs stores would be converted to Food 
4 Less warehouse stores to meet growing demand for discount prices and an 
anticipated challenge from Wal-Mart, sources said. Wal-Mart is expected to open 
a number of California grocery operations under its "superstore" format over 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the merger goes forward, the combined company, which would be called Ralphs 
Grocery Co., may close some poorly performing stores and eliminate some jobs as 
it consolidates operations. Yucaipa and Ralphs have not decided how many jobs 
would be eliminated or which stores would close. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland chains controlled by Yucaipa are operated by La Habra-based Food 
4 Less Supermarkets, which is valued at about $1 billion. Yucaipa would acquire 
Ralphs stock from DeBartolo Corp., an Ohio-based real estate development firm 
that controls Ralphs, under the expected agreement. Yucaipa would assume $1 
billion of Ralphs debt and pay about $500 million to Ralphs shareholders, 
making the total value of the merger $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors of Food 4 Less Supermarkets Inc. and the directors of 
Compton-based Ralphs have already approved the merger, but the deal won't be 
final until it is approved by all Ralphs shareholders, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an agreement would face antitrust scrutiny by the state attorney general 
and the Federal Trade Commission. The merger would create a vast chain 
controlling about 27% of the California market. Among the major competitors are 
Vons, the current Southland leader with 19% of the market, Lucky, Albertson's, 
Hughes, Stater Bros. and Smith Food & Drug. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, some local supermarket chains have been forced to pare down 
merger plans in the face of opposition by regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Alpha Beta's former corporate parent, American Stores, was 
permitted to merge Alpha Beta stores with Lucky in Northern California in 1991, 
but was forced to sell 145 Alpha Beta stores in Southern California to Yucaipa 
on antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sources at Ralphs and Food 4 Less Supermarkets have said the proposed 
merger would not be a violation of antitrust laws because competition in 
Southern California has been increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many antitrust experts believe that Ralphs and Food 4 Less will be forced to 
sell some of its stores but that authorities will allow the merger because the 
Southland has one of the most competitive supermarket environments in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission approve the 
merger, it would mark the end of Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alpha Beta was established in 1915, it immediately took a novel approach: 
The food retailer was established as a self-service market with products 
stocked alphabetically to help customers find what they wanted. Hence the name, 
Alpha Beta, the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, however, the company lost its distinctive reputation and 
became an also-ran in the Southland's supermarket industry wars. Analysts said, 
among other things, that Alpha Beta relied too long on stores that were built 
in the early 1960s and that later were surpassed by competition from chains 
with bigger, more-modern stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet its corporate parent, Salt Lake City-based American Stores, often was 
preoccupied with its supermarkets in other parts of the country. By 1988, 
American decided to buy Southern California's more vigorous Lucky Stores chain 
and to place Alpha Beta under Lucky management to revive the faltering stores. 
Later, when the California attorney general's office objected to the merger, 
American decided to keep the Lucky stores and sell the Southern California 
Alpha Beta operations to Yucaipa. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys, founded in 1924, and Viva, established in 1987, were both acquired by 
Yucaipa in 1989 and placed under the Food 4 Less Supermarkets roof. Until 
recently, Food 4 Less Supermarkets was the only major supermarket company 
willing to maintain a large presence in South Los Angeles and other communities 
with large minority populations.

JESSICA TANDY, STAR OF STAGE, SCREEN AND TV, DIES AT 85; THEATER: THE ORIGINAL 
BLANCHE DUBOIS WENT ON TO WIN AN OSCAR FOR 'DRIVING MISS DAISY.' SHE SUCCUMBS 
TO CANCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From a Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jessica Tandy, the versatile dramatic actress who electrified Broadway 
audiences as the original Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams' classic "A 
Streetcar Named Desire," and went on to wider fame decades later as the 
Oscar-winning heroine of the film "Driving Miss Daisy," died Sunday. She was 
85. 
</P>
<P>
 She died at the Connecticut home she shared with her actor husband Hume Cronyn 
after a four-year battle with ovarian cancer. Cronyn was at her side, the 
couple's publicist, Leslee Dart, said in announcing the death. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Tandy died on the day of an Emmy Awards ceremony in which she and Cronyn 
were nominated as best lead actress and actor in a miniseries or special for 
their CBS movie, "To Dance with the White Dog." 
</P>
<P>
 She did not win the Emmy in her category, but Cronyn did in his. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the ceremonies, actor John Lithgow delivered a tribute to her and 
said, "Your friends in television say goodby to you tonight. We will all miss 
you very, very much." The audience observed a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Tandy won her best actress Academy Award in 1990 for her portrayal of a 
Southern Jewish dowager in "Driving Miss Daisy," a film that charmed audiences 
around the world. But long before, Miss Tandy had more than established herself 
by winning three of the coveted Tony Awards for dramatic acting in legitimate 
theater. She was a veteran of more than 150 roles on stage, screen, radio and 
television in a career that spanned nearly seven decades. 
</P>
<P>
 For 52 of those years, she was married to Cronyn, with whom she performed in 
several plays and films, including the 1985 movie "Cocoon" and its sequel, 
"Cocoon: The Return." 
</P>
<P>
 The two were often called the "first couple of the American theater," and both 
were named to the Theatre Hall of Fame in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, the couple, and particularly Miss Tandy, seemed busier 
than successful performers half their ages. Miss Tandy, who appeared in six 
films since 1985 -- including her 1991 co-starring role in "Fried Green 
Tomatoes" for which she was nominated for another Oscar -- seemed determined 
not to retire. In 1988, she was honored by the American Academy of Dramatic 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who once described acting as "the breath of life to me" was born in 
London on June 7, 1909. Much of her childhood was spent in poverty. Her father 
died when she was 12, and her mother took extra clerical and night teaching 
jobs to save enough money to send her young daughter to private school and then 
to London's Ben Greet Academy of Acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Tandy developed an interest in the theater through her mother, who, 
feeling the girl was too young to stay home alone, took her along to the adult 
night school where she taught. To pass time, the child enrolled in a 
Shakespeare appreciation class with students more than twice her age. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother also routinely took her and her two brothers to plays, pantomimes 
and museums. "It sounds terribly snobbish, but she raised us to be 
intellectually above our neighbors," Miss Tandy later recalled, adding, "I 
didn't date, ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother encouraged her interest in acting, she said, "as a dignified way 
for me out of our bleak life." 
</P>
<P>
 When Miss Tandy was 18, in 1927, she made her professional debut in a 
Soho-district theater in London, winning a role that paid two pounds a week. 
The part called for five elegant costumes, which she was expected to provide. 
Unable to buy them, she sewed them herself. 
</P>
<P>
 She first gained recognition as a gifted actress in 1932, in a London play 
called "Children in Uniform," and that same year, married British actor Jack 
Hawkins. The marriage lasted eight years and produced a daughter, Susan. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Tandy's reputation was enhanced by other roles -- as Ophelia in John 
Gielgud's 1934 production of "Hamlet," opposite Laurence Olivier in "Henry V" 
in 1937, and again with Gielgud, playing Cordelia in "King Lear" in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 While still based in London, she appeared on the New York stage four times, in 
two short-lived plays in 1930, and more successfully in 1938 and 1939. In 1940, 
when her marriage to Hawkins ended, she moved permanently to New York City with 
her daughter and became an American citizen in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who had said, 'We long to have you here,' disappeared into the 
woodwork," she said in a later interview. She was cast in minor roles in minor 
plays, and had trouble making ends meet. "That was a tough time," she recalled. 
"It mattered terribly that I should make a living and I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1942, she married Cronyn. The couple moved to Hollywood because 
Cronyn had won a role in his first film, Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow of a 
Doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 While Cronyn was successful and in great demand as a character actor, Miss 
Tandy was, as she put it, "rather unused." Her husband arranged a supporting 
role for her in a film he was doing, "The Seventh Cross" (1944), and she gave 
birth to a son, Christopher, in 1943, and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 She had some small roles in "Valley of Decision" (1945), "Dragonwyck" (1946) 
and "The Green Years" (1946). "Nobody out there really took me seriously as an 
actress," Miss Tandy said years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Her career revived on Broadway in 1947, when she originated the role of 
Blanche DuBois opposite Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski in the now classic 
Broadway production of "A Streetcar Named Desire." Her casting came about after 
Cronyn directed his wife in one of Williams' one-act plays, "Portrait of a 
Madonna," in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was having trouble casting his frail and tragic Southern belle, 
Blanche, until he saw Miss Tandy perform. Williams journeyed by train to see 
her and later wrote: "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was 
Blanche." Miss Tandy's portrayal of Blanche in the play established her as one 
of the world's most renowned actresses, and earned her a first Tony Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing Blanche changed my life," she said in a 1983 interview. "It brought 
me back to the theater. . . . 'Streetcar' gave back the challenge and the 
challenge has never left." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, however, was still years away from appreciating her talents. 
</P>
<P>
 She did have supporting roles in "Forever Amber" (1947), "A Woman's Vengeance" 
(1948) and two other films in 1951. But when "Streetcar" was made into a movie 
in 1951, Vivien Leigh was cast as Blanche. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Tandy returned to Broadway and joined her husband in what was to be their 
first joint triumph, "The Fourposter," a two-character comedy about a 35-year 
marriage. It ran on Broadway for two years and led to both a radio and 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Tandy also won critical acclaim on Broadway in "Five Finger Exercise" in 
1959, and in Edward Albee's "A Delicate Balance" in 1966. She was awarded a 
second Tony for "The Gin Game" in 1977 and a third for "Foxfire" in 1982. She 
also won an Emmy in 1988 as best actress in a miniseries or special for the CBS 
television version of "Foxfire." She was cast opposite Cronyn in both plays. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1982 review, New York Times critic Frank Rich wrote: "Everything this 
actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should 
be allowed to write about her." 
</P>
<P>
 She appeared in several more films as well, including "The Birds" (1963), 
"Butley" (1974) and "Honky Tonk Freeway" (1981). Then starting at age 76, Miss 
Tandy had a starring role in "Cocoon" (1985), which became a major hit, and 
followed that with "Batteries Not Included" (1987), "The House on Carroll 
Street" (1988), "Cocoon: The Return" (1988) and, of course, "Driving Miss 
Daisy" in 1989. The last she called "by far the best movie role I ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose I feel rediscovered," she said in 1990. And when informed that at 
80 she was the oldest person to win an Oscar, Miss Tandy replied: "Well, good 
for me!" 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband maintained a home in Connecticut, an apartment in 
Manhattan and a rental home on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma. Although 
there were times when either her career or Cronyn's dominated the other, Miss 
Tandy told the Chicago Tribune in 1990: "I don't think we've ever been in 
competition with each other. . . . On the whole, we've kept pretty even. One of 
the reasons the marriage has been successful, I think, is that it was the 
second for each of us. I think there are different expectations. Each of us 
originally married far too young, and it didn't work. But I think this one is 
going to last." 
</P>
<P>
 After the actress played Miss Daisy, a New York Times interviewer asked her 
about old age, and dying. Before replying she put a hand on her forehead and 
closed her eyes. "At my age," she said, "I do wonder what the end would be. I 
hope against hope it will be quick. . . . But of course you have no control 
over any of this. I don't know how much longer I can go on. And I do hope I 
have the sense to know when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks earlier, however, the veteran performer told another reporter just 
as earnestly: "I find that what makes life worth living is the work. I'd like 
to do another play, another film. It doesn't have to be a big part. Just a good 
part. . . ."

CHRISTOPHER CALLS FOR UNITY ON HAITI; CARIBBEAN: GOP LEADERS REJECT CONSENSUS 
APPEAL, PLEDGE TO CONFRONT ADMINISTRATION. SECRETARY OF STATE ACKNOWLEDGES 
PUBLIC IS RELUCTANT TO INTERVENE MILITARILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher called Sunday for national unity behind 
President Clinton's plan to use U.S. troops if necessary to expel Haiti's 
current regime -- but leading Republicans in Congress pledged to challenge the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I would urge at the present time is that people recognize the 
importance of unity in this situation if we are to persuade (Lt.) Gen. Raoul 
Cedras and Mr. Michel-Joseph Francois to leave of their own accord," 
Christopher said. Army commander Cedras led the coup that drove democratically 
elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power in September, 1991, and 
Francois is the feared police chief of Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders rejected the appeal for consensus and instead pledged to 
confront the Clinton Administration in Congress. Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) said lawmakers will seek a formal debate on the invasion idea and 
will challenge the President's intention to use military force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to have a debate. . . . If they're not going to find out from 
anybody else, at least Congress ought to be out there trying to inform the 
American people. Is there any real national interest in Haiti?" Dole said on 
CBS' "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a United States invasion will do anything but, over time, 
exacerbate their (Haitians') problems rather than help them," said Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona, a Republican member of the Armed Services Committee and a 
former Vietnam prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher acknowledged that the public is still "reluctant" to intervene in 
Haiti, according to recent polls. But he said Clinton may have to proceed with 
an invasion anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes a President has a responsibility," Christopher said. "He has to do 
what is in the nation's interest, and I think that if it comes the time when we 
have to use military force, President Clinton will explain carefully and fully 
to the American people what the reasons are, and I hope and believe we'll have 
their support at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole predicted that the invasion plan would lose if it came to a vote in the 
Senate now, in part because the White House has not properly consulted 
lawmakers on the justification for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President would lose because he has not made the case," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the Administration has 
consulted more than 75 times with small and large congressional delegations 
this year alone. He and other Administration officials echoed the traditional 
executive-branch position that the President has the authority to order 
military action without congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension underscored the wide divide that remains between the White House 
and Congress on Haiti even as officials indicated that a possible U.S.-led 
attack against the military junta is nearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said Sunday that he thinks the Administration has made up its mind and 
that the invasion will begin in the next two or three weeks. Madeleine 
Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said that the time for an 
invasion is close, while Christopher said diplomatic efforts have now been 
"exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is running out" for Haiti's top military leaders, Christopher said. "I 
hope they leave very promptly, but their days are numbered and they will leave 
one way or another, either soft or hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has said Clinton will begin a renewed effort to outline his 
position and intentions this week. So far there has been no sustained White 
House public education effort on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last month, the Cuban refugee crisis and the legislative struggles 
with the crime bill and health reform plan have distracted national attention 
from the approaching Haiti confrontation and may have precluded the kind of 
support-building blitz that then-President George Bush waged before the Panama 
and Persian Gulf military actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also rejected recent charges by former Vice President Dan Quayle 
and former presidential candidate Ross Perot that Clinton wants to use an 
invasion to boost his political standing just weeks before midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing of it is really dictated by what's going on in Haiti. We seem to 
be running out of other options," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Administration is facing continued skepticism about its position on 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 McCain said an invasion would be harmful to U.S. foreign policy interests in 
the short term and unsuccessful in Haiti over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. forces and materiel dwarf the 7,000-member Haitian military, the 
United States is unlikely to be able to pacify the country, he said. Cedras and 
his supporters would eventually melt into the population and foment resistance 
and a repetition of the turmoil witnessed during the 1915-34 U.S. occupation, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCain also said the President lacks domestic support for military 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us in Congress, with the exception of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
are strenuously opposed or at least have strong reservations about the possible 
intervention. . . . Basically, there is no exit strategy and (it) clearly is a 
United States operation with a very small fig leaf of 266 (Caribbean) troops 
who we're in the process of training now," McCain said on "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 The embattled Haiti policy also took some hits from the Democratic side 
Sunday, as Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine said he would 
prefer to have the President go before Congress before taking military action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President should seek congressional approval, even though it's not legal 
or necessary, to build support in the country. But no President has ever agreed 
with me, and I don't think this one does either," Mitchell said on "Face the 
Nation."

HUGHES TO SHUT FULLERTON PLANT, SOURCES REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE and KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co. will announce today that its sprawling, 37-year-old 
Fullerton aerospace complex will be effectively shut down over the next two 
years and most of the plant's 6,800 workers either transferred or laid off, 
according to sources knowledgeable about the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "An awful lot of good people aren't going to survive this," said a well-placed 
source, adding that some workers would be transferred to Hughes sites in El 
Segundo and Long Beach, while others would retire or lose their jobs. The 
source didn't know how many layoffs are expected at the Fullerton facility, 
which opened in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will close more than a dozen major buildings at the 350-acre 
Fullerton complex, leaving open only two leased buildings where up to 700 
employees now work, sources said. The vacated buildings and the land, which the 
company owns, are expected to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 After four months of secrecy and speculation, the announcement will end an 
anxious wait for workers, local officials and business leaders who had lobbied 
Hughes to keep open the city's largest employer, which generates millions of 
dollars in tax revenue and paychecks. Economic losses from the closure are 
expected to ripple across Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The action offers Hughes two tempting benefits: consolidation of operations 
amid continuing defense cutbacks and sale of prime real estate in Fullerton 
valued at more than $75 million. All that Hughes would retain there are two 
leased structures: Buildings 675 and 676, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The venerable aerospace giant manufactures ship-based radar, air traffic 
control equipment and large-scale air-defense systems, among them NATO's 
European air defense system. The decision to close the Fullerton plant is part 
of a broader companywide reorganization that will involve shutting down 
another, still-undisclosed facility in Southern California, according to a 
source. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was bracing for the announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what we feared," said Frank M. Reid, executive vice president of the 
Fullerton Chamber of Commerce, after learning about the pending announcement. 
"It's their business decision and it's one they had to make. We're going to 
miss them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the firm's plans remained largely concealed from company employees 
and local officials, city representatives were scheduled to meet with Hughes 
executives after a scheduled 10 a.m. announcement to employees -- a private 
session seen as an indication that work at the plant will be significantly 
scaled back or shut down entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials had asked Fullerton police to send an officer to monitor 
response to the announcement, to be delivered by Hughes Chairman C. Michael 
Armstrong over closed-circuit television to plants in Fullerton as well as El 
Segundo and Long Beach, where cutbacks were also feared. Police said the action 
was merely a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lary D. Smith, a business area manager and nine-year Hughes employee, said he 
would be relieved at whatever the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just want to know so they can get on with their lives. 
Everything's been on hold; it's been an anxious period," he said Sunday as he 
headed into Building 600, the oldest on the complex. The Fullerton resident 
said he was prepared for the news either way: "I'll work wherever I'm needed." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the plant closes, it's going to really hurt. This is going to really hurt 
all of Fullerton," said Dorothy Petsas, co-owner of the Sunny Hills Cafe, a 
local restaurant that daily serves lunch to about 50 Hughes employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors about the plant's future have swirled like milkshakes at the 
restaurant, which has already felt the effects of previous cutbacks at the 
complex. Diners no longer have to wait in line for tables, one result of cuts 
in the Hughes work force, which has gone from a high of about 15,000 workers in 
the mid-1980s to 6,800. About 800 of those live in Fullerton, said Mayor A. B. 
(Buck) Catlin, himself a former Hughes engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 3-million-square-foot Fullerton plant, Hughes has two complexes in 
El Segundo -- with 7,800 employees and a combined working area of 3.3 million 
square feet -- and a smaller, leased plant in Long Beach that employs 970 
workers. Altogether, the company has 34,000 employees in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The four defense facilities considered for consolidation are part of Hughes 
Aerospace & Electronics Co., a corporate division formed in March. The 
consolidation, first mentioned to workers in April, reflects the latest efforts 
by Hughes to simplify its operations in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm already shut plants in Canoga Park, San Diego and elsewhere over the 
past two years, consolidating missile operations and reaping greatly increased 
profits as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutdown of the Fullerton plant would take up to two years in order to 
allow the company to finish projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant was considered vulnerable because of its potential for residential 
development. Hughes was already seeking permission to develop a portion of the 
property with houses. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that while a closure would be a severe blow to the local 
economy, Hughes is not the only big employer in town. Cal State Fullerton, the 
second-largest employer, has 2,100 workers, and Hunt-Wesson Foods Inc. employs 
1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like a fish-packing plant in Alaska closing and shutting the town 
down," said City Council member Chris Norby. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's big." 
</P>

AFRICAN AMERICANS AIDING RWANDANS FIND SPECIAL TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spanish nuns, Swedish civil defense workers, French doctors have come to bind 
this nation's wounds, hug its orphans and mend its schools. But for one small 
group of Americans, the sense of duty and dedication is as personal as their 
genes and family tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Their skin, like that of the Rwandans, is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, when we made that 'middle passage' to America, it didn't sever our 
ties or our responsibilities," Cary Alan Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating out of a Greek restaurant on the outskirts of this capital, the 
contagiously enthusiastic 34-year-old New Yorker and the rest of the small 
local staff of Africare, the oldest and largest African American nonprofit 
organization assisting Africa, are doing what they can to revive a battered 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Elton King, an accountant and Africare's director of management services, had 
already spent 18 1/2 years on this continent as a Peace Corps administrator and 
roving trouble-shooter. But the lanky, gray-haired 59-year-old left his home in 
Silver Spring, Md., and the company of his wife and his three daughters last 
month to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole life has been spent working with Africa," King reflects in a mellow, 
Southern-accented voice. "For me, there's a spiritual dimension to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Peace Corps retiree personifies the unique mix that Africare can offer: 
Yankee managerial talent and know-how coupled with a keen dedication to helping 
the lands where many Americans' ancestors were captured, clamped in irons and 
shipped through the "middle passage" to the sugar and cotton plantations of the 
New World. 
</P>
<P>
 Africare's call for Rwanda aid has already elicited more than $100,000 in 
donations, as well as food and clothing, from across the United States, King 
and Johnson say. The Detroit chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement 
of Colored People has shipped vehicles to replace cars that disappeared in a 
citywide orgy of looting here this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Artists for Africa and the distinguished African American poet Maya 
Angelou, who read a poem at President Clinton's inauguration, have also helped 
marshal support to deal with Africa's latest humanitarian emergency, Johnson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 In consultation with Africare, the staff of the hospital at Howard University, 
one of the most distinguished of America's black institutions of higher 
learning, offered to assemble a medical team because many of Rwanda's health 
professionals are now dead or in refugee camps outside its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We especially need nurses, midwives and midwife trainers," Johnson says. "As 
quickly as possible, we want to restore the capacity of the Rwandan health 
system to function on its own." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 130 children now at Les Hirondelles orphanage in Kigali, Africare's 
staff has bought plastic dishes and silverware and an electric generator, and 
paid to repair a roof damaged by a mortar round. They'll be driving to Kampala, 
Uganda, soon to buy shoes for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two weeks, two African American nurses and a social worker are expected 
to arrive to care for the boys and girls who lost their parents in Rwanda's 
genocidal massacres and civil war, Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many foreign charities or aid organizations that responded to Rwanda's 
emergency, Africare is no newcomer to this former Belgian colony in Central 
Africa. Since 1984, when it began a U.S. government-financed refugee 
resettlement project on the Rwandan-Tanzanian border, Africare has run many 
small-scale, self-help, rural development projects, from beekeeping to 
goat-breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that many of the organizations are here to respond to the emergency," 
says Johnson, who until last month worked for the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, managing aid deliveries to some of the 1.2 million 
Rwandans who fled to camps in Zaire. "But when the world's attention has 
shifted to other crises, we want to make sure the pieces are in place to help 
Rwanda rebuild in a long-term, sustainable way." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, though, Africare is focusing on aiding children orphaned by 
the war. It also hopes to get funding from the U.S. Agency for International 
Development to pay for rebuilding and restaffing two medical clinics in the 
hills near Kigali that were looted and damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Africare will seek U.S. government aid funds to pay for carting away 
the trash that has been mounting on many Kigali street corners since the 
bloodshed erupted in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Africare was founded in 1971 as a response to the terrible drought then 
afflicting the Sahel, the band of sparse grassland that lies south of the 
Sahara. C. Payne Lucas, the former Peace Corps director for Africa, was the 
driving force. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus was intended to be unique. Africare was created as a vehicle for 
African Americans to help Africans transform their societies to withstand 
disasters like droughts or famines. Also, it was meant to be a forum where 
African Americans could interact with Africans and discover, or rediscover, 
their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's headquarters, Africare House, was intentionally built in an 
inner-city, working-class neighborhood on R Street in northwest Washington, 
D.C., to, in Johnson's words, "bridge the gap" between visiting African leaders 
and black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald F. McHenry, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is now a 
research professor of diplomacy and international affairs at Georgetown 
University, serves as the nonprofit organization's chairman. It now directs 
assistance programs in 27 African countries, from Senegal to Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, when Rwanda was swept by massacres of the minority Tutsis by the 
dominant Hutus and a dormant civil war flared back into life, most of 
Africare's local staff were killed or fled. According to King, the organization 
lost $137,000 that it had in Rwandan banks; two offices and two houses; four or 
five vehicles, and furniture, refrigerators and computers worth thousands of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Its two American staff members left in a hurry to escape the fighting and 
massacres. Soldiers from the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front, the victors in 
the civil war, took over the main office. Only the desks, file folders and some 
of the file cabinets could be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 To rebuild from the shambles, King flew back Aug. 8 -- and was aghast at what 
he found. "To come to a country that has no running water, no telephone -- hold 
it -- you look around, and it's like being in the desert," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stroke of luck, King met a Rwandan of Greek origin, who because of the 
turmoil and looting was eager to rent his hillside restaurant for $4,000 a 
month and leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Africare set up its headquarters in the restaurant's spacious sunken dining 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has hired six Rwandan employees and will add more when it begins 
implementing its projects. 
</P>
<P>
 For Johnson, a Brooklyn native who was named Africare's full-time, salaried 
representative for Rwanda on Aug. 25, helping Africans help themselves has been 
a rich discovery of his innermost self. Johnson grew up in the projects of 
Bedford-Stuyvesant, the son of a nurse and a 35-year employee of the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a lot of African American families, we were detached from African 
culture. Back when I was a kid, black people didn't know about Africa, didn't 
care," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His own moment of discovery came when, as a junior at Sarah Lawrence College, 
he decided to spend his junior year abroad at the University of Nairobi, in 
Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got bit by the Africa bug," Johnson says. "Just enjoying the people 
and the life and the lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I got here, I had a real gap in my personality," he says. Africa 
filled it. 
</P>
<P>
 The bearer of a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia 
University, Johnson went to Zaire with the Peace Corps and to other African 
countries as an employee of the U.N. refugee office. When his U.N. superiors 
asked him to go work with refugees in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said no. It just 
didn't have the same "spiritual connection" as similar work in Africa, he 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, King recalls, when he first arrived in the West African country of 
Gabon to work for President John F. Kennedy's fledgling Peace Corps, the 
citizens of newly independent black African countries had doubts about the 
abilities of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd always heard of the whites, that the whites would help," he says. "But 
as they became exposed to us, they very much became our brothers and sisters."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; 'PRO-CONSUMER' CANDIDATES URGE 
OPPOSITE SOLUTIONS; GOP'S QUACKENBUSH WOULD CUT REGULATION TO LURE INSURANCE 
FIRMS TO CALIFORNIA. DEMOCRAT TORRES FAVORS A GET-TOUGH POLICY ON INSURANCE 
RATES AND COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the already intense campaign for state insurance commissioner, both major 
party candidates are presenting themselves as champions of the consumer, each 
promising that ample and inexpensive insurance -- among the biggest household 
expenses for millions of families -- will receive top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush and Democratic state Sen. 
Art Torres enter the electoral ring from vastly different philosophical 
corners. The methods they would employ to assure low rates are diametrically 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush -- the recipient of hundreds of thousands of dollars of insurance 
industry campaign contributions -- would treat the companies with kindness. He 
favors dropping as much of the rate-making regulation prescribed by Proposition 
103 as possible, and trusting free-market forces to assure Californians the 
protection they need at affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres -- only a light recipient of industry contributions -- by contrast 
believes in tight regulation, getting tough with companies when necessary, as a 
sounder way to guarantee that insurers perform in the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush contends, however, that toughness as practiced by the current 
commissioner, John Garamendi, has been counterproductive, causing many insurers 
to leave California or reduce sales here. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few have actually left the state, but many of the 700 or so property 
and casualty insurers operating in California have restricted sales of certain 
kinds of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art Torres wants to socialize insurance, and I want to keep it a private 
venture," Quackenbush said in an interview. "With less regulation, the 
companies would be free to set their own prices, more would enter the state, 
and eventually the prices would come down." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres and his supporters respond that history shows that does not happen. 
They point out that in the years before the passage in 1988 of Proposition 103, 
in a free-market setting, California was one of the states where rates were 
rising the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years after rate regulation was introduced in 1989, California 
became one of only three states where auto insurance liability premiums 
actually went down. That was partly due to rate freezes ordered by Garamendi 
while the courts considered a flood of lawsuits over Proposition 103 and partly 
due to agreement by some companies to give the premium rebates called for in 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures compiled by the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners for 1989-92 
show that while average liability premiums went up by at least 32% in the 10 
most inflationary states, they went down by 0.2% in California in the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of how far regulation should go has become prominent in the 
Torres-Quackenbush fight in the areas of casualty homeowner insurance, 
particularly earthquake coverage. Many insurers have sought to reduce their 
exposure to losses by terminating the sale of earthquake insurance, raising 
deductibles and, in some cases, refusing to renew homeowners policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres has reacted with a far more active approach than Quackenbush. The 
Democratic candidate has called on Gov. Pete Wilson to order a moratorium on 
most non-renewals in homeowners policies, which would force insurers to stay in 
the state and continue covering their California customers. Torres also has 
co-sponsored legislation to give the insurance commissioner power to declare 
such a moratorium, and he supports legislation in Congress to create a 
federally backed national disaster insurance pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush supports only the national insurance pool. He has opposed the 
moratorium and has said he supports "at least a temporary suspension" of the 
state law mandating that all sellers of homeowners policies also offer 
earthquake insurance. In short, he wants less regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The result presents an apparent contradiction for Quackenbush, considering his 
belief that the less regulation there is, the more insurance companies will 
want to remain in California. In this case, withholding regulation would free 
insurers to pull out of the state at will. 
</P>
<P>
 But Torres adopts positions that raise problems, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the senator's past stands, and three bills he has on the governor's 
desk now, indicate that Torres believes in loading up new coverages and 
obligations on the companies without allowing a rise in premium prices to 
defray the additional costs. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, one Torres bill would extend health coverage for hundreds of 
thousands of Californians who have fertility problems, and another would allow 
the scientific and medical communities, rather than insurance companies, to 
decide which expensive new medical treatments are necessary. Quackenbush, like 
most Republicans, voted against both bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush also voted against Torres' so-called Homeowners Bill of Rights, 
also on the governor's desk. Among its provisions is the requirement that the 
companies go to court to justify questioning policyholders under oath to probe 
suspected fraudulent claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush calls that proposal "a trial lawyer's bill" that would increase 
litigation, delay resolution of claims and amount to an impediment to the 
insurers' anti-fraud efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres denied that his measure is a trial lawyer's bill, saying it protects 
policyholders against harassment by the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic candidate accused Quackenbush of hypocrisy in opposing such 
measures. "When he goes out on the road, he says he's for consumers in the free 
marketplace," Torres said. "Yet when he's given an opportunity to vote against 
insurers, he votes for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the disputes, all three of Torres' bills, if signed by the 
governor, could lead to higher payouts by the companies and ultimately increase 
the pressure for higher rates in the fields of property and casualty insurance, 
the areas under insurance commissioner jurisdiction. Health insurance does not 
come under the purview of the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 For auto insurance, Torres has been a major supporter of a "pay-at-the-pump" 
proposal in which motorists would buy coverage with their gasoline. Some 
critics believe that untried approach could add a big everyday insurance cost 
for many, while still requiring most people to buy supplementary coverage for 
full protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Clinton Administration's original health insurance proposals, 
pay-at-the-pump fell by the wayside as fears rose that it could prove more 
costly than the system it sought to replace. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres also faces the problem of keeping the courts on his side. Commissioner 
Garamendi has succeeded in winning several court battles over disputed 
regulations. Perhaps the best example was the recent unanimous state Supreme 
Court decision upholding Garamendi's prescriptions for Proposition 103 rebates 
and future rate approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Torres, if he proves to be more of an industry foe than Garamendi, could 
inspire a new round of court tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry observers believe that regulation might be weak under 
Quackenbush, but under Torres it might be so tough, particularly as pressure 
for a resumption of rate increases intensifies, that court backing could be 
lost, undermining the commissioner's authority to hold insurance insurance 
costs for the consumer in check.

SKULL SESSIONS; BUSY FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGIST CALLS SOUTHLAND 'PRIME TERRITORY' 
FOR HER WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judy Suchey came to California 25 years ago, largely for the bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Suchey studies the bones of the dead, some victims of the region's grisliest 
crimes: the Manson slayings, the Hillside Stranglers murders and other serial 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 For a forensic anthropologist, Suchey said, this is a "dream location." 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California is just prime territory for a person in my profession. 
There's more crime and more bodies just thrown away in remote areas here than 
anywhere in the world. I don't know anyone anywhere who can match the cases 
I've had." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the 51-year-old Suchey has participated in some of California's 
biggest cases while working for coroners in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties: 
</P>
<P>
 * Years after the Tate-LaBianca slayings by the Manson "family," she 
identified the remains of ranch hand Donald (Shorty) Shea, now listed as one of 
the cult's numerous victims. Shea was decapitated and buried on the Manson 
family's Chatsworth property. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Hillside Stranglers case, in which Angelo Buono and his cousin, Kenneth 
Bianchi, sexually tortured and killed nine women in Glendale and then buried 
their bodies on hillsides in 1977 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 1986 Cerritos airline crash, in which 82 people died. Suchey's 
discoveries allowed scientists to identify dozens of victims by linking the 
remains with dental records. 
</P>
<P>
 * The case of Long Beach serial killer Randy Steven Kraft, who deposited his 
victims' bodies along freeways or buried them in remote areas. In 1989, Kraft 
was sentenced to death for the mutilation and murder of 16 men in Orange 
County, although authorities believe he may have killed as many as 67 people in 
three states over 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * The case of "Sunset Strip Killer" Douglas Daniel Clark, whose victims' 
remains were found primarily in Hollywood. Clark was sentenced to death for the 
1980 sex slayings of six women. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Dowell, a criminalist with the Los Angeles County coroner's office, said 
Suchey has earned a worldwide reputation, not only because of her success with 
high-profile cases, but because she created a way to determine sex and age 
through skeletal remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed with another anthropologist and called the Suchey-Brooks standard, 
the technique involves measuring the width, length and thickness of pubic bones 
and applying them to a chart, which is then used to determine sex and age. 
</P>
<P>
 A mounted display in Suchey's office shows that these bones in men differ 
considerably from those of women, and various other markings on the bones can 
indicate approximate age. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Kansas and South Dakota, Suchey (pronounced SUCH-ee) was inspired by 
a college professor to view forensic anthropology as an adventure, then was 
compelled to ply her calling in the state that offered the most promise. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Suchey, whose small office is cluttered with human bones, 
sometimes works 80 to 90 hours a week, including teaching full time at Cal 
State Fullerton. She does that job not because it's lucrative -- it isn't -- 
but because it carries spiritual rewards that examining skeletal remains never 
will, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to look only at dead bodies all the time, it could get really bad," 
she said. "But students are alive and fresh. They're real ." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she lives for the breakthroughs a skilled expert can bring to a murder 
case after detectives have all but given up. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Suchey helped unravel a Griffith Park homicide case that had 
lingered for years. Her work helped determine that the intertwined bodies of an 
embracing couple, with guns pointed at their backs, did not represent a double 
homicide, which police originally had thought, but rather the man shooting the 
woman and vice versa, in virtually the same split-second. 
</P>
<P>
 In Needles, Calif., Suchey helped excavate a handful of bones and identify the 
bodies of a grandfather, his son and grandson years after their small plane had 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheer volume of her work is impressive," Dowell said, "and she's made 
some remarkable discoveries over the years. I've seen her out in the bush, for 
instance, literally up to her neck in poison oak, looking for things that look 
like twigs but aren't twigs -- they're bones." 
</P>
<P>
 Suchey charges less for her services than other independent forensic 
anthropologists because she doesn't want to become dependent on the money from 
that work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being able to say, 'I can't do that now -- I have my teaching job.' 
And why do I need more money?" Suchey said. "I'm single, I don't have children. 
I have two brothers and friends. And a cat. I can't think of any way in which 
money would help my life." 
</P>
<P>
 But Suchey does mind what she calls the woeful amounts paid to government 
pathologists, forensic anthropologists and the like, particularly in Los 
Angeles County, where the workload is relentless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agencies are terribly underfunded, and the L.A. coroner's office is one of 
the worst," she said. "They should have 50% more, but instead, they keep 
getting cut. It's like the difference between me teaching 80 students or 480 in 
one semester." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Suchey said, her own work has taken a physical toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spend a lot of time rappelling mountains," said Suchey, who recently had 
major surgery on each foot after a four-hour hike up Mt. Baldy to reach a crime 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the venom from the bite of a brown recluse spider began to eat away 
at her nose until antibiotics and a hospital stay stemmed the erosion. High 
blood pressure also set in, which doctors blamed on stress. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are emotional repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air crash was the worst situation I'd ever been involved in," she said, 
"because I had no space. I worked at the scene or on small body parts for three 
weeks -- every minute I wasn't teaching. I had no rest at all. It just wasn't 
good. At times, I got to thinking I could see some of the victims walking in 
crowds. You're thinking so much about what you're doing that it's constantly on 
your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to work less, Suchey is writing a book aimed at educating prospective 
forensic scientists. On occasion, she speaks to a mystery writers' group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved in dozens of terrible scenes," she said, "where you know 
someone was tortured and then killed, and it's the middle of the night, the 
moon is out, and there you are, working on a body. You begin to feel you're 
working out of a novel. Most of the time it's dry, clear-cut and scientific, 
but once in a while, strange things happen, and you begin to think, 'This is 
really weird, and here I am, right in the middle of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One incident occurred a few years ago in a remote desert. Suchey found deep 
depressions in the soil and a mummified body. She concluded the victim had been 
tortured because of the condition of the bones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get there until 2 or 3 in the afternoon, and even by nightfall, we 
hadn't finished," she said. "It got stranger and stranger the more we worked. 
Parts of skin at the victim's finger pads had been cut away and were floating 
about . . . the kind of thing murder mysteries are made of, except it was 
happening for real." 
</P>
<P>
 Although breakthroughs occur, Suchey's work yields its share of 
disappointments. Not long ago, she discovered the remains of a young woman in 
Indio and thought it might be homicide victim Denise Huber, who was then listed 
only as missing. Huber's body was later discovered in a freezer in Arizona. The 
Indio body has not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tremendous amount of bodies are just never identified," she said. "And 
there's a tremendous amount of crime. People don't realize it until one of 
their relatives is killed." 
</P>
<P>
 So in terms of offering a laboratory, California is second to none, she noted, 
shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it threatens to be that way for a long time to come. Believe me, the 
people in my field have no shortage of work. All that crime just won't let us 
rest."

STRIKE THREATENED AS TEAMSTERS REJECT OFFER BY LUCKY STORES; LABOR: THE TWO 
SIDES CONTINUE TALKS WITH A FEDERAL MEDIATOR AS THEIR CONTRACT EXPIRES. THE 
MAIN ISSUE IS JOB SECURITY FOR WAREHOUSE AND DELIVERY WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of Teamsters unanimously rejected the latest contract offer by Lucky 
Stores, increasing the chance of a strike by the 1,695 workers who warehouse 
and deliver goods to the chain's 235 supermarkets throughout Southern 
California, the union reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at the behest of a federal mediator, both sides continued to meet 
late Sunday, and Teamsters leaders told their members to report to work as 
usual today. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract between Lucky and Teamsters Local 952, representing warehouse 
workers and truck drivers, expired today at 12:01 a.m. Union leaders left open 
the possibility that they could call a strike at any time after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Other options are boycotting Lucky without a work stoppage or extending the 
current contract until a new agreement is reached -- a step usually taken when 
a settlement appears imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sunday, the two sides were still far apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been very, very, very little headway," said Ed Mireles, head of 
Teamsters Local 952, as workers jammed into the union hall here to vote on the 
contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing with substance," Mireles said of the latest offer, which came 
after more than 20 hours of talks that began Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Decker, a Lucky spokeswoman, said: "There's been some movement on the 
company's side; I don't know about the union side." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she remained hopeful that a settlement could be reached. "They're 
making some progress. That's why they're talking again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters and Lucky, the No. 2 supermarket chain in the Southland, have 
not been wrangling over wages and benefits. Rather, they have been deadlocked 
since mid-July over the company's ability to move distribution and warehouse 
work out of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Lucky operated three distribution centers in Orange County, where 
workers are represented by Teamsters Local 952, to service all of Lucky's 
Southern California stores and 20 in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucky recently opened a warehouse in Fontana, and the company has shifted 
liquor products there from its warehouse in Buena Park. Lucky workers in 
Fontana, represented by a separate Teamsters local, make $4.60 an hour less 
than workers doing the equivalent jobs at an hourly pay of $16.60 in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky has said it needs the flexibility to operate more efficiently. But Local 
952 says the shift in liquor products will cost the jobs of at least 22 
members. Moreover, it threatens long-term job security because Lucky could move 
more work to Fontana or other lower-wage warehouses, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't take a stand now, we could be gone 10 years from now," said Don 
Brewster, a union steward at Lucky's warehouse in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side disclosed details of the rejected offer, but the Teamsters' 
Mireles said it was well short of the union's goal of obtaining clear language 
that would preserve jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other issues were likely to fall into place once the dispute over job security 
was resolved, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, Teamsters Local 952 ironed out an agreement with 
Albertson's, leaving only Lucky among the major supermarket chains in the 
region without a settlement.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: 'CYNICAL' PRESS JUST REFLECTS WHAT IT COVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasurer Kathleen Brown, stumping through Northern California aboard her 
campaign bus, recently complained to a veteran newspaper reporter that the only 
people she was having trouble reaching were the likes of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time with the political press," she told William Endicott, 
Capitol bureau chief for the Sacramento Bee. "I can't get through to you guys. 
You're cynical. You're tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, columnist George Will on ABC's Brinkley show responded to 
such gripes from politicians. Comedian Lily Tomlin, he noted, "plays a bag lady 
and one of the bag lady's wise remarks is, 'No matter how cynical you get, you 
can't keep up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and other politicians are constantly proving the wisdom of the bag lady. 
Their cynical machinations this year are racing beyond even normal 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How can any rational person, for example, read anything but cynicism into 
Brown's recent promise, if elected governor, to convene her new Cabinet and 
hopefully the Legislature in Los Angeles? She wants "to focus the full 
attention and resources of the state on the Basin's recovery," the candidate 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers shell out generously to headquarter elected state officials and 
their staffs in Sacramento. There's a computer on virtually every desk capable 
of spewing data by the barrel. There are scores of meeting rooms, all sizes. 
Experts and special interests long ago learned how to get here from Los 
Angeles; it's an hour flight. Logically, any government solutions can be 
devised more efficiently at the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 What Sacramento doesn't have that Los Angeles County does, however, is 
one-third of the state's voters. Add in Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties -- the Los Angeles Basin -- and it's half. Brown is running a regional 
campaign strategy, and you don't need to be much of a cynic to see the 
posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 And if she's elected, what better place to launch an administration than in 
the state's TV capital? Brown envisions all those cameras spotlighting her 
first weeks in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this is merely a next-generation version of Gov. Pete Wilson's 
cynical staging of a "crime summit" for Los Angeles TV last February. He 
actually adopted the idea from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's economic summit 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in fact, is no laggard at cynical politics: All those anti-crime 
"strike" bills and the incessant photo ops signing them, last spring's ugly TV 
ads depicting illegal immigrants racing across the border, counting funny money 
from Washington to balance the state budget. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Rep. Mike (formerly Michael) Huffington, who is asking to 
represent California in the U.S. Senate after having lived in the state only 
three years. He's done little as a one-term congressman. But he's apparently 
willing to spend unlimited millions of his own fortune to buy a Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Political cynicism is not bounded by ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is there's a circle of cynicism in our society that includes not 
just political writers and politicians but the public. Pundits react cynically 
to the cynical actions of politicians, who desperately hunt for gimmicks to 
entice an increasingly cynical public. And too often the more cynical the 
gimmick -- such as a cheap-shot ad -- the more successful the politician, which 
intensifies cynicism all around. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the bag lady, citizen cynics can't keep up. But they can turn off, and 
many do, as shown by low voter turnouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Estrich, who managed Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential race and now is 
a USC law professor, says, "The problem is everybody wants to win. It probably 
would be foolhardy to run a different kind of campaign. Everybody sits around 
and says, 'This is all well and good, but we need to run the negative ad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally cynical," she adds. "I'm cynical about most of what I hear in 
conventional political discourse and cynical of the motives. And I'm 
increasingly distressed by what I consider the failure of democracy on a daily 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Estrich blames talk radio for feeding voter cynicism and laments the breakdown 
of traditional political institutions -- parties and unions. Today, she says, 
"the voters' link to politics is liable to be the local radio host." 
</P>
<P>
 Political cynicism isn't new. Candidates used to wear Indian head bonnets and 
kiss babies. But public cynicism soared after Vietnam and Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown is right. We're all cynical and tired -- tired of the babble 
and the gimmicks. Candidates could refreshen us with some serious and 
substantive discourse.

AMID CROATS' ADULATION, POPE RENEWS CALLS FOR PEACE; BALKANS: HE TELLS CROWD 
'HISTORIC REALISM' REQUIRES ACCOMMODATION AMONG WARRING ETHNIC GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pope John Paul II climaxed his first visit to the former Yugoslav federation 
Sunday amid the electric adulation of hundreds of thousands of followers and 
sobering new calls for Balkan peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The 74-year-old pontiff was strong-voiced at a three-hour Mass in this capital 
of predominantly Roman Catholic Croatia, but he maneuvered with difficulty on a 
right leg broken in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leg troubles him, but his spirits are very high," said the Rev. Roberto 
Tucci, a senior papal aide. 
</P>
<P>
 An elevator at the back of a three-story papal altar at the racetrack here 
spared John Paul the steep, 27-step climb, and aides helped him in and out of 
cars and his Popemobile. 
</P>
<P>
 But the strain of the journey showed in his face. Italian photographers who 
take pictures of the Pope for a living returned from a morning photo session at 
the presidential palace with sadness in their eyes. "He doesn't look good at 
all," one photographer said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul looked very good, by contrast, to jubilant Croats who applauded 
every step of the first Pope to visit a city where Christianity came 900 years 
ago. Organizers estimated the racetrack crowd at between 500,000 and 750,000 -- 
cowled, contemplative nuns, young people in peasant dress, city families, the 
disabled in wheelchairs and big, young soldiers in berets, all basking in the 
chords of a 230-voice choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing them, the green-robed John Paul made the most of his stay in the 
only part of the former Yugoslav federation he has been able to visit; the Pope 
is not welcome among Serbian leaders in Belgrade, and security concerns forced 
him to scrap last week's scheduled visit to Sarajevo, the capital of war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raise up your ardent and trusting plea for peace," the Pope urged in a Mass 
homily he delivered in Serbo-Croatian and directed not only to Croats but also 
to Serbs and Muslims. "The present tragic division and tensions must not make 
us forget that there are many elements today that unite the people at war. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "Peace in the Balkans -- I emphasize strongly in this time of suffering -- is 
not a utopia! Rather, it is necessary from the point of view of historic 
realism." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope won his biggest applause when he drew an analogy between religious 
faith and the Sava River, which bisects Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Faith in this region, today so sorely tried, must return to be a unifying and 
beneficial force like the rivers that flow through it. I am thinking of the 
River Sava, which, beginning in Slovenia, flows through your country across the 
borders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina through Serbian land, into the 
Danube. . . . Two rivers that meet are called to unite many peoples, just as 
the two expressions of Christianity must do -- Western and Eastern -- that have 
always coexisted in these lands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians and Muslims have dwelt together in the 
Balkans for a millennium, he noted, adding, "It is not lawful to attribute to 
religion the phenomenon of nationalistic intolerance which is raging in this 
region." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Croatia's Muslim minority attended the papal Mass on 
Sunday, and a leader of Zagreb's small Jewish community welcomed the Pope in a 
brief address to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian Orthodox Church, however, declined invitations to the Mass, 
Vatican officials said. Serbian spokespersons have publicly accused the Vatican 
of siding with Croatia in the Balkans vortex of ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech at Zagreb's airport before his departure for Rome, the Pope urged 
his listeners: "Dare to forgive and welcome others. . . . To forgive means to 
free the heart from the feeling of revenge which is not compatible with the 
civilization of love."

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: CONVERTING CONGRESS BACK INTO A REAL CITIZEN LEGISLATURE; 
LIKELY GOP PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER LAMAR ALEXANDER WANTS TO 'CUT THEIR PAY AND 
SEND THEM HOME.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1776, John Adams declared: "The representative assembly . . . should be in 
miniature an exact portrait of the people at large. It should think, feel, 
reason and act like them." Ever since, the ideal of the citizen politician has 
been one of American politics' most powerful symbols -- the presumed corrective 
to the machinations of professional politicians seduced by the distant capital. 
The ideal was at the heart of the political revolution instigated in the 1820s 
by Andrew Jackson, who championed the cause of rotating federal jobs among his 
rank-and-file supporters. It was immortalized in Frank Capra's classic movie 
"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," in which Jimmy Stewart, as an ordinary American 
armed only with idealism, shames the Senate into reform. And it powered the 
1992 presidential campaign of Ross Perot, who presented himself as a modern 
Cincinnatus, reluctantly summoned down from the boardroom to rescue a 
beleaguered nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Lamar Alexander, the former two-term Republican governor of 
Tennessee and President George Bush's education secretary, who wants to 
institutionalize the ideal by converting Congress into a citizen legislature. 
Alexander, who is diligently laying the groundwork for a 1996 presidential 
campaign, wants to cut congressional salaries in half and send members home 
over the summer to work at real jobs in their districts. He has even distilled 
the idea into the first memorable rallying cry of the 1996 campaign: "Cut their 
pay and send them home." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander says Congress should convene in January, work until about opening 
day of the baseball season in April and return home until Labor Day, when it 
would go back into session until Thanksgiving. In between, legislators could 
take any jobs they wanted: He would entirely lift the limits on outside income. 
"You would come closer to having some conflict of interest than you would in 
the system you have now," Alexander allows, "but you'd also have men and women 
in the Legislature who know more about what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander figures that spending half the year at home would keep lawmakers in 
closer touch with the country. And it would make them less likely to meddle in 
affairs more properly handled at the state and local level. To further 
encourage Congress in that direction, he offers a variant of Ronald Reagan's 
stillborn "new federalism" proposal: Alexander wants the federal government to 
turn over to the states $90 billion in welfare, food stamps, job training and 
infant nutrition programs in return for picking up the full cost of Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is intrigued with the idea of moving federal departments outside of 
Washington -- relocating the Interior Department, for instance, somewhere in 
Marlboro Country. "We're about ready for a dismantling of our central 
government almost the same way our big companies have had to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a political gambit, Alexander's call to send home Congress puts him ahead 
of his potential rivals in formulating a message for the '96 race. 
Buttoned-down and soft-spoken, he had never been known as a firebrand. This 
idea could establish him as the field's most radical critic of Washington -- 
not a bad position when the only group less popular in the country than 
Congress is probably major league baseball players. (Unless it's the baseball 
owners.) 
</P>
<P>
 It crystallizes his efforts to define himself as the candidate from outside 
the Beltway, in contrast to better-known Washington figures who could enter the 
race, such as Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), former Rep. Jack Kemp 
and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.). Perhaps most important, Alexander's call to shut 
down Congress gives him a potentially resonant calling card with the remnants 
of Perot's army. "Lamar," said Republican strategist William Kristol, "would 
like to be kind of a kinder, gentler, saner Perot." 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, Alexander's signature idea could be more problematic. 
In some ways, the concept (based on an idea pushed for years by former Senate 
Majority Leader Howard H. Baker Jr., another Tennessee Republican) recalls the 
Congress of the 19th and early 20th centuries. At least until the explosion of 
legislation under Woodrow Wilson, Congress was often in session less than half 
the year -- and rarely after "it got too hot to stand Washington," notes 
Richard A. Baker, the official Senate historian. On their long absences from 
the capital, legislators frequently held second jobs, most often as lawyers or 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 But would the practices that allowed Congress to govern a largely homogenous, 
relatively agrarian society with few international interests still be practical 
at the end of the 20th Century? Steadily since the Progressive Era, Washington 
has filled its arms with stacks of responsibilities, and Congress couldn't 
return to spending half the year at home without letting some drop. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine, says Alexander: He wants Congress to do less. But some fear that 
a part-time Congress couldn't fulfill its minimum obligation of appropriating 
the money to keep the government operating, a process that now often drags on 
until the very end of each year. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be possible to overcome those problems with such procedural reforms 
as multiyear budgeting. More intransigent would be the conflict-of-interest 
questions inherent in Alexander's scheme. The most attractive aspect of the 
citizen legislature idea is the prospect of forcing members to experience 
firsthand the laws they pass from a distance. Who doesn't believe that 
deliberations would be improved if the chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee spent one summer working as an assistant district attorney and the 
next as an assistant public defender? 
</P>
<P>
 But many skeptics consider it more likely that legislators would end up in 
sinecures provided by interests hoping to influence their decisions in 
Washington. "The notion of going back home is a romantic notion, but they would 
never get out of their class or status," predicted David Cohen, co-director of 
the Advocacy Institute in Washington. "They are going to go into their law 
firms, into speaking for fees." 
</P>
<P>
 Other practical problems loom. Could Congress finish the "dismantling" 
Alexander urges in the short window he would allow? And if Republicans regain 
control of either house of Congress (or both) by 1996, would Dole really want 
to spend half the year drafting wills and settling contract disputes in 
Russell, Kan. -- and tilting to the executive branch the increased power 
implicit in Congress' surrendering its oversight functions six months at a 
time? 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Alexander's idea -- like the allure of the citizen-politician idea 
throughout our history -- rests on the myth that conniving career politicians 
are ignoring the common-sense solutions of a virtuous citizenry. In fact, the 
citizenry is usually as ambivalent and conflicted as the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 With his passionate calls for shuttering Washington, Alexander is sailing into 
the crosscurrents of that ambivalence. His agenda reduces to its essence the 
assumption animating from almost all the likely 1996 Republican contenders: 
that the overriding lesson of Bill Clinton's turbulent presidency is that 
Americans want Washington to do less. Clinton has undeniably overestimated the 
public's tolerance for massive new federal programs. But it is also clear that 
Americans perceive pressing problems, from crime to economic insecurity, that 
they want someone to address. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing that yearning for renewal against the enfeebling suspicion of 
government amounts to walking a tightrope -- one on which Clinton has 
repeatedly stumbled. But Alexander, like other Republicans, risks falling off 
the other side if he assumes that Americans want Washington only to close its 
doors and leave the search for solutions to governors, mayors and those among 
us who extend kindness to strangers.

 Lamar Alexander could announce his 1996 presidential candidacy as soon as late 
this year, aides say. He's already furrowing the ground -- driving across 36 
states this summer to build grass-roots support and organizing a fund-raising 
network. And he's not alone: Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.), and former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney all are taking 
purposeful early steps toward the race. Why the rush? The answer lies below -- 
in the dramatic acceleration of the 1996 primary-and-caucus calendar. By late 
March, 1996, when California casts its ballots, the GOP will have selected 
about 60% of its 2,210 delegates for the nominating convention. 03,10,49,11

CAIRO CONFEREES LINKING GROWTH, ENVIRONMENT; POPULATION: 'WE SIMPLY CANNOT HAVE 
A REPLICATION OF THE AMERICAN LIFESTYLE AROUND THE WORLD,' A DELEGATE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jacqueline Hamilton, trying to explain the links between population and the 
environment, has frequently drawn on her childhood in Southern California as an 
illustration. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers the small housing development she grew up in, surrounded by 
orange groves and avocado trees as recently as 1972. Friends coming to visit 
had to be directed by describing natural landmarks and curves in the road. Now, 
she says, there's a Wal-Mart less than a mile from her mother's house, and a 
freeway connector passes a quarter of a mile away. The old creek has been lined 
with concrete. The groves are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an image familiar to many Southern Californians but vividly illustrative 
in this Egyptian metropolis, where a U.N. conference on global population is 
trying for the first time to draw clear links between population growth and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the great values of this process is that it finally makes the specific 
link between people, how they live and their consumption patterns, and how many 
of us there are," Hamilton, an official with the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 As draftees at the International Conference on Population and Development 
recessed Sunday amid a deadlock on more controversial reproductive issues, 
environmental organizations said the conference has already produced important 
gains that go beyond a 1992 environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro, which did 
not address the issue of population. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental action program agreed on at the Cairo conference calls for 
population issues to be considered in all new development projects; special 
strategies to eradicate poverty and promote employment for the rural poor, and 
modification of consumption patterns that are eating away at the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The broad, central core of our objectives was to make sure that we achieved 
broad, international understanding of what 'carrying capacity' really means and 
what it means for public policy," said James Hayes, director of the original 
1970 Earth Day, president of a Washington-based environmental foundation and a 
member of the U.S. delegation to the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carrying capacity is ordinarily thought of as the number of any species that 
a biological system can support in perpetuity. But the crucial dimension that's 
often ignored is that it's not just numbers, but numbers times their impact. 
With the American lifestyle, the world's carrying capacity is only about 2 
billion people. We simply cannot have a replication of the American lifestyle 
around the world," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This conference has recognized that, both implicitly and explicitly, and 
that's the first time that has happened at a United Nations conference. It is 
an extraordinary achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 It is generally accepted that present levels of population growth cannot be 
sustained without great damage to the environment. But the plan under 
consideration in Cairo this week also goes far to recognize that consumption 
patterns play an equally important role. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States has only 5% of the world's people, for example, it 
consumes 25% of the world's commercial energy, 27% of its aluminum and more 
than 20% of its tin, copper and lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural Resources Defense Council officials say that the 55 million people 
born in industrialized nations during the 1990s will pollute the world more 
than the 895 million born in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups had pushed for specific policies in the conference's 
final document that would seek to lower consumption among rich nations and 
improve conditions among poorer ones. 
</P>
<P>
 They had sought statements encouraging nations to adopt energy-efficient 
standards for new construction and equipment; water cleanup programs; policies 
making manufacturers responsible for the wastes they generate and for wasteful 
packaging, and strategies to make sure the price of goods reflects their full 
environmental cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Brauen, a member of the Swiss delegation, called the policies adopted 
"a very weak, useless formulation." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the delegates were too consumed by a controversy over abortion 
policies to focus on environmental issues. "All we talk about is abortion, and 
finally when we wanted to discuss the responsibility of the North, the chairman 
said we must hurry up. There is something wrong about that." 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials said the conference adopted each one of the American 
environmental team's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rio specifically promised a future consideration of population and the 
environment. This is the fulfillment of the Rio promise," said Sen. John Kerry 
(D-Mass.), an observer at both international conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups sought to secure financing to carry out the conference's 
stated objectives, estimated to cost about $17 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our top priority was to ensure that there was adequate funding language in 
the document to make the Cairo document actionable," said Ray Pingle, a Sierra 
Club volunteer from Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is not enough for countries to merely say they will increase their 
funding as much as they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think incrementalism isn't going to work anymore. Just donating more money 
than they did last year isn't going to do it. This is a critical time, and if 
we don't come up with enough funds to control population growth immediately, 
the population is going to triple, and the world just can't sustain that," 
Pingle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important issue for us, because we really believe that virtually 
all the other battles that we fight to save the environment will be lost in the 
long term if we don't stabilize the world population."

TALK ON GAYS BRINGS MEDIA RUSH IN CAIRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When lawyer Carlos Jose Mosso put up a small sign announcing a lecture on gays 
Sunday, he didn't realize the excitement it would cause. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 people -- mostly Egyptian reporters and photographers -- crowded 
into the lecture room, thinking that at last here was the gay demonstration 
anticipated as part of the "immoral" U.N. population conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was so disruptive that the Argentine lawyer had to stand on a 
chair and shout, "I am not a homosexual; I have a family" before he could begin 
his talk. 
</P>
<P>
 The avid interest came because pro-Islamic and opposition newspapers, amid 
fundamentalists' claims that the U.N. meeting was promoting promiscuity and 
homosexuality, had reported that gays and lesbians would be marching on the 
streets of Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Homosexuality is condemned by Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosso, a Roman Catholic from a group called the League of Decency, talked 
about the current phenomenon of gays and lesbians revealing their sexuality and 
pleaded for understanding.

BRITISH GULF WAR COMMANDER CALLS FOR COMPENSATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The commander who led British troops in the Persian Gulf War called for 
compensation Sunday for the families of British soldiers killed by U.S. pilots 
in a "friendly fire" accident during the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Peter de la Billiere, who retired from active service two years ago, said 
the families of the nine victims, who have not been offered financial 
compensation by the United States, should be treated more generously. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that the American and British governments have got to look 
after those British families who suffered rather better than they have up to 
now," he said in an interview on British Broadcasting Corp. television. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine soldiers were killed by fire from U.S. aircraft Feb. 27, 1991, after 
being mistaken for an enemy target. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Billiere said he failed to understand why the United States had paid 
compensation over another "friendly fire" incident in an Iraqi "no-fly" zone 
this year but not to the victims of the earlier wartime accident. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Air Force fighter pilot has been charged with negligent homicide in the 
April 14 attack on two U.S. helicopters over Iraq in which 26 people were 
killed. The families of two British officers who died in the April incident 
have each been awarded $100,000 in compensation by the U.S. Defense Department.

JAPANESE COALITION LOSES BY-ELECTION BY BIG MARGIN

 Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's ruling coalition suffered an unexpectedly 
severe defeat in the first Parliament-level test of its support Sunday as an 
opposition candidate won by a landslide in a by-election for a seat in the 
upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuzuru Tsuzuki, 43, a former Labor Ministry section chief who was backed by 
six opposition parties, won 43% of the ballots cast for seven candidates in 
Aichi prefecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling coalition candidate Jiro Mizuno, 48, a former U.N. staff member, polled 
a paltry 25%. A female radio disc jockey who condemned Tokyo politicians for 
transforming the contest into a national power struggle came in a close third 
with 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result creates the image that the new coalition is a weak government," 
said Minoru Morita, a respected political commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat underscored the difficulty Murayama's Socialists and the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) had in lining up their diverse supporters behind a 
single candidate, Morita said. The two parties -- rivals for four decades -- 
joined with the splinter New Party Harbinger to take power June 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama's Socialists face bleak prospects in local elections in April and an 
upper house election in July, Morita said. He predicted that the tripartite 
coalition would collapse after the July election. 
</P>
<P>
 The parties of the opposition, including those run by former Prime Ministers 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata, will gain a "spiritual boost" in their 
efforts to amalgamate into a single party, or at least into a single 
negotiating bloc within Parliament, Morita added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although pre-election polls showed that Tsuzuki was likely to win, his 
landslide came as a surprise. Tsuzuki campaigned on a platform of reform: He 
urged deregulation of the economy and told voters he would improve living 
standards to bring "wealth that you can feel in your daily lives." The 
coalition's Mizuno insisted that stability is needed to make progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The by-election was called after courts stripped a Democratic Socialist 
incumbent of his seat for lying about his educational background in information 
officially submitted to election authorities in 1992.

HEAD OF U.N. RIGHTS TEAM IN RWANDA QUITS IN FRUSTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when arrests by the government appear to be mounting, the head of 
the U.N. team in charge of monitoring human rights here has resigned, casting 
doubt on the United Nations' ability to probe Rwanda's genocidal massacres or 
keep tabs on the current situation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources said over the weekend that Karen Kenny, an Irish human rights 
lawyer, let her contract lapse because of frustration over lack of support from 
U.N. headquarters in New York, the organization's Human Rights Center in Geneva 
and leaders of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny's four-member team was responsible for monitoring current human rights 
practices and investigating the countrywide killings last spring in which half 
a million people -- some estimates say twice that -- are believed to have been 
annihilated. Most of the victims were members of Rwanda's Tutsi minority. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.N. sources said Kenny spent much of her time battling the U.N. 
bureaucracy to get computers, staff and cars to take her investigators into the 
field in search of testimony, survivors or any victims of new abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, a month after the killings began, U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali named a special envoy for Rwanda to provide detailed reports so 
that the United Nations could establish individual responsibility for the mass 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council also appointed legal experts from three West African 
countries to formally determine whether genocide had taken place and to 
identify those behind it for possible prosecution before an international 
tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the delays and lack of resources experienced by Kenny and her staff led 
some to question the United Nations' commitment to singling out the murderers 
and human rights violators. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Kenny's resignation, a top official from the Office of the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Human Rights arrived here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, the United Nations issued emergency safety guidelines to all 
foreign aid workers in eastern Zaire after violent clashes in Rwandan refugee 
camps left up to 10 people dead and scores injured. 
</P>
<P>
 And the International Committee of the Red Cross reported a drastic increase 
in the number of people arrested by authorities in Rwanda, with 2,000 people 
said to have been detained in the past 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Rwandan Patriotic Front-led government has forsworn mass reprisals 
against members of the majority Hutu tribe or returning refugees, although they 
have insisted that ringleaders and participants in the springtime blood bath 
must be caught and punished.

NEW SEPARATIST WRANGLE LOOMS FOR QUEBECKERS; CANADA: POLLS PREDICT PROVINCIAL 
VOTERS WILL SIDE TODAY WITH THE INDEPENDENCE-MINDED PARTI QUEBECOIS AFTER A 
BLAND CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an unexpectedly airless, dispassionate campaign, Quebec voters decide 
today whether to plunge Canada into a new wrangle over whether the province 
should separate from the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Most polls predict a sizable parliamentary majority for Parti Quebecois, which 
has promised to hold a referendum on Quebec's sovereignty within 10 months if 
it takes over the provincial government. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the stakes, the 50-day campaign has raised more shrugs than hackles in 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts cite a number of reasons for voter ennui. Part of it is timing. The 
six weeks leading up to Labor Day are regarded in Quebec as a period for 
vacationing, not politics. 
</P>
<P>
 And neither of the principal party leaders, Jacques Parizeau of the PQ and 
Daniel Johnson of the Liberals, is particularly inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the country went through this struggle, in the 1970s and early 
'80s, the forces of Canadian unity were led by the brilliant, acerbic Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau and the separatists by the anguished, intense Rene Levesque. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, when Parizeau and Johnson, Quebec's current premier, met in their 
televised debate Aug. 29, they engaged in a bloodless exchange of numbers, like 
two bookkeepers in a game of dueling calculators. The post-mortem consensus: a 
thuddingly dull draw. 
</P>
<P>
 But what may be most important of all are the often contradictory, insular 
impulses of the Quebec voter. While the rest of Canada, and much of the world, 
sees separatism as the campaign's overriding issue, for most Quebeckers the 
dominant element is simple fatigue with the Liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals have governed here for nine years, the last four of which have been 
spent in economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The polls say as much, and so does Raynald Coutu, a 51-year-old antiques 
dealer in this riverside town of 14,000 set amid rolling hills about 80 miles 
southeast of Montreal. "We need a change, and Parizeau has around him some new 
blood," Coutu said, sitting behind a formidable desk in a corner of his shop. 
</P>
<P>
 He also thinks the PQ will be more assertive on behalf of Quebec in the 
struggles over control of taxes and government programs that are the staples of 
Canadian domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parizeau will be more aggressive and we'll have a better chance to gain 
something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Parizeau puts Quebec independence to a vote next year as he says he 
will, Coutu will cast his ballot "No." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, when Levesque's PQ government put a similar referendum on the ballot 
and lost, 60% to 40%, Coutu voted in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, Coutu has bought and sold one antiques store and purchased 
another. He made a fine profit buying and refurbishing a Montreal office 
building, unloading it before the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Sovereignty, and all the economic uncertainties that accompany it, is a young 
person's game, Coutu said. "If you're 50 years old, and look at what you have, 
and your pension coming up, you wonder, why should you risk it?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coutu is in the large middle ground of Quebec's French-speaking voters -- 
pollster Jean-Marc Leger puts it at 20% of the electorate -- who lean toward 
independence but are hesitant to take the final leap. What they really are 
looking for is some kind of special accommodation from the rest of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The longstanding joke in Quebec puts it this way: "Quebeckers want an 
independent Quebec within a united Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of Canada does not seem to be in an accommodating mood when it 
comes to Quebec -- and that gives hard-line separatists hope. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps with voters like Coutu in mind that the PQ came up with its 
campaign slogan: "Another Way to Govern." Parizeau has not backed away from his 
promise to hold a sovereignty referendum after taking over the provincial 
premiership. But he has tried to focus his campaign on economic issues rather 
than the separatist option. 
</P>
<P>
 Parizeau says he is talking about issues that voters are interested in; 
critics suggest he is running away from his party's founding principle. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent campaign appearance, Johnson contended that Parizeau is 
soft-pedaling sovereignty because the case for it "can't be made. It's no show, 
no go. . . . If the case could be made, he would have made it 20 years ago and 
every day since." 
</P>
<P>
 Following what was generally regarded as a disappointing showing in the 
debate, Johnson has stepped up the pace and vigor of his campaign, finally 
shaking his image as an emotionless technocrat. He is making never-say-die 
speeches to party faithful and sparring with journalists, particularly 
opinionated radio talk show hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're telling lies!" he shouted at one. "What you're saying is dumb!" 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, the son of one Quebec premier and the brother of another, became 
premier in January after Robert Bourassa retired because of ill health. A 
former business executive with a Harvard MBA, Johnson held various economic 
posts in the Bourassa government before taking the top job. 
</P>
<P>
 But political insiders say that unless the Liberals win at least 40 of the 125 
seats in the provincial Parliament today, Johnson could be toppled from his 
leadership post. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of his problems, polls continue to show Johnson, 49, personally more 
popular than Parizeau, even if his party trails the PQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Parizeau's image problems are longstanding. A former university professor, he 
fairly radiates smugness, and he is often described in the media as "arrogant." 
The holder of a doctorate from the London School of Economics who speaks 
English with an Etonian accent, Parizeau's tendency toward three-piece suits 
and phrases such as "good show" brings repeated references in the 
English-language press to upper-class bumbler Bertie Wooster and other P. G. 
Wodehouse characters. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more amusing aspects of the campaign has been the handlers' efforts 
to transform the candidates into Regular Guys. Johnson has been photographed 
playing softball, volleyball and golf. Unfortunately, he always seems to be 
wearing street shoes more appropriate for a bank board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Parizeau, 64, went on Musique Plus, the Quebec version of MTV, and disclosed 
his favorite scatological term and that a childhood nickname was "vibrant 
weasel." 
</P>
<P>
 With the polls showing the PQ building its lead, Parizeau's campaign has, of 
late, curtailed his schedule, limited his access to the press and placed him in 
carefully controlled appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs and the economy are the themes of Parizeau's message, but Quebec 
independence underlies it. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he has promised a new freeway and an extension of the Montreal 
subway, lower air fares to remote parts of the province, shorter waiting times 
at hospitals and improved social programs -- all without raising taxes or 
increasing the provincial deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be available when independence eliminates duplicative programs 
of the national and provincial governments, he says. Parizeau's estimate is 
that elimination of duplication would save $3 billion, but he has never 
explained how he arrived at that total. 
</P>
<P>
 One potentially incendiary issue that has received little attention in the 
campaign is language. 
</P>
<P>
 The last PQ government (1976-85) enforced a law requiring that all outdoor 
signs be in French only and that virtually all business in the province be 
conducted in French. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was loudly resented by the province's sizable non-French-speaking 
population. It later was modified by Bourassa's government, although French 
remains the officially dominant language. 
</P>
<P>
 The PQ platform calls for no major language law changes, but some elements 
within the party favor tougher legislation, including such provisions as 
requiring French proficiency to enter English-language universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Most polls point to the PQ winning as many as 85 to 90 seats in the 125-member 
National Assembly, as the provincial Parliament is called. These same polls 
show a decline in sentiment for independence, with as few as four in 10 
Quebeckers saying they would support some sort of sovereignty for the province. 
</P>
<P>
 But pollster Leger cautions that the post-election dynamic of a separatist 
government in Quebec City could raise support for independence.

EPA STUDY BOLSTERS CASE AGAINST DIOXIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LEE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency has concluded in a long-awaited study that 
dioxin -- a class of potent chemical compounds that works its way into fish, 
meat and dairy products -- probably causes cancer in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000-page EPA report, which is to be released Tuesday and is the EPA's 
strongest statement about the cancer threat of dioxins, reinforces a tentative 
conclusion the EPA reached in 1985. The new study stops just short of labeling 
dioxin a known carcinogen. Making that determination calls for more study on 
human exposure levels, an EPA official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA study estimates that dioxin and related compounds are responsible for 
between one in 1,000 and one in 10,000 of all cancers, according to the study. 
The most common cancer presumed to be associated with exposure to dioxin is 
lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which is subject to 120 days of public comment and a peer review, 
said that most adverse effects from dioxin occur at a level 10 to 100 times 
that to which most Americans are exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although dioxin first came to public attention as a contaminant in the 
controversial herbicide Agent Orange used in the Vietnam War, 99% of known 
dioxin emissions in the United States now come as a byproduct of incineration 
of medical and municipal waste that contains some form of chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
 One government source familiar with the study cautioned against overreaction: 
"At this point, we are not recommending that the American public change any 
dietary habits as a result of this study. If there are any actions to be taken, 
they will probably be on the part of the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 One step is the EPA's plan to request that industry and environmental 
organizations submit all data they have about the release of dioxin in the 
United States or about the exposure of the American population to the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 While helping to resolve the debate over dioxin's health effects, the EPA 
study is likely to fuel another public battle about what should be done to 
protect the American public from the dangers of dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA already has more than 30 different controls on dioxin, including 
restrictions on its presence in herbicides and requirements that it be cleaned 
from toxic waste dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The pulp and paper industry already severely limits the use of chlorine in 
paper manufacturing, a response to concerns about the health effects of dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that dioxin levels in most Americans have been declining in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials declined to comment before official release of the study.

CUBAN POLICE START CRACKDOWN ON WOULD-BE RAFTERS HEADED FOR U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police began cracking down Sunday on would-be emigrants working furiously to 
launch rafts ahead of a Tuesday government deadline, after which no departures 
by sea are to be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cuban Interior Ministry police captain patrolling this popular beachfront 
said he was under orders to "persuade" rafters not to leave. He added, however, 
that police were not instructed to interfere with the departures of any rafts 
already waiting at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba is responding to an accord signed Friday with the United States calling 
on President Fidel Castro to halt an exodus of rafters that has flooded U.S. 
detention centers with migrants. In exchange, Washington agreed to assure that 
the influx of legal Cuban migrants will rise from the current 2,700 per year to 
20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 State-run television said that in compliance with the accord, police would 
immediately begin confiscating any vehicles used to transport rafts to the 
seashore and that drivers would be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of police were visible patrolling Havana's seafront Malecon boulevard, 
while checkpoints were established on key highways leading to beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 At several launching points in Cojimar, east of Havana, activity had 
significantly diminished Sunday in comparison with a packed beachfront Friday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A police captain, who would not give his name, said his officers have been 
told to fire on anyone who makes threatening moves toward police enforcing the 
ban on rafters. Previously rafters have said violence would erupt if police 
attempted to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of Cubans setting out on rafts appeared to decline, the 
ranks of those rescued at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard picked up a bit Sunday. 
By 8 p.m. EDT Sunday, the Coast Guard had plucked 684 Cubans from the waters of 
the Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature was also poised to hinder the migration effort as a tropical depression 
approached southeastern Cuba. Weather forecasters predict high winds, rain and 
rough seas through Tuesday, threatening to make launchings dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The remnants of Tropical Storm Debby still packed enough of a punch Sunday to 
flood an expressway and knock out electrical power in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The swell of refugees has caused the Clinton Administration to reverse a 
28-year policy of granting asylum to Cubans. Many have been detained at the 
U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers have been trying to contain protests, but about 2,000 rafters 
demonstrated for a second straight day Sunday, a U.S. military spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Cubans left their Camp Bulkeley complex and attempted to walk 
peacefully toward the center of the naval station, but security forces set up 
"blocking positions" and were trying to route them back to camp.

 A smoky train fire closed Penn Station for nearly three hours, shutting down 
passenger service on Amtrak and two large suburban commuter lines and forcing 
the evacuation of hundreds of people.Nine people suffered minor smoke-related 
injuries. The shutdown affected thousands of Amtrak passengers in the busy 
Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston. Smoke billowing from vents 
and entrances were seen by passers-by. The precise cause of the fire was 
unknown, but a spokesman said it apparently began underneath the engine of an 
Amtrak train that had pulled in from Upstate New York.

NO ARSENIC FOUND IN HAIR BELIEVED TO BE NAPOLEON'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI found no poisonous levels of arsenic in a lock of hair purported to be 
Napoleon's, historians said Sunday, but the finding did little to resolve the 
debate over how he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The history books say the deposed French emperor died of stomach cancer. But 
some say the British murdered him; others contend French royalists did him in. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI findings were released on the last day of the 10th annual meeting of 
the Napoleonic Society of America, where historians debated Napoleon's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hair did not come from a person who died of arsenic in the time period 
represented by the hair growth," said a signed letter from FBI Special Agent 
Roger N. Martz. 
</P>
<P>
 The lock of hair is said to be backed up by a chain of documentation, starting 
with a linen maid who wrote that she snipped the lock six hours after Napoleon 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, historians who support the theory that Napoleon was poisoned said they 
believe that the hair didn't come from his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the hair is not authentic, what difference does it (the test) make?" 
said Ben Weider, co-author of the book "The Murder of Napoleon." Weider took 
part in the debate, presenting evidence that the maid's note was doctored.

 Weider and others, such as Prof. Rene Maury, author of "L'Assassin de 
Napoleon," believe Napoleon was weakened over time with arsenic and finished 
off with cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
 Historical accounts show Napoleon was given beverages containing oil of bitter 
almonds and a laxative called calomel, which when combined, produce a cyanide 
compound, Weider said.

 The 220-strand lock of hair, sealed in a glass covered-leather box, was also 
displayed at the meeting for anyone who might have wanted to bid more than 
$100,000 for it. The hair is owned by a French physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon was exiled by the British to the remote island of St. Helena off 
southern Africa in 1815. His health began to fail in 1817; he died in 1821 at 
51. 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon's official autopsy said his stomach was riddled with cancerous 
lesions and an ulcer.

 Former NAACP director Benjamin L. Hooks was in stable condition following 
heart bypass surgery.Hooks, 69, arrived at Tulane University Medical Center on 
Thursday, complaining of chest discomfort. He underwent a four-hour quadruple 
bypass operation Saturday, the hospital said. Hooks, the former executive 
director for the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, was in 
New Orleans to attend the annual meeting of the National Baptist Convention 
U.S.A. Inc. Hooks retired April 1, 1993, after 15 years as head of the NAACP.

ALAR PANIC SHOWS POWER OF MEDIA TO TRIGGER FEAR; HEALTH: '60 MINUTES' BROADCAST 
CREATED SCARE AT TIME WHEN THE INDUSTRY WAS ALREADY MOVING AWAY FROM USE OF THE 
CHEMICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The warning -- uttered on prime-time network television, against a backdrop of 
a giant apple marked with a skull and crossbones -- was indeed ominous: 
</P>
<P>
 "The most potent cancer-causing agent in our food supply is a substance 
sprayed on apples to keep them on the trees longer and make them look better." 
</P>
<P>
 So said Ed Bradley on "60 Minutes" on Feb. 26, 1989, and so began a nationwide 
panic, fed by other media, which quickly followed "60 Minutes" 's lead with 
their own stories on the killer chemical daminozide (better known by its trade 
name -- Alar). 
</P>
<P>
 Young children, the media reported, were especially vulnerable, because they 
tended to drink a lot of apple juice and because their digestive and immune 
systems were not fully developed. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the time of the "60 Minutes" broadcast -- which was viewed by an 
estimated 40 million Americans -- industry was already moving away from Alar, 
and the nation's three major baby-food makers said they were using non-Alar 
apples. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Resources Defense Council, an activist environmental group, wanted 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to ban Alar and several other 
pesticides. When the group produced a report ("Intolerable Risk: Pesticides in 
Our Children's Food") condemning Alar, Newsweek rushed into print with the 
story before the report was officially released. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, Newsweek said, would "almost certainly generate frightening 
headlines." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it did -- three weeks later, right after "60 Minutes" aired its story. 
News media throughout the country -- effectively manipulated by the Natural 
Resources Defense Council and aided by public appeals and congressional 
testimony from that well-known molecular biologist Meryl Streep -- almost made 
it seem that one bite of an Alar-treated apple or one swig of juice made from 
Alar-treated apples would mean instant death. 
</P>
<P>
 Coverage of the Alar scare was "outrageous . . . completely alarmist," says 
Marla Cone, who writes about the environment for the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alar was a made-to-order media story. It had apples, kids and cancer. "A 
lot of (media) people were suckered in," Cone says. 
</P>
<P>
 The media coverage produced a nationwide hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 School boards in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta and many other cities 
banned apples and apple products from their cafeterias. Some parents raced 
after their children's school buses to yank apples from their lunch boxes. 
Supermarkets came under intense pressure to remove apples form their shelves. 
Uniroyal, the manufacturer of Alar, pulled the product off the market. Sales of 
apples plummeted, forcing many farmers to dump their crops or give them away -- 
costing the industry more than $100 million, according to economists' 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the Alar scare "set a troubling precedent," the Washington Post 
editorialized several weeks later. "A complicated scientific issue was allowed 
to be decided not by officials charged with protecting the public, on the basis 
of hard evidence, but by a frightened public acting on incomplete and often 
erroneous press reports." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA had expressed concern about the safety of Alar for many years before 
Newsweek and "60 Minutes" jumped on the story. But the agency had decided that 
test results were either flawed, contradictory or insufficiently conclusive to 
warrant an immediate ban and formal action was delayed, pending hearings in 
late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 David Gelber, the producer of the "60 Minutes" Alar story and now the 
executive producer for ABC's "Peter Jennings Reporting," says EPA and 
scientific criticism of Alar convinced him the story was worth doing at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John A. Moore, then acting administrator of the EPA, said on "60 Minutes" 
that Alar "should come off the market" because of what he had earlier described 
as "an inescapable and direct correlation" between exposure to Alar and "the 
development of life-threatening tumors." 
</P>
<P>
 "The public had a right to know that was their view," Gelber says. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Meyerhoff, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Fund, also 
defends the Alar story. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the apple industry launched a "concerted disinformation campaign" in 
an effort to persuade the media and consumers alike that Alar was not 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The media have a "tremendous problem," Meyerhoff says, in trying to accurately 
and responsibly communicate risk. To be credible, they must avoid crying wolf 
too often. But to protect the public, they must also avoid what he calls 
"crying sheep" -- falling prey to timidity and self-censorship when they're 
criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been conflicting reports on Alar since the initial controversy. In 
1992, the EPA said its research showed that "long-term exposure to Alar poses 
unacceptable risks to public health . . . food use of daminozide posed an 
unreasonable risk of cancer to the public" (although Uniroyal's withdrawal of 
Alar from the market had rendered moot the question of a ban on it). 
</P>
<P>
 But a panel of international experts has concluded that Alar is safe to eat as 
a trace residue in food, and both the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture and Britain's Advisory Committee on Pesticides concluded that the 
risk of getting cancer from the small amount of Alar used on apples was 
minuscule. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, C. Everett Koop, the former U.S. Surgeon General, said, "If Alar ever 
posed a health hazard, I would have said so then and would say so now. When 
used in the regulated, approved manner, as Alar was before it was withdrawn in 
1989, Alar-treated apple products posed no hazards to the health of children or 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Adamson, director of the division of cancer etiology at the 
National Cancer Institute, said the risk of eating an apple that had been 
properly treated with Alar was "certainly less than the risk of eating a 
well-done hamburger . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists are also divided on Alar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people who complained about Alar (coverage) had a very good 
point, Peter Prichard, editor of USA Today, said in a recent interview. "I 
don't think it was as dangerous as it was made out to be." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rae Tyson, Prichard's own environmental reporter, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we've made some mistakes (covering environmental health 
issues)," Tyson says, "but I'm not sure Alar is one of them . . . I would 
defend the way we've covered it." 
</P>
<P>
 So, was Alar completely harmless? Almost certainly not. It's impossible to 
prove a negative; you cannot demonstrate in a laboratory that any substance 
will never harm anybody under any circumstances. Moreover, there is evidence 
that Alar, like so many other substances -- natural and artificial -- could 
cause cancer in humans at high doses. Even peanut butter, after all, contains a 
known carcinogen -- aflatoxin. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking Alar off the market was ultimately a good decision, says Gregg 
Easterbrook, a contributing editor at Newsweek, who has written often on 
environmental issues. Alar didn't do anything truly important, and if a "very 
small safety increase" has been gained by its removal, society is better for 
it, Easterbrook says. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple crops -- and sales -- have reached record levels recently, so no lasting 
damage has been done (except to any small farmers who went out of business in 
the months after the initial scare). But Easterbrook and others inside and 
outside the media are nonetheless critical of the frenzied fashion in which the 
Alar story was covered. Among other shortcomings, the media published few 
stories comparing the Alar risk to other risks or explaining how conflicting 
risk estimates for Alar were arrived at. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make a rational decision about Alar, the public needed to know" all this, 
says Sharon Friedman, head of the department of journalism at Lehigh University 
in Bethlehem, Pa., and the author of a study on "Media, Risk Assessment and 
Numbers" just published in the summer issue of the journal "Risk: Health, 
Safety & Environment." 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not get this information from most of the mass media," Friedman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 For many in the media, however, the Alar story became a turning point in their 
approach to the coverage of environmental and other risk issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm struck by how often . . . (reporters) call me and say . . . 'Is this 
something we should be concerned about or is this another Alar?' " says Paul 
Portney, vice president of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank 
that specializes in environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Schneider, who writes about about environmental issues for the New York 
Times, says Alar coverage was "the beginning of the evolution of my thinking -- 
was my coverage and (that of) others being led by a sort of dogma that wasn't 
accurate?" 
</P>
<P>
 After Alar, Schneider says, he began asking newer, tougher questions about 
risk issues and proposals for eliminating risks -- "How do you know? What data 
are you using? How much does this cost?" The Great Alar Apple Scare 
</P>
<P>
 Parents nationwide panicked after media reports said apples were being treated 
with "the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food supply," as "60 Minutes" 
put it.

DISILLUSIONMENT MARKS 103RD CONGRESS; GOVERNMENT: AS MIDTERM ELECTIONS NEAR, 
LAWMAKERS SAY THE PRAISE THEY EXPECTED AT BEGINNING OF SESSION HAS GROWN INTO A 
CHORUS OF VOTER DISCONTENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not quite two years ago, Bob Filner was swept into the House of 
Representatives on the largest wave of newcomers in half a century. A San Diego 
Democrat, he was part of a freshman class that arrived in Washington ready to 
shake up the old order, to prove to the nation that congressional gridlock was 
gone and legislative boldness was back. 
</P>
<P>
 Had things turned out as congressional Democrats had hoped -- and as many had 
led voters to expect -- this last big recess before November's midterm 
elections would have been a victory lap, a time for boasting about their 
accomplishments and planning how to build upon them next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as House members end their three-week break and return to Washington 
this week for the final few weeks of the 103rd Congress, Filner says he feels 
"a real sense of tragedy" about the legislative record of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost a once-in-a-great-while opportunity to make some major changes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he made the round of his constituents during the recess, Filner said, he 
tried over and over again to explain why things fell apart on health care 
reform and other issues. He talked about the power of special interests, the 
pettiness of partisan politics, the factionalism of his own party. But 
ultimately, the 52-year-old former city councilman acknowledged bluntly: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure why it happened, either. I'm as confused as they are. You can 
try to explain the reasons, but it comes down to this: We didn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 The dismay and disillusionment expressed by Filner appear to be shared by many 
lawmakers, particularly Democrats, who went home to make their best case for 
voters to return them to Washington next year to try again. Instead of the 
approval and praise they once thought they would receive after two years of 
congressional activism, some say the climate is even worse than before the 1992 
election, when the House was battered by scandals involving its post office and 
private bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been truly the most difficult year I have gone through," sighed one 
veteran House member. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care reform -- the issue that was supposed to have been the crowning 
achievement of one-party governance -- is stalled, and even a heroic 
resuscitation is likely to produce little more than incremental improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Major initiatives to clean up congressional fund-raising practices and rein in 
special interests have yet to materialize. Last year's budget victories are a 
distant memory, and the steadily improving economy has not seemed to produce a 
general sense of well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-crime legislation clearly ranks as the Democrats' biggest accomplishment 
this year, but the fight to pass it turned so ugly and partisan that it is not 
producing the political bounce that party leaders had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats insist that voters will blame both parties for the mess in Congress. 
Republicans -- who have far fewer vulnerable seats at stake -- say their 
position could hardly be better going into the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The enduring message of this session is that "this is a Congress that is not 
to be trusted. They spent the entire two years flexing their ideological 
muscles against the grain of American opinion," said Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), 
a member of the Republican leadership. "Certainly, people are more aware than 
I've ever seen them that you've got to change Congress if you want to change 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, many Democrats blame their own leadership for failing to enforce 
congressional discipline, and for being deaf to the larger political themes 
resonating outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-death of the crime bill on a procedural vote crystallized those 
doubts for many Democrats. Their leaders, whose job it is to count noses, had 
gone into the vote confident they had the number they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 When House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) proposed saving the bill by abandoning its assault-weapons ban 
-- in essence, a Democrats-only strategy that would have preserved spending 
that Republicans had branded as "pork" -- their rank and file were horrified. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it was up to White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, a House 
veteran, to rescue the bill by negotiating a deal with a handful of 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Foley and Gephardt's leadership, younger Democrats complain there is 
little incentive to vote with their party on difficult issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, those who hold out until the last minute often find themselves with 
significant leverage, and are rewarded with special breaks. Even committee and 
subcommittee chairmen have been willing to break party ranks on crime, the 
budget and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the Democrats had staked everything on health care. Now, in hopes 
of having something more to show for the past two years, they are turning their 
attention to other items that remain on their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to go home with something. The crime bill will not be enough," said 
Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), a member of the House Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the possibilities: revamping the Superfund law for the cleanup of toxic 
waste sites and approving a global trade pact and a telecommunications bill. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of their commitment to reform, many would also like to pass 
campaign-finance and lobbying bills to curb the influence of special interests. 
They conceded, however, that pending legislation in those areas would be far 
less sweeping than originally hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 As one Democratic freshman put it: "I'm not telling you that those bills are 
heroic, but they're bills." 
</P>
<P>
 But with only about five weeks left to adjournment, Congress may have little 
opportunity or energy to accomplish much else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put so much into health care, and raised expectations so high," said Rep. 
Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). "We're left with very little, because so much 
time, energy and just emotional capital had gone into the health care issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, given the effort invested in health care reform this year, 
lawmakers are finding little concern about -- or even interest in -- its 
demise. Many House members said they were surprised by the intensity of the 
indifference toward an issue that has consumed practically every powerful 
interest in Washington. In that sense, the recess has been something of a 
reality check. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsui said that in five days of meeting with voters in his district, "not one 
person said that they were really upset. . . . Generally speaking, people were 
probably more relieved that we weren't moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts continue to salvage at least part of the health care bill, but even a 
modest effort could be a hard sell with voters. Most Republicans and some 
Democrats argue that Congress should scrap the entire effort and try again next 
year.

NEW RULES BAFFLE MANY WHO PLAY THE DATING GAME; HALF FEEL AWKWARD ABOUT HOW TO 
ACT IN RELATIONSHIPS, ESPECIALLY WHEN BILL ARRIVES

 In what she intended as a perfunctory display of good manners, Karen Terry 
offered to split the dinner tab with her date one recent night. Not only did he 
accept, he carefully tallied the bill and reported that her part was $6 more 
than his. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was amazed and completely turned off," said the 31-year-old Irvine medical 
equipment sales representative. After all, she sniffed, he was the one who 
asked her out, and he obviously made a good living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until then, I'd enjoyed his company," Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he called a few days later, she made up excuses as to why she 
couldn't find time, and has avoided him ever since. "If he's that cheap on the 
first date, imagine how bad he would be as a husband," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Powell might sympathize with the guy. He never knows what to do at that 
awkward moment when the check arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some women insist on helping, but you never know if you should take them up 
on it," said Powell, 44, a real estate broker in Orange. "I've even had women 
initiate the date, and then not contribute a cent to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Keefer, 18, a UCLA college student who lives with her parents in 
Irvine, has "no qualms about asking a man out." Patricia Nattrass, 58, an 
escrow officer in Costa Mesa, never has and probably never will. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Rubalcava, 25, a software engineer in Fullerton, believes that women only 
think they want a sensitive man. "Then when you open up to her, her perception 
of you changes and she dumps you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the befuddling world of dating in the 1990s. "Everyone is 
confused," Rubalcava noted. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Orange County Poll of 500 unmarried adults suggested that he's right 
-- although respondents also showed a willingness to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four percent of the people interviewed say they typically share the 
expenses of a date. Clinging to traditional roles, however, when asked if they 
pay for the date themselves, only 3% of women say they normally foot the bill, 
while 56% of men go home with lighter pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Just over half agreed with the statement: "Most of the unmarried people I meet 
in Orange County feel awkward about how to act in relationships because of 
changing men's and women's roles." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of confusion about who's Fred Astaire and who's Ginger Rogers," 
said Pat Allen, a Newport Beach therapist and author of the book, "Getting to I 
Do." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that both sexes can lead in romantic pursuits, Allen said, "we don't know 
when to chase and when not to chase." 
</P>
<P>
 A popular tactic today, Allen said, is for a woman to slip her business card 
to a man who captures her interest -- but still, that leaves her on the waiting 
side of the telephone receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Who should pay? Easy, said Allen: "The person who initiated the date." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples make a mistake when they start dividing everything down the middle. 
"It gets tediously equal and neutralizes the romantic energy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who gives seminars to singles both in Orange County and in Los Angeles, 
senses that people here are more traditional. "Men still pay for dates and open 
doors in Orange County," she said. "In L.A., it's whoever grabs the check first 
and whoever gets to the door first." 
</P>
<P>
 Dexter Padgitt, 43, a video show editor who lives in Seal Beach, said he is an 
old-fashioned sort. "I open the door for my girlfriend, buy her flowers, buy 
her dinner. Sometimes I think I'm smothering her. She told me she doesn't want 
me to pay for everything anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it chivalrous for a man to pay," said Anaheim resident Cheryl 
Zuvich, 38, a buyer for an oil company. "But if we've been out a few times, I 
offer to pay, or invite him over to my place for dinner. I still think it's 
true that women want to be courted." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Whittemore, a Newport Beach psychologist who teaches a course in dating 
skills, encourages male clients to pick up the tab. "When you're first dating, 
symbolic gestures are important," he said. "Women still place a lot of 
importance on a man's ability to be the provider." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan Tisone, 24, the manager of a purchasing department for an engineering 
firm in Orange, shrugs off the idea that men can make a favorable impression by 
pouncing on the tab. "I pay for some dates and occasionally open doors," he 
said. "But I like it when a woman does the same for me. I want to be pampered 
too."

CONGRESS MAY PUSH THROUGH BARE-BONES HEALTH PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders said Sunday that they would try 
to get a pared-down health care reform bill approved by Congress before 
adjournment for the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will clearly be less sweeping than I would prefer, but I think there's a 
lot that can be done that represents good progress in health care in our 
country," Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said on CBS-TV's 
"Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said a "bare-bones" package that would 
provide coverage to those with pre-existing conditions or those making job 
changes would have a chance of passage before the 103rd Congress quits for the 
year in early October. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that Republicans should not be perceived as -- and are not at this 
time -- a negative force in this debate," Dole said on the CBS program. He said 
the public would support only "very targeted, modest reforms" for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Major health care bills remain stalled in both the Senate and House because of 
a lack of consensus on how or whether to overhaul the nation's medical system. 
The stalemate is a major defeat for President Clinton's efforts to achieve 
comprehensive changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with only about four weeks remaining before Congress adjourns to allow 
lawmakers to campaign before the Nov. 8 midterm elections, major health care 
legislation is dead for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole proposed that bipartisan leaders in both houses try to agree on a bill 
making relatively minor changes in health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 20 areas where we have pretty complete agreement," Dole said 
without providing any details on a possible consensus approach. "We may not get 
it done . . . but I'm willing to try it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, however, objected to Dole's proposal for a leadership-written health 
care bill on grounds that it would give too much power to four or five members 
of Congress to shape the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and Dole also were at loggerheads on another issue before lawmakers 
this month: ratification of a world trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, who strongly backed the President on the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, said he wanted to delay a vote until 1995 on whether to ratify 
changes in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Clinton has recommended 
congressional approval this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be able to resolve it, but so far I haven't seen any (budget) numbers 
that would lead me to believe we are going to pay for it," Dole said, referring 
to revenue-raising provisions needed to offset the loss to the Treasury from 
lower tariffs provided by the GATT changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting traditional Republican support for tariff reduction and trade-expanding 
measures, Mitchell said he was "deeply disappointed" by Dole's stand against 
ratifying the GATT agreement this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try very hard to get it passed," Mitchell said. "This is a good 
agreement for the United States. It will reduce tariffs in other countries for 
American goods by one-third, it will protect American intellectual-property 
rights, it will increase access for Americans who offer services in other 
countries, it will strongly enhance America's economic future."

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY DEFENDS USAIR SAFETY RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena on Sunday defended the safety record of 
USAir in the wake of a crash that killed all 132 aboard one of the company's 
737 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our review of all of our maintenance efforts and all our surveillance 
indicates (USAir) has been complying with our regulations," Pena said on 
ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." He added that he plans to take a 
USAir flight on a business trip next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he was unsure if the financially troubled airline would survive 
its fifth fatal crash in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Vogt, a National Transportation Safety Board official also appearing on 
the program, said investigators are examining many causes for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The ill-fated Boeing 737, Flight 427, slammed into the ground just short of 
Pittsburgh International Airport on Thursday night and burst into a fireball 
seven miles northwest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, investigators found two more engine parts that could indicate that 
thrust reversers were deployed on the jet. Three thrust reversal actuators from 
the jet's right engine have now been found in the deployed position, Vogt said 
at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrust reversers are used to slow a plane after it lands and can only be 
deployed by the pilot on the ground, he said. A jet would crash if the 
reversers were deployed in flight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the findings, Vogt said investigators have no theories yet on what 
caused the crash. "We're not centering our investigation anywhere," Vogt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actuators, a supplemental part to the thrust reversers, could have shifted 
on impact, he said. A fourth thrust reversal actuator from the right engine was 
found to have not been deployed. Two others from the right engine are still 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogt also said investigators have interviewed a flight crew that reported 
engine problems with the jet. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight crew reported on June 28 that the right engine was difficult to 
reverse, Vogt said. It was lubricated and no other pilots complained about the 
thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 crash investigators combed the site Sunday while crews continued 
looking for body parts. Several church services were held for the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three 20-person crews retrieving remains from a wooded hillside. 
Crews are rotated every two hours to give them water, rest and a respite from 
what is a dirty, smelly task. Some of them smear fragrant balm on their upper 
lip to mask the jet fuel, scorched materials and other odors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many team members have asked not to be sent back, officials said.

LUCKY STORES' OFFER TURNED DOWN BY TEAMSTERS; LABOR: ACTION INCREASES CHANCE OF 
STRIKE BY THOSE WHO SUPPLY 235 SOUTHLAND SUPERMARKETS. CONTRACT EXPIRES TODAY, 
AND TALKS CONTINUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teamsters members Sunday unanimously rejected the latest contract offer by 
Lucky Stores Inc., the union reported, increasing the chance of a strike by 
1,695 workers who warehouse and deliver goods to 235 Lucky supermarkets 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at the behest of a federal mediator, both sides continued to meet 
late Sunday, and Teamsters leaders told their members to report to work as 
usual today. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract between Lucky and Teamsters Local 952 expired today at 12:01 
a.m., and union leaders left open the possibility that they could call a strike 
any time after that. Other possibilities are a boycott of Lucky without a work 
stoppage, or an extension of the current contract until a new agreement is 
reached -- a step usually taken when a settlement appears imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sunday, the two sides were still far apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been very, very, very little headway," Ed Mireles, head of Teamsters 
Local 952, said in an interview as hundreds of Lucky workers jammed into the 
union hall in Orange to cast their votes on the contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing with substance," Mireles said of the latest offer, which came 
after more than 20 hours of talks that began Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Decker, a Lucky spokeswoman, said: "There's been some movement on the 
company's side, I don't know about the union side." 
</P>
<P>
 She remained hopeful Sunday afternoon that a settlement could be reached, 
saying, "They're making some progress, that's why they're talking again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters and Lucky, the No. 2 supermarket chain in the Southland, have 
not been wrangling over wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the two sides have been deadlocked since the talks started in mid-July 
over the company's ability to move distribution and warehouse work out of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, Lucky operated distribution centers in Buena Park, Irvine and 
Fullerton, whose workers are represented by Teamsters Local 952, to service all 
of Lucky's Southern California stores and 20 in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this summer, Lucky opened a warehouse in Fontana, and soon after 
that the company shifted liquor products there from its warehouse in Buena 
Park. Lucky workers in Fontana are represented by a separate Teamsters local 
and they make $4.60 an hour less than comparable workers in Orange County, 
whose hourly pay is about $16.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky has said it needs the flexibility to move work among its Southern 
California warehouses to operate efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 But Teamsters Local 952 says the shift in liquor products will cost at least 
22 of its members their jobs, and moreover, threatens the long-term job 
security of its members because Lucky could move additional work to Fontana or 
other lower-wage warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side disclosed details of Lucky's offer that was voted down on Sunday, 
but Mireles of the Teamsters said it was well short of the union's goal of 
obtaining clear language that would preserve jobs for his members. Mireles said 
other issues were likely to fall into place once the dispute over job security 
was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 While there were no signs Sunday of an immediate strike, Lucky workers said 
they would not hesitate to walk out. Many of the workers attending the union 
meeting Sunday pumped their fists in the air and broke into applause when the 
Teamsters leaders urged them to reject the latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't take a stand now, we could be gone 10 years from now," said Don 
Brewster, a union steward at Lucky's warehouse in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, Teamsters Local 952 ironed out a separate agreement with 
Albertson's, leaving only Lucky among the major supermarket chains in the 
region without a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Teamsters, all of the other big food chains agreed to the 
job-security language that the union is seeking from Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky officials said it did not matter what the other companies had agreed to, 
because each supermarket chain was negotiating a separate contract this year, 
whereas in the past the major food companies, as a group, negotiated a single 
contract with the Teamsters.

CITY LOOKS INTO FACE OF THE HOMELESS; SHELTER: COMPLAINTS ABOUT TRANSIENTS 
PROMPT COSTA MESA OFFICIALS TO SCHEDULE FACT-FINDING MEETINGS WITH PASTORS AND 
SOUP-KITCHEN VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mark usually sleeps on the first bench he finds in the city. He doesn't have 
an apartment or a house, so when the sun is coming up, he is just settling 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of wasting time until you get tired," said the 31-year-old New 
Jersey native, who declined to give his last name as he sat outside the Costa 
Mesa Job Center last week waiting for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Reed, 38, said he's spent the nights in a local warehouse the past few 
weeks. But he's been without home for a few years already, so it's nothing 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair are among the several hundred homeless who walk the streets of Costa 
Mesa, a city better known for its sprawling shopping malls than its transient 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of residents' complaints about the homeless living in Lions Park, 
city officials are trying to learn more about these people who live on the 
streets and sleep in parks and under bridges. City Manager Allan L. Roeder and 
others are planning to meet this week with local ministers and soup-kitchen 
volunteers to try to find out who comprises the city's transient population. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder believes the city will learn much and can benefit by talking to the 
people who are in contact with the homeless on a daily basis. He plans to 
report his findings to the City Council on Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10,000 homeless people are believed to live in Orange County. 
According to an October, 1993, survey of some 1,300 of them, Anaheim and Santa 
Ana had the most, with Costa Mesa and Orange close behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless have been walking the streets of Costa Mesa for years, and they 
often turn up at the Job Center on Placentia Avenue seeking work. Recently, 
however, some residents have complained about transients loitering and sleeping 
at Lions Park. They contend the homeless pose a danger and have asked City Hall 
to get them out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder described the problem as a delicate situation and urged a compassionate 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all the homeless are drug addicts," he said at a City Council meeting 
last week. "Not all of them are dangerous. You can't just label them." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Sid Soffer likened the identities of the homeless to that of the 
servicemen in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  
</P>
<P>
 "You see the (homeless) all over the place, but you don't know who they are or 
where they came from," he told city officials during the public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Isenman, senior pastor at the First United Methodist Church in Costa 
Mesa, said he sees the city's homeless daily at the church soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a great mix of people, he said. Some are mentally ill, others are 
single men or women running from abusive relationships; still others are people 
who migrated to California from elsewhere years ago and have fallen on hard 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Shaw, executive director of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force 
in Irvine, said he had a hard time understanding why residents were 
complaining.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a public park," he said. "If you want privacy, don't go picnicking at a 
public park. If you want privacy, have a candlelight dinner at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of fear that goes along with the homeless. There's this stigma, 
this stereotype that they're drug addicts, shifty, lazy, but I know some people 
who are housed that act like that." 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter offers an alternative to 
sleeping on the streets: rooms for single men and women and couples for up to 
three days. Families with children can spend a week or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 people spent nights in the 55 dormitory-style rooms with bunk 
beds last year, said Valerie Miller, an administrative assistant for the 
shelter, whose location is not made public. Meals are also provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "The help is out there; they just need to find it and go to it," she said. 
"But at the same time there are so many homeless that maybe we need more 
agencies. The number is staggering." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the homeless men who spends time at the park said he would like to see 
the city construct a building where they could drop off their bags, receive and 
make telephone calls, take showers and do their laundry in coin-operated 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't even have to have rooms or shelter," said the middle-aged 
carpenter, who declined to give his name but said he came to California from 
Albuquerque in the 1970s in hope of finding better paying work.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just so long as somebody was there to watch the bags. That's what people 
object to. Our bags. But we don't have any place to put them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo Rosas, also a transient, said he never begs and he isn't looking for 
free housing, either. He lives under a bridge that spans the Santa Ana river, 
collect cans during the day and buys his own food and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the police that give me the most trouble," he said on West 19th Street, 
his hand resting on the front of a shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann, 48, frequents the park. Not homeless herself, she calls some of the 
transients who use the park her friends. She balked at using the term homeless 
to refer to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of the home is all in the mind," said Mary Ann, who in August 
quit her waitress job in Detroit to come to California and lives in an 
apartment here. "It's houses that these people don't have. A place to stay 
inside. A structure."

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 How do they come up with the numbers for the freeways? The freeways that my 
parents take me on a lot are the 405 and 118. 
</P>
<P>
 What if they build a new freeway? How would they figure out what number it 
would be? 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Moskowitz, age 7 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Elliot: 
</P>
<P>
 Those are very good questions. Many adults wonder about the same things but 
don't bother to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency in charge of the freeways, Caltrans, has the answers. First of all, 
the numbers give you a clue to the direction of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost always, interstate freeways that end in odd numbers, like the 405 and 
the 5, run north and south. Freeways that end in even numbers, like the 10 (a 
zero counts as an even number), go east and west. So it helps you know which 
direction you're driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers also reflect the freeway's purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate freeways that use just one or two digits, like the 5 freeway or the 
10 freeway, are main routes connecting major population centers of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 If a freeway has three numbers, then it is either a bypass around the main 
freeway or a "spur route" -- an offshoot of the chief roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bypasses will always begin with even numbers, like the 405 and the 605 
freeways. An odd starting number, as in the 105 freeway, means that it's a spur 
route. All of these freeways serve Interstate 5, which is why their last two 
numbers are 05. (Similarly, the 210 freeway is a bypass for the 10 freeway, 
while the 110 freeway is a spur route.) 
</P>
<P>
 The 105 freeway was opened last year and is the newest in Southern California. 
Caltrans plans no new freeways for the foreseeable future, so it may be a long 
time, if ever, before we have a chance to observe firsthand how they come up 
with a new freeway number. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I was wondering what you're supposed to do when someone gives you 
instructions, and they say to go west on the Ventura Freeway, but the signs 
only give you a choice of north or south. 
</P>
<P>
 Naomi Moskowitz, age 10 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Naomi: 
</P>
<P>
 Like your brother's, that is a good question. You were very observant to 
notice, even though (presumably) you don't drive yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The 101 freeway, called the Ventura Freeway in some areas and the Hollywood 
Freeway closer to Downtown Los Angeles, runs from our city all the way up to 
San Francisco. Because of this, transportation officials consider it a 
north-south artery. That is why the signs on on-ramps and freeway interchanges 
will often say north and south. 
</P>
<P>
 But here in the San Fernando Valley, the freeway actually runs east and west, 
as you will see on a map. So we give directions that way, and some of the signs 
do say east and west. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it can be very confusing. But here is your rule of thumb: On the 101 
freeway, west means north and east means south. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't tell that to a compass. 
</P>
<P>
 Update: Back in June we published a letter from Dick Tyler of Sherman Oaks, 
who asked why the Sepulveda Boulevard-Ventura Boulevard off-ramp from the 
northbound San Diego Freeway only had two lanes at the bottom, even though 
there was space for a right-turn lane onto Sepulveda. That space is currently a 
striped-over shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 We took the question to Caltrans, which sent out engineers to examine the 
area. With their research now complete, spokeswoman Pat Reid told us last week 
that Caltrans has agreed to remove the hatch marks on the right shoulder and 
install a right-turn-only lane, bringing the number of lanes at the bottom of 
the off-ramp to three. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to be finished by the middle of next month.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COMMUNITY CHURCH MARKS 50 YEARS IN CORONA 
DEL MAR

<P>
 When Corona del Mar's Community Church Congregational United Church of Christ 
had its first service on May 28, 1944, it was in unlikely surroundings: Balz 
Mortuary Chapel by the Sea on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The church, which celebrated its 50th anniversary Sunday, has come a long way 
since then, a fact its members gathered to celebrate with special music and 
prayers, and a time capsule to remind members at the next half-century 
milestone of its humble beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger, more modern church that stands at 611 Heliotrope Ave. is the 
long-term fruit of the labors of 10 Christian women who formed the Capilla 
Circle to make sure their children got a religious education. Originally, they 
taught Sunday school in a vacant building on Jasmine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's former associate minister, Lori Souder, continued a longstanding 
tradition of leadership by women when she gave the sermon for Sunday's service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have played a central role in the life of this church from the very 
beginning," the Rev. Dennis Short, the church's interim pastor, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation that gathered Sunday included a few of the early members, 
still on hand to contribute historical tidbits and memories for a time capsule 
filled with letters and the church's recently published history. HOLLY J.

 Is Fido feeling blue? Or perhaps uncharacteristically lashing out at loved 
ones? 
</P>
<P>
 Fido may not be psychotic after all, just reacting emotionally to a host of 
undiagnosed aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Dawn Eshelman, a 40-year-old pet-sitter who has become a specialist in 
the art of animal massage. After training as a sports massage therapist at the 
Institute of Therapeutic Studies in Santa Ana, Eshelman traveled to a Virginia 
school earlier this year to learn how to apply her art to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned her craft on ex-race horses and is now earning $45 an hour for her 
drug-free approach to equine health. But in addition to working part-time as a 
sports massage therapist for a local chiropractor, she is applying animal 
massage techniques to dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dog massage isn't really a whole lot different than horse massage," says 
Eshelman, a former graphic designer for the Maui News in Hawaii who moved to 
Irvine two years ago. "It's just scaled down." 
</P>
<P>
 Eshelman has a regular stable of clients at Serrano Creek Stables in Lake 
Forest, where she says owners regularly employ the talents of chiropractors and 
even acupuncturists to give their horses a competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dog massage is most beneficial to older, arthritic dogs who may be developing 
behavior problems as a reaction to pain, according to Eshelman. One of her 
favorite clients is an aging, overweight Dalmatian.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; LAW AIMED AT VENDORS, BEGGARS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave tentative approval last week to an ordinance that would 
make it illegal to use center medians for purposes other than lawfully crossing 
the street. The public safety measure was unanimously approved at its first 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council, City Manager Frank Benest said that a 
"proliferation of vendors and panhandlers" occupying center medians is creating 
a safety hazard for pedestrians and passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Benest said the law is needed because raised center medians in Brea are so 
narrow "that an average size person could not sit or stand or otherwise occupy 
the median without encroaching into traffic lanes." 
</P>
<P>
 Benest added that the presence of anyone in a median could distract motorists 
and possibly lead to a fatal accident. He also said that peddlers in the 
medians are likely to illegally step into traffic and upset the traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a precedent for such a law, Benest told the council. He cited a 
provision of the State Vehicle Code that prohibits vending within 500 feet of 
freeways due to potential dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the City Council gives final approval to the proposed law, violators would 
be subject to a $100 fine for the first offense within a year. A second 
violation within a year would be punishable by a $200 fine, and a $500 fine 
would be levied for the third and any subsequent violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would also be able to use civil remedies including restraining orders 
and preliminary or permanent injunctions to enforce the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Benest said the proposed law is designed to prevent traffic accidents, and is 
not aimed at eliminating panhandling or street vending in Brea. ALAN EYERLY

 A resident who had sought permission to open a private supper club called 
Tiffany's II at the five-story Harbor Tower and Marina at 3333 W. Coast Highway 
has withdrawn plans for the club indefinitely.

<P>
 The proposal was to go before the Planning Commission last week but was 
withdrawn without explanation by the applicant, Edward Martinez St. Clair.

 Although there was little resident opposition to the proposal, police

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; AUTO CLUB GIVES TIPS ON SCHOOL BUS SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Automobile Club of Southern California is warning children and their 
parents about the hazards associated with riding school buses. More than 750 
students were injured in school-bus-related accidents in California last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are injured most often when the school bus approaches or leaves a 
loading area," said Chuck Kurtz, manager of the Automobile Club's Anaheim 
office. "Incidents usually occur when children near the bus move out of the 
driver's line of sight. This might happen when they bend down to pick up a 
dropped article, or walk behind the bus or where they can't be seen by the 
driver." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurtz offered the following safety tips for school bus riders and their 
parents: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wait for the bus in a safe area well off the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not engage in horseplay, which could cause someone to fall or be pushed 
into the path of a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remain seated while the bus is in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep the aisles clear, and do not leave lunch boxes or other items where 
someone might trip over them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure children know it is dangerous to throw objects inside the bus or 
out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 * If children need to cross the street after leaving the bus, they should walk 
in front of the bus in view of the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Automobile Club also offered these safety tips for motorists: 
</P>
<P>
 * Obey posted speed limits in school zones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be alert to directions from school crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 * When a school bus is loading or unloading children, motorists must remain 
stopped until the bus driver turns off the stop lights or signals for motorists 
to proceed. ALAN EYERLY

said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the grant money include continued educational programming and 
interactive exhibits. 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have given a woman living in the city-owned Emerald Isle Mobile 
Home Park until today to clean her dwelling or the city will do it and charge 
her for the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, who had obtained a court order, inspected her residence last week 
after complaints from other park residents that it was dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bushman of Garden Grove's Economic Development Department said that 
representatives from Vector Control and the county Environmental Health 
Division accompanied city code-enforcement employees during the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven inspectors found the home filled with debris, and two rats were seen 
inside, Bushman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awful," he said. "Clothes were thrown everywhere. There were food 
containers with food scraps; one room was wall to wall with debris. The aroma 
was not good. It was just a revolting situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bushman said the city obtained the court order because the woman, who is in 
her 50s and lives alone, did not allow city inspectors inside when they first 
came to investigate two weeks ago. The woman was not home in last week's 
inspection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is on Clinton Street, between Westminster Boulevard and Trask Street. 
There are 60 mobile homes in the park that the city purchased about a year ago. 
Rent is about $500 a month per space, Bushman said. BERT ELJERA

 After the Civil War, thousands of pioneers migrated West, including to what is 
now Orange County, lured by descriptions of the area's lush farmland.

 A land rush in the 1880s led to the creation of more than a dozen "boom towns" 
-- many of which went bust with the local economy in the 1890s.

 After most voter signatures on his campaign filing papers were challenged, 
Christian Basquette has withdrawn as a City Council candidate, City Manager 
Pamela Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He withdrew voluntarily after he realized he did not have sufficient 
signatures," Gibson said."Twenty signatures are needed, and it turned out that 
16 of the signatures were by people who claimed they didn't know him and didn't 
sign his document. Therefore the document is not valid." 
</P>
<P>
 Basquette, 25, said in an interview that he was the victim of people who 
signed his papers while purporting to be someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood in front of shopping centers and asked people to sign," Basquette 
said. "Unbeknownst to me, some of these people were not who they claimed to 
be." He said he did not know about the false voter signatures until he was 
notified by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Basquette, who owns a marketing business, said he had run for the City Council 
in 1990 and 1992 and never before had trouble filing. He noted that because the 
filing deadline for the Nov. 8 election is past, he can't get on the ballot 
this year. "That's OK," he said. "I'm young. I still have plenty of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Basquette's withdrawal leaves four candidates for two open council seats. They 
are Kenneth Blake, Alta E. Duke, Gerald L. Patton Sr. and Charlene Hatakeyama. 
No incumbent is running. BILL BILLITER

 Meilen Tu of Northridge defeated top-ranked Martina Hingis of Switzerland on 
Sunday to capture the girls' singles title at the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadow, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu, 16, was the fourth seed in the tournament, but beat Hingis 6-2, 6-4, at 
the United States Tennis Assn.'s National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu defeated Kim de Weille of the Netherlands, 7-5, 6-4, in a semifinal match 
Saturday.She advanced to the semifinals of the junior girls' draw Friday when 
she beat Tara Snyder, 0-6, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu, who turns 17 in January, has said that she gave up many things to reach 
the U.S. Open. She withdrew from Granada Hills High School last fall, where she 
would have been a senior, so she could tour with the U.S. Junior team. 
</P>
<P>
 She is enrolled in a Los Angeles Unified School District independent study 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The move paid off when she earned a wild card entry into her first Grand Slam 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sacrificing the normal teen-age life," she said in August. "But it 
doesn't bother me that I can't go out every Friday and Saturday night till, 
like, 2 o'clock in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 At 16, Tu was the youngest player and the only junior in the main draw of the 
professional U.S. Open. Tu lost a tough first-round match against Silvia Farina 
of Italy, 7-5, 6-7, (8-6), 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-5, 105-pound teen-ager works out for four hours a day at the Warner 
Center Club in Woodland Hills, a secluded gym and tennis court located atop a 
seven-story parking garage. She lifts weights with a personal trainer and has a 
massage therapist along with the daily tutoring of Bill McClain, her coach for 
the past 14 months.

RESIDENTS GROUP DUMPS ON WACHS; SUNLAND-TUJUNGA: NEIGHBORHOOD ACTIVISTS DELIVER 
CLEANUP MESSAGE, DEPOSITING JUNK IN TRASH BIN OUTSIDE COUNCILMAN'S OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Sunland and Tujunga residents tired of trash littering their 
community took to the streets themselves Sunday, hauling broken-down couches, 
tattered chairs and beat-up appliances to a Dumpster set up outside Councilman 
Joel Wachs' field office. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunland-Tujunga Citizens' Patrol, a group of about 50 residents who banded 
together last year to clean up graffiti and patrol their neighborhood, had 
tried to get Wachs to order city crews to clear curbs of trash, said Nina 
Royal, secretary of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally the group decided to do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 So at about 6 a.m. Sunday, the group began scooping up tires, old couches, 
chairs, broken furniture and even a washing machine. The junk overflowed the 
dumpster, set up in the parking lot of Wachs' Sunland-Tujunga field office.

<P>
 Schools throughout the Santa Ana Unified School District have received more 
than $550,000 from the state Department of Education to fund drop-out 
prevention programs, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will be shared by 13 schools.Each will receive almost $43,000, 
district spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 In awarding money, state officials asked school districts to show proof of the 
success of their drop-out programs. Santa Ana Unified has cut its drop-out rate 
by 45% since 1985, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's programs include outreach consultants who meet with students, 
train staff to recognize at-risk youngsters, and update parents on their 
children's performance. They also encourage students to take part in school 
clubs and sports, find them tutors and reward them for good attendance, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools receiving the money are: Adams, Diamond, Edison, Fremont, Lincoln and 
Madison elementary schools; Carr, Lathrop, McFadden and Spurgeon intermediate 
schools, and Saddleback, Valley and Santa Ana high schools. JON NALICK

<P>
 Patience will be a necessary virtue of downtown motorists starting Oct. 10, 
when paving work begins on one of two main roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews are scheduled to work on Camino Capistrano between Del Obispo Street and 
Ortega Highway as part of the city's preventive maintenance program.The 
$179,000 project is expected to be completed by Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city officials, the project will create severe traffic problems 
downtown. The roadwork will not start until 8:30 a.m. weekdays. Work will not 
be allowed on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs should soon be posted at five intersections urging motorists to take 
alternate routes on San Juan Creek Road and Stonehill Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one lane in each direction on Camino Capistrano and Del Obispo Street 
will be open during construction, but some left turns along the affected 
sections may be prohibited. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; CITY WILL EXAMINE COUNTY LANDFILL 
DRAFT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission on Tuesday will review a draft environmental report 
for a plan intended to guide future development of the county's Prima Deshecha 
Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the 1,530-acre landfill site sits within the southeast corner 
of the city, south of the Ortega Highway.Parts of the landfill, in use since 
1976, are also in an unincorporated area and in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are recommending that the environmental report be changed 
because part of the landfill, as proposed, would eventually be visible from 
houses to the north and northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also concerned about the county's analysis on how the landfill 
plan will affect Ortega Highway traffic in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposal the Planning Commission will consider is to ask the county to 
take responsibility for the widening of Ortega Highway east from Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. at City Hall, 32400 Paseo Adelanto. JEFF 
BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MAYOR WANTS OUTSIDE ATTORNEY IN LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson will ask her colleagues at tonight's City 
Council meeting to consider hiring an outside attorney to fight a lawsuit 
challenging the city's campaign reform law. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole point is that the people wanted campaign reform and we worked hard 
on the ordinance." she said."I just want somebody who's a specialist in this 
area" to defend the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed Aug. 2 in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana charging that 
the city's campaign law restricts freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is simply an incumbency protection law," said Jim Righeimer, who is in a 
group of two citizens and two corporations that filed the suit. "We will take 
(the lawsuit) all the away to the Supreme Court because on its face (the 
ordinance is) unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit challenges the city's $300 limit on the amount an individual can 
contribute to a campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the seven seats are open in November's council race. There is a field 
of 23 candidates with Councilman Ralph Bauer the only incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Robert Sangster said the city's ordinance limits 
contributions, but not campaign expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 "A political action committee can raise or spend as much money as it wants," 
he said. "It just can't take more than 300 bucks from any one person." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said the reason for the ordinance, which went into effect in 
January, was to ensure there is a "level playing field" during campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been independent committees that have put huge sums of money into 
certain City Council members' races," she said. "Our community wanted campaign 
reform, and we worked very hard on that." DEBRA CANO

CHANGES PROPOSED FOR DEVELOPMENT LAWS IN LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials are proposing changes to the city's land development laws for the 
first time in more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will hold a public hearing today on a proposed subdivision 
ordinance that, along with others, would regulate how land will be parceled out 
and how smaller lots would be combined for bigger projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent is to encourage orderly land development, officials said. In 
addition, the ordinance would require developers to set aside areas for public 
use in proposed developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Elizabeth Binsack said the city's land 
development laws have not been updated since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the city will draft a manual in the next six months that will explain 
the rules, procedures and interpretation of ordinance, which the council will 
consider Sept. 26. BERT ELJERA

3 TEEN-AGERS HELD AFTER ROBBERY AT AUTOMATED TELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Santa Ana teen-agers were arrested on suspicion of robbing a man at an 
automated teller machine that was also the location of two other recent 
robberies, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers, whose names were not released because of their ages, were 
arrested by Officer Tom Both about 8:25 p.m. Saturday near the junction of 
Quail and Dove streets, Detective Bill Hartford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the suspects are 17 years old and the other is 15, Hartford said. They 
are being held at Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a Newport Beach resident who was not identified, told police he 
was at the Bank of America outdoor automated teller machine in Eastbluff 
Shopping Center at 7:50 p.m. when a youth with a gun approached him and 
demanded cash, Hartford said. The victim gave up $57 and the bandit fled in a 
black and white Chevrolet Chevelle. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim ran to a nearby Hughes Market, called 911 and gave police a 
description of the suspects and the getaway car, Hartford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three teen-agers were spotted and arrested without further incident, and 
the cash was recovered, Hartford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun, which the victim had described as a semiautomatic handgun, turned out 
to be a pellet gun that "looks pretty close like a semiautomatic," Hartford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the officer, the victim did just what police suggest someone do 
during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should comply with the suspects' demands and then immediately call us and 
give us as much of a physical and vehicle description as you can," Hartford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford said the three teen-agers are not considered suspects in the earlier 
robberies, but that "it is very rare to have these incidents at that specific 
location."

HOMES LOSE POWER WHEN CABLE FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A portion of Los Alamitos and a small area of Cypress were without electric 
power for more than three hours Sunday morning when an underground cable 
failed, a utility spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1,050 Southern California Edison customers, the vast majority of 
them in residences, lost power about 7:50 a.m. when a feeder cable in the Long 
Beach area failed, said Ron Whittemore, an Edison spokesman.Most of the homes 
affected are in the Lakewood, Long Beach and Hawaiian Gardens area, although 
about 100 homes in Los Alamitos and Cypress and several traffic signals in Los 
Alamitos also had their power knocked out, Whittemore said. 
</P>
<P>
 All power was restored by 11:34 a.m., Whittemore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the outage had not been determined Sunday and remained under 
investigation, Whittemore said.

SOLO CRASH KILLS MAN; WOMAN HURT IN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A multiple-vehicle accident Sunday and a solo car crash Saturday night left a 
woman injured and a man fatally hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ellis, 33, of Orange was pronounced dead at UC Irvine Medical Center 
after his 1962 two-door Volkswagen overturned and ejected him. He was traveling 
north on Laguna Canyon Road about 3 1/2 miles north of the intersection with El 
Toro Road when his car veered off the road. He was speeding at the time of the 
9:30 p.m accident, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Mary Parker, 28, of Anaheim suffered moderate injuries Sunday as a result 
of a chain reaction of mishaps on the Artesia Freeway in Buena Park. An 
unidentified driver was being sought by the California Highway Patrol after 
fleeing the scene, a patrol dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artesia Freeway incident involved five cars in three collisions in the 
westbound lanes near Western Avenue, the dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began at 8:29 a.m. when Parker lost control of her car while 
trying to avoid an object in the road. She spun out and struck the center 
divider, where her car came to rest facing the wrong direction. Two other 
drivers observed the collision and stopped their cars 75 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 A minute later, a pickup truck struck the two cars that were stopped. The 
driver of the truck fled via the Knott Avenue exit, the dispatcher said. 
Another driver, seeing the hit-and-run collision, braked and swerved left into 
the center divider and struck Parker's vehicle, while she was standing at her 
left front door. Her right shoulder and arm were caught in the door and she was 
dragged several feet. 
</P>
<P>
 She was treated at Western Medical Center-Anaheim for her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park police found the truck involved in the hit and run parked off 
Orangethorpe Avenue east of Knott Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver was still at large Sunday night, according to reports.

COST TO HOMES, WILDLIFE WEIGHED IN RAILWAY PLAN; TRANSPORTATION: ANTELOPE 
VALLEY OFFICIALS SEEK TO HAVE HIGH-SPEED TRAIN ROUTE RUN THROUGH AREA, THOUGH 
THE PROJECT COULD DISPLACE RESIDENTS AND ENDANGER SPECIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed high-speed rail system running through the Antelope Valley and 
connecting Los Angeles with Northern California could displace more than 260 
homes and businesses, as well as endanger several rare plant and animal 
species, according to a preliminary study released by Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 But local officials say they are willing to pay that price for the benefit of 
having the Antelope Valley included in the route of a 21st-Century rail line 
that could eventually connect Los Angeles with San Francisco and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed railway would be capable of speeds up to 310 m.p.h., making the 
trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento in two hours. But state Department of 
Transportation officials must decide between a route through the Antelope 
Valley or one along Interstate 5 through Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely want the alignment to run through here," said Jeff Long, 
Lancaster's director of public works. "When it is built, it will run through 
the Antelope Valley with a population that will grow to over a million people. 
It would be strange to bypass us. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of transportation plan is vital to the economy of the area, Long 
added. "In the end, there will be a few displaced homes on any of the routes 
that you take." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A public workshop hosted by Caltrans officials will be held today and Tuesday 
in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys for residents to voice their opinions 
about the two possible routes connecting a portion of proposed rail between Los 
Angeles and Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the debate is expected to focus on the environmental effects of the 
rail project. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you travel these distances, you are going to run into these important 
ecological areas," said Dave Mansen, senior project manager with Myra, Frank & 
Associates in Los Angeles, the firm that performed the preliminary 
environmental study for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 The railway, which could begin construction as early as the year 2000, could 
run through Los Angeles, Glendale, Burbank, San Fernando, Santa Clarita, 
Palmdale, Lancaster, Tehachapi and Bakersfield, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is still seeking funds for the system, expected to cost between $5 
billion and $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both routes follow the Southern Pacific/Metrolink railroads from Union Station 
in Los Angeles to Santa Clarita. At that point the route splits into two 
possible lines. One closely follows Interstate 5 and then travels along either 
Edison Road or Union Avenue to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative is to follow the Antelope Valley Freeway into the Antelope 
Valley and then along California 58 to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The study calls for 15 houses to be relocated between Los Angeles and Sylmar, 
including five single-family homes north of Union Station, 10 homes near the 
Burbank Airport on Sancola Avenue and Ferncola Avenue and some commercial 
property in the area, Mansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, as many as 150 homes could be displaced. Most are 
located in Soledad Canyon; 62 of the residences are in a single mobile home 
park, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southern end of Palmdale, 15 homes would have to be acquired east of 
the Antelope Valley Freeway, Mansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, seven species of wildlife will be affected, including the 
blunt-nose leopard lizard, the San Joaquin kit fox and the Tipton kangaroo rat, 
all of which are protected under federal and state endangered- or 
threatened-species laws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two plants that could be severely affected by each of the proposed rail routes 
are the Bakersfield atriplex and the slender-horned spineflower in the Antelope 
Valley. Both are protected by federal and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The first public workshop on the two routes will be held at the Valencia Towne 
Center in the Community Room today from 5 to 8 p.m. On Tuesday, a workshop will 
be held in the Stanley Kleiner Center at Lancaster City Park from 4 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the High Speed Ground Transportation Feasibility Study, released 
last week, are available at the Newhall, Palmdale, Lancaster and Burbank public 
libraries through Sept. 30.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans will also accept written comments until that date.

SEAL BEACH EXPECTED TO APPROVE EXTENSION OF SOLICITORS' HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight is expected to reluctantly approve an ordinance 
extending until 10 p.m. the hours that solicitors and fund-raisers can knock on 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 A private organization soliciting funds for the Sierra Club complained to city 
officials about the 8 p.m. deadline in Seal Beach, citing a U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling that established 10 p.m. as a reasonable cutoff time. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously approved a first reading of the new ordinance Aug. 
22, but Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings said the extension of hours was 
disrespectful to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always taught in my home that it was inconsiderate to call people after 
8:30 at night," she said. "And you didn't call your relatives after 9. I don't 
want people knocking on my door at night." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hastings and her council colleagues unanimously approved the ordinance 
after City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said the city could be challenged in court 
for restricting hours earlier than 10 p.m. "Basically, the council's hands are 
tied on this," Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Brown questioned whether the prohibition on solicitors in the 
gated community of Leisure World could also be vulnerable to a court challenge. 
But City Atty. Quinn Barrow said gated communities are allowed to ban 
door-to-door solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrow said residents can fend off late-night solicitors by posting a "no 
solicitors" sign. Solicitors who knock on doors when such a sign is visible are 
in violation of the law, according to Barrow. RUSS LOAR

FALSE ALARMS PROMPT PROPOSAL TO RAISE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider a plan to revise private alarm response 
fees to recoup the cost of police responses to false alarms, which make up 99% 
of all alarms answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach police officers spend 9.6% of their time answering false alarms 
at a cost that city officials say is difficult to quantify, but could be as 
high as $1.8 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not fair to the remainder of the community to have available staff 
committed to the volume of false alarm responses we experience with the 
potential of jeopardizing a timely response to a legitimate emergency," Police 
Chief Bob McDonell reported to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most U.S. cities, Newport Beach continues to monitor private alarms 
directly from the Police Department rather than by a private vendor. While the 
department would continue that practice, alarm owners would have to pay more 
for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council agrees to McDonell's request to boost fees, the matter would be 
set for a public hearing at later council meeting, probably in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the $1.8-million figure may overestimate the actual cost, part of the 
department's request is for $20,500 for better software so the police and a 
finance computer can track responses and costs more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is also our intent to take a more aggressive role in enforcing the . . . 
ordinance to ensure those with faulty systems or untrained employees take 
whatever steps are necessary to rectify those deficiencies and therefore 
eliminate the need for our continual response," McDonnell added. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside increased fees, the proposed changes are designed to reduce the number 
of false alarms by: 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending $12,200 to upgrade police monitoring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating a system to require alarm permit renewal annually for businesses 
and every three years for homeowners, which ensures that notification contacts 
and information are current; 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending $10,371 over the balance of the fiscal year to assign a staff 
person to 20 hours a week of work on the upgrade. HOLLY J. WAGNER

VALLEY CHRONICLE: FAMILY ADOPTS MASTER THE GREYHOUND BEFORE HIS RACE IS RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It takes some imagination to picture this dog as abused, particularly if you 
see him at his Northridge home in repose. 
</P>
<P>
 Master is likely to be found on John Collins' sofa, with Bo the cat snuggled 
up nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite posture: lying on his back with all four legs in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 John and Marlene Collins adopted the dog because they felt sorry for 
greyhounds in general and this one in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they think of him as the resident couch potato. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I have identical house slippers, and we took a picture of 
Master in his four-legs-in-the-air pose after we'd put the slippers on him," 
Marlene says. "To look at him now, you would never know he was a champion racer 
who was destined for the dead racing-dog heap. That's what happens to 
greyhounds when they are too old to race anymore. They are put to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 John, 55, an actor, and Marlene, 44, a medical secretary, have always had dogs 
and cats at home, but Master, the greyhound, is special. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are like millions of other people who saw the television programs and 
magazine articles about the abuses of racing greyhounds," Marlene says. "Those 
pictures of the animals being starved and dying and put to sleep stayed with us 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Collinses decided to adopt one of the dogs. Their vet put them on the 
trail of several organizations who rescue greyhounds bred for racing.  
</P>
<P>
 "We went to Operation Greyhound in El Cajon, which is run by Bruna Palamatier, 
who has made greyhound rescue her life's work. She charges $150 for each dog 
adopted after it has been spayed or neutered and has been checked by a vet. I'm 
sure the money doesn't cover her costs," Marlene adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went down expecting to find something more sterile and antiseptic, but 
Bruna runs a dog hotel. The greyhounds are all over her yard and house, 
including the furniture. That's just the way she is. She rescues dogs who are 
about to be put to death from several states and just loads them up in her 
vehicle and brings them to her home," John says. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Collinses were allowed to adopt, they were required to fill out an 
application and were interviewed by Palamatier. 
</P>
<P>
 They told her about their two old dogs that had recently died, their two cats 
and their most recent addition, Schatzi, a young German shepherd who had 
flunked Guide Dogs of America training school for seeing-eye dogs because she 
was too shy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruna told us she had a cute, little female greyhound she thought would be 
right for us, but when we got down there I saw my husband with this big, male 
racing greyhound," says Marlene. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all she wrote. The bonding was instant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Master was looking at John as if he were saying, 'It's about time you came to 
get me. I've been waiting for you,' " his wife says. 
</P>
<P>
 Schatzi, who was along on the trip, seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is how the Collinses came to share their home with two stray cats, one 
guide dog school dropout and a greyhound who doesn't race anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 John Collins says the greyhound adoption has worked out well, that it's an 
experience he recommends. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who might be interested, he says greyhounds are sensitive dogs, 
better off in a home with no small children. And they need a fenced yard 
because of their speed and chase instincts. "If they see something to chase, 
they are off," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of that, John says Master is just like any other companion pet but for 
his earlier life experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to say this exactly, but greyhounds really are sensitive," 
he says. "Master seems to understand that we rescued him from something bad 
that could have happened to him, and he always acts so loving and grateful. 
He's such a wonderful dog, anyway, it just breaks your heart." Valley Schools 
Will Benefit From Annual Taste of Encino 
</P>
<P>
 Yes it is time again to taste Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual benefit will be held Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 
the Courtyard Shops of Encino, 17401 Ventura Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, according to Jan Sobel, the executive director of the sponsoring 
Chamber of Commerce, there will be more fun and games for the children so the 
parents can stay longer. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the past, this year's Taste of Encino will include the fare of seven 
more-or-less local wineries, as well as food from 25 upscale and middlescale 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the eateries are from around Encino, but the tony Studio City Bistro 
Gardens will again be dishing up morsels of its renowned chocolate souffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults pay $2 admission and then between $1 and $4 for generous tastes or sips 
of whatever they chose to taste or sip.  
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the proceeds goes to buy needed supplies for participating Valley 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 About $20,000 was contributed last year, according to Sobel, for computers, 
software, public address systems and other items. The philanthropy takes some 
of the sting out of overindulging, since one is, of course, only doing it for 
the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, according to Sobel, there's the how-dee-doo factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always amused to see neighbors introducing themselves to each other and 
hanging out together, when they have lived next door, or in the same block, for 
years and never spoken." Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting uptight about what I thought were all the girls crank-calling 
my two teen-age boys, until I realized it was probably just Princess Di up to 
her old tricks again."

ANN CONWAY: DOUBLE THE PLEASURE, DOUBLE FUN

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a never-before September gala war, the Orange County society season was 
launched on Saturday when two major charity benefits were held on the same 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 About 450 supporters of South Coast Repertory theater gathered for an al 
fresco reception at Town Center Park in Costa Mesa before proceeding into the 
Westin South Coast Plaza Hotel for "Viva Teatro!" a black-tie fest that raised 
$125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, 350 boosters of the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa 
Ana gathered in the museum for the premiere of the facility's new art exhibits 
-- "Easels in the Arroyos" and "Partners in Illusion: William and Alberta 
McCloskey" -- before sweeping into the tree-studded Noble courtyard for a 
black-tie dinner under the stars that raised $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about wanting to be two places at once. "It breaks my heart to be in 
competition with SCR on the same night," said Sharon Esterley, chairwoman of 
the museum's annual "La Fiesta" fund-raiser. "I love being here, but I would 
love to be at the SCR gala too. It would have been nice to have had them on 
separate nights so people could attend both. They are both wonderful events." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem arose when SCR's gala organizers were unable to book their event 
at the Westin for Sept. 17 and moved it to the Saturday after Labor Day, the 
gala spot favored by the Bowers Museum for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bowers event wasn't listed when we checked the (social) calendar, and we 
didn't know about it until a month afterward that we had scheduled the same 
date," said Michele Wankier Edwards, co-chair of the SCR event with her mother, 
June Wankier. "We thought, 'Oh no! Same time! Same theme!' We were afraid, but 
it worked out. We exceeded our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests at the SCR gala were entertained by Spanish flamenco and Fiesta 
Folklorico dancers as they sipped libations in Town Center Park amid tropical 
foliage and the squawks of exotic birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Before proceeding to the Westin for dinner, guests heard the music of Juan 
Carlos Quintero and watched an Aztec fireball ceremony by Xipe Totec. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending their first SCR gala were Charles and Mary Kay Ruck. He serves on 
the board of SCR's Supporting Cast, a young professionals' support group. "I'm 
a little nervous," Charles Ruck said. "This gala is all the talk, you know. You 
walk around town and people say, 'Oh! You're going to that!' We're looking 
forward to the whole experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides kicking off SCR's 31st season ("A Streetcar Named Desire," 
underwritten by Kaiser Permanente, opened on Friday night) the bash celebrated 
the theater's 10-year partnership with the Latino community in the development 
of its Hispanic playwrights project. 
</P>
<P>
 This gala was Latin-flavored down to its beef tenderloin marinated in molassas 
and its protea and desert-rock centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "SCR is a theater for all of the people of Orange County," said Martin Benson, 
artistic director for SCR. "We want to draw on all of the energies and 
excitement and cultures of our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Added David Emmes, producing artistic director for SCR: "The future of our 
nation depends upon embracing diversity. This is a humble gesture in 
reinforcement of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests was Harold Schultz, president of SCR's board of trustees. 
"In 'Streetcar' Blanche DuBois says, " 'I don't want realism; I want magic,' " 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz told the ebullient crowd. "For 30 years, Martin Benson and David Emmes 
have given us a potent mix of both." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a glittering black and white gala gown, Sharon Esterley welcomed 
guests to the Bowers' gala, a celebration highlighted by the announcement of 
plans for a new children's museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County already has a fabulous children's museum, in the classical 
sense, in La Habra," said Peter Keller, executive director of the Bowers 
museum. "But we're going to have a children's version of the Bowers -- a 
hands-on, interactive museum that will be a window on the world to children." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidseum, housed in the former California Bank building at 18th and Main, will 
be launched with a Christmas party on Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 After touring the art exhibits and listening to the Van Houten Brass Ensemble, 
guests sat down to a feast -- filet mignon and roast chicken topped off by 
chocolate turtle cake -- at tables spread with hand-painted tablecloths. 
</P>
<P>
 Each sapphire, ruby and emerald cloth was splashed with an image of gilded 
fruit. The decorative accent was repeated in the table centerpieces -- terra 
cotta bowls heaped with glitter-frosted oranges and trailing ivy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fashioned our theme after a still-life by Alberta McCloskey," Esterley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests danced under a star-hung sky until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests were Bowers' governor Jack Lindquist, honorary gala 
chairman; Patricia House, the museum's director of development; and Ruth 
Seigle, president of the museum's board of governors.

MARS, VENUS . . . AND CUPID; MEN AND WOMEN SEEM TO BE FROM DIFFERENT PLANETS. 
JOHN GRAY'S MESSAGE: COME BACK TO EARTH AND DEAL WITH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, LOS ANGLELS TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1984, John Gray's marriage broke up after only two years -- a bad thing for 
a self-professed expert on the sexes whose livelihood was based on the 
relationship seminars the couple gave. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Gray's professional and personal fortunes have blossomed faster 
than a high school crush. 
</P>
<P>
 Through early September, his most recent book, "Men Are From Mars, Women Are 
From Venus: A Practical Guide for Improving Communication and Getting What You 
Want in Your Relationships" (HarperCollins, 1992) has sold nearly 1.6 million 
hardcover copies. It has been on the New York Times bestseller list for 68 
weeks and has been translated into 20 languages. His nationwide seminars over 
the past 10 years have drawn more than 100,000 people -- almost evenly divided 
between men and women. And he has been happily married to his second wife, 
Bonnie Gray, for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, 43, has ascended to self-help superstardom despite non-traditional 
academic credentials and less-than-wholehearted endorsement from the 
psychological community. His success has been fueled by word of mouth and 
talk-show appearances, including four visits to "The Oprah Winfrey Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond its catchy title and simple prose, Gray said, his book has sold because 
of its common-sense message: Men and women are different, and if they accept 
that they can communicate better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak a language that people out there understand," he said. "My message is 
. . . accept the differences and then do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The differences are notable, he said. Men like to work problems out on their 
own -- in their "cave," Gray writes. Women, he maintains, work out problems by 
talking them through. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses the analogy of men and women coming from different planets as a way to 
explain -- over and over again -- that the distinctions between men and women 
are inherent. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray bases his findings on his own experiences and stories he hears, he said, 
rather than on any published scientific research or controlled study. For many 
in the profession, that methodology is shaky at best and inaccurate at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to hear easy bromides -- when you read it you can relate to it 
because it fits into your experience," said Howard Markman, a psychology 
professor at the University of Denver and co-author of "We Can Work It Out: 
Making Sense of Marital Conflict" (Putnam, 1993). "The big question is, does 
this help people's relationships in the long run? And there the lack of 
research really leaves you wondering. There are many things that feel good 
initially and don't produce any long-lasting change." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray acknowledges that "Mars" is not a part of the academic mainstream, and 
shrugs off the fact that some academicians look down upon his methods and 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 He holds a doctorate in psychology but is not licensed by the state as a 
psychologist; his earlier days as a counselor were permitted under state law 
because his background as a monk allows him to practice "spiritual counseling." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray talks openly about his early experimentation with drugs and his nine 
years spent as the personal assistant to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. His 
bachelor's and master's degrees in Eastern philosophy are from the Maharishi 
European Research University in Switzerland. His doctorate was granted by the 
unaccredited Columbia Pacific University in San Rafael after Gray completed a 
correspondence course in 1982, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His fans don't much care where he got his education. They like what he has to 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 0 gerri Farnell of Encino, married for 40 years, arranged for Gray to speak at 
a recent Los Angeles charity event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize that men and women think so differently," Farnell said. "I 
don't care what his credentials are, if somebody can offer me ways to improve 
relationships, I'm all for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Lotterstein, 59, has been married for 36 years but said he never truly 
understood his wife until he read Gray's book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to understand she was on a track that she can't change. I don't 
have to argue with her; she can't change certain things," said Lotterstein, who 
lives with his wife in Pacific Palisades. "All the other times for the past 35 
years I'm trying to tell her she's wrong and she should change." 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds like a simple model, Gray said, that's because it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes so much sense," he said. "There are millions of people out there who 
are just basically normal people, but they have a certain pattern that happens 
in relationships. And with a little more awareness and a little more 
instruction, they can correct that and then they have a much happier 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Baucom, director of clinical psychology at the University of North 
Carolina-Chapel Hill and an expert in marital communication and gender 
differences, said that what can seem too easy often is. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples can indeed be taught guidelines for how to communicate, he said, 
adding that he has not read Gray's work. But learning how to implement them, 
especially when one or both partners are upset, is the hard part -- and often 
where a troubled couple needs a trained therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you don't want is people to have read the book, tried it on their own, 
failed and then say, 'It's no use going to a professional because we've already 
tried that,' " Baucom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said he is in favor of traditional therapy. His book, he said, can 
prepare couples for it by exposing them to the ideas about different modes of 
communication. What's more, he said, many of his readers are those who would 
not go to therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's original, Los Angeles-based classes were small -- 10 or 15 people at a 
time who came to learn what he called "Enlightened Sexuality," or the spiritual 
side of sex. 
</P>
<P>
 His first big success came when he began teaching with, dating and eventually 
marrying Barbara De Angelis, author of the best-selling "Secrets About Men 
Every Woman Should Know" (Delacorte Press, 1990). By the time they got married, 
two years after they first became involved, they were teaching seminars of 75 
to 100 people in seven cities. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the marriage broke up in 1984, it was more than just an emotional 
shock for Gray; he acknowledges that it was a professional disaster. (De 
Angelis' publicist said she was not available for comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 Gray did his best to continue the seminars the two had previously scheduled, 
explaining what had happened at the beginning and offering refunds to those who 
felt his teachings were no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could feel this rumble through the room," Gray recalled. " 'What? Can't 
you make your relationship work?' People have a tendency to want their teachers 
-- and I would, too -- to be examples of what they're teaching and suddenly I 
wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually he began to look into how men and women were different. When he 
began teaching what he had learned, he talked about men and women as if they 
were from different planets, with different customs and different languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before remarrying in 1985, he published his first book, "What You 
Feel, You Can Heal: A Guide for Enriching Relationships." That book took eight 
years to sell 50,000 copies; with a boost from "Mars," sales have doubled. His 
second book, "Men, Women and Relationships: Making Peace With the Opposite 
Sex," came out in 1990. That book, too, shot up after "Mars" and has now sold 
about 150,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said he tested his theories in counseling sessions and in his seminars. 
By listening to testimonials, and encouraging seminar-goers to express approval 
and disapproval by clapping and hissing, Gray said he was able to pick and 
choose which "generalizations" worked and which didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mars" gives few details about his method, noting Gray's seminar experience 
and years in the field; the 15,000 interviews on which he says "Mars" is based 
are neither footnoted nor described in detail. Where the book quotes 
individuals talking about their situation or problems, Gray gives their first 
names and attributes the story to either sessions or seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't develop this based on reading other people's books. I don't even 
read that much," Gray said. "I do everything through my own personal 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray works in his home office in Mill Valley, where he lives with Bonnie, 
their 8-year-old daughter and his wife's two daughters from a previous 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 His next book, "What Your Mother Couldn't Tell You and Your Father Didn't 
Know" (HarperCollins), about keeping romance alive, is due out in November. 
Gray hopes to release another recently completed book in time for Valentine's 
Day. "Mars and Venus in the Bedroom" will tackle couples' sexual 
miscommunication, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markman, of the University of Denver, said Gray's success has challenged 
psychologists to write well-researched books that are still accessible to the 
public, as he and co-author Clifford Notarius have tried to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gray continues work on his lectures -- last year there were 36 -- 
his cassette tapes and a new CD-ROM that, Gray said, will approximate private 
counseling sessions with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking around his small office, decorated with pictures of his family, the 
slight and soft-spoken Gray acknowledged that life, post-"Mars," has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he no longer bothers with the $69 weekend seminars or the $24 
one-night sessions unless the crowds are in the hundreds or thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Grays still live in the cozy, wood-frame house abutting a redwood 
forest that they bought six years ago, they have purchased a new one, just up 
the street with a mountain view. He drives a new BMW and flies first class. 
</P>
<P>
 His formula for maintaining a relationship in spite of a hectic schedule, he 
said, is "more success, more time together." The temptation, he said, is to 
spend more time working. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gray promises his fans that he will continue to teach them how to get 
along with their partners -- regardless of his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The academic world wants to say, 'What is your source for this?' You've got 
to have a huge reference list," he said. "My source for this and the validation 
of my information is that this is common sense. I say it in my introduction: If 
this rings true for you, then use it and see if it works." What We Say . . . 
What We Mean 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women are different, writes John Gray in "Men are From Mars, Women Are 
From Venus: A Practical Guide for Improving Communication and Getting What You 
Want in Your Relationships." Here are a few entries in his 
"Venusian-Martian/Martian-Venusian Phrase Dictionary": Women  
</P>
<P>
 We never go out. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like going out and doing something together. We always have such a fun 
time, and I love being with you. What do you think? Would you take me out to 
dinner? It has been a few days since we went out.  
</P>
<P>
 I want more romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweetheart, you have been working so hard lately. Let's take some time out for 
ourselves. I love it when we can relax and be alone without the kids around and 
no work pressures. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No one listens to me anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 I am afraid I am boring to you. I am afraid you are no longer interested in 
me. I seem to be very sensitive today. Would you give me some special 
attention? . . . Men  
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is bothering me that I cannot handle alone. Please don't ask any more 
questions about it.  
</P>
<P>
 It's all right. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a problem but you are not to blame. I can resolve this within myself 
if you don't interrupt my process by asking more questions or offering 
suggestions. . . . I can process it within myself more effectively.  
</P>
<P>
 It's no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no big deal because I can make things work again. Please don't dwell on 
this problem or talk more about it. That makes me more upset. I accept 
responsibility for solving this problem. It makes me happy to solve it.

<P>
 In the end, I thought I'd lose my nerve and wail, "Ooooooh, nooooo. Let's make 
another go at it." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, we had been on the verge of breaking up several times before. But I 
always managed to chicken out, convincing myself that it wasn't that bad. You 
just need to give it time, I'd say. It will get better. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time was different. Reconciliation wasn't going to happen because one 
of us didn't want it to happen. I wanted out. 
</P>
<P>
 Document before me, pen in hand, the dotted line was simply waiting for my 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
 I scribbled my name with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 There, it was official. After more than three years, I was no longer an MTA 
bus passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rewind to 1991. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 New to Los Angeles, I noticed these massive hunks moving up and down Venice 
Boulevard with eye-catching frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hubba-hubba! Who are those buses?" I asked a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, those are the buses," she said sleepily. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I heard that L.A. had no buses! That all the good buses were in New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some," she said. "You just have to know where to look." 
</P>
<P>
 So my search began. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a find! On my stretch of Venice Boulevard alone, there was a healthy 
choice of three -- count 'em, three -- buses that got you Downtown and back.  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't want to commit to one just yet, so I courted all three for brief 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The local bus, the No. 33, had one quality a commuter looks for in a bus: It 
ran 24 hours a day. Unfortunately, it wasn't the bus you want to be on at 10 at 
night while wearing a pink pastel suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, look," a drunk passenger slurred to me when he suddenly woke up about 50 
minutes into the ride, "Jackie (expletive) Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Mirth Factor was higher on the 33, the 333 Limited offered a better 
clientele -- only because, as the name implied, it was limited: in hours of 
operation and in the number of stops it made. Its riffraff was just riff. 
</P>
<P>
 Bachelor No. 3 -- the 436 freeway bus -- was impressive indeed. Cleaner. 
Safer. Quieter. Although more expensive to ride than the other two and with 
service and stops more limited than the Limited, it was a bus your mother would 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 We were joined in commuted bliss when I signed a document at work indicating 
that I was officially exchanging my car parking pass for a subsidized monthly 
bus pass. (To have both is forbidden. Sort of like bus bigamy.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ours was a union of pure bliss. At least at first. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what time I left work, the bus was always there to greet me. It 
massaged my aching bones every time it hit a bump on the roadway. It warmed me 
in the winter and cooled me in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't talk back. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, I flashed my bus pass and zipped over to the mall, the gym, my 
favorite French bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day as we were zipping past the bus shelter at Venice Boulevard and 
McLaughlin, it occurred to me that I couldn't stand it anymore. It was nothing 
the bus shelter did. I just hated its guts. 
</P>
<P>
 It only got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-sweet smell of the cologne of a regular rider who often sat in front 
of me suddenly reminded me of something Swamp Thing stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 The bright, gentle laughter of a county worker now sounded like a hyena on 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to find the man who called me Jackie Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I realized that I could name all the bus stops along Venice Boulevard, I 
knew that I had to get out of this relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to go back to driving my car. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to blast the tape player with Aretha singing "Freeway of Love." 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to eat lemon muffins and drink vats of coffee from the comfort of my 
front seat. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to call dinner hosts on my cellular phone and say, "The 405's backed 
up. I'll be a little late." 
</P>
<P>
 I was tired of bus life. 
</P>
<P>
 So after much, much thought, I signed on the dotted line and exchanged my bus 
pass for a parking pass. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While I take full responsibility for the dissolution of this relationship, I 
should add that the final irreconcilable difference came this summer when the 
MTA decided to raise fares and discontinue bus passes Sept. 1 for everyone 
except students and the elderly. (While the MTA action is on hold pending the 
outcome of a federal court battle -- which gets under way today -- don't get 
any ideas. I'm outta here. It's for the best, I tell myself.) 
</P>
<P>
 Friends' reactions have been mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-car-poolers sneer: "We knew you'd be back among your selfish, 
air-polluting kind, trying to lie your way out of a ticket for driving solo in 
the diamond lane." 
</P>
<P>
 My commuting buddies say they are ashamed to know me. How could I give up any 
relationship after just three years? 
</P>
<P>
 They say I'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few months of looking at other cars sitting in traffic during rush 
hour on the Santa Monica Freeway and watching my blood pressure rise to new 
heights, they say I'll be running to catch the bus once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. But for now, I'm going to give the single life a try.

COMMITMENTS; CYBERVILLAINS BEWARE -- SOMEONE'S WATCHING YOU; COMPUTERS: PRIVATE 
INVESTIGATOR LYNN ZWICKE HAS SIGNED ON TO PROTECT THE GULLIBLE AND 
UNSUSPECTING. THE MOTHER OF SIX ALSO TELLS PARENTS WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE DOING 
ON-LINE.

<P>
 Prodigy, whether it likes it or not, has its own private eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Zwicke, a 44-year-old widow with six children, is a licensed private 
investigator in Milwaukee who prowls the Prodigy bulletin boards to warn the 
gullible and unsuspecting, and to bust those who would prey on them. 
</P>
<P>
 She never intended this to be her major avocation. She signed on to Prodigy 
for fun and relaxation from a patently stressful occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 But she quickly noted the sometimes frantic postings from parents whose 
teen-agers had been recipients of unsolicited pornography, and from women who 
unwisely gave their home addresses to a friendly Pnut (as Prodigy aficionados 
call themselves) and ended up unwilling victims of a putative stalker. 
</P>
<P>
 With cooperation from the agency that employs her (and trained her), Zwicke 
turned her investigative talents to the on-line service. She has found, 
confronted and reported to Prodigy officials shadowy figures who sign on to 
different boards ("Teens" or "Lifestyles," for example) with various names, 
genders and self-descriptions. She can't remember the last time she read a 
book, she says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy officials know Zwicke is there and permit her pro bono activities even 
though they believe the problem is smaller than has been portrayed. They 
encourage parents to adopt the policy of "turn them in and turn them off" -- 
that is, alert Prodigy officials to the posting and turn off the computer -- 
when they come across suggestive or offensive postings or E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services have been likened to big cities with good neighborhoods and 
bad neighborhoods, but, says Prodigy spokeswoman Debra Borchert, "It's a lot 
easier to escape on a computer than it is in a public place." 
</P>
<P>
 Zwicke identifies herself on-line as a PI, but when she has a suspect in her 
sights, she may sign on as one of her children or someone in search of on-line 
companionship. 
</P>
<P>
 She also posts warning notes urging parents to find out what their kids are 
doing on-line, warning people never to give out personal information -- 
especially addresses, passwords and credit card numbers. Now she is trying to 
organize parents and schools off-line to alert teen-agers to on-line perils.

MARCH OF THE MONKS; BUDDHISTS' WEEKLY WALK FOR ALMS, AN ODDITY TO MANY, IS 
ANCIENT RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walking single-file, the Thai monks slip unnoticed through a residential 
section of North Hollywood each Saturday at sunup. 
</P>
<P>
 They move deliberately, their sandals flapping softly against the sidewalk, 
their orange robes billowing. Sooner or later, their orange robes betray their 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 A dog barks. Sleepy-eyed motorists stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where they go," said Richard Holmquist, who paused while tying a 
bag of garbage in his driveway to watch the procession. "They come by every 
week. I call them the Orange Brigade." 
</P>
<P>
 Though an oddity to neighbors, the march of the monks is an ancient ritual 
meant to help rid them of earthly desire, a first step on the path to Buddhist 
enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 The route takes them from the Wat Thai temple to the front yards of about a 
dozen Thai-American families. There, the monks are offered fruit, rice, bags of 
curried meat and bottles of water from small tables or the hoods of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thailand, where most of the population is Buddhist, providing food for 
monks has been practiced for centuries and is not considered charity. By 
feeding monks, adherents help their mentors become free of material needs, 
which in turn enhances their own spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, Phra Setthakit," Nith Duangkam, 77, said in Thai, bowing deeply as she 
scooped rice into his bowl. "I'm sorry, I cannot come to the temple tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's too bad," Setthakit said. "I hope you can come soon." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, which has the world's largest Thai community outside Thailand, 
the alms walk is largely symbolic. The monks say it helps them and their 
followers remember who they are in the concrete sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside another home, Phra Anon Puangsuwan poked his wooden bowl through his 
robe to accept a neatly wrapped bundle of skewered meat and a box of chocolate 
milk from a woman bent respectfully low.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, Phra Anon confided, "I like chocolate milk." But, perhaps sensing a 
transgression, he quickly added: "I like all food the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The monks work to shed all desire, and the achievement is their source of 
holiness. They succeed to varying degrees, depending partly on how long they 
spend in monkhood. Anon, 57, quit his computer data entry job three months ago 
to spend five months as a monk at Wat Thai before he begins another job in 
Hawaii. For Thai men, joining a temple for at least a few months of their lives 
is considered crucial to understanding the Buddha's teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life has been about getting things," Anon said. "I am learning that money 
is not so important. Maybe when I go back, I won't be so attached to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the temple, the rice, curries, bananas, grapes and other foods are 
prepared by volunteers for the 20 monks who live at Wat Thai -- the largest 
Thai temple in the United States. But the supplies will last only a day. The 
rest of the week, a cook hired by temple supporters prepares food for the 
monks, who, according to the teachings of Buddha, are forbidden to handle 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 17,000 Thais live in Los Angeles County, according to 1990 census 
figures, with six temples serving their spiritual community. 
</P>
<P>
 Phra Sumana, head monk at Wat Thai, said thousands visit the temple each month 
to ask advice from the monks, pray or study Thai language, dance and flower 
arranging. 
</P>
<P>
 The monks keep no membership rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are free to come and go," Sumana said. "I only know there are many who 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The monks usually stay within the two-acre temple, where they chant in groups 
in the morning and evening, meditate alone during the day and perform chores 
such as sweeping and decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 A strict interpretation of the Buddha's teachings allows them only eight 
possessions: two robes and an undergarment (all saffron colored), a bowl for 
accepting food, a razor for keeping the head and face shaved, a sewing needle, 
orange thread and a cloth water filter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need anything more," said Phrakru Setthakit Samahito, a 30-year 
monk, demonstrating how one robe is used for a pillow while the other serves as 
a blanket. "We can sleep on the ground if we need to." 
</P>
<P>
 A few other accouterments, such as eyeglasses, sandals and socks, have made 
their way onto the unofficial possessions list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Living in Los Angeles, too, has forced the monks to abandon a few taboos. 
Sumana admits to having been forced several times to drive to a grocery store 
himself, because no help was available. 
</P>
<P>
 "A monk in a store does not look right," Sumana said. "But we have to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 As have the neighbors of the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the sight of the robed monks jaywalking across Coldwater Canyon 
Boulevard is as bizarre as that of their ornate, gold-leafed temple flanked by 
a Mobil station and a tract of stucco homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A block west of Wat Thai is the independent evangelical Grace Community Church 
of the Valley, which the monks walk past each Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look like they're out for Halloween," said Rod Smith, security guard and 
member of the church, as he watched them pass. "I pity them. I believe they are 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighbors, though, are less derisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are part of the community," said Vytautas Barkus, a Lithuanian American 
who walks his dogs near the temple. "They are very peaceful. They cheer me up."

MAKING IT IN O.C.; SPEEDY CHIPS TWICE AS FAST AS OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Even in cyberspace, the old adage "time is money" still applies. That is what 
led Rockwell's Telecommunications Division in Newport Beach to develop and 
manufacture the V-Fast family of modem chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny chips transmit data over telephone lines at 28,800 kilobits a second, 
making it possible to transmit a 20-page, single-spaced document in a little 
over two minutes. That's twice as fast as other widely available high-speed 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's less waiting, and a faster transfer rate means more data can be sent 
without running up telephone charges," said Dan Greenfield, modem product 
manager for Microcom, which utilizes Rockwell V-Fast chips in its modems. With 
data compression, the transmission rate can be quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the chip's introduction last year, more than 126 modem manufacturers are 
installing it in their products. Rockwell's Newport Beach fabrication plant, 
which recently underwent a $150-million expansion, operates around the clock 
producing some 400,000 chips a day.JANICE L. JONES

DISCORD ALONG THE BORDER; TRADE: MEXICAN SHOPPERS AND U.S. RETAILERS SAY 
MEXICO'S CURRENT ENFORCEMENT OF $50 CUSTOMS LIMIT VIOLATES SPIRIT OF NAFTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Andy Carrasco walked across the U.S.-Mexico border on the way to the big Vons 
grocery store here knowing that, for all the talk of lowered trade barriers 
between the two countries, he can only buy $50 worth of duty-free groceries 
this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Free trade agreement? What free trade agreement?" wondered Carrasco, a 
Tijuana resident who makes two or three weekly shopping trips across the border 
here 18 miles south of downtown San Diego. "I'm buying fewer things and paying 
more taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrasco and countless other Mexican shoppers are furious over the newly 
toughened enforcement of a $50 limit imposed by Mexican customs on U.S. goods 
they can buy. It's a ceiling they say violates the spirit of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and contrasts painfully with the $400 limit that Americans 
enjoy when they go on sprees to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Also incensed are retailers along from the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, from 
McAllen, Tex., to Calexico and San Ysidro, where a decades-long dependency on 
cross-border shoppers from Mexico has been disrupted. Downtown retailers in 
Laredo, Tex., for example, report sales have fallen more than 20% in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harassment," said Tony Tirado, former mayor of Calexico, and a vocal 
opponent of the limit. Lionel Flores, a manager at Shermo electronics store in 
San Ysidro, less than a mile from the border, said: "We've lost about 70% of 
our business. We're going to change locations." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the $50 limit per shopping trip has been law in Mexico for decades, 
Mexican customs only began enforcing the limit in late 1992, and shoppers and 
U.S. retailers say the enforcement has become tougher and the penalties harsher 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests came to a head in late August when Charles S. Meissner, assistant 
U.S. commerce secretary for international economic policy, met personally with 
retailers in McAllen and Brownsville, Tex., and then lodged a formal complaint 
with the Mexican government. He asked Mexico to bring the limit more nearly in 
line with the $400 maximum on what U.S. tourists can bring in from foreign 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Mexico's president-elect, Ernesto Zedillo, weighed in on the flap, 
promising to review the $50 limitation because it has become a "source of 
irritation" with residents of both countries. "Somehow it has to be addressed," 
Zedillo told an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 The customs limits were not addressed directly in NAFTA, the free trade 
agreement that went into effect Jan. 1 and which is designed to break down 
tariff barriers between the two countries over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner characterized the tiff as one of several post-NAFTA "glitches," and 
said U.S. and Mexican commerce officials have begun meeting monthly to discuss 
trade problems in the wake of NAFTA's enactment Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the toughened enforcement as NAFTA was being implemented is 
puzzling to some, but a spokeswoman for the Mexican finance ministry said the 
enforcement began when it did simply because the technology with which to 
enforce it was finally put in place at various border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 But some border businessmen see political motives, speculating that the 
administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari wanted to appease 
political patrons who own retail operations in Mexican border states and to 
wean Mexican shoppers from U.S.-made goods that, despite freer trade, are 
either unavailable or priced too high in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say it is part of a concerted effort to stamp out contrabando hormiga, 
Mexico's huge, illicit flea-market industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Mexican retailers or their hirelings have crossed the border to 
buy U.S. retail goods and then cart them back for resale at prices that 
legitimate Mexican retailers can't match -- in effect using U.S. retailers as 
wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry had grown so big that Mexican authorities, content for years to 
look the other way as loads of Levis, athletic shoes and hardware were brought 
across the border, decided to clamp down to recover the huge amounts of sales 
taxes it was losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said the Mexican government is addressing a "legitimate problem in 
that many small Mexican retailers were coming across the border and buying $500 
to $1,000 worth of blue jeans or shirts," and reselling them in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman with Mexico's Hacienda, the finance ministry, defends the limit 
by noting that Mexicans actually can buy more duty-free goods in the United 
States than the other way around, since Americans' duty-free limit of $400 on 
purchases in Mexico and in other foreign countries is monthly, not daily. 
Mexicans can make as many shopping forays as they want, as long as they observe 
the $50-per-trip limit. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical matter, however, the $400-per-month duty-free limit on U.S. 
shoppers is loosely enforced, as U.S. Customs has little way of keeping track 
of shoppers' monthly allowances as long as they declare less than $400 worth of 
purchases per trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime observers of the border economy such as Gerald Schwebel, a Laredo 
bank executive and past chairman of an association of businesses called Border 
Trade Alliance, hope NAFTA will eventually eliminate the need for strict 
customs limits, as U.S. retailers over time are able to freely distribute the 
goods in Mexico that Mexican consumers so obviously want to buy on this side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big deal when you realize that the retail industry remains the largest 
employer in the border area," Schwebel said. "Stores all along the border area 
are reducing operations because of the loss of sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Lopez, who owns a computer repair shop in Tijuana, said as he strolled 
toward the shops in San Ysidro that Mexican officials know "nothing about life 
on the border" -- how the economies are interdependent, how the cost of living 
in Tijuana parallels that of San Diego, and how much of a burden the 33% import 
duties represent. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not the $50 limit is ultimately relaxed, the Mexican government for 
now is cracking down on the limit, confiscating goods over the legal amount 
that are not declared and impounding the automobiles of shoppers who fail to 
declare excess amounts, according to Mexican shoppers interviewed in San 
Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treat you like a thief when you cross," said Maria Flores, a Tijuana 
resident interviewed as she walked back to the Mexican border carrying her 
weekly purchase of two bags of groceries. "I used to buy a little dress for $30 
or $40 in addition to the groceries, but I'm afraid to now."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; WORD-OF-MOUTH POWER; KNITWEAR MAKER TURNS

 Brenda French sells sweaters like hot cakes. Actually, more like Tupperware. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Los Angeles knitwear manufacturer peddles her high-end goods not 
through department stores or specialty retailers, as she once did. Instead, 
French sells her line, called French Rags, out of the homes of some of her best 
customers in affluent suburbs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 And she's earning more than during her days in some of the most fashionable 
stores around. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a few years ago, French's knits were a stitch away from disappearing. 
Some of her best department store customers were on the wane, leading to 
slow-payment and other problems. Her company's overhead was enormous and 
growing. Labor problems developed. 
</P>
<P>
 That French Rags overcame all this is a testament to trying something 
different when the old ways don't work and to listening to the people who wear 
the clothes, French says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the worst thing you can do in business is be resistant to change," 
said the 54-year-old native of Manchester, England, an area known for its 
knitting. "I knew enough to trust the customer." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the late 1980s, Brenda French was like many apparel manufacturers. She 
employed hundreds of people in a cavernous factory to produce clothing that 
sold in retail stores. Now she operates on a much smaller scale, selling her 
knit sweaters, dresses, skirts, coats and other items through "trunk shows" -- 
a term that derives from the old-time salesman's method of traveling around the 
country selling products out of a trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion industry fixture Marjorie Deane, publisher of the respected Tobe 
Report trade publication, called French "very adventuresome for taking the 
goods to the customer." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet French's approach is "retailing as it should be," Deane said. 
"Shopping should be fun, and Brenda does make it fun. Her customers feel very 
cosseted and comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the change was not entirely voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 French, who learned to knit in grade school, began small in 1978 making 
scarves at home with yarn she bought at Woolworth. Her many retail contacts, 
accumulated during 16 years of working for different manufacturers in various 
merchandising and production roles, snapped up the scarves and begged for a 
sweater to go with them. 
</P>
<P>
 French obliged, dyeing the yarn in her kitchen sink. The sweaters caught on, 
and more and more pieces were eventually added. 
</P>
<P>
 French found a factory and brought in knitters. As business boomed, she found 
a larger factory and brought in more knitters. The yarn no longer came from the 
local dime store, but from an agent who introduced her to a special rayon yarn 
that she still uses. The yarn produces knit garments that don't cling and, 
therefore, are flattering to a more mature figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales approached $10 million and French Rags were featured in such well-known 
stores as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's and Bonwit Teller. 
The company employed 300 people in a 25,000-square-foot factory in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But it all began to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Department stores started to look like the dinosaurs of retailing in the 
mid-1980s. As their problems mounted, they made life more difficult for 
suppliers like French. Stores were slow paying their bills and used any excuse 
to return merchandise that didn't sell immediately, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers became disenchanted with her knits, and French became disenchanted 
with retailers. Most stores insisted on hanging her knits instead of displaying 
them folded on shelves and, as a result, the clothes would become stretched out 
of shape after only a few weeks away from the factory, French said. Plus, 
retail mark-ups put some of her garments close to the $1,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really drove me crazy," French said, adding that department store buyers 
had no idea what the customer wanted. "I thought, how can I continue to do 
business with these morons?" 
</P>
<P>
 Managing her large work force was an increasing headache. An unsuccessful 
attempt was made to unionize. Falling sales turned into layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in 1989, French was dumped by her factor, which is a financing 
company that is commonly used in the apparel industry to collect accounts 
receivable. 
</P>
<P>
 French was seriously considering going out of business as sales dipped below 
$1 million. Then a customer from New York called because she could no longer 
find French Rags. The customer suggested showing the line in her home and 
promised to invite all her well-heeled friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, is this what I've come down to? The Tupperware party?" French 
recalled. "But I learned that in business you should never not do something 
because you don't think it's classy enough. I said, yes, this makes business 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 French had hoped to attract 20 women to that first informal trunk show. Many 
more showed up and she sold about $80,000 worth of merchandise in five days. 
And better yet, these customers paid upfront. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a woman in Chicago volunteered to host a trunk show, followed by another 
and another. French now has 60 agents around the country who make a 15% 
commission selling to relatives, friends and social contacts in their tony 
communities. Sales have rebounded to $5 million, and the company is more 
profitable than ever thanks to lower overhead, fewer middlemen and no inventory 
other than yarn, French said. The only stores that now carry French Rags are 
her West L.A. factory outlet and a shop in the Eldorado Hotel in Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 But the huge factory and work force have not come back. French now relies on 
computerized machines and a small crew of hand knitters. She employs about 85 
people who produce everything, except the yarn, in a 15,000-square-foot 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothes cost between $85 and $565 -- not bargain basement items, but 
relatively inexpensive for custom garments. 
</P>
<P>
 It works because her prosperous and busy customers are no longer interested 
shopping as a sport as they were in the 1980s, French said. They make an 
appointment, try on the samples and order the garments in the colors and 
lengths they want. And they like that her slimming fashions don't change 
radically every year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all sort of evolved around common sense and what the customer's needs 
are," French said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her famous customers is Hillary Rodham Clinton, who sported French Rags 
in cover shots on Newsweek and People magazines. The path to the White House 
was not that unusual for French: It came down to word of mouth. The First Lady 
heard about French Rags from Texas Gov. Ann Richards, another loyal customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are terrific gossips and we always pass on good news," French said. "I 
guess I've benefited from that."

COMPROMISE ON NEW TRADE PACT LIKELY, KANTOR SAYS; LEGISLATION: ADMINISTRATION 
MAY BACK OFF ON 'FAST TRACK' PROVISION TO HELP ENSURE PASSAGE BY CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Pressing to win approval of a global trade pact and to avoid a damaging 
showdown with Congress, the Clinton Administration signaled Sunday that it is 
willing to hold back a legislative provision it had sought for negotiating 
future trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
 The new GATT accord -- which would establish a World Trade Organization to 
govern global commerce -- was completed in Geneva last December after seven 
years of negotiations. It was given final approval in April, and dispatched to 
about 120 nations for ratification. So far, 26 nations have approved it, but 
U.S. authorization this year is considered essential for its success. 
</P>
<P>
 That approval, however, has hit an unexpected snag in Congress, forcing the 
Administration to craft a compromise. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, 
speaking at the end of international trade talks in Los Angeles, emphasized 
Sunday that no final decision has been made on how to overcome the resistance 
to the agreement, which would liberalize world trade and slash tariffs by an 
average of 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kantor, in an interview with The Times, indicated that the main sticking 
point -- a so-called "fast track" provision for negotiating trade issues -- is 
now less pressing for the Administration than the overall goal of winning 
approval for the pact in time for a Jan. 1, 1995, international deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-track provision would extend for 2 1/2 more years the authority 
permitting the President to submit trade accords to the House and Senate for a 
single vote in each chamber, with no amendments allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton administration strategists hope to win that approval by stripping the 
fast-track authorization out of this year's legislation, and then submitting it 
back to Congress next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fully confident that our efforts will result in ratification," Kantor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments Sunday came upon the conclusion of weekend talks among trade 
representatives from the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union. 
No major breakthroughs were announced, as the trading partners focused largely 
on procedural issues for implementing the trade agreement.

 Recycled Water Project: The first large-volume use of recycled water by a 
petroleum refinery will be announced Tuesday in Torrance by the California 
Environmental Protection Agency, the city of Torrance, the West Basin Municipal 
Water District and Mobil Corp.'s Torrance refinery. The plan, called the West 
Basin Water Recycling Project, is intended to better prepare Torrance for 
periods of drought, reduce treated waste water that ends up in Santa Monica 
Bay, and reduce the amount of fresh water that must be piped into the South Bay 
region.The recycled water is treated waste water that has had all solids 
removed and been disinfected at the city of Los Angeles' Hyperion Treatment 
Plant in El Segundo. The West Basin district will then purify the water 
drinking standards (though it won't be used for drinking). The city of Torrance 
and the water district will offer the water -- at a 30% discount -- to other 
big water users.

 Unemployment Data Due: August's jobless figures for Orange County are expected 
to be released Friday by the State Employment Development Department in 
Sacramento.Accompanying the report will be a monthly tally of jobs at 
businesses within the county. The August unemployment figure is not expected to 
exceed the 6.6% rate reported for July. Local economists have said they expect 
county employers to add jobs during the second half of 1994 after several years 
of steady employment declines.

 Bracing for Hughes Layoffs: Hughes Aircraft Co. is expected to unveil today 
the details of plans to consolidate its defense-electronics lines in El 
Segundo, Fullerton, Long Beach and perhaps other sites, and employees are 
bracing for job cuts that could total 3,400. Hughes said in June that the 
streamlining would center around its radar and warfare electronics groups at 
those locations, which are saddled with excess capacity due to the slide in 
Pentagon spending. Even Hughes' 350-acre Fullerton plant, which employs 6,800, 
is considered a candidate for closure, because Hughes is using only about 
two-thirds of the available space there.

LOBSTER STILL PINCHING MUCH OF SEAFOOD MARKET; FISHING: OTHER NEW ENGLAND 
FISHERIES STRUGGLE, BUT MAINE LOBSTER FLEET EXPECTS A 4TH GOOD SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHARP, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waves rain down on the pilot house as Pat White steers his 33-foot lobster 
boat through six-foot swells en route to his favorite fishing spot on a crisp 
New England morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the tossing boat, the stench of fish bait, diesel fumes and bleach are 
enough to turn the stomach of a newcomer who tries to avoid falling flat on a 
wet deck littered with fish debris. 
</P>
<P>
 But White is cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you like them apples?" he says as he yanks a 60-pound trap aboard the 
boat and plucks out some prized lobsters. He turns to the newcomer: "You bring 
good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Good supply and stable prices have given lobster fishermen such as White 
plenty to smile about this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As some other New England fisheries struggle, the Maine lobster catch has 
topped 30 million pounds twice during the last three years, and another 
exceptional season is expected this year for its 4,000-strong lobster boat 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices have remained relatively stable. Consumers have been willing to pay 
premium prices -- $10 a pound at a Los Angeles supermarket, for instance, or 
$40 to $74 for a dinner at the Manhattan Ocean Club. At Maine seafood markets, 
though, the crustaceans are available for less than $4 a pound, and some 
restaurants in the state sell two-lobster dinners for as little as $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishing industry and scientists wonder how long such good fortune can 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the million-dollar question," says Jay Krouse, a state marine 
biologist in Boothbay. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 2 million traps already crowding the ocean floor, lobster is 
already overfished, the federal government says. 
</P>
<P>
 And lobster people fear their livelihood could be further threatened if those 
who used to go after dwindling fisheries such as cod and haddock are pressured 
to begin exploiting lobster to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like squeezing a balloon," said Robert Morrill from the National Marine 
Fisheries Service in Portland. "You squeeze the balloon, it will bulge 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the fishing is good. 
</P>
<P>
 At daybreak, lobster fishermen like White can be seen on piers from Kittery to 
Calais chopping smelly bait, loading their boats and chugging out to sea, much 
the same as their fathers and grandfathers did. 
</P>
<P>
 Most lobstermen in the York area fish between 600 to 1,000 traps, hauling in 
enough to earn a decent living, said White, who is the executive director of 
the Maine Lobstermen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go up and down the coast, you find guys who make a good living and 
guys who don't," he said. "It's like farming. Some farmers make a good living, 
some don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Among lobstermen's association members, White has been trying to bring folks 
to a consensus on conservation rules such as minimum and maximum sizes for 
lobsters that can be caught. 
</P>
<P>
 But lobstermen are an independent lot, he concedes, and reaching a consensus 
will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful life," White said as he tossed lobsters into a barrel-shaped 
container. "It's just like everything else in the world today: It's more 
complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen cannot harvest egg-bearing female lobsters, which can carry 5,000 to 
50,000 eggs. Lobsters that are not at least 3 1/4 inches from their eye sockets 
to the start of their tails are tossed back into the ocean too. 
</P>
<P>
 A "good trap" might contain eight or 10 lobsters, fishermen say. At least half 
are usually thrown back. 
</P>
<P>
 As sea gulls flutter overhead, White cuts a notch into the tails of mature 
females to declare them off-limits and flips "snappers" that don't measure up 
back into the cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 Such conservation measures, along with the inefficiency of the old-fashioned 
traps used by generations of lobstermen, have helped lobsters thrive even 
though their population is generally thought to have peaked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with fishing for many other species is too many fishermen and too 
few fish after years of overfishing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most beleaguered species is haddock. Fishermen last year took in 
only about 879 metric tons from the fertile Georges Bank fishing grounds off 
Cape Cod. That contrasts with annual haddock catches of around 50,000 metric 
tons in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 White said Maine lobstermen want to reach a consensus on stricter voluntary 
regulations -- perhaps on a moratorium on new licenses -- to avoid having the 
federal government step in to regulate the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the other fisheries are watching to see if we can make it work," he said.

MCI EXPECTED TO UNVEIL E-MAIL, OTHER SERVICE ENHANCEMENTS

 MCI Communications Corp. is expected today to unveil a new line of value-added 
services providing enhanced electronic mail and information capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be MCI's response to AT&T's move into this area with Lotus," said 
Blake Bath, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T Corp. said Feb. 17 that it would work with Lotus Development Corp. to put 
Lotus' Notes communications software on AT&T's computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes is a computer program that allows employees of large companies in 
several offices to communicate and work on documents simultaneously. By 
transmitting Notes over public telecommunications lines, companies are saved 
the costs of creating their own in-house computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company, has been running 
tantalizing TV commercials for weeks, waving something called "Gramercy Press" 
at viewers. The commercial resembles ads that, without disclosing too much, act 
as previews of coming television series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The announcement on Monday will involve 'Gramercy Press,' " Bernie Goodrich, 
an MCI spokesman, told Bloomberg Business News. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI needs to work with a computer software company in order to enter the 
value-added business. Industry observers say Microsoft Corp. could be a 
candidate. The software giant is known to be working on a "Notes killer" to 
rival Lotus' program. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Microsoft were not immediately available for comment.

 S&Ls Earn $1.3 Billion in Quarter: The increased profits at savings and loans 
in the April-June period is a sign the industry is weathering the increase in 
interest rates this year, the government said. Earnings were up from $750 
million for the first quarter even though the rise in short-term interest rates 
increased the cost of S&Ls' deposits, the Office of Thrift Supervision said. At 
the same time, the total of loans and other assets held by thrifts increased 
for the first time in six years, rising $4 billion to $773 billion.

 American Express Weighs Acquisition: The company, which operates the nation's

business by buying the U.S. travel offices of London-based Thomas Cook Group 
Ltd.The Wall Street Journal and USA Today reported that the companies have 
agreed to the deal, which is likely to be announced today. They said terms 
could not be learned. A buyout would create a travel company that handles about 
$10 billion in annual travel sales, more than three times the $3 billion 
handled by the second-largest U.S. travel company, Carlson Travel Network, the 
newspapers said.

 Foundation Wins Military Contract: The Rancho Cordova-based health maintenance 
organization said it has won a five-year, $648-million contract to provide 
managed health-care services to military dependents and retirees in Oregon and 
Washington state.Under the contract, Foundation will manage medical care for 
230,000 beneficiaries of the Defense Department's Civilian Health and Medical 
Program of the Uniformed Services, or CHAMPUS. An unsuccessful bidder for the 
contract was Health Systems International Inc., a Woodland Hills-based HMO. 
Last year, Foundation lost a $3.5-billion CHAMPUS contract for California and 
Hawaii. Foundation protested the decision, which the government then put out 
for rebid. A decision is expected this fall.

 Consent Decree Ends Federal Investigation: Richard Carl Huitt, 41, who 
investigators say bilked 125 investors out of $11 million, has signed an 
agreement prohibiting him from future violations of securities laws. Without 
admitting guilt, Huitt, already sentenced to eight years in prison after 
pleading guilty to fraud charges, agreed to the consent decree, thus ending an 
investigation started last year by the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission.

BUYERS SAY: COME ON OVER, LAND ROVER; TRANSPORTATION: THE BRITISH OFF-ROAD 
VEHICLES SELL WELL IN O.C., WHERE SOME REGARD THEM AS STATUS SYMBOLS, OTHERS AS 
FAMILY VEHICLES.

 Why does any Southern Californian need a car like the Range Rover? These are 
the expensive British-made, four-wheel-drive vehicles of choice for those who 
require transport across deserts and through jungles. The answer, according to 
Range Rover owner Francois Badeau, is: They don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The excuse I give people is that if there is an earthquake I will be able to 
get to where I need to go," Badeau said. Truth is, the Newport Beach resident 
bought his $50,000 Range Rover for a familiar Orange County motivation: It's a 
status symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has all the prestige and comfort of a luxury automobile but is less 
expensive than a top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz or BMW," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Necessary or not, vehicles by Land Rover, the company that makes the Range 
Rover brand of sport utility vehicle, are opening the checkbooks of more and 
more Orange County residents. Land Rover North America, headquartered in 
Lanham, Md., said that U.S. sales have reached 5,640 vehicles this year, 
compared with 4,907 in all of 1993. If that pace continues, 1994 sales might 
triple last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers would have been much higher had more vehicles been available," 
said company spokeswoman Nancy Rader. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rovers' growing popularity in Orange County and nationwide is the result 
of several factors. Auto experts say the combination of Orange County's 
demographics and the introduction of a new Land Rover vehicle, called 
Discovery, is pushing sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't produce them fast enough to keep up with demand," said Sterling 
Bantle, sales manager of Bauer Jaguar and Range Rover in Anaheim. The 
popularity of Discovery is linked to its lower price, he said. Discovery, which 
starts at $29,600, is designed to compete with the fully loaded versions of 
Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank Robnett, sales manager of Jeep-Eagle of Santa Ana, discounted the 
effect the new competition is having on the market. "Sales are not affected one 
bit," said Robnett, adding that a basic Grand Cherokee can be purchased for as 
low as $23,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Land Rover now sells three vehicles in the United States: the Land Rover 
Discovery, the $52,500 Range Rover County LWB (which stands for long wheel 
base) and the Land Rover Defender 90, an open-air, off-road vehicle that starts 
at $27,900 (top optional). 
</P>
<P>
 The company says the average Range Rover buyer has a household income of more 
than $225,000 a year, while Discovery owners average about $125,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery has added appeal because many consider it a family vehicle, said Ken 
McGraw, owner of Land Rover of Mission Viejo. Like a minivan or station wagon, 
Discovery seats seven and has dual air bags. The introduction of 
family-friendly Discovery to Orange County has nearly tripled sales of Land 
Rovers in the area, McGraw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has always provided a good market for high-end import cars, said 
Chris Cedergren, an auto-industry consultant with AutoPacific Group Inc. in 
Thousand Oaks. Affluent drivers in Orange County tend to be younger, added 
Cedergren, and they prefer sport utility vehicles to the sedans their parents 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a division of BMW, the manufacturer is trying to broaden the appeal of its 
vehicles by opening new dealerships it calls Land Rover Centres. They sell new 
Rovers and used sport utility vehicles of any brand. And the first one in 
California is McGraw's Land Rover of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Each center will have a course where customers can learn off-road driving. 
They will also have "adventure centers" where owners and potential owners can 
arrange off-road trips. Customers will even be able to purchase a variety of 
gear like driving gloves and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Land Rover hopes the novelty of the Land Rover Centres will further popularize 
the vehicles, which for nearly 50 years have been almost standard equipment for 
back-country expeditions and safaris in remote areas of Africa, Asia and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Land Rover line was modeled after World War II military vehicles and built 
to endure jungle treks and safaris. Perhaps with the 1970 debut of the luxury 
Range Rover, its rugged, hearty makeup was displaced by its image as the sport 
utility vehicle of the rich and famous.

RISING RATES ADD TO BURDEN OF STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT; DEBT: ON JULY 1, 
BORROWERS BEGAN PAYING 7.43% ON VARIABLE-RATE LOANS, UP FROM 6.22%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Leonard Adler, three months out of Georgetown University's law school and 
$100,000 in debt, learned the hard way just how rising interest rates affect 
adjustable-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, Adler and thousands of students in the government's $76-billion 
student loan program began paying 7.43% on their variable-rate student loans, 
up from 6.22%. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase follows the 1.75% rise in short-term interest rates this year. 
Before October, 1992, when variable-rate loans first came into use, students 
paid a staggered loan-rate of 8% for the first four years and 10% for the 
balance, which couldn't exceed six years on loans of $7,500 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably better that I went to school during a time of low interest 
rates," said Adler, 25, who earns about $25,000 a year as director of a 
homeless outreach program in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has been in the student loan business since 1966, when the 
annual volume of loans was $73 million and the average loan was $828. By last 
year, loans reached $17.8 billion a year and averaged $3,105, according to the 
U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 And, higher rates or no, the Student Loan Marketing Assn., widely known as 
Sallie Mae, expects a near doubling in annual loan volume to $31.4 billion in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal student loans offer lower rates than most other ways to borrow money. 
The prime rate, for instance, a benchmark for bank borrowing costs, is now 
7.75%, up from 6% in early 1994 but well below the 10.5% rate of January, 1990. 
In contrast, variable rate Stafford loans can't rise above 8.25%. The loans are 
named for former Vermont Sen. Robert Stafford, who helped craft the 1965 law 
that created the government's student loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides lower rates, student loans have another big advantage over 
conventional loans: In many cases, the government picks up the tab for interest 
until a student graduates. And, though students today are experiencing the 
other side of the equation, floating-rate loans can float down as well as up. 
</P>
<P>
 That's little consolation to those suddenly finding themselves stuck with 
higher payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Olive Smith, a second-year graduate student in international affairs at 
Columbia University, would prefer to have rates "frozen" on the $35,000 she 
owes on her student loans. After all, as she said, "we're students." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has lots of company among those suddenly paying more for their 
education. "I keep getting letters saying (the rate) is changing," said Michael 
O'Neil, 32, a 1994 graduate of Cleveland-Marshall Law School who's paying off 
$50,000 in loans, including $20,000 affected by floating interest rates. "I'm 
not happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It all adds up. This summer's increase on O'Neil's adjustable-rate loans means 
he'll repay an extra $1,500 on his loan; he figures his monthly loan repayments 
at more than $600. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank has raised the rate it charges on overnight bank loans five 
times this year, to 4.75% from 3%, in an attempt to keep inflation under 
control. The most recent increase, on Aug. 16, bumped up short-term rates by a 
half percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 All it will take is "one more rate increase of similar magnitude and we'll hit 
the 8.25% cap" above which student loans can't rise, said Dana Callihan, a 
spokesman for the California Student Aid Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 California gets $3.5 billion a year from the federal government to fund its 
student aid programs, the largest of any state in the nation. California 
students account for between 9% and 11% of all government funds distributed for 
student loans. 
</P>
<P>
 With tuition bills soaring, about one-third of college and graduate students 
have borrowed money from the government. Without big loans from the government, 
"I didn't have an option," said Stephanie Pitcher, 26, a third-year law student 
at Boston University. She owes more than $93,000 for college and graduate 
school. "Maybe that's stupid. But it was either do it this way or don't do it 
at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One consolation for students: the higher rates suggest an expanding economy, 
and more jobs than a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though rates are rising, I think the economy is picking up," O'Neil 
said. "It's a trade-off."

CONTROVERSIES THREATEN TO HALT FUND INDUSTRY'S GROWTH; MUTUALS: LATEST BLOW TO 
PUBLIC TRUST INVOLVES PIPER JAFFRAY FUNDS' LOSING ONE-FIFTH OF THEIR VALUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An unprecedented stream of scandals and controversies this year threatens to 
halt the mutual fund industry's explosive growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous escalation in controversy in the fund industry," said 
Bob Powell, editor of Mutual Fund Market News in Boston. "It's a recipe for 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 funds are now available to investors and the amount of 
customers' assets under management has doubled, to about $2 trillion, since 
1990. The industry has grown because investors trust fund managers to deliver 
the safety and above-average returns they promise. A series of problems 
threatens to undermine that trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any doubt when you see dozens of stories in newspapers 
with headlines saying 'trust betrayed' on page one, that has an effect on 
shaking investors' confidence," said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar 
Mutual Funds, a newsletter in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems have already set in. For example, the growth in fund assets has 
stalled so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of stock, bond and income mutual funds totaled $31.5 billion in July, 
according to the Investment Company Institute, a Washington, D.C., trade group. 
That compares with sales of $36.6 billion in June and $43.4 billion in July 
1993. Through the first seven months of this year, the ICI said, assets of all 
funds grew at an annual rate of just 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1990 to 1993, Lipper Analytical Services Inc. said, fund assets doubled, 
to about $2 trillion. That performance reflected an average annual growth of 
33% during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, total fund assets may rise if equity funds benefit from the stock 
market's recent surge. That won't be much help to the sagging bond funds, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the Securities and Exchange Commission is "seeing to it that 
funds do not involve a measure of risk that is inconsistent with the 
description of the fund," Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the SEC, said last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest blow to public confidence in the investment industry occurred just 
last month, when it was disclosed that Piper Jaffray Cos. fund manager Worth 
Bruntjen's funds have fallen $705 million to $2.8 billion. All six of his funds 
lost a fifth of their value because of his investments in high-risk 
mortgage-backed securities, whose value plummeted as interest rates began to 
rise earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven individual shareholders and a Teamster union affiliate have sued Piper 
Jaffray. They charge the Minneapolis-based firm failed to disclose properly the 
risks of the funds' investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper Jaffray denied the charges. Addison Piper, the firm's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Other mutual fund leaders seem less sanguine about the effects of the Piper 
Jaffray fiasco. Asked to comment about his industry's image in the wake of the 
Piper Jaffray incident, George Collins, president of Baltimore-based T. Rowe 
Price, which manages about $29 billion, tried to evade the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about it," Collins said. "Nothing on the record." 
</P>
<P>
 A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical, said it is "very important 
for the mutual fund industry to manage the public's perceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the fund industry has generally moved swiftly to calm investors 
following a scandal, but they chide the industry's leaders. "They are just now 
becoming aware of the depth of concern out there," Morningstar's Rekenthaler 
said. "It's not just two or three newspaper articles that are going to go 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Lipper said: "The question is, will alternative investments become more 
attractive -- real-estate private placement programs, for example? If that 
happened, then I would be very concerned for the fund industry." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, executives must grapple with the sales-practice issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry must improve its communications and disclose more information," 
Lipper said. "Investment strategies should be evolved for the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 "At Piper Jaffray, communications about the fund were so far apart from how 
the fund was actually run," Rekenthaler said, noting that Piper had told 
investors that the fund was conservative.

PHANTOM BANKS BILK INVESTORS OUT OF MILLIONS; FRAUD: NUMBER OF FAKE 
INSTITUTIONS IS RISING. EXPERTS SAY DEALS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE PROBABLY ARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Preying on small investors and businesses hungry for higher returns, sham 
banks that sell phony investments are cropping up around the country, bilking 
unsuspecting customers out of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Using official-sounding names and fancy addresses, these phantom banks, as 
regulators call them, aren't really banks but fake companies that exist only on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal banking authorities say the scams are masterminded by con artists who 
promise investors huge rewards in return for a large fee or deposit. But when 
the time comes for investors to receive their payouts, the bank and investors' 
money are nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major problem that has not abated," said John Shockey, special 
assistant to the federal Comptroller of the Currency and an expert on banking 
scams. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 18 months, several phantom bank schemes have caught the attention 
of regulators and law enforcement officials. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * A bank in Rochester, N.Y., claiming affiliation with a legitimate banking 
company in the former Soviet Union, sold millions of dollars of phony 
certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Miami investor lost $2 million after people in Toronto claiming to 
represent a bank licensed on the Caribbean island of Montserrat sold bogus 
five-year CDs. Canadian banking officials said the crooks targeted Americans 
for schemes involving phony CDs and large loans requiring an upfront fee of 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors in Germany and other European countries were bilked by a phony 
U.S. bank called First American Insurance and Banking Corp. that lured 
customers by advertising high-interest savings accounts in local papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators say the scam banks may target wealthy people and pose as financial 
planners with a great investment opportunity. They also prey on elderly people, 
immigrants and people who can't obtain loans from real banks because of bad 
credit history. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of phantom banks is on the rise, officials say, because real bank 
CDs pay low rates and investors are looking for better deals. Rogue banks lure 
customers with CDs or other investments that they claim have interest rates of 
25% or higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Scams are also increasing because people are enticed by stories of 
high-yielding overseas investments. Many phantom banks claim to deal in 
securities or bank notes arranged by foreign banks or through offshore 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shockey said the schemes work like this: Criminals line up investors by 
placing ads in local and national newspapers about the investments themselves 
or about tax planning and brokerage services. 
</P>
<P>
 The investments range from CDs to so-called prime bank notes, a phony type of 
credit letter or debenture. The phantom banks usually require investors to buy 
the notes or the CDs and they promise big returns within a specified period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they may have official-looking documents and may list addresses in 
major financial districts, the banks often don't have real offices. Some use 
post office box numbers, while others are registered in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing more of it," said Larry Sweeny, in charge of special situations 
at the New York state banking department. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sent to all banks it 
supervises a list of more than 60 entities that are conducting banking 
businesses illegally or without regulatory authorization. The Canadian 
government separately issued a list of over 200 entities operating illegally in 
both the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time these phantom banks make the watchdog list, the damage already 
has been done. The FDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal 
Reserve Board usually find out about the phantom banks from real bankers whose 
customers have been contacted by the rogues or from consumers who have been 
victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agencies warn financial institutions about the phantom banks, 
consumers are often on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Shockey said investors should be on the lookout for products that promise 
exorbitant returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to prosecute the criminals who run phantom banks because many 
times the victims are unwilling to press charges or the schemes take months to 
unravel, Shockey said. 
</P>
<P>
 To convince investors that it was legitimate, First American Insurance and 
Banking Corp. furnished prospective customers with a list of federally-insured 
banking institutions that had been purchased from the FDIC. It altered the list 
to include itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Mesheske, chief of special activities at the FDIC's division of 
supervision, said the bank was not insured by the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
 First American, headquartered in Delaware with an office in New York, took 
deposits from numerous investors. But the investors found they couldn't contact 
the bank when they wanted their money back, banking authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's Delaware and New York phone numbers are out of service, and its New 
York office, supposedly in a Fifth Avenue office building, doesn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesheske said the agency has received numerous complaints from investors who 
have lost large sums of money through the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDIC is working with banking and law enforcement authorities to track 
First American down, Mesheske said. In the meantime, the agency has issued a 
special alert to U.S. banks warning them to be extremely cautious of any 
transactions involving First American. Warning Signs 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators say there are warning signs that can tip off consumers to 
phantom, or phony, banks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Newspaper ads, letters or pitches for letters of credit, prime bank notes,

 Gateway Communications Inc.: The beleaguered computer equipment maker said 
Friday its shareholders have approved the $2-million sale of the company's 
assets, primarily its wide-area networking communications product line, to a 
competitor in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction with Microdyne Corp. in Alexandria, Va., is expected to close 
next week, when Gateway's chairman and chief executive, Patrick F. Cadigan, 
will resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway, which will have about $3 million in cash and securities after the 
closing, said it will continue to exist as a publicly traded company and will 
look for another business to acquire.

HAWAIIAN READY TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawaiian Airlines Inc. is ready to emerge from Bankruptcy Court protection 
today with a solid capital structure and a strong outlook for expansion, its 
chief executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company has significantly improved over the last 18 months," said Bruce 
Nobles, president and chief executive of Hawaiian. "We have the right fleet, 
cost structure and marketing partner to go forward and be profitable on a 
fairly consistent basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobles cited two aspects of Hawaiian's new life: its creditors' agreement to 
accept stock in exchange for debt and Hawaiian's marketing and services 
agreement with American Airlines and its parent, AMR Corp., that will help it 
strategically. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Hawaiian will be linked with AMR's Sabre computerized reservations 
system, giving it more access to travel agencies for flight bookings. And 
American Airlines will pay Hawaiian Airlines to fly its passengers who want to 
use frequent-flyer coupons for travel to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheaper for American to use Hawaiian for those passengers, and Hawaiian 
gets more revenue," said Randy Havre, an analyst at J.B. Havre Inc., who has 
been watching Hawaiian's reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, AMR will maintain Hawaiian's fleet of six Boeing DC-10s and 13 
DC-9s for less than what it cost the company to maintain the Lockheed L1011 
aircraft it previously used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saved $15 million in cash in 1994 because the overhauls were not needed on 
the L1011s," Nobles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian's reorganization has been relatively swift by bankruptcy standards. 
It sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code on Sept. 21, 1993. Many companies take years to reorganize under 
bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the reorganization plan, Hawaiian Airlines Inc. is created 
by merging the previous holding company, HAL Inc., and its subsidiary, West 
Maui Airport Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 All HAL common stock will be canceled and the reorganized company will issue 
about 11 million shares of new common stock to be distributed among unsecured 
creditors who are owed more than $50 million. New shares also will go to the 
employees, management and for warrants related to financing after Bankruptcy 
Court conformation of the reorganization plan. Shareholders of the old HAL Inc. 
get nothing under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The new shares are expected to be listed on the American and Pacific stock 
exchanges within 90 days after Hawaiian emerges from Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian also is expected to complete an agreement today with the CIT 
Group/Credit Finance Inc. for a credit line up to $8.65 million. About $3 
million will be for letters of credit, and the remainder will be used as 
working capital and payment of some expenses, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some details are still being finalized, but it's basically done," Nobles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Havre, the analyst, said there will be about 1,200 initial shareholders in the 
new company. "In that respect, it will create some liquidity," Havre said. But 
some creditors may want to cash out and sell their stock, "and that would 
create a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Havre said he expects most new shareholders won't sell immediately, but will 
wait and evaluate the company after six months or a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Havre estimates Hawaiian's new shares will have a value of about $4. 
"Considering cash flow and estimated earnings, Hawaiian is undervalued at that 
price," he said.

JAPAN UNDERGOING A MODERATE RECOVERY, OFFICIALS SAY; ECONOMY: OTHERS DISAGREE; 
J.P. MORGAN PREDICTS FALL IN INVESTMENT. VALUE OF AUTO SALES FLAT. 
</P>

<P>
 Is Japan's worst post-World War II recession over? 
</P>
<P>
 In a report interpreted by the mass media here as the official word of the end 
of the three-year slump, the government said last week that, in essence, things 
are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy has turned "toward a moderate recovery," the Economic Planning 
Agency (EPA) said in its monthly report to the Cabinet -- continuing months of 
caution on forecasting the direction of the struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the EPA also warned that a "full-fledged" upswing could not be foreseen 
until companies' investments in factory equipment stops declining and 
apprehensions over the impact of the surge in the yen disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun, once it rises, doesn't reverse course, but we can't say that about 
our economy," EPA Minister Masahiko Komura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsutomu Tanaka, the agency's vice minister, was more optimistic. He said the 
economy could achieve the goal of 2.4% growth that the government set in its 
fiscal 1994 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Isamu Miyazaki, head of the Daiwa Research Institute and a former EPA vice 
minister, said growth would range between 1% and 1.5% this fiscal year and 
reach 3% in fiscal 1995, even without full recovery in corporate profits and 
investment. Equipment investment, he said, would turn upward in mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But J.P. Morgan in its own report Friday predicted that investment would 
decline 7% this year and fall again by 0.5% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession, by EPA calculations, began in May, 1991, in the aftermath of 
the bursting of a "bubble" of excessive investment in plant equipment, stocks 
and land in the late 1980s. Last year, growth all but halted, with gross 
domestic product increasing only a tenth of a percent. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency cited as reasons for its cautious optimism a continuing high level 
of housing construction, increases in production, a pickup in consumer spending 
spurred by a $55-billion refund to taxpayers in late June and early July and 
improved business confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA failed to mention it, but strong exports also have added a prop. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week ago, however, Hideo Sakamaki, president of Nomura Securities, 
declared that "the future is still a black hole. Japan is still in a tunnel, 
and we can't see the exit." 
</P>
<P>
 Sakamaki also said that the country's capital markets are "not functioning" to 
provide funds needed for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth S. Courtis, strategist and senior economist for Deutsche Bank Capital 
Markets Asia, said banks' bad loans, which he estimated at about $650 billion, 
or 8% of the banks' assets, "represent a major negative for the entire 
economy." Continued contraction of bank lending because of that debt burden, he 
said, "makes it, at best, problematic for the economy to expand any time soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan Motors, also remained pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand that the politicians in the government want to say that the 
economy has recovered, but to us in the auto industry, it just feels that we 
have finally hit the bottom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of trucks started increasing just last April in comparison with a year 
earlier, and auto sales began picking up only in July, he noted. Customers, 
moreover, have switched to buying smaller cars and recreation vehicles, and as 
a result the value of sales still has not increased, he complained.

 Strike Strands Ships: The nationwide action begun Thursday by 7,000 seamen and 
dock workers of the Maritime Union of Australia is to protest what members fear 
will be a selloff of government-owned shipping interests.About 100 ships were 
stuck in ports Friday. Ship owners say the action is costing shippers and 
exporters an estimated $4.5 million a day. Late Friday, the government invited 
union officials to meet with Prime Minister Paul Keating today. At issue is the 
future of Australian National Line, the troubled shipping company owned by the

INDONESIAN PRESS OPERATING IN A CLIMATE OF FEAR; PUBLISHING: CRACKDOWN 
CONTINUES AS THE COUNTRY PREPARES TO HOST AN ECONOMIC SUMMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Indonesian press corps is still reeling from the government's abrupt 
decision in June to shut down three publications that had been testing the 
limits of President Suharto's stated policy of "openness." 
</P>
<P>
 The clampdown has led to a new era of fear and caution as editors running 
publications that have thus far escaped government sanctions warn their 
reporters to lie low. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the silenced journals is the influential newsweekly TEMPO, considered 
required reading among the nation's movers and shakers. The magazine remains in 
limbo as a tense battle for control wages behind closed doors. Some former 
employees accuse the government of moving against TEMPO to help a powerful ally 
of Suharto gain control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the ultimate corporate raid, Indonesian-style," says former TEMPO chief 
editor Goenawan Mohamed. "You use government power to take over the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Before its license was revoked, the magazine, founded 23 years ago, was 
flourishing. It was favored by advertisers eager to reach the swelling ranks of 
middle- and upper-class consumers in this developing nation, taking in $20.85 
million in revenue last year and posting an annual growth rate of 15%. 
Circulation had reached 198,000. The magazine, unlike media of many Third World 
nations, routinely dispatched reporters to all corners of the globe and also 
maintained correspondents in Washington, Melbourne, Tokyo, New Delhi and other 
capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The government did not spell out the reasons for closing TEMPO; it only cited 
a general need to safeguard national security. However, the decision came after 
Suharto delivered an angry speech criticizing TEMPO's reports on a 
controversial purchase of used ships from the former East German navy. The deal 
was supervised by the president's protege and close adviser, Minister for 
Research and Technology B.J. Habibie. Habibie, for his part, has insisted 
privately that he only wished to bring TEMPO to court, not shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers believe that the government action was more the result of 
long-accumulating anxiety over perceived links between some TEMPO staffers and 
former Defense Minister Benny Moerdani, seen as a political threat to Suharto. 
With the president's sixth five-year term ending in 1998, jitters over 
succession are mounting. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other banned publications -- a political tabloid called Detik and the 
newsweekly Editor -- were accused of inflaming conflicts among the national 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Three government ministers have delivered public promises that a new license, 
known as a SIUPP, will be granted to TEMPO. Yet TEMPO journalists worry that it 
will come with strings attached as the Suharto government reasserts its control 
over the press in an attempt to minimize dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports have surfaced that the government will only revive the magazine under 
the ownership of Bob Hasan, a close Suharto associate and chairman of APKINDO, 
the powerful Indonesian plywood association. The timber magnate has publicly 
denied that he has entered into any negotiations, but some TEMPO staffers say 
they have already received feelers from Hasan's camp. 
</P>
<P>
 At an Aug. 10 stockholders' meeting, TEMPO employees voted to apply for a new 
license independent of any new investor. In the context of Indonesian politics, 
this is hardly equivalent to a poison pill. "We suspect that the chances of 
getting a new SIUPP are no more than 5%," says Bambang Bujono, newly elected by 
his colleagues as the chief editor of a revived magazine. "But we still have to 
try. This is better than not trying at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Consistent with Indonesia's press law, employees own 20% of the shares in the 
holding company that owns TEMPO, a company that counts other lucrative assets 
such as an East Java daily newspaper, a publishing house, and various parcels 
of real estate. These shares are estimated to be worth at least $2 million, 
enough to get the magazine back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not the new license is granted, a bitter Mohamed plans to file suit 
against the government this month. An independent journalists' alliance has 
been formed to challenge the supremacy of the existing journalists union, which 
is controlled by the ruling party, Colkar. 
</P>
<P>
 The street protests of June gave way in July and August to poetry readings, 
artistic "happenings," public discussions and strategy sessions organized by a 
determined contingent of artists, activists, intellectuals and journalists. 
Photocopied pamphlets, the Indonesian version of Russian samizdat texts, are 
spreading throughout the archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
 Eros Djarot, former executive editor of Detik, has thrown his energies into 
recording an album of songs celebrating freedom, human rights and democracy. 
"We just want to prove that no one can stop our creativity," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts do not represent a significant challenge to the Suharto 
government. Yet they do cast a shadow over Indonesia's image just as the 
world's fourth most-populous nation prepares for a rare turn in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Jakarta will play host in November to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) summit, spearheaded by President Clinton. The summit is expected to draw 
about 3,000 journalists as well as foreign government leaders and officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A continued press crackdown is likely to draw further criticism of Indonesia 
-- already condemned by the United States and other nations for repression in 
East Timor, which Indonesia annexed in 1975. The U.S. Congress has banned the 
sale of small weapons, light arms and crowd control equipment to Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting with Suharto earlier this month, South African President Nelson 
Mandela called for new discussions on the East Timor question. Banned Weekly 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia's weekly news magazine Tempo had made impressive circulation gains 
before it was banned by the government. Circulation, in thousands: '93: 168,000

otherwise known as P.T. Indonesian Satellite Corp., or Indosat. The offering is 
part of a larger global stock sale planned for later this year by Indosat and 
the Indonesian government, which now owns all of Indosat's 931.9 million shares 
outstanding.

 Firms Expect to Raise More Than $1 Billion This Quarter: Executives and 
analysts said Taiwan companies expect to raise that amount in international 
capital markets through bond and stock sales. They include industrial blue chip 
Formosa Plastics Corp., which plans to raise $350 million in a bond sale, and 
electronics group Yageo Corp., which launched a stock issue nearly two weeks 
ago. Taiwan is already one of the largest Southeast Asian issuers 
internationally of stocks and bonds this year, said Justin Leverenz, an analyst 
with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Taipei, after sales of more than $1 
billion were realized by about 20 Taiwanese companies over the spring and 
summer.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; WHERE THE JOBS ARE; POLARIZATION OF JOB MARKET TO 
INTENSIFY, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You can go to college or technical training school and make good money working 
as a nurse, a corporate manager or a computer programmer. Or you can struggle 
to finish high school and face the slim paycheck given to a hamburger flipper, 
a gardener or a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, there may not be much in between as the job market moves to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the sobering message from the experts who peer into the cloudy crystal 
ball of employment forecasting, trying to predict the world of work in the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's sharp divisions in America's labor market will accelerate even more in 
coming years, as workers are increasingly channeled into a highly trained and 
well-paid class of professionals and technicians, or a growing army of service 
workers whose tasks are vital but who get low pay and scanty fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great hole in the middle, where there were semi-skilled 
manufacturing workers, and the generalist middle manager also is falling by the 
wayside," said Ted Gibson, principal economist for the California Department of 
Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-paid specialists and technicians will have the ample income, and the 
scarcity of time, to demand more services provided by the lesser-paid workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of 2005, according to federal and state forecasts, will be one in 
which people eat out more frequently (more jobs for cooks and food-preparation 
workers) and drink less (fewer jobs for bartenders); spend less time in bank 
lines (fewer tellers and more ATM machines); have their yards cared for (more 
gardeners) and houses decorated (more painters and paperhangers), and, when 
they fall ill, get more of their care at home (more home care aides and 
licensed practical nurses). 
</P>
<P>
 The best jobs -- full-time, year-round, with health insurance, pensions and 
other benefits -- will be reserved for the highly trained specialists. Even in 
the shrinking manufacturing sector, there will be 230,000 new jobs nationwide 
for specialists -- engineers, scientists and computer systems experts. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Employment Development Department, in its study of the labor 
market for the period 1990 to 2005, predicts the 10 largest growth categories 
will include such service jobs as retail sales clerks, office clerks, 
waiters-waitresses and cashiers, along with the higher-salaried general 
managers-executives and registered nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government also expects a huge surge in service jobs, with a sharp 
demarcation between the well-paid, highly trained workers and low-skilled 
legions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that both California and the nation have shown an 
acceleration in growth at opposite ends of the income distribution," said Tom 
Lieser, an economist with the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are the hottest growth sector. Health care services "will be one of 
the fastest-growing industries in the economy, with employment increasing from 
9.6 million to 13.8 million" by 2005, according to the 1994-95 edition of the 
U.S. Labor Department's "Occupational Outlook Handbook." Improved medical 
technology and a rapidly growing population of elderly Americans will 
accelerate the demand for health services. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail trade will show a healthy 23% expansion in employment throughout the 
nation and a booming growth rate of 33% in California. Restaurants, furniture 
stores and specialty shops are all expected to enjoy strong job gains. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 3 million business service jobs will be added nationally. This sector 
boasts one of the fastest-growing activities: computer and data-processing 
services. Personnel supply services, or temporary help agencies, will keep 
expanding at a rapid rate. And businesses will demand a wide range of 
consulting services, the EDD predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many jobs that used to be inside now are contracted out," said Thomas P. 
Nagle, EDD director. "Businesses buy the services as they need them. The way we 
do business in Corporate America has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The aristocrats of the service industries will be those whose education has 
brought them the best jobs, the Labor Department's handbook promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Continued expansion of the service-producing sector conjures up an image of a 
work force dominated by cashiers, retail sales workers and waiters," the 
handbook says. "Although service-sector growth will generate millions of these 
jobs, it also will create jobs for financial managers, engineers, nurses, 
electrical and electronics technicians, and many other managerial, professional 
and technical workers. . . . The fastest-growing occupations will be those that 
require the most formal training." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about any revival of California's well-paid manufacturing jobs that 
didn't demand much educational background -- this segment of industry has been 
declining for a long time. By 2005, the state will add 3 million jobs, with a 
scant 88,000 going to manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace and defense activity in California will keep shrinking, with further 
losses in the companies involved in aircraft, guided missiles and space 
vehicles, and the electronics components industry will give up jobs too as "the 
manufacturing process becomes more automated and more firms move production 
overseas," says the EDD's official forecast. Government is also shrinking in 
relative share of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, manufacturing and government each accounted for 20% of all jobs in 
California. By 2005, their share will shrink to 14% each. 
</P>
<P>
 Times will continue to be tough for the displaced workers. "It isn't likely 
that people who lose manufacturing jobs will gain new jobs in the upper-pay 
category," said Ronald Kutscher, associate commissioner of labor statistics at 
the Labor Department. "There is a growing wage disparity between those who are 
highly educated and those who are uneducated," said Kathy Masera, publisher of 
the California Job Journal, a weekly publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means living standards could deteriorate for many Americans," she 
warned. Many families already need a second income to maintain the middle-class 
standard of living. If the main breadwinner is laid off from a well-paid 
manufacturing job, the family may never recover, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the world becomes even more insecure, future workers should be forewarned. 
"The focus for young people needs to be on education and an understanding of 
what their incomes will be without it," she said. U.S. Job Growth

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; WHERE THE JOBS ARE; THE FIELD OF RETAIL SALES IS 
RINGING UP GAINS 
</P>

<P>
 The unemployment office is losing one of its best suppliers: the retail 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession and restructuring woes that led to so many retail layoffs in 
recent years are largely gone. As a result, the retail business during the next 
decade will find itself in the happy role of job creator, with employment 
growing an estimated 23% between 1992 and 2005, according to U.S. Labor 
Department estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Job growth is expected in a wide variety of positions, but one of the hottest 
jobs in the store will be that of -- no kidding -- sales associate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retail clearly is an industry that is growing. There's a lot of opportunity," 
said Robert Hall, vice president of the National Retail Federation, a trade 
group based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some growth at the headquarters office, but the real explosion 
of growth will be on the sales floor," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts insist that sales associates are metamorphosing beyond the 
minimum wage-paying foot soldier of the retail wars, the sort of careless 
refugee from the unemployment line with little talent for sales and even less 
interest in the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 As retailers launch yet another of their perennial pushes to improve customer 
service, they say they are creating a sort of "super sales associate" who roams 
the store to find the best way to serve clients. The most successful among them 
generally work on commission and are being well rewarded financially. Many are 
making a career of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Kaufman is one of this breed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman is among the top sellers in the Nordstrom chain; in 1992, she was the 
best of the best, moving $1.3 million in merchandise. Kaufman works at 
Nordstrom's Westside Pavilion store in men's suits -- at least, that's what her 
bosses think. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, Kaufman traipses all over the store gathering shirts, ties, socks 
and accessories to coordinate with a just-purchased suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my little corner of the world," said Kaufman, a former teacher who 
has been a sales pro for the last 16 years. "This company provides me with 
every tool I need to basically run my own business." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman said her father, who worked in retail his whole life, jokes that his 
daughter single-handedly sells more in one year that an entire store did in his 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my career," Kaufman said. "I went in with the attitude that I was 
going to be the best I could be." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman does it with an almost obsessive attention to detail and by treating 
her "gentlemen" in a manner to which they have not been accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
 She maintains a "personal book" listing a myriad of details about her clients, 
including sizes, colors and designer preferences. ("It's like a Bible to me," 
she says.) She calls special customers when certain shipments arrive. She sends 
thank-you notes. She ships out 1,500 hand-signed invitations to Nordstrom's 
"half yearly" sales. She remembers birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 And the bulk of her customers in a given day have asked specifically for her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a marvelous clientele," Kaufman said. "Even when the recession hit Los 
Angeles, I was treated very loyally by my clientele." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordstrom sales associates make an average income of $24,000, although a "good 
pool" earns between $30,000 and $40,000 and "a handful" hovers at the 
six-figure mark, said spokeswoman Caroline Brown. They also enjoy full 
benefits, profit sharing and a 401k retirement plan. Only 38% of the sales 
force is employed part time. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nordstrom and many of the mid- to higher-end retailers, sales associates 
usually work on commission or on a combination of salary and commission. That 
means the more they sell, the more they earn. The potential for high incomes is 
not as promising at salary-based retailers. The overall average salary for 
full-time retail sales people is less than $20,000 a year, according to the 
Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of sales associate remains a good entry point into the retail business 
for those interested in management or buyer/merchandiser jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordstrom's management employees have all come up through the ranks, said Joe 
Demarte, vice president of personnel. One local store manager took a temporary 
sales job during Christmas break from college several years ago and never left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our growth will be in new stores and most of our opportunities, most of our 
jobs, will be in sales," Demarte said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The National Retail Federation, with the help of a Labor Department grant, is 
developing a set of job standards for professional sales people, said Kathy 
Mannes, a project coordinator for the trade organization. The group also is 
considering starting a credential program that would be transferable from store 
to store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've met people making six figures in all kinds of stores, but that's 
because they really stayed with it," Mannes said. "We're really talking about a 
professional sales associate, a committed long-term employee who is empowered 
by their employer in terms of customer service."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; WHERE THE JOBS ARE; HOW TO PAY THE LIGHT BILL 
WHILE WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED

<P>
 There are two kinds of actors: those who are stars and those who need jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stars are the actors who make enough money to tide them over from role to 
role. The legions of character actors, supporting actors, extras and wanna-bes, 
however, find a career in acting is all too often an unconnected series of 
roles separated by a lot of waiting. And they still have to pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to find a job that pays enough but won't get in the way of 
acting. And that's some trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors call the work they do in between acting stints "day jobs," even though 
many are in fact night jobs. Actors waiting tables is an enduring Hollywood 
cliche. But restaurant jobs still work well with an acting career because they 
offer the flexibility to work odd hours or trade shifts with other employees if 
an audition or role comes up. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs waiting tables are readily available in Southern California and 
well-suited to an actor's skills, said Michael Van Duezer of the Actors Equity 
Assn. "Dealing with the public and all that," he said. "And, depending on where 
you work, it can be good, quick money." 
</P>
<P>
 But, with a little bit of luck and ingenuity, actors can find many other jobs 
to fill the bill. These aren't permanent, full-time positions, so they rarely 
pay well. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no one best job for an actor, said Josh Schiowitz, whose Hollywood 
agency, Schiowitz/Clay/Rose represents established and aspiring actors. 
"Everybody has his own version of the ideal job, one that's flexible, where 
they know you need to take time off for auditions and jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some common jobs for actors, because they provide that flexibility, are 
telephone sales, car parking and part-time work at health clubs, construction 
sites and offices. Many actors prefer working for catering brokers -- which 
supply servers and bartenders to caterers or for private parties -- or for 
temporary-help agencies. These days, temp agencies hire for jobs ranging from 
traditional clerical work to accounting, industrial and light construction 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of working for such agencies is being able to call in and 
specify which days you're willing to work, say actors who choose these jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the opportunity to work several days or nights a week, many career 
actors find it tough going without a spouse or a roommate to share living 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Hansen is a 29-year-old actor who figures he needs to work three days, or 
nights, in a combination of jobs to earn his fair share of household expenses. 
Sometimes his wife, Midi, wishes he'd work more so they'd have more of a 
cushion in their budget, but Hansen said it's important that he have time to 
devote to the theater group he started and to be available when calls for 
acting work do come. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying available for auditions puts the biggest crimp in an actor's ability 
to work a day job. Sometimes the call comes the night before, but more likely 
only a few hours' notice is given. A missed phone call or audition could be 
some other actor's big break. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day, a call came at 10 (in the morning) for a 2 o'clock audition," 
said Hansen, who works for Host Helpers, a catering broker, as a 
sometimes-landscaper and does substitute teaching. He made the audition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's most steady money comes from substitute teaching in the Inglewood 
School District, where he can call in once a week and tell a computer what days 
he's available for work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a little bit of start-up time to get the paperwork together and pass 
the test" to become credentialed for subbing, but it has been worth it, Hansen 
said. "It's $100 a day and it's only a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Robinson is a fortysomething actor who had a good career going in 
commercial films and minor film and TV roles in Dallas -- including a small one 
in the series "Dallas" -- when he moved his family to Los Angeles five years 
ago in search of larger roles. He says he lives in "eternal hope," but until 
his big break comes, he has had to take a day job. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he works 20 hours a week, at night, reading transcripts to court-reporting 
students at Merit College in Los Angeles. Merit hires primarily actors and 
musicians as readers because of their ability to keep a measured pace while 
reading previously unseen material. Robinson prefers it to waiting tables, but 
wonders whether reading at 240 words per minute -- that's four words a second 
-- is all that beneficial to his acting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Holmes is an actor and singer who also works for a small film 
production company. "When all of that fails -- and it's feast or famine -- when 
I need more work, I have one straight world job, or day job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes has parlayed her affinity for computers into a consulting job that 
allows her to set her own hours. Currently, she is writing computer-based 
training programs and appearing in a musical, "Song of Singapore," at a Long 
Beach theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding an understanding boss is almost as important as finding the right job. 
Agents say it's usually best to be upfront with a perspective employer about 
your acting career, and actors agree. 
</P>
<P>
 One actor recalled having to quit a job where the boss didn't know. "After 
all, there are only so many times you can go home 'sick' in the middle of the 
day" to make an audition, the actor said.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; WHERE THE JOBS ARE; SEEKING REAL ESTATE GOLD? TRY 
PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

<P>
 When the housing market was white-hot in the 1980s, more than 3,000 
Californians a month took out a salesperson's license in the hope of making a 
killing by selling real estate. Even some part-timers earned more than $50,000 
a year in commissions, until the market went bust and the recession took hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the economy is back on the mend and the realty market is pulling out of 
its long slump. If you're thinking of pursuing a real estate career, this could 
be an ideal time to do it -- as long as you don't expect to start making a lot 
of money overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great time to get into the industry, because things are slowly 
getting better and you'll have some time to build a foundation before the 
business really takes off," said Pat Neal, an Orange County broker and 
president of the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you think that working in real estate is an easy way to make a fast 
buck, forget it. The 'easy money' days are long gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most realtors say that new salespeople trying to break into today's 
tepid market are lucky if they make $15,000 a year. Experienced California 
agents with a long list of "repeat" customers average about $55,000, according 
to the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Neal and other experts say, the hottest real estate jobs and most 
opportunities are no longer in sales: They're in property management. With 
vacancies high and inflation low, owners need help in wringing every last cent 
of profit out of their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 True, dealing with tenants and making sure an office or apartment complex is 
in good shape may not sound like much fun. But it does offer a steady paycheck 
-- unlike a job as a commissioned salesperson -- and much more room for career 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any industry, pay scales vary widely. An entry-level position that 
involves dealing with tenants and supervising maintenance workers at several 
small buildings pays between $25,000 and $35,000 a year, said Bob Sullivan of 
Sullivan-Dituri Real Estate, which manages about 2,500 rental units in West Los 
Angeles and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have some experience and a degree in business or a related field, you 
could earn more than $50,000 a year by working as an account manager for a big 
firm, where you'd be responsible for the cash-flow analysis and supervision of 
a large portfolio of properties. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even bigger money at the top. Sullivan said the heads of many big 
property-management firms or supervisors of large office complexes earn more 
than $100,000 a year -- and many got their start by managing a small apartment 
building or shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a college degree will be helpful if you're looking for a white-collar 
job with a large property management firm, many smaller companies and most real 
estate sales offices aren't as demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative to getting a four-year degree, many newcomers instead simply 
take a few courses in their chosen real estate field at a community college. 
Local chapters of trade associations, such as the nonprofit Institute of Real 
Estate Management, also offer inexpensive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all property managers work full-time. Many are apartment-dwellers who 
simply do some light maintenance work around their building and show vacant 
units to prospective tenants for a few hundreds dollars a month, or for a 
reduction in their rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are homeowners who've agreed to handle the leasing duties for neighbors 
or co-workers who've been transferred, but have decided to rent out their house 
instead of sell it. Their typical fee: Between $100 and $500 to screen tenants 
and handle all the paperwork, plus $100 to $300 a month for supervision and 
collecting the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of (free-lance) jobs for people who want to specialize in 
managing houses or small apartments, because they're just too small for most 
management firms to mess with," said David Gribin, co-owner of Citiscape 
Property Services in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can manage four or five houses in your spare time, you can make $1,000 
or $1,500 a month. Plus, you'll get a feel for what the property-management 
business is all about and then you can decide if you'd like to make it a 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're serious about getting any type of job in the real estate industry, 
experts say you should start by obtaining a salesperson's license. In 
California, that requires taking 45 hours of training in real estate 
fundamentals at a private school or college and then passing a three-hour exam 
administered by the state department of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you're not going into sales, you're going to need a license if you're 
handling contracts or money," said property manager Sullivan. "Besides, the 
stuff you learn in real estate school is useful, even if you never go into the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Sluggish sales and rising mortgage rates have dimmed the short-term prospects 
for two other key jobs in the industry -- mortgage brokers and real estate 
appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Professionals in those fields can enjoy six-figure incomes when the market's 
hot, but their earnings plunge when activity cools.

 Long before Southern California's aerospace industry began going through 
convulsions in the late 1980s, Norman Schaffer sensed that the good times 
weren't going to last forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired by Lockheed in 1980 as a metalworker, Schaffer realized that if the 
company's business slowed down, he could be out on the street. Sure enough, 
Schaffer wound up being laid off by Lockheed in 1992 as the company wound down 
its operations in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike so many of his counterparts from the ravaged aerospace industry, 
Schaffer, now 42, quickly found another job. The reason: He had taken the 
initiative, years earlier, of beginning extended training in a trade where 
skilled workers are badly needed: air-conditioning maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaffer's story of survival in today's turbulent job market could be a 
harbinger for the American work force. In a world where technology is 
transforming the nature of work and where job security is disappearing, 
training advocates and career counselors say perhaps the best way to stay 
employed is through what has come to be known as lifelong learning. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, these employment specialists say, workers need to continually 
develop marketable new talents and skills that enhance their value in the job 
market. The aim is to help workers remain valuable to their current employers 
or, in the event of a layoff, find new jobs more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's common sense. Nobody is going to take care of us anymore," said Judith 
A. Waterman, head of a career counseling firm in San Mateo, Calif., and 
co-author of a recent Harvard Business Review article concerning lifelong 
learning and developing a "career-resilient" work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifelong learning can involve enrolling in anything from government 
job-training programs to community college art courses. Worthwhile classes are 
also offered by university extension programs, for-profit schools and even the 
local computer store. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, lifelong learning may mean volunteering for a special work 
assignment offering a chance to try something new. The important thing is to 
seize opportunities to learn skills that are prized in the general job market. 
</P>
<P>
 If you consider yourself a computer illiterate, it's probably time to learn 
your way around the keyboard. A recent survey by Olsten Corp., a human 
resources consulting firm, found that within a few years, employers will want 
almost all of their employees to possess computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also encourage people with specialized backgrounds to round out their 
knowledge. If you are a numbers cruncher, try learning more about negotiating, 
customer service skills and dealing with different types of people. In fact, 
those types of courses are helpful for employees in many lines of work. 
</P>
<P>
 When people "don't fit" in their jobs, Waterman said, "it's more often because 
of their social skills than for any other reason." 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're, say, a marketing specialist already savvy in interpersonal 
relations, you might want to take an accounting course to improve your grasp of 
financial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 While career counselors advise workers to take the initiative in pursuing 
training and other forms of lifelong learning, some high-tech companies and 
other employers offer a helping hand -- or a strong push. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola Inc., for instance, in 1990 started requiring all employees to 
receive at least five days of training, job-related or otherwise, every year. 
The company also encouraged more employees to take college courses by paying 
for tuition in advance, rather than having employees pay first and be 
reimbursed later.  
</P>
<P>
 To some skeptics, spending lots of money on general training and education in 
an era when employees freely move from company to company doesn't make economic 
sense. But Susan Harwood, director of human and organization development for a 
Phoenix-based unit of Motorola, counters that good training programs build 
employee loyalty and keep talented workers from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't invest in your people, why would they invest in you?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Harwood said, such programs give more Motorola workers the skills 
to transfer from the company's shrinking business units to new jobs in 
expanding operations. That, in turn, means the company has to lay off fewer 
employees and pay less in severance benefits. "Everyone benefits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major roadblocks to lifelong learning, however, is a lack of time, 
awareness or motivation among many workers, especially those who aren't getting 
encouragement from their employers. "How many people are proactive? As I look 
around, I don't see that many," said Charlene Walker, co-owner of Womens 
Focus/Career Focus, a career development and outplacement company in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people will sit and keep their jobs as long as the paycheck comes in," 
Walker said. "Only when push comes to shove do they go out and look for new 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 At Lockheed, Schaffer said, even when the company announced that layoffs were 
imminent, "most people took the attitude that 'I'll cross that bridge when I 
come to it' " instead of embarking on job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 By starting to take air-conditioning courses in the mid-1980s, Schaffer said, 
"I was trying to cross the bridge before I ever saw it." He now earns $15.50 an 
hour maintaining the air-conditioning system at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 An indication of how few employees pursue training came in a study released 
last November by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. It found that 
at 858 companies offering tuition-reimbursement programs, only 6.5% of eligible 
employees took advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many workers simply can't find the time for such courses. "It's hard enough to 
hold a job and raise a family," said Denise Georgemiller, who directed the 
Hewitt study. In other cases, she said, employers have done little to publicize 
the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For those willing to make the commitment, the key is finding out what kind of 
training would most likely provide a boost in the job market. But how do you do 
it? For starters, check out the newspaper help-wanted ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a type of computer expertise or knowledge of a particular software 
required for job openings in your field or the field you want to enter? If so 
and you don't have that training, go get it.  
</P>
<P>
 Many companies cling to proprietary or out-of-fashion software for such tasks 
as word processing; if that's the only kind of software you are familiar with, 
it's a good idea to learn how to work with the most widely used word-processing 
programs, such as WordPerfect or Microsoft Word. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are interested in switching to a new field, talk to people already in 
that line of work, preferably someone who does hiring. Find out what type of 
training you would need to be a serious candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 People who turn their personal interests and hobbies into careers are often a 
step ahead of the pack when it comes to training. "If you're doing what you 
love to do, you're almost naturally going to stay up-to-date" with changes in 
the field, said David H. Hendon, manager of the federally funded Verdugo Center 
for Jobs and Retraining in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 If you aren't fortunate enough to have turned your personal passion into a 
job, training specialists say, it's important to identify new skills that can 
broaden your expertise and make you more adaptable as an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 As for where to find worthwhile programs and classes, experts advise, look at 
what's available at your current place of work, even if the offerings don't 
sound very enticing at first. At the least, you might make some valuable 
contacts that lead to new opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, training offered at work is sometimes narrowly focused to a specific 
job at a specific company and thus doesn't equip workers with skills they could 
use in a new role, said Carol G. Brown, director of professional development 
projects for the Washington-based American Society for Training and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Training, she said, "is really a very personal thing. People have to take the 
responsibility of developing their own strategies."

<P>
 To listen to executive recruiters and other employment trend specialists these 
days, the corporate hotshot, so sought-after in the me-decade of the '80s, is a 
has-been. Now employers want team players, people willing to join with their 
colleagues in collaborative -- not competitive -- efforts aimed at achieving 
shared goals, workers who genuinely believe that the whole is greater than the 
sum of its parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Gary Kaplan, owner of a Pasadena executive recruiting firm: "The 
single-combat warrior, that bright, purposeful worker, tends to suck up a lot 
of oxygen in an organization. And now they're often seen as too innovative and 
too difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The switch follows more than five years of intense thinning of management 
ranks throughout Corporate America that has left businesses with flattened 
organizational ties that many experts say require greater cooperation and 
productivity among remaining managers and workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies also view the teamwork system as a way of getting employees to think 
and act as though they are the owners of the business with a vested stake in 
its performance beyond a regular paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what does it take to become a team player? 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, says Marilyn Moats Kennedy of Career Strategies in Wilmette, 
Ill., you must suspend your innate disbelief that this concept can succeed. 
"You've got to believe that it's going to work; that's 80% of it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she readily admits that because many companies pay only lip service 
to the true value of teamwork -- shared goals, cooperative efforts and direct 
responsibility for results -- workers generally view the notion with cynicism 
and refuse to give it a fair chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teamwork is all too often a catch phrase used to demand loyalty from workers 
to their organization and boss," Kaplan complains. Even worse, he adds, the 
concept is also subject to becoming a mask for indecision, procrastination and 
lack of management leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can accept the possibility that teamwork can work, Kennedy says 
employees must remain focused on the goal the team has set for itself and 
flexible about the various approaches and working styles of their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Selecting the team's goal and strategies for achieving it can be the most 
important -- and difficult -- task facing a group of employees. Potential 
problems include trying to figure out management's desired results rather than 
exploring the full range of actions, as well as failure to allow a team to 
develop its own guidance and tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams require great management at the very top," Kennedy says. "It's no 
surprise that college sports coaches are paid as much or more than college 
presidents. Developing a cohesive, winning team is three times more difficult 
than issuing orders." 
</P>
<P>
 Personality issues, she argues, are largely irrelevant if employees share 
common goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best team players in sports -- men like (former Chicago Bulls basketball 
player) Michael Jordan and (former Chicago Bears quarterback) Jim McMahon are 
hardly men without intense personalities and strong skills," she notes. "But 
when they're working, they are entirely dedicated to the team's goal and 
anything else is irrelevant. That's how it should be in business, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some personality types are not well-suited to teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cutting an organization down to a core group that can manage through tough 
business cycles places a premium on getting people who can work together to get 
the job done," says John A. Challenger, executive vice president of Challenger, 
Gray & Christmas Inc., a Chicago-based job-search firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger believes that with only limited exceptions, any worker, no matter 
how independent, self-centered or inwardly focused, can become a team player. 
Those who need not apply? 
</P>
<P>
 "Complacent people, people who are adverse to action," he responds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts put risk-adverse and perfectionist personalities on the short 
list of workers generally unsuited to teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlene Walker of Womens Focus/Career Focus in Tustin says flexibility toward 
colleagues and their opinions and habits is perhaps the most important 
attribute a worker can bring to a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to buy into the notion that there is an advantage and an adventure 
to working as a team," she explains. "And you've got to believe that you are 
all in this together -- and for the better." Are You a Team Player? 
</P>
<P>
 Take the following quick test to determine whether you have the temperament to 
work in groups. 
</P>
<P>
 1. People say I'm impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 a. False 
</P>
<P>
 b. True 
</P>
<P>
 c. Uncertain 
</P>
<P>
 2. I find myself upset rather than helped by the kind of criticism that many 
people offer me. 
</P>
<P>
 a. Occasionally 
</P>
<P>
 b. Often 
</P>
<P>
 c. Never 
</P>
<P>
 3. I work best when: 
</P>
<P>
 a. I receive recognition and appreciation for my ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 b. I know that I did a good job. Self-approval is all I need. 
</P>
<P>
 c. Uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 4. If I had to choose, I would rather: 
</P>
<P>
 a. Work with others and follow group consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 b. Work alone with full responsibility for the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 c. Seek advice only when I want it. 
</P>
<P>
 5. In a group, I prefer: 
</P>
<P>
 a. To share my ideas regardless of who gets the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 b. To take a back seat and listen. 
</P>
<P>
 c. To impress everyone with my knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring: If you picked four or five "a" answers, you are probably a good team 
player, says Charlene Walker, of Womens Focus/Career Focus, a Tustin career 
development and job placement firm. If you answered fewer than that, consider 
work environments with different management styles.  
</P>
<P>
 Group-oriented people, Walker says, depend on social approval and admiration. 
They tend to ask others for help easily, prefer not to make independent 
decisions and are flexible with their ideas. Equally important, she adds, they 
are open to criticism.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; MAKING IT WORK; NEW CAREER? OPEN YOUR MIND AND 
PUDDLE-HOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Switching from a career as a computer systems designer to a financial planner 
may seem like a huge jump. And it would be if it were taken all at once. But, 
like most people who successfully change careers, Cassandra J. Frazelle, 51, of 
Costa Mesa took it in steps. "It wasn't one plunge -- it was more like puddle 
hopping," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of other Californians who have moved into new careers, Frazelle 
followed a series of steps that anyone can take, the first being a careful 
assessment of her interests and skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Some recareerers know exactly what field they want to move into -- they may 
have had a dream gnawing at them for years. But many, especially those 
pressured into making a move, need to delve into their job histories -- all the 
way back to those lemonade stands -- to get a fix on the things they are not 
only good at, but actually love doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's essential to have an open mind and get out of the (career) box they're 
in," says Kate Pope, director of counseling for Women at Work, a job and career 
resource center in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Plessner, 31, of Irvine learned the value of identifying her passion. 
After several years working for her father's fund-raising company, she knew she 
wasn't being fulfilled. She sought help from a career counselor at Cal State 
Fullerton, who told her: "Don't think of a job. Think of what you love." 
</P>
<P>
 Plessner's love was personal watercraft, but she never thought she could get 
paid for doing what she saw as a hobby. Her counselor helped her see 
differently, and, after considerable research, she landed a position in 
government relations at Kawasaki Motors in Irvine. She teaches water safety 
classes, trains marine police how to use personal watercraft and helps 
physically challenged people learn to water ski -- and she sometimes does her 
work in exotic settings such as the West Indies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tell me all the time now, 'You have such a great job!' " Plessner 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Research is the second key step in changing careers. It's a step most 
job-hunters want to skip or gloss over, but Plessner advises sticking with it. 
She spent hours in the library reading magazine articles on personal 
watercraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned what states were having problems, what the (trade) association was 
and what companies belonged to it, and what the hot spots were in the 
industry," she says. This knowledge helped her sound like an insider when she 
sent letters and resumes to major manufacturers of personal watercraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The best place to start researching a new career is the library. Read articles 
about the field in general business publications and specialized magazines and 
newsletters that cover the industry. You'll find out about the major trade 
associations, which you should call to ask for back newsletters and convention 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Look into on-line computer services, such as CompuServe, America Online, 
Prodigy and Women's Wire. They feature "chatting" areas that are 
industry-specific, and you can pick up insight into key trends, as well as meet 
people who might be helpful when it comes time to look for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've become familiar with industry jargon and issues, attend some 
professional meetings, but beware of going business card-crazy by passing yours 
out to everyone you meet, warns Carol Geffner, director of career services at 
the Claremont Graduate School. It's better to focus on a few people and get 
your questions answered.  
</P>
<P>
 "Your antenna should be up to gather information," she says. "Go with specific 
questions as if you were an outside consultant trying to get a fix on issues in 
the industry."  
</P>
<P>
 When you can start posing sophisticated questions, begin interviewing experts 
in the field. People who are active in professional groups are especially 
inclined to be helpful, but don't aim for those at the senior-most rung yet, 
because you're still testing your wings. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember, you're not a job-seeker, you're still an information seeker, and 
people may hold it against you if you ask whether they have any job openings, 
says Madelon Maupin, general manager of the Los Angeles office of Lee Hecht 
Harrison, a national outplacement company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can suggest meeting for a quick cup of coffee in the morning, but don't 
count on people being able to spare even that much time. You should be prepared 
to ask very focused questions on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, send a letter in advance telling who you are and the information 
you're seeking, says Sharon B. Schuster, editor of the ReCareering Newsletter 
in Northbrook, Ill. Then follow up within a week with a phone call. "You don't 
want to use up credit with possible employers if you don't have it together," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Such information-gathering expeditions can help you refine your goals, as they 
did for Frazelle, the financial planner. She originally thought she wanted to 
be a stockbroker, but after meeting with brokers at several large firms, she 
realized that job wasn't for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they described to me was more 'widget selling' as opposed to 
'consultive-solution selling,' which I'm more comfortable with," says Frazelle, 
who refocused and now works for IDS Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 As you talk to more people, position yourself as someone bringing talents from 
your old career into the new area, says Joyce A. Schwarz, author of "Successful 
ReCareering" and a counselor in Los Angeles who helps professionals through 
career transitions. 
</P>
<P>
 What qualities do you bring from your old position that will make you stand 
out in the new one? Did you develop great writing skills, problem-solving 
skills, a feeling for a certain market that would be greatly valued in this new 
field? You don't want it to seem like you're starting from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not starting over, you're starting better," Schwarz says. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be feasible to move into a new career quickly, so you have to move 
gradually, as Teresa Allen of La Jolla has done in her transition from nurse 
practitioner to magazine writer. Five years ago, she bought a computer and 
learned how to use it. She started reading Writer's Digest and other writing 
magazines and attended seminars at local colleges, where she had a chance to 
grill published writers about their profession. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned I had to write about what I knew first, so I started doing 
technical articles for nursing journals," Allen says. Her goal was to write for 
general-interest publications, so last year she sent clips and query letters to 
major women's magazines. She had just the specialized expertise McCall's 
magazine was looking for in a writer to do an article called "The Nurses' Guide 
to Doctoring Yourself," which appeared in the April issue. 
</P>
<P>
 For Allen, the real motivation was finding something she really loved. "You 
have to ask yourself, 'Am I just tired of this job, so I guess I'll do that 
one?' Or is it something you feel really passionate about? I really wanted to 
be a writer -- and now, after paying my dues, I am."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; MAKING IT WORK; A NEW AGE DAWNS AT THE OFFICE; 
MORE ABOUT SOUL, LESS ABOUT SALARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARIA L. LA GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget the billionaire founder of Wal-Mart and "Sam Walton: Made in America, 
My Story." Don't buy "Iacocca: An Autobiography" unless you can get it for 
under a buck in the bookstore bargain bin. As for "Get Better or Get Beaten" -- 
get real. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeover tales, billionaire bios and how-tos founded on fear are out, replaced 
by management meditations like "Zen and the Art of Making a Living." "Zen" 
bills itself as "a practical guide to creative career design," a "career guide 
for human beings." Says the preface: "It's really a book about love in action, 
about joy, about beauty, about caring." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so your boss doesn't define work as "love in action" and likely would not 
suggest a group visualization exercise to kick off the next staff meeting. 
Still, a quick peek these days at the business section in any bookstore -- or 
the seminar roster at corporations from IBM to AT&T -- will get you more about 
God and less about greed, more about the soul and less about statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Age has hit America's corps of corporate baby boomers, causing hopes to dim 
and hair to dull. Downsizing has replaced growth. For the first time, this 
generation's universe is finite. In an era of lowered expectations and a search 
for a different kind of success, "spirituality" and "business" are no longer 
oxymorons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally people aren't laughing at me," says Carol Orsborn, author of "How 
Would Confucius Ask for a Raise: One Hundred Enlightened Solutions for Tough 
Business Problems." Orsborn reads the I Ching along with the Wall Street 
Journal and is a leading proponent of spirituality in the workplace. "People 
are taking this seriously."  
</P>
<P>
 "This" is the belief that you don't have to put away your heart when you pick 
up your briefcase, that the universe is a caring place that will take care of 
you if you let it, that life is cyclical, that trying harder and working more 
can cause more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though more and more is being written about the need to apply spiritual 
principles in the business environment, we often have little idea of what 
spirituality looks and feels like," Orsborn says in "Confucius," which is her 
often-funny effort to answer that question. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem No. 51 is an odd one for Eastern philosophy: What to do about a very 
Western IRS audit. Nonetheless, Osborne manages an artful I Ching answer that 
runs to three pages. Problem No. 80 gets a much less mystical response. 
Problem: "I've got a full-time job that saps so much of my energy that there's 
nothing left in me to pursue my life's passion: sculpture. What can I do about 
this?" Succinct solution: "Get a part-time job." 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier Orsborn book called "Inner Excellence: Spiritual Principles of 
Life-Driven Business" was turned down by more than a score of publishers in the 
late 1980s. In contrast, "Confucius" was the main selection for the Fortune 
Book Club in June and was one of the Book of the Month Club's best selections 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Inner Excellence" was being ignored, says Patti Breitman, Orsborn's 
agent, "it was the message they were turning down. The message was you don't 
have to put your spiritual self on hold when you go to the office. I don't 
think the world was ready for that then." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be now. A slender fable originally self-published in 1988 and called 
"Zapp! The Lightning of Empowerment" has sold more than a million copies. 
Authors William C. Byham and Jeff Cox hope to re-create the success of their 
tale about the troubles and triumphs of the fictional Normal Company in 
Normalburg, U.S.A, with the more recent "HeroZ: Empower Yourself, Your 
Co-workers, Your Company." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Decanted to its essence, the advice given in most Tao-based business books can 
sound a tad simplistic without the lengthy historical and philosophical 
discourse given by most authors. The books in general are based on 
Eastern-flavored positive thinking, visualization, relaxation, faith and the 
giving up of control over all aspects of one's life. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the necessary faith and optimism are perhaps the biggest stumbling 
blocks for our oh-so-rational world. "If you don't have faith, you end up 
turning the business environment into a war zone," Orsborn says. "Business 
becomes about survival. . . . If you aren't willing to take at least that leap 
of faith (that the universe is benevolent and has an order of its own), you 
have to wonder what's going to get you out of bed tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurdles aside, there is a growing market for this new crop of old ideas 
filtering into the American workplace, says Steven Piersanti, president of 
Berrett-Koehler Publishing, which specializes in books that link soul and 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Work has taken center place in our lives," Piersanti says. "People are 
starting to want more meaning out of it. More than just a paycheck, they want 
fulfillment. . . . So the traditional business literature has been expanding." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Age of Business Literature does more than answer questions like: If a 
tree falls in the forest, would Georgia-Pacific hear it and turn it into a 
cardboard box? 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Lynch, co-author of "Thinking Body, Dancing Mind: TaoSports for 
Extraordinary Performance in Athletics, Business, and Life," likes to tell the 
story of how the Tao Te Ching, an ancient book of Chinese wisdom, helped a 
Silicon Valley middle manager get a Manager of the Year award. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When people would make mistakes or have a failure, say, in writing a proposal 
or making a product, he would reward anyone on the team who would find a 
solution to the problem," Lynch recounts. "He had fantastic response. What it 
does to the people is they're more relaxed when working because they know 
they're not going to get written up. When you're relaxed, you're more 
creative."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; MAKING IT WORK; A NEW AGE DAWNS AT THE OFFICE; A 
SURVIVOR'S GUIDE TO FEEL-GOOD JOBSPEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, you no longer get more authority at work. Someone empowers you. Or 
maybe you empower yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, there is an empower outage at your company. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you run the risk of getting downsized out of a company, probably the 
result of some kind of re-engineering project some hotshot MBA dreamed up. 
</P>
<P>
 While you are trying to figure out if you even have a parachute, let alone 
what color it is, you no doubt should consider trying to re-career. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, you may well be suffering from sanity deficit disorder. Time to 
re-happy yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about the aging of the American work force as a problem. A bigger worry 
is New Age-ing, especially the proliferation of the goofy, feel-good euphemisms 
that clutter up the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when people talked about jobs, careers, promotions and 
getting ahead in terms of paychecks and insurance coverage for root canals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now what people really want is fulfillment and having meaning, or so the 
book-writing consultant and the $1,000-a-day seminar leader would have us 
believe. Who wants another week of vacation when spirituality on the job 
beckons? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's one suggestion: Let's re-euphemize the workplace. Throw out all the 
warm, fuzzy language and theories and get back to basics (yet another modern 
management cliche). Let's make it a level playing field again for the person 
who looks at work as, well, a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, catchy phrases and euphemisms have been dreamed up for years by the 
consultant, itself a frequent euphemism for "unemployed." Anyone still remember 
what a quality circle is, let alone how it works? Or the ABCs of Theory Z? 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s, there was the Organization Man running headlong into the Peter 
Principle. In the '70s, there was the gamesman. In the '80s, we looked high and 
low for synergies while searching for excellence by trying to get close to 
those customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the New Age-ing isn't likely to end anytime soon. The 
billion-dollar-plus management consultant profession that churns out book after 
book won't let it. 
</P>
<P>
 So while we are waiting for some re-sanity on the job, here is a brief 
survival guide if you want to make that job work. What you really need to know 
to survive in today's New Age job -- make that workplace -- market is the new 
jobspeak. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't worry about getting fired anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will ever use the word. The personnel -- make that human resources -- 
profession gave up on the word long ago, probably at the prodding of lawyers 
who think such an impersonal term isn't the kind of thing a jury wants to hear 
when someone sues later. 
</P>
<P>
 Layoff was once the euphemism of choice, but no longer. Arnold Schwarzenegger 
aside, even termination -- wrongful or otherwise -- is out of vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's company, you are more likely to be downsized out of your job. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, the company may rightsize you. These are particularly popular 
terms in the defense industry, where downsizing and rightsizing have increased 
in inverse proportion to the amount of subsidizing by Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you want to impress your boss, re-term the vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 You especially need to come up with a lot of "re" phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell the boss you want to help re-engineer, restructure and revamp your job. 
All it means is that you want to tear up the mess you made in the first place 
and try to put it back together again. 
</P>
<P>
 Too big a mess and your boss will want to re-career you by shipping you off to 
your company's equivalent of Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't make it sound as if you want the boss's job. Make it clear your goal 
is more empowerment on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most important, find a way to use trendy techno-phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 Let everyone know you're heading onto the information superhighway. Let the 
boss know you are in the fast lane -- not stuck at a call box -- and that you 
are willing to info-car-pool with your fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Draft yourself a mission statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid such basic missions as "I want to earn $250,000 a year by age 30 and 
have a lodge in Aspen." 
</P>
<P>
 You want to explore the politics of meaning as it relates to your career. You 
want to make a commitment to excellence. You want fulfillment that comes from 
your high ethical standards because you know that in the long run it's good for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid deal breakers. Look for niches. Seek out strategic partners and 
strategic alliances. Try to be lean, but not too mean. Position yourself and 
your company. Be a people person. And always look for win-win situations.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; MAKING IT WORK; A NONPROFIT JOB CAN PAY OFF 
HANDSOMELY -- IN SATISFACTION 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Cohen grew up in his family's gift-importing business. As a student, he 
worked summers there. As a grown man, he ran the company. So it was with a 
heavy heart that he sold it in 1977, tired of the endless demands and stress of 
being in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know it at the time, but Cohen had just taken a huge step toward 
happiness. He began volunteer work helping the elderly, and it worked its way 
into a paid job. He earns far less than he did running his own business, but he 
is happy to trade that income for the emotional satisfaction of providing 
important mental and physical health services to older people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to follow my heart and it turned into a career," said Cohen, now 
associate director of Senior Health and Peer Counseling in Santa Monica. "There 
are so many more rewards for me than when I had my own business. No. 1 is 
feeling good and proud of what I'm doing. I'm not selling Christmas 
decorations, I'm helping improve the human condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cohen, most people who venture into the nonprofit realm must accept less 
financial compensation than they did in their old jobs in the for-profit world. 
But almost all speak fondly of the emotional payoff: the satisfaction of doing 
something important for others. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, nonprofit agencies can provide a more comfortable work environment. 
Mike Rosell, office manager at AID for AIDS in West Hollywood, said he never 
felt he fit in when he was a financial analyst at Security Pacific Business 
Credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a single gay man, I just didn't fit that corporate image," Rosell said. "I 
could wear a suit and talk the right way, but I didn't think I would move up 
and have a future there. Here, it's much more relaxed. I feel I can be myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosell started out at AID for AIDS earning about half the $32,000 he made 
annually at Security Pacific. Even with a promotion, he still makes somewhat 
more than half that. But for him, the job itself is the payoff. His agency 
provides transportation and financial assistance to AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my old job, I just did the same chores over and over and didn't contribute 
anything to society," he said. "Here we make a huge difference in people's 
lives. That makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit agencies can sometimes provide more flexible work conditions. That 
is what brought attorney Carol Jimenez to the Center for Health Care Rights, a 
Los Angeles agency that provides free counseling and legal representation to 
Medicare beneficiaries and tries to improve the Medicare system through 
class-action litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the agency three years ago, Jimenez had spent six years in 
business litigation with a large private firm. She was dissatisfied and wanted 
a change. But Jimenez, the mother of two small children, wanted more control 
over her hours. Her nonprofit job lets her work four days a week and 
compensates for lower pay rates by being generous about vacation and days off, 
Jimenez said. She also has the important benefit of greater job satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of work I want to do most, changing the law and creating 
systemic reform," she said. "And there just aren't many opportunities to do 
that in the for-profit sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others who have moved from for-profit into nonprofit jobs, Jimenez 
sometimes misses the bountiful resources of her old job. At the firm, she had 
support staff to do all her photocopying, word processing and correspondence. 
Now, she shares one secretary and one receptionist with 14 other people. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle Bassell, resource coordinator for Organization for the Needs of the 
Elderly in Reseda, only recently began getting an hour for lunch. For eight 
years before that, she had to grab a bite in half an hour. Bassell, 72, said 
that in her years co-owning a garment-manufacturing firm, she took home three 
times as much as she does now. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition from the for-profit to the nonprofit world should be undertaken 
carefully, said Rodney Lowman, a Houston psychologist who specializes in career 
and work issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who will be happiest in nonprofit jobs, he said, are those with a strong 
"helping orientation" who are genuinely dedicated to the mission of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 People who gauge their value largely by the amount of their paycheck rather 
than the nature of what they accomplish would be poor candidates for work in 
nonprofits, Lowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miki Jackson, who runs Aunt Bee's Laundry, a Hollywood agency that does 
laundry for AIDS patients and runs a thrift store, said emotional survival in 
nonprofits hinges on valuing yourself for what you do, not what you earn. 
Jackson, 42, works 300 hours a month and takes home about $36,000 a year. As a 
graphics designer, she worked far less and earned $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember you are not doing it for the money," she said. "It's a 
different system of rewards that is foreign to most people in the for-profit 
sector. You can't keep score by how much money you make -- it's how much good 
you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and other nonprofit workers caution those considering a similar move 
that they must be ready for heavier commitments of time and emotions than are 
required by most jobs. Jackson works with people suffering from illness. She 
must work endlessly to raise money to keep her agency afloat. The phone calls 
and meetings invade her nights and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Baker, executive director of the Women's and Children's Crisis Shelter 
in Whittier, said that when grants need renewing, she can work three weeks 
without a day off. It is emotionally draining to see scores of battered women 
and abused children, she said, so she tries to avoid burnout by escaping for 
brief camping trips. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the strains of her job, Baker said, the rewards still win out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get to help people, to ease suffering," Baker said. "And in the end, what 
more important thing is there to do?"

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; ESSAY; WHY READ THIS WHEN YOU COULD BE AT THE 
BEACH? 
</P>

<P>
 Some have the notion that leisure is gaining the upper hand over work in 
America, and that in the 1990s we are correcting the excesses of the 1980s. 
There are even polls saying so. 
</P>
<P>
 This is hard to believe, although a correction would certainly be called for. 
The 1980s, which took place years ago, were really nuts. Nine of every 10 
adults worked 20 hours a day on Wall Street, making money that they squandered 
on poison pills and other drugs. Former janitors in fashionable gardening togs 
planted greenmail in clay pots on their penthouse patios. Secretaries made 
$300,000 and up, which they rolled over into Japan sector funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But they weren't happy, because they were working such long hours. For one 
thing, their laundry never got done. Laundry piled up across New York City and 
eventually was sent by rail to designated sites in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, this couldn't last, because many had to go to prison. When the 
bubble finally burst at decade's end, almost all Americans lost nearly 
everything. At a late-night gathering in the California desert, more than 700 
followers of junk bond king Teapot Milksky gathered to carry out a secret pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in bunny suits for warmth against the chill desert air, they stood in 
a circle as little white cocktail napkins were handed out, inscribed with the 
thought-provoking suicide note left by George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak 
Co., a few years after his 1925 retirement: 
</P>
<P>
 "My work is over, why wait?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then they drank from small cups of Kool-Aid, fell to the ground and appeared 
to go to sleep. But a Milksky aide had inadvertently left the cyanide at his 
mother's, so after a while everybody got up and went back to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 They left the question hanging spookily in their wake, "Have Americans learned 
their lesson about not working so hard?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mankind has been arguing about this from the outset. How hard should we work? 
Is idleness immoral? What's better, work or leisure? What became of all those 
old leisure suits? The people at this newspaper working so hard to put out this 
special report about work, why aren't they at the beach? Isn't that what they 
came out to California for? 
</P>
<P>
 The economists have answers for these questions, but enough said. We should be 
listening to the philosophers. They have been warning us all along to kick 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient Greeks, for example, said the whole point of work is the leisure 
time it buys so we can sit around and tell jokes. Bertrand Russell said in 
1932, "The morality of work is the morality of slaves." 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't been working out, pardon the expression. Sure, Americans have 
increased their standard of living dramatically, but nobody takes advantage of 
it. Their work is joyless, their vacations are manic, and their evenings are 
spent bowling in large groups, sending balls crashing into pins in a deafening 
crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is not hard to trace. It stems from the discovery of guilt in 1633 
by a Pilgrim youngster as he played in a drafty New England cow barn. Guilt, a 
heavy lead globe not much different from a bowling ball, was just what his 
father, Puritan minister John Winthrop, was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Winthrop had won a following with the line "Work is a godly virtue." But at 
the time, a labor shortage had driven wages up so high that church pews were 
priced out of reach. Carpenters and other labourers, as laborers were spelled 
at the time, made so much money that they started taking a lot of time off to 
enjoy it, sitting around telling jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evils which were springing up," Winthrop wrote in his journal, with a 
shudder palpable to this day, "were: 1) many spent much time idly, etc., 
because they could get as much in four days as would keep them a week; 2) they 
spent much in tobacco and strong waters. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Well-read in Greek philosophy though these labourers apparently were, they 
were no match for Winthrop. Holding the guilt aloft in court like a smoking 
gun, he got a charley horse in his right shoulder, but not before persuading a 
judge to place a cap on wages so the labourers would have to work longer for 
the same pay. Failure to do so would cause them to feel guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, the government has been using workers to get it out of trouble. 
Just last month, for example, speaking from a bunker in Wyoming, the government 
admitted it likes to keep people out of work to help control inflation. Yet 
instead of thanks, these jobless inflation soldiers, trudging barefoot down the 
street toward what passes for home, get jeered at as slackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is productivity, also known as "layoffs." If you double your 
efficiency, civilized people would argue, you should be able to go home around 
noon and play with the dog, as the Germans do. Instead, they lay half of you 
off. This is the sharp-stick-in-your-carrot approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Attitudes are changing, according to polls. For example, leisure is now rated 
as more important than work by Americans, 41% to 36%, the opposite of the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But many observers, such as the Germans, believe this sort of wisdom is 
unattainable in a nation capable of the leisure suit. The new poll results 
probably just mean that the baby boomers are pooped.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS; WHERE THE JOBS ARE; POLARIZATION OF JOB MARKET TO 
INTENSIFY, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can go to college or technical training school and make good money working 
as a nurse, a corporate manager or a computer programmer. Or you can struggle 
to finish high school and face the slim paycheck given to a hamburger flipper, 
a gardener or a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, there may not be much in between as the job market moves to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the sobering message from the experts who peer into the cloudy crystal 
ball of employment forecasting, trying to predict the world of work in the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's sharp divisions in America's labor market will accelerate even more in 
coming years, as workers are increasingly channeled into a highly trained and 
well-paid class of professionals and technicians, or a growing army of service 
workers whose tasks are vital but who get low pay and scanty fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great hole in the middle, where there were semi-skilled 
manufacturing workers, and the generalist middle manager also is falling by the 
wayside," said Ted Gibson, principal economist for the California Department of 
Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-paid specialists and technicians will have the ample income, and the 
scarcity of time, to demand more services provided by the lesser-paid workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of 2005, according to federal and state forecasts, will be one in 
which people eat out more frequently (more jobs for cooks and food-preparation 
workers) and drink less (fewer jobs for bartenders); spend less time in bank 
lines (fewer tellers and more ATM machines); have their yards cared for (more 
gardeners) and houses decorated (more painters and paperhangers), and, when 
they fall ill, get more of their care at home (more home care aides and 
licensed practical nurses). 
</P>
<P>
 The best jobs -- full-time, year-round, with health insurance, pensions and 
other benefits -- will be reserved for the highly trained specialists. Even in 
the shrinking manufacturing sector, there will be 230,000 new jobs nationwide 
for specialists -- engineers, scientists and computer systems experts. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Employment Development Department, in its study of the labor 
market for the period 1990 to 2005, predicts the 10 largest growth categories 
will include such service jobs as retail sales clerks, office clerks, 
waiters-waitresses and cashiers, along with the higher-salaried general 
managers-executives and registered nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government also expects a huge surge in service jobs, with a sharp 
demarcation between the well-paid, highly trained workers and low-skilled 
legions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that both California and the nation have shown an 
acceleration in growth at opposite ends of the income distribution," said Tom 
Lieser, an economist with the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are the hottest growth sector. Health care services "will be one of 
the fastest-growing industries in the economy, with employment increasing from 
9.6 million to 13.8 million" by 2005, according to the 1994-95 edition of the 
U.S. Labor Department's "Occupational Outlook Handbook." Improved medical 
technology and a rapidly growing population of elderly Americans will 
accelerate the demand for health services. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail trade will show a healthy 23% expansion in employment throughout the 
nation and a booming growth rate of 33% in California. Restaurants, furniture 
stores and specialty shops are all expected to enjoy strong job gains. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 3 million business service jobs will be added nationally. This sector 
boasts one of the fastest-growing activities: computer and data-processing 
services. Personnel supply services, or temporary help agencies, will keep 
expanding at a rapid rate. And businesses will demand a wide range of 
consulting services, the EDD predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many jobs that used to be inside now are contracted out," said Thomas P. 
Nagle, EDD director. "Businesses buy the services as they need them. The way we 
do business in Corporate America has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The aristocrats of the service industries will be those whose education has 
brought them the best jobs, the Labor Department's handbook promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Continued expansion of the service-producing sector conjures up an image of a 
work force dominated by cashiers, retail sales workers and waiters," the 
handbook says. "Although service-sector growth will generate millions of these 
jobs, it also will create jobs for financial managers, engineers, nurses, 
electrical and electronics technicians, and many other managerial, professional 
and technical workers. . . . The fastest-growing occupations will be those that 
require the most formal training." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about any revival of California's well-paid manufacturing jobs that 
didn't demand much educational background -- this segment of industry has been 
declining for a long time. By 2005, the state will add 3 million jobs, with a 
scant 88,000 going to manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace and defense activity in California will keep shrinking, with further 
losses in the companies involved in aircraft, guided missiles and space 
vehicles, and the electronics components industry will give up jobs too as "the 
manufacturing process becomes more automated and more firms move production 
overseas," says the EDD's official forecast. Government is also shrinking in 
relative share of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, manufacturing and government each accounted for 20% of all jobs in 
California. By 2005, their share will shrink to 14% each. 
</P>
<P>
 Times will continue to be tough for the displaced workers. "It isn't likely 
that people who lose manufacturing jobs will gain new jobs in the upper-pay 
category," said Ronald Kutscher, associate commissioner of labor statistics at 
the Labor Department. "There is a growing wage disparity between those who are 
highly educated and those who are uneducated," said Kathy Masera, publisher of 
the California Job Journal, a weekly publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means living standards could deteriorate for many Americans," she 
warned. Many families already need a second income to maintain the middle-class 
standard of living. If the main breadwinner is laid off from a well-paid 
manufacturing job, the family may never recover, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the world becomes even more insecure, future workers should be forewarned. 
"The focus for young people needs to be on education and an understanding of 
what their incomes will be without it," she said. U.S. Job Growth

THE 46TH ANNUAL EMMY AWARDS; THE SCENE: BACKSTAGE SPIN; BIG WINS FOR 'FENCES' 
LEAVE 'NYPD' BLUE; CBS SHOW GETS SEVERAL KEY AWARDS, INCLUDING BEST DRAMA, BUT 
BEST ACTOR GOES TO FRANZ. 
</P>

<P>
 The small town beat up on the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its record-setting 26 nominations and more controversy and publicity 
than you could shake a nightstick at, ABC's gritty police drama "NYPD Blue" had 
much of its thunder stolen at the 46th annual nighttime Emmy Awards on Sunday 
by "Picket Fences," the quirky drama about the fictional town of Rome, Wis. The 
CBS entry was named best drama series and also won for best supporting actress 
and actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had a chance," "Picket Fences" creator and executive producer 
David E. Kelley told reporters backstage at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. "We 
knew we had good competition. If we were to believe everything we read and 
heard, we would have been sensible to predict 'NYPD Blue.' But the only thing 
we knew going in was that all the episodes had to be screened and looked at, 
and we knew if the panel sat in the room and watched 'NYPD Blue' and 'Picket 
Fences,' we would do well." 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the best drama award, Kelley beat out his former boss, "NYPD Blue" 
co-creator Steven Bochco, who also co-created the acclaimed "L.A. Law," giving 
Kelley his start as a television writer and then turning the show over to him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second year in a row that "Picket Fences" scored a surprise victory 
in the drama series category despite lackluster ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of hoped it would give us a big kick-start last season and our 
ratings would improve," Kelley said. "We would hope that will be compounded 
this year. With two Emmys, we hope people will stay home Friday nights and 
watch us. It's a difficult time slot." 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" still came out the biggest winner of the night with six Emmys, and 
probably the most eagerly applauded award was Dennis Franz winning as best 
actor in a drama series for his coarse police detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the show, Franz walked into the press room clutching his Emmy and 
said, "What a shocker. Big surprise, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Franz's co-star, David Caruso, who is leaving "NYPD Blue" in a controversial 
salary dispute, had been the favorite. "I thought David would win," Franz said. 
"I thought the ball was in his court." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to his show's loss to "Picket Fences," the actor said, "This is a 
bittersweet night. There were so many nominations, and there were certain ones 
we thought were shoo-ins. The show, we thought, was pretty much a lock. We 
expected to win that. But I told ("Picket Fences" co-star) Kathy Baker that, if 
we were going to lose, 'We would rather lose to your show.' It is a 
disappointment, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Franz would not speculate on whether Caruso's decision to leave the series -- 
made shortly before voting on the Emmys took place -- might have had a backlash 
effect with the judges. "That's hard to say," he said. 
</P>

 Franz has been supportive of Caruso with the news media, but he did not thank 
his co-star in his onstage acceptance speech. That was an oversight, he said 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot to thank the entire cast, if you want to know the truth," he 
explained. "I'll show you the (note) card. (Caruso's name) was on the card. I 
sort of skipped over that one, and I feel bad about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Former "L.A. Law" star Jimmy Smits has been cast to replace Caruso after four 
episodes this season. When Ann Biderman stepped backstage after picking up an 
Emmy for writing an episode of "NYPD Blue," she was asked if she was writing 
the script introducing Smits and, if not, whether she could reveal how he will 
be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not, and no, I can't," she responded coyly.

 "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer spoke for the cast and crew of the show, which 
won as best comedy series, in saying he was pleased: "It's flattering. 
Sometimes it feels like it's deserved. You work a lifetime trying to get 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Emmys for him and the show will result in greater expectations 
before the comedy's much-touted move to Tuesday nights, where it is pitted 
against ABC's "Home Improvement," the No. 1 show on TV, Grammer said, "Well, it 
couldn't hurt. I'm sure NBC will take every opportunity it can to plaster the 
news all over. This will keep a lot of people at the network busy. But I think 
we would hold up in whatever time slot we were in." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Casey, one of "Frasier's" executive producers, commented on the move 
when he came backstage to accept his Emmy for outstanding writing in a comedy 
series. "We don't really have a whole lot to say in the matter," he said. "So 
we're just going to go in with the best show we can produce, and do the things 
that have made it a pretty popular series to this point."

 Kirstie Alley, who beat out the favorite, Bette Midler, as best actress in a 
miniseries or movie for her role in the CBS film "David's Mother," had to live 
down some notoriety when she stepped backstage. A reporter asked what her 
husband would say now, referring to the fact that when Alley won an Emmy in 
1991 for her role on "Cheers," she joked about her husband, actor Parker 
Stevenson, giving her "the big one." 
</P>
<P>
 "He will probably say thank you, and to keep my mouth shut," she said with a 
laugh. "He's never been quite the same. He's never been looked at the same, 
I'll tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone hoping for Alley to turn up on "Frasier" -- a "Cheers" spinoff -- as 
Rebecca, the character she played on "Cheers," may be in for a long wait, she 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think at some point you have to pretend like you have another job," said 
Alley, who is getting ready to star in a movie for horror director John 
Carpenter. "Those women on the show are so wonderful -- they really are -- and 
fresh. We're not," she said, referring to the former "Cheers" barflies.

 Aaron Spelling said his award for producing "And the Band Played On" was the 
culmination of 4 1/2 years of difficult work. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why he took on the project when he is known for lighter fare, such 
as "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Melrose Place," he said, "There were too many 
friends that were dying, too many friends who had died of AIDS, having a young 
daughter and son," and to get out the truth that "AIDS is not a homophobic 
disease. That is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "The band is playing on, and Washington hasn't done a damn thing 
about it." 
</P>

 Dennis Miller didn't seem to be in a mood to take any shots at Tribune 
Entertainment or those who canceled his syndicated talk show two years ago. And 
unlike his caustic demeanor on HBO's "Dennis Miller Live," which won for best 
writing for a variety or music program, Miller was relatively subdued.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get into any (stuff) about whether I feel vindicated or not," 
he said backstage, flanked by his fellow writers, who shared the award with 
him. "You do feel screwed for a while. But it's nice to have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that his show will return on HBO this fall, and the big change is "I 
got rid of all my body hair" while it was on hiatus.

 Candice Bergen was genuinely flustered backstage after winning her fourth Emmy 
for best actress in a comedy series for "Murphy Brown." She was listing off all 
the people she didn't thank -- CBS, the producers, her co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually prepare something in case I win, but I was sure it was going to be 
Helen Hunt for 'Mad About You,' " Bergen said. 
</P>

 David Letterman, whose late-night show on CBS was named best comedy, variety 
or music series, had kind words for Madonna, who caused a ruckus on his program 
with her coarse language. They appeared together at the MTV Video Music Awards 
last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She called me on Thursday and asked if I would go with her to the awards," 
Letterman said. "She was very nice and very pleasant about it and, other than 
the other 98.9% of the show, I really enjoyed myself."

 "Manchurian Candidate" director John Frankenheimer had never won an Emmy, 
despite being nominated six years in a row from 1955 to 1960. He revived his 
directing career this year on cable television, and he finally broke through 
for a golden statuette with the HBO prison drama "Against the Wall," about the 
Attica prison uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a great feeling," he said. But he noted that after directing for 40 
years, "It has never gotten easier. It's harder now because I don't want to 
repeat myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenheimer's latest film, "The Burning Season," starring Raul Julia as 
murdered Brazilian activist Chico Mendes, premieres Saturday on HBO.

 Michael Richards, who scored a best supporting actor award for "Seinfeld," 
said he felt strange beating co-star Jason Alexander for the second year in a 
row: "I think he should have one of these. Everyone on the show should have one 
of these." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his silent acceptance speech, he explained, "I was blown. I didn't 
think I would win. The clock was going by so quickly, and there were so many 
people to thank."

THE 46TH ANNUAL EMMY AWARDS; THE LOOK: WHAT THEY WORE; SCATTERSHOT GLAMOUR

 Dressing for the Emmy Awards is no easy feat. For one thing, the Pasadena 
event lands on a seasonal cusp -- not quite fall but no longer summer. And 
there's the gnawing awareness that, hey, it's only the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere between the down-home style of the Rotary Club banquet and the 
glitzy heights of the Oscars lies the right look. The winners of Sunday night's 
best dressed awards left their opera gloves at home and the beauty contest 
hair, well, to beauty contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 In her short black suit, her perfectly cut hair glistening, Emmy winner Leigh 
Taylor-Young made her younger peers look positively vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
 Other exquisite minimalists included Armani-clad Helen Hunt, Marlo Thomas in 
Vera Wang, and Michelle Pfeiffer, sparkling on husband David E. Kelley's arm, 
also in Armani. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, the evening's most striking style moment occurred when the sisters 
from "Sisters" took the stage -- Swoosie Kurtz, Patricia Kalember and Julianne 
Phillips (the good girls), all in white, bad-girl Sela Ward dressed in black. 
(Ward later waltzed off with an Emmy, so we guess nice girls do finish last.) 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of bad girls, Roseanne continued to show the world her, uh, shapely 
legs, this time in an itty-bitty skating dress. Her soft and subtle hair and 
makeup were improvements, though, over the Liz-Taylor-on-a-bad-day look she 
wore for last week's MTV Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other gals who seemed in search of a style, any style. The show's 
co-hosts, Patricia Richardson and Ellen DeGeneres, started off the evening 
dressed like a couple of housewives headed for a rare night on the town. 
Housewives dripping in diamonds, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 Each fared better after a change -- DeGeneres switching to a velvet Anne Klein 
smoking jacket and sneakers, Richardson into a flattering cranberry 
off-the-shoulder gown. This neckline does wonders for the post-40 set. Meredith 
Baxter, for example, looked stunning in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Men, of course, have it so much easier. But whose bright idea was it to ignore 
hundreds of years of perfectly good tradition and wear a black shirt underneath 
his tuxedo? Garry Shandling, Dennis Franz, Tom Skerritt and Tim Allen did the 
black shirt look. But at least they were shirts. "NYPD Blue" hunk David Caruso 
couldn't even bother to button up, slapping on a T-shirt instead. 
</P>
<P>
 And, guys, could we go back to the old black tie? When Jerry Van Dyke shows up 
tieless, you know the look has lost its edge.
