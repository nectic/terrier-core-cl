 GOBBLE GOOD: Maybe you've had it up to your stuffing with Thanksgiving dinner 
tips for today. But Robert E. Merryman is someone to listen to: He's the 
county's environmental health division director, and he warns that where 
there's feasting, there's the chance for food-borne illness. . . . Common 
mistakes, he says: "Improper thawing, inadequate cooking, contaminating foods 
with raw poultry juices, and leaving holiday foods out at room temperature are 
the main concerns. . . . Foods traditionally served at Thanksgiving provide an 
excellent food source for harmful bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
 YOUNG LIONS: If you've chosen today to crowd your way into Disneyland, you 
could be on national TV. CBS will show three hours of Thanksgiving parades, 
including Disneyland's "Lion King Celebration Parade." But don't expect Dick 
Clark. . . . The Disneyland TV hosts are Sheree J. Wilson -- she married Bobby 
Ewing on TV's "Dallas" -- and George Newbern -- he married Steve Martin's 
daughter in the movie "Father of the Bride." 
</P>
<P>
 HOLIDAY TREAT: Actor John Stamos may be the biggest name to come out of John 
F. Kennedy High School in tiny La Palma, but one day Roxanne Taga may upstage 
him. Taga, who is just 19, was the understudy to the lead in Broadway's "Miss 
Saigon." But Wednesday the lead skipped for the holiday and Taga found herself 
center stage in one of Broadway's biggest hits. . . . Her response: "I feel 
prepared. It's what I've been working toward since coming to Broadway." She had 
a little help: Mom and Dad, Roxanna and Ernest Taga, flew in for her opening. 
</P>
<P>
 HE'S NO DUMMY: Art can be painful for the artist, as well as the beholder. 
Antony Gormley, whose work is part of the "Essential Gestures" collection of 
sculptures now on exhibit at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, goes the extra mile 
for his work. Gormley risks suffocation to take impressions of his own body 
while using breathing tubes. . . . But it pays off. Wednesday, he was awarded 
the Turner Prize, Britain's top art honor, for his collection of five dummies 
bent over double against a wall.

 OXNARD HONOR: Oxnard has been named one of 12 cities in the nation that have 
excelled at complying with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. . . . A 
panel appointed by the Justice Department and the U. S. Conference of Mayors 
chose the cities from among 130 across the country. Among the reasons Oxnard 
was singled out: providing disability awareness training to city employees and 
diligent enforcement of disabled parking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 HELPING THE HUNGRY: For the fortunate, getting a bounteous meal today is a 
pleasure to be counted on. . . . But many of the needy among us rely on 
organizations such as Meals on Wheels -- which provides hot meals to Ventura 
County residents -- not only today, but year-round (B1). . . . "Meals on Wheels 
is a gift from heaven for people like us," said Aileene Jenson, 77, who lives 
with her husband in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 SHOP-O-RAMA: Precious holiday shopping time is slipping away. . . . But not to 
worry. There are lots of services available to help harried Ventura County 
residents prepare for the holidays, and there are tips that can save time and 
even money (Ventura County Life, Page 11). . . . Pressures of the season put 
some people in a very un-festive mood. Said Judith Sitko, a therapist in 
Ventura: "What I hear most about holiday stress is the guilt, the feeling of 
obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 WORK IT OFF: You've eaten that heavy-duty meal, you've sat through that 
Thanksgiving movie or football game. . . . Now, it's penance time. Where else 
to work off guilt -- and extra calories -- but at the gym? Celebrities have 
pricey personal trainers to whip them into shape (Calendar, F1), but for the 
rest of us, it's do-it-yourself. For gym owners, this is a boom season. "We've 
had a lot of people coming in anticipating that Thanksgiving indulgence," said 
Jill Hansen, wellness director at the Ventura YMCA. The biggest rush, however, 
is in January, during the frenzy of New Year's resolutions.

JULIAN SYMONS; BRITISH MYSTERY WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prize-winning mystery writer Julian Symons, whose novels include "The Color of 
Murder" and "The Progress of a Crime," has died at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
 His family announced Tuesday that he died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Symons' 26 novels won the Crime Writers Assn. Critics Award and the 
Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Symons was more interested in the tangled psychology of killers, victims and 
investigators than in leading readers through the genre's traditional 
crime-solving puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to 1943 almost all crime writers . . . viewed criminals as objects, as 
wicked ciphers. . . . Things are very different today. The criminal can now be 
the most interesting character of the lot," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1958 to 1959, he chaired the Crime Writers Assn., which he helped found. 
He succeeded mystery writer Agatha Christie as president of the Detection Club 
of writers after her death in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Symons, who had a strong following in the United States, was a visiting 
professor at Amherst College in Massachusetts in 1975-76. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, he stammered as a child and was sent to 
a school for special education. His real education began when he started 
reading books, encouraged by his author-brother, A.J.A. Symons. 
</P>
<P>
 Symons became a Trotskyist and a poet. After World War II army service, he 
became an advertising copywriter and began reviewing books for the Manchester 
Evening News. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he received the Cartier Diamond Dagger Award for his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 He once told an interviewer: "The thing that absorbs me most in our age is the 
violence behind respectable faces." He cited "the judge speaking with passion 
about the need for capital punishment" and "the quiet obedient boy who kills 
for fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife and their son.

producer saw her featured on a poster. The revue was to tour Europe after its 
Paris success but Baker jumped to the Folies Bergere and the company disbanded.

MARK CASADY; AGRONOMIST, BRADLEY AIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Boon Casady, agronomist and former aide to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, 
has died of Valley fever at the age of 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Casady died Friday at the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield, his brother Cort 
Casady said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a pioneer in organic agriculture and helped start Cal-Organic Farms in 
Kern County, the largest commercial organic vegetable grower in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his death, Casady was director of research and development for 
MPX Systems/Cal Foliar Inc. He previously was chief of field consulting for 
Petrik Laboratories and president of Fertility King, a company he founded in 
1979 to promote soil management and crop fertility techniques in the San 
Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Working for Bradley in 1977, Casady directed the Los Angeles Community Gardens 
Program to help residents develop produce gardens in their neighborhoods. In 
its first year, the program yielded more than $3 million in produce for about 
10,000 participants. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of McAllen, Tex., Casady grew up in Phoenix and the San Diego area. 
He attended San Diego State and Howard University in Washington and briefly 
worked as a journalist with his father's newspaper, the El Cajon Valley News. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young man, Casady began working for Democratic politicians. One of his 
duties was to drive John F. Kennedy around San Diego before the 1960 Democratic 
Convention in Los Angeles. Casady later served as field deputy for state Sen. 
Thomas M. Rees and helped him get elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Much in demand as a consultant and lecturer, Casady was asked twice to use his 
knowledge of organic soil nutrients to restore the Hollywood Park turf before 
the Breeders' Cup race. 
</P>
<P>
 Casady is survived by his father, Simon, brothers Derek, Kent, Lance and Cort, 
and his son, Justin Shane Casady.

SCOTT HARRIS: BOB HORN SPEAKS VOLUMES, BUT QUIETLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Got a letter from Bob Horn a few weeks ago. Not a long letter, but it was 
packed with news, opinions and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I appreciate all my correspondence, for even hate mail stokes the glow of 
moral superiority. But Bob Horn's letters are special, and not only because he 
tends to be flattering. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob let me know he was moved by a column about "the blind fellow" -- AIDS 
patient Mario Ceremano. "I was intrigued by his feeling of isolation," Bob 
wrote. Quickly shifting topics, Bob, a retired Cal State Northridge political 
science professor, expounded on a piece concerning the financial woes of the 
CSUN athletic department. He had kind words for Athletic Director Bob Hiegert, 
then added: "By the way, I have long favored dumping football." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Bob commiserated with my close-but-no-cigar lamentations concerning 
the Nippon Ham Fighters, my fantasy baseball team. "I can sympathize . . . 
because my team, the Slugs, on a very different point scale, ended up third, 
one point out of second and two out of first." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of you, especially those who lack a proper appreciation for fantasy 
baseball, may wonder why anyone would find inspiration in these words. But, as 
always, you have to consider the source. 
</P>
<P>
 This being Thanksgiving week, it was high time to drop in on the Horns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His younger brother, Tom, had flown in from Pittsburgh, Pa. His sister, Ethel, 
came down from Juneau, Alaska. The matriarch, Dorothy, was in from Grosse 
Point, Mich. Today, Bob Horn and his wife, Judy, will be hosting 17 family 
members and friends for turkey and fixings. 
</P>
<P>
 I dropped by their Winnetka home on Tuesday. We sat in the living room, with 
Bob, as usual, leaning back in his easy chair, tethered by a plastic tube to 
his ventilator. The mechanical lung sat on an end table, inhaling and exhaling 
with a rhythmic wheeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob, virtually paralyzed, has been "on the vent" for four years. A fast-moving 
form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's 
disease, put him in a wheelchair and weakened him to the point that he was 
quickly losing the ability to talk, swallow or even breathe. His choice was 
death or life on the vent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Horn introduced himself to me last year by, as he would put it, "kicking 
out" a letter in response to a column concerning assisted suicide. Bob still 
has slight movement in his feet, and can write by operating a specially rigged 
computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to a column about Bob's views on assisted suicide. He thinks it 
should be legalized, though it's not for him. A few months later, I checked in 
on the Horns again -- and learned how the family survived the Northridge 
earthquake. Judy and their son, Chris, manually operated an "ambu bag" to keep 
Bob breathing, but a bronchial infection landed him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob was looking good Tuesday, better than I expected. An acquaintance had told 
me that Bob had lost much of the movement in his eyebrows. This was troubling, 
because aside from his computer, Bob "talks" with his eyebrows. The Horns rely 
on a code that employs the alphabet in a grid pattern. "One, two, three," Judy 
will say, and Bob will signal the row. Then Judy recites the letters, waiting 
for another signal. Fortunately, Judy usually needs just a few letters to guess 
at the word. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyebrows aren't as agile, but agile enough. His brown eyes are still 
attentive, darting from person to person. Often, a smile curls his lips. He 
silently shares in the laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy, with Bob's prompting, filled in some of the highlights of the year. His 
old basketball buddy, elementary school teacher Martin Turley, visited often 
and got Bob out of the house more. They rode Metrolink and Metro Rail and 
stopped by the renovated Central Library. Bob, a Soviet scholar, wondered 
whether the library had a copy of his 1982 book, "Soviet-Indian Relations." It 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Father's Day gift, the Horns' three grown children -- Jeff, Chris and 
Laura -- took their dad to a Dodger game. It was a glorious day. The Dodgers 
won and Mike Piazza hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob grinned and spelled out the significance. Piazza, it seems, doesn't just 
play for the Dodgers. He also plays for the Slugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a teacher," said the button on Bob Horn's sweater. He's now busy writing 
his second book, describing his ordeal with ALS. It takes him six hours "at 
best" to write a single-spaced page. The first 40 pages look promising. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob is a religious man, and I was curious about his opinion concerning efforts 
to allow prayer in public schools. He was precise in phrasing his answer. To 
him, "a moment of silence" -- but not prayer -- would be appropriate in the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Only later did the irony strike me. This man has been silent for years. 
</P>
<P>
 But then I realized this wasn't true. Bob Horn isn't silent at all. 
</P>

MEALS ON WHEELS DISHES UP MORE THAN FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA and SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aileene Jenson used to cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghetti and meatballs was one of her specialties, and she used to bake pies 
into the night in the small kitchen of her west Ventura home. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last few years, the 77-year-old Jenson has suffered several 
strokes, a broken hip, cracked ribs and a spinal-cord injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenson and her wheelchair-bound 89-year-old husband still manage to have one 
hot meal a day, though, thanks to a nonprofit organization that feeds hundreds 
of elderly residents in the county daily. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who can afford the $4.25-a-meal charge, the Ventura-based Meals on 
Wheels delivers to clients' homes a freshly cooked repast consisting of a main 
dish, salad, dessert, bread, milk and fruit juice. For those who can't afford 
it, Meals on Wheels finds sponsors or takes whatever the client can pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, a much smaller program feeds 30 to 40 people daily for $3.25 a 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both organizations serve the hungry, they face different financial 
scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Simi Valley program is still accepting clients, the Ventura 
organization has a tight budget and is unable to feed many of the hungry people 
in the west county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are operating on a shoestring," said Vickie Herrera, director of the 
Ventura-based program. "We have turned down at least 30 people in the last few 
weeks because they can't afford to pay and we can't afford to feed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are a 5-foot, 4-inch woman who weighs 65 pounds and a man who has 
been admitted to the hospital three times in the last six weeks for 
malnutrition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are desperate for help. It's an ongoing battle to keep the program going," 
Herrera said. "It breaks my heart when I have to say no to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Meals on Wheels is pieced together entirely through client payments, private 
donations and fund-raisers, officials with both agencies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other organizations that feed people on a temporary basis, Meals on 
Wheels feeds people as long as they are in need. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura-based office, which feeds about 250 to 280 people daily, operates 
with an annual budget of about $168,000 and with 25 volunteers and five 
part-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller Simi Valley office, which is run by a group of senior citizens, 
has an annual budget of about $32,000 and operates with a dozen volunteers and 
one part-time worker. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura office, the food is purchased in bulk from discount warehouses 
and is prepared daily by Jesus Carranza, who has been with Meals on Wheels for 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Carranza begins cooking at 5:30 a.m. Monday through Friday. He follows a menu 
put together by a nutritionist. 
</P>
<P>
 Because several of the people who receive the meals have special diets, 
Carranza cannot use salt, pepper, oil and hot spices. 
</P>
<P>
 "To add flavor and make the food more interesting, I use a lot of herbs," 
Carranza said. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 a.m., Carranza, with the help of volunteers, packs the food and has it 
ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when volunteer drivers such as John Collins, a retired Ventura 
resident, take over. 
</P>
<P>
 After loading 50 meals into his 1980 Volkswagen truck, Collins starts his 
Oxnard route. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a worthwhile project because if weren't for this one meal a day, 
most of those people would not eat," said Collins, who has been volunteering 
for the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other drivers, Collins does more than drop off the bags of food at 
clients' front doors. 
</P>
<P>
 If no one answers his knock, Collins checks on the welfare of the recipient, 
first by talking with neighbors and then by notifying his supervisors, who in 
turn contact relatives or hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients are grateful for more than the food. Knowing that a driver will be 
visiting five days a week -- the two weekend meals are delivered on Friday -- 
gives clients a sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meals on Wheels is a gift from heaven for people like us," said Jenson, who 
lives with her husband and whose only relative lives in Georgia. "It's good to 
know that there is someone out there who truly cares and looks out for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jensons, like many elderly people in the county, live on an $800-a-month 
Social Security check and most of that is spent on housing, medication and 
utilities. Little is left for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what we would do if it weren't for them," said Jenson, who has 
depended on the organization for the last 17 years. "We have had a very hard 
time, and when we did not have sponsors, we used to share one meal between the 
two of us. But when they found out that, they began to give us two meals a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of Meals on Wheels' clients are long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for them, I don't know how I would be able to get back on my 
feet," said 63-year old Betty Ivey, who has been in and out of the hospital for 
the last nine months. "I feel much better when I eat well, and soon I hope to 
be able to cook my own meals." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivey, a former volunteer with Meals on Wheels, said she paid for the meals for 
two months, but then she had to cancel because she could no longer afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew that I still needed the food but couldn't pay for it, so they 
continued bringing it every day," Ivey said. "I'm forever grateful, and I hope 
to get well soon so I can cook myself." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, volunteers at the city's Senior Center deliver 10,000 meals a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, cook Bernie Cangelosi whipped up the day's hearty repast: 
Salisbury steak with gravy, noodles and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers quickly scooped the food into aluminum trays, sealed them tight and 
slipped them into an insulated carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Then driver Dennis Cummings sprang into action, loading his truck with the 
carrier and a box of fruit, milk and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings, 67, said he looks forward to seeing the clients he serves twice a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pleasure, really, to be able to do it," he said. "The people we serve 
are really good folks." 
</P>
<P>
 The recipients of Meals on Wheels seem equally fond of Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of his first stops, Connie Santoro greeted Cummings with a big smile. 
"I look forward to seeing him," she said. "I know I have a visitor every day." 
Still recovering from hip surgery, Santoro signed up for the program six months 
ago at her daughter's urging. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter worries about me. She wants to make sure I'm getting a good 
meal," Santoro said. "For me, it's a meal delivered to my door. What more could 
I ask?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the next stop, Alameda Plenger gives Cummings a hug and a handful of candy. 
"Take your vitamins," she said playfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenger, one of the program's longstanding clients, depends on Meals on Wheels 
as her main food supply. "I've been in this program for a long time, 10 years 
or more," she said. "I can stretch a meal to both lunch and dinner. I don't eat 
as much as I used to."

GOBBLED UP; 50,000 BIRDS LATER, TURKEY FARMER FINALLY CAN TAKE A REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take a long look around Gary Lee's turkey ranch and you may wonder if 
something is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's none of the gobbling or warbling you might expect to hear on a ranch 
that raises 50,000 birds at a time. Inhale deeply and you won't smell even a 
hint of the manure that normally blankets the range where turkeys feed and 
roam. 
</P>
<P>
 Peek into Lee's refrigerator and you won't even see a Butterball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before Thanksgiving, the one thing you can't find at Ventura 
County's only turkey ranch is a turkey. And that's just the way Gary Lee likes 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in months I have a minute to catch my breath," said the 
42-year-old rancher. "And besides, if I had turkeys on my ranch right now, you 
wouldn't be having Thanksgiving."  
</P>
<P>
 Lee just finished shipping 1 million pounds of turkey to be processed in 
Fresno, leaving just enough time to ensure 50,000 Thanksgiving diners will have 
a fresh bird on their table. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as winter sets in and snow begins to dust the rural stretch of county 
land northeast of Pine Mountain, the only reminder of the toms and hens that 
filled Lee's pens are the white feathers that collect in corners and catch on 
wire fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next five months, he will clean and service the intricate machinery 
that shovels food to the tiny poults so they can balloon to as much as 35 
pounds in about 15 weeks. By April, the ranch will be ready for a new crop of 
50,000 baby turkeys, carried from Fresno in temperature-controlled trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking his land in blue overalls and a brown denim jacket, the easygoing 
rancher reflected on the cutthroat business he once swore he would avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time I wanted to do anything but raise turkeys," said Lee, who 
spent several years in the Coast Guard. "But then I found out it is not so bad 
to work for yourself. There's a lot involved in farming. You've got to be a 
Jack-of-all-trades." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is involved in every aspect of his ranch operation, from growing feed to 
fixing the flats on the aging trucks that haul wood chips and manure out onto 
the range. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard labor, he said, has been the key ingredient in his effort to keep the 
ranch running. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is still in business, which is enough to prove he has bucked the odds in 
an industry that recently came close to ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, one of four major turkey producers, Louis Rich Co., shut down 
its California operations, according to John Voris, an industry expert who 
works for the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they left, the turkey industry went into a tailspin," Voris said. 
"Dozens of growers went under, and their empty facilities became worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 For years California had run neck and neck with the nation's leading turkey 
states, producing 32 million birds in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But between 1992 and 1993, the number of turkeys grown here plummeted to 21 
million, Voris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our production fell behind North Carolina, Minnesota, even Arkansas, of all 
places," Voris said. "The drop, combined with high taxes and high labor costs, 
made things look pretty desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee watched anxiously as the handful of Ventura County growers began to 
falter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those last few years were tough," Lee said. "I was lucky because I had a 
contract (with a major national turkey producer). Others were not so lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the economic climate, Lee has had to worry about the 
unpredictable weather that changes daily in the county's backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
 If the weather is too hot, the birds do not breed. And if it's too cold, the 
birds begin to huddle together to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be fine, except they begin to pile up on one another and the guys 
on the bottom don't usually fare too well," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather can also cause the turkeys to get sick, and certain illnesses cannot 
be treated because of the strict federal bans on the use of most medications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can really ruin your day to come out and see a group that's sick," Lee 
said. "You can tell right away because they look droopy, and they all start to 
snit -- which is a sort of noise turkeys make when they sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear 25,000 birds making that noise, you know you've got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee never grows close enough to the birds to sympathize with their 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, turkeys are not easy to grow attached to," he says, as a smile 
curls under his mustache. "They're not cuddly little animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while they may not be likable animals, Lee said he does appreciate what 
they have done for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret getting into turkeys," he said. "It may not be the typical way 
of life, but it's treated me just fine."

THORNTON'S SUICIDE NOTE READ AT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five weeks before allegedly killing Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, Mark 
Scott Thornton wrote a suicide letter in which he said he would be "better off 
dead" because everyone in his life -- everyone he loved -- had given up on him. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotionally powerful letter, read Wednesday to the Superior Court jury 
hearing Thornton's murder trial, provides the first extensive glimpse into 
Thornton's state of mind in the weeks leading up to the nurse's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't handle this place we call Earth or California. It's hell here, so all 
I have to say is goodbuy everyone and may god BE with you," the defendant, then 
19, wrote in the letter of Aug. 12, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I'm going to go to where I don't need anything: Six feet under the ground 
to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of taking his own life, prosecutors say that Thornton kidnaped and 
killed O'Sullivan on Sept. 14. The slaying occurred at a remote spot in the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say he stole the nurse's small black truck, using the vehicle to 
abduct Stephanie Campbell, his 16-year-old estranged girlfriend who had refused 
to date him any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 When apprehended five days later in Reno, Thornton still had O'Sullivan's 
truck, as well as the murder weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses in his trial, which wrapped up its fourth week of testimony 
Wednesday, have alluded to Thornton's suicidal state of mind. Two of his former 
girlfriends, including Campbell, have testified that suicide was a frequent 
topic for Thornton during their relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thornton's lawyers have also said their client initially tried to provoke 
police officers in Reno into shooting him. The officers testified that Thornton 
had a gun in his hand when he was arrested and at first refused to drop it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reading of the letter -- entitled "My Last Words" -- marked the first 
time the jury had heard about Thornton's suicidal tendencies in the defendant's 
own words. The letter was read by Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Noel Brown, who 
testified that he found the letter inside a backpack in a room Thornton had 
rented from a Thousand Oaks couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do this because I have no one. Everyone has left me to die. And that 
is what's going to happen in the next couple of days," the letter states. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm about to lose my one and only person I really care for. And that is 
Stephanie Cambell. I have no more money to do anything IN my life or enof 
confidence IN myself to go on with my life. So I am going to go WERE I don't 
need anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my family and especialy my sister Chantal Sarrazin. . . . Don't 
(worry) about me. I'm better off dead," the letter continues. "I am going to 
sleep now to rest forever. Love Mark Scott Sarrazin." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarrazin is Thornton's mother's married name. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks before he wrote the letter, Thornton had been kicked out of his mother's 
home.

YOLO OFFICIAL CANDIDATE FOR CITY MANAGER; VENTURA: DONNA LANDEROS IS CONSIDERED 
BY SOME TO BE THE TOP CONTENDER. THE ADMINISTRATOR'S COLLEAGUES PRAISE HER 
PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leading candidate for the job of Ventura city manager is a Santa Paula 
native who manages an agricultural county near Sacramento, City Hall sources 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If selected for the job, Donna Landeros, 46, would be the first permanent 
woman city manager in Ventura County history. The City Council is scheduled to 
resume hiring discussions when it meets in closed session on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors in Yolo County, where Landeros is chief administrator, praise her 
as one of the best administrators they have ever encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tremendous amount of faith in her," said Mike McGowan, chairman of 
the Yolo County Board of Supervisors. "She'll be very difficult to replace." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's top-notch," said Yolo County Supervisor George DeMars. "She's strictly 
professional in everything she does." 
</P>
<P>
 In Yolo County, Landeros makes $86,292 a year, plus $8,950 in benefits, 
according to county records there. Ventura's former city manager, John Baker, 
who left the city in July to start his own consulting business, made $108,120 a 
year plus $23,957 in benefits at the time of his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, city officials announced that Ventura Police Chief Richard 
Thomas will serve as interim city manager beginning Dec. 1, while the city 
waits for Landeros or another candidate to fill the job on a permanent basis. 
Thomas will replace another interim city manager of the same name -- Richard 
Thomas, the retired top administrator of Santa Barbara -- whose contract ends 
on Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The current interim city manager started his position on July 1, when 
then-manager Baker resigned.  
</P>
<P>
 Landeros declined to be interviewed, but through her secretary said that she 
grew up in Santa Paula, leaving after her high school graduation in 1966. Her 
parents, Bill and Eleanor Crouch, still live in town. Eleanor Crouch served as 
mayor of Santa Paula from 1977 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Also through her secretary, Landeros said her husband is a migrant education 
teacher, and the couple has a 13-year-old son who is in the eighth grade. Yolo 
County Supervisor Helen Thomas, who said she is a personal friend of Landeros, 
said Landeros attended UCLA and worked after college for Los Angeles' parks and 
recreation department. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros moved to Yolo County five years ago, in the midst of one of the worst 
budget crises the county had ever faced, county officials there said. Yolo 
County has 150,000 residents and a strong agricultural base, in addition to 
businesses in the oil and food processing industries, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Davis and the city of Davis, with a population of about 50,000, are located 
in Yolo County, as are three smaller cities -- West Sacramento, with 30,000 
people; Winters, with fewer than 5,000 people, and Woodland, the county seat, 
with a population of 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolo County is one of the state's original counties, with a history that dates 
back more than 140 years. With funds in extremely short supply in recent years, 
Yolo County's supervisors have made drastic budget cuts, including shutting 
down the county's only public hospital and consolidating all the county's 
courts in Woodland. The county now saves money by paying local private 
hospitals, clinics and doctors to provide medical care to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors said Landeros' negotiating and leadership skills were key to 
making the budget-cutting go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The county hospital) was an albatross," DeMars said. "It was her decision 
that it had to go. It was her plans and negotiations that made it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 One example of Landeros' talents that her bosses mentioned repeatedly was her 
ability to broker a deal between the county's long-feuding environmentalists 
and gravel miners. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 15 years, McGowan said, environmental advocates have butted heads 
with the miners, insisting that they cease taking gravel out of local riverbeds 
because it endangered the area's plants and wildlife. But gravel mining is a 
big industry in Yolo County, and the miners say the community cannot afford to 
lose the jobs its industry creates, McGowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 About six months ago, the supervisors decided they were at the end of their 
patience with the quarrel, he said. So they asked Landeros to take a stab at 
settling it. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros brought both sides together together in a room and made them talk to 
each other, he said. Today, the two factions are working out the final details 
of an agreement that the supervisors say has won approval from all but the most 
extreme environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other people who contributed to the success of the process," 
McGowan said, "But it was Donna who really made it happen by her personal 
intervention." 
</P>
<P>
 Landeros has been the only woman on a list of seven candidates the council has 
considered for the job. Ventura's search for a new city manager has lasted for 
months and council members have said their closed-session bickering over the 
decision has reached a new level of animosity. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say the search should end soon. Councilman James Monahan said he 
hopes to have a new, permanent city manager on board by mid-January. Thomas, 
the police chief and soon-to-be interim manager, said he was told he will be 
able to return to law enforcement within about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 If his replacement is Donna Landeros, the city will be extremely fortunate, 
said Penny Bohannon, Ventura County's lobbyist and legislative analyst, who has 
known Landeros professionally for a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her advice to the council, Bohannon said, is "don't let her get away." 
</P>
<P>
 "She deals very well with people, is tremendously hard-working and dedicated," 
Bohannon said. "She's very direct and she doesn't mince words. She would be a 
tremendous asset in any city."

PARENTS BACK BUT SAY SON STILL MISSING; CRIME: THE YOUTH IS SOUGHT OVER A 
RACIAL BRAWL IN THOUSAND OAKS. THE COUPLE HAD ALSO MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED 
BEFORE HIS HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Lees are back in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Not their son James, who jumped bail before an April preliminary hearing on 
his role in an after-school racial brawl in Thousand Oaks. But his parents, who 
also mysteriously disappeared just before the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview in the driveway of their million-dollar North Ranch 
compound, the Lees said they have no idea where their 16-year-old son is. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still looking for him," said Hsin-E Lee, James' father. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said his son Frank is also missing, and he said he was "not sure" whether 
the two boys were in the United States. Both sons were involved in the February 
fight that left two Westlake High School students hospitalized with gunshot 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a warrant out for their arrests, and Crimestoppers has offered $1,000 
in reward money for tips leading to James Lee's arrest. He was charged as an 
adult with assault with a deadly weapon and assault with force likely to 
produce great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said he had received no letters from his sons, but refused to say whether 
he had received telephone calls from them. Lee would not say where he and his 
wife had been, or when they returned to the home they had left vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors speculated that the family had fled to their native Taiwan so that 
James would avoid prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee would not discuss the causes of the February fight that led to James' 
arrest. "There's different stories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and witnesses said a one-on-one fistfight was expected between James 
Lee and a football player, who was his rival. Instead, police said, five 
carloads of youths arrived at the park and emerged wielding baseball bats, guns 
and 2x4s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the Asian Mafia," they reportedly announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said he had no plans to sell the house on Oak Grove Place in Thousand 
Oaks, which was purchased for $1.1 million in 1989. But he and his wife have 
been keeping a low profile since their return. 
</P>
<P>
 They have not been seen at church, said Curtis Lowe, pastor of the Chinese 
Christian Church of Thousand Oaks. And they have not contacted their son's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer, Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., said he had a message for his client: "He 
should turn himself in." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they can do nothing to the Lees other than ask them where 
their son is. "They don't even have to talk to us if they don't want to," said 
John Vanarelli, the deputy district attorney handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, prosecutors announced Wednesday that charges were being refiled 
against another youth, Oubansack (Andy) Sonethanouphet, who is accused of using 
a gun in the shooting. Lee is charged only with having used a bat or a board. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 9, a Superior Court judge dismissed charges against Sonethanouphet, 
ruling that police had illegally obtained a confession from him. But 
prosecutors say they still believe they can convict Sonethanouphet in Juvenile 
Court. He had been charged as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial dates have also been set for the two remaining defendants, who will also 
be tried as adults. John Yi, a Thousand Oaks teen-ager charged with four felony 
counts for allegedly firing a gun during the melee, is scheduled to go to trial 
Dec. 5. William Huang, a Rowland Heights youth charged with aiding and abetting 
Sonethanouphet, has a January trial date.

LIMITED USE PROJECTED FOR POINT MUGU AIRPORT; TRANSPORTATION: ESTIMATES OF 
COMMERCIAL PASSENGERS FOR CONVERTED FACILITY ARE MUCH LOWER IN NEW REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new consultant's report on a proposal to convert the airfield at the Point 
Mugu Navy base to joint civilian and military use indicates that the number of 
passengers who might use the facility is only a fraction of original estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study summarized Wednesday for the Point Mugu Airfield Joint Use 
Investigative Committee estimates that only 500,000 to 1.5 million commercial 
passengers a year would use the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares to another consultant's estimate of 2.5 million passengers 
annually by the year 2010. The new study cites an uncertain economy and 
competition from regional airports for the lower estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint use committee signed off on the higher passenger estimate a month 
ago in declaring that joint use of the Point Mugu field was feasible. Committee 
members now say they expect aviation specialists from a regional planning 
agency to analyze the dramatically different figures at a meeting Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Merwin, chief aviation analyst for the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, briefed the committee on the new study, but said he is not yet 
sure which of the estimates is right. SCAG is directing the airport studies and 
contracted for both passenger reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one possible scenario," Merwin said of the new report. "Frankly, we 
just got it and we want to study it more. We want to see how the conclusions 
were reached." 
</P>
<P>
 Merwin also said the new consultant thinks that jetliner service on medium and 
long-haul routes from the Point Mugu airport would not make sense for many 
years -- until shorter routes are well established. The first consultant was 
much more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 While Merwin said he wanted to study the report more fully, he said he 
endorses many of its conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experts I have talked with have really urged us to back away from 
building a full-sized facility," Merwin said. "They recommended that we start 
small and avoid entangling the airport in debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Turbo-prop commuter air service is currently available at Oxnard Airport 
through the United and American airline subsidiaries. Merwin said it is not 
clear how or if those operations would be integrated into the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to move the joint-use proposal forward, the committee on Wednesday 
directed SCAG to find $10,000 to speed up federal regulatory approval of a 
high-tech satellite navigation system that would allow jetliners at Point Mugu 
to take off and land over the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The ocean patterns would keep jets from flying over Camarillo, where 
opposition to the airport is strongest because of the fear of noise and 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Merwin said that approval of new aircraft navigation systems usually takes 
many years, but that this high-tech system is moving toward acceptance much 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most new instrument approach systems take five to eight years to get 
approval," he said. "(This system) could be approved for use in about two 
years."

NURSE AIDE CONVICTED OF MOLESTING 3 PATIENTS; COURTS: THE ACCUSED MAN ACTED AS 
HIS OWN LAWYER ON CHARGES INVOLVING WOMEN WHO WERE BEING TREATED AT SIMI VALLEY 
HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nurse's aide who acted as his own lawyer was convicted Wednesday of sexually 
molesting three female patients at Simi Valley Hospital on his first day at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor E. Sumner stood with his hands in his pockets and showed no emotion as 
he was found guilty of sexually battering two elderly patients and penetrating 
a mentally retarded woman with his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner must be sent to prison when he is sentenced Dec. 16, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Patrice D. Koenig said. The maximum possible sentence is 10 years, the minimum 
is three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig said the trial was extremely difficult for the victims because they 
were cross-examined by the 47-year-old defendant, who exercised his legal right 
to represent himself. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the women, a 32-year-old with the mental capacity of an 8- to 
10-year-old, had a stress-induced seizure the day after she testified but has 
since recovered, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an extremely traumatic experience for them," Koenig said. "Coming to 
court they were all basically terrified, but they all ended up doing very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the women's frail health, the trial was moved to Simi Valley for 
two days while they testified. One of the victims had to be wheeled into court 
on a hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the assaults occurred July 9, on Sumner's first day as a temporary 
hospital employee. Koenig said Sumner was assigned to care for nine patients 
and molested two of them: a 72-year-old woman with a fractured hip and a 73- 
year-old woman who was seriously ill following heart bypass surgery months 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner was also found in the mentally disabled patient's hospital room twice 
and was sent away because the woman's family had specifically requested that 
she not be cared for by men, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 At trial Sumner argued that the victims misinterpreted his actions as he 
attempted to care for their medical needs, and that the women were confused 
because they were on medication. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated a full day before returning with the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell had jurors raise their hands in 
unison to show their agreement with the verdicts. But when the judge asked 
Sumner if he wanted jurors polled individually, the defendant replied, 
"Definitely not." 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig, who had a private session with jurors after the verdict, said they 
were curious to know why Sumner acted as his own attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them only he knows why he did it," the prosecutor said.

SCOTT HARRIS: CATCHING UP WITH AN OLD FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Got a letter from Bob Horn a few weeks ago. Not a long letter, but it was 
packed with news, opinions and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I appreciate all my correspondence, for even hate mail stokes the glow of 
moral superiority. But Bob Horn's letters are special, and not only because he 
tends to be flattering. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob let me know he was moved by a column about "the blind fellow" -- AIDS 
patient Mario Ceremano. "I was intrigued by his feeling of isolation," Bob 
wrote. Quickly shifting topics, Bob, a retired political science professor at 
Cal State Northridge, expounded on a piece concerning the financial woes of the 
CSUN athletic department. He had kind words for athletic director Bob Hiegert, 
then added: "By the way, I have long favored dumping football." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Bob commiserated on my close-but-no-cigar lamentations concerning the 
Nippon Ham Fighters, my fantasy baseball team. "I can sympathize . . . because 
my team, the Slugs, on a very different point scale, ended up third, one point 
out of second and two out of first." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of you, especially those who lack a proper appreciation for fantasy 
baseball, may wonder why anyone would find inspiration in these words. But, as 
always, you have to consider the source. 
</P>
<P>
 This being Thanksgiving week, it was high time to drop in on the Horns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His younger brother, Tom, had flown in from Pittsburgh. His little sister, 
Ethel, came down from Juneau. The matriarch, Dorothy, was in from Grosse Point, 
Mich. Today, Bob Horn and his wife, Judy, will be hosting 17 family members and 
friends for turkey and fixings. I dropped by their Winnetka home on Tuesday. We 
sat in the living room, with Bob, as usual, leaning back in his easy chair, 
tethered by a plastic tube to his "ventilator." The mechanical lung sat on an 
end table, inhaling and exhaling with a rhythmic wheeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob, virtually paralyzed, has been "on the vent" for four years. A fast-moving 
form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's 
disease, placed him in a wheelchair and weakened him to the point that he was 
quickly losing the power to talk, swallow or even breathe. His choice was death 
or life on the vent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Horn introduced himself to me last year by, as he would put it, "kicking 
out" a letter in response to a column concerning assisted suicide. Bob still 
has slight movement in his feet, and can write by operating a specially rigged 
computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to a column about Bob's views on assisted suicide. He thinks it 
should be legalized, though it's not for him. A few months later, I checked in 
on the Horns again -- and learned how the family survived the Jan. 17 
earthquake. Judy and their son Chris manually operated an "ambu bag" to keep 
Bob breathing, but a bronchial infection landed him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob was looking good Tuesday, better than I expected. An acquaintance had told 
me that Bob had lost much of the movement in his eyebrows. This was troubling, 
because aside from his computer, Bob "talks" with his eyebrows. The Horns rely 
on a code that employs the alphabet in a grid pattern. "One, two, three," Judy 
will say, and Bob will signal the row. Then Judy recites the letters, waiting 
for another signal. Fortunately, Judy usually needs just a few letters to guess 
at the word. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyebrows aren't as agile, but agile enough. His brown eyes are still 
attentive, darting from person to person. Often, a smile curls his lips. He 
silently shares in the laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy, with Bob's prompting, filled in some of the highlights of the year. His 
old basketball buddy, elementary schoolteacher Martin Turley, visited often and 
got Bob out of the house more. They rode Metrolink and Metro Rail and stopped 
by the renovated Central Library. Bob, a Soviet scholar, wondered whether the 
library had a copy of his 1982 book, "Soviet-Indian Relations." It did. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Father's Day gift, the Horns' three grown children -- Jeff, Chris and 
Laura -- took their dad to a Dodger game. It was a glorious day. The Dodgers 
won and Mike Piazza hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob grinned and spelled out the significance. Piazza, it seems, doesn't just 
play for the Dodgers. He also plays for the Slugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a teacher," said the button on Bob Horn's sweater. He's busy writing his 
second book, describing his ordeal with ALS. It takes him six hours "at best" 
to write a single-spaced page of copy. The first 40 pages look promising. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob is a religious man, and I was curious about his opinion concerning efforts 
to restore prayer in public schools. He was precise in phrasing his answer. To 
him, "a moment of silence" -- but not prayer -- would be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Only later did the irony strike me. This man has been silent for years. But 
then I realized this wasn't true. Bob Horn isn't silent at all.

VIEWS ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an illegal immigrant from Mexico for eight years, I was asking myself, do 
we really get any credit at all? 
</P>
<P>
 As an illegal I pay taxes, pay a mortgage, car loan, and work every day. 
</P>
<P>
 I was thinking, what if all of us in the state stopped working for three days? 
Will this be an impact on the economy? How will politicians fix it? Will this 
show any reality for people who do not want to see it? Imagine nannies, 
housekeepers, drivers, field workers, waitresses and laborers all over the 
state stopping at once. Will you see a difference? Will you pay $3 for a head 
of lettuce? Will you eat an $8 hamburger, spend $20 for a car wash and so on? 
Will your income stretch that far? See reality.

to become a citizen, I had to learn English and pass the Constitution test. The 
effort and hard work that I put in have been very rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 I am neutral about Prop. 187 but I have two suggestions that might make a 
difference. First, I suggest that everybody who is illegal here now be granted 
amnesty and given the opportunity to become citizens within a certain period of 
time. Second, any illegal immigrants who are here now that do not take 
advantage of this amnesty time frame would not be eligible for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 This country is made up of immigrants, and I think these suggestions would be 
fair for all.

 * As a manufacturing supervisor overseeing hundreds of immigrant workers, I am 
shocked at those who support Prop. 187. The proposition is a countermeasure to 
attack illegal immigrants already within the state that have bypassed our 
system and supposedly waste tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies have prospered in Southern California due to hard-working, legal and 
illegal citizens. An immigrant's No. 1 expectation is to lead a hard-working 
life, not state-funded public health or welfare benefits. Prop. 187 is trying 
to solve too many issues with one magic pill. The state must focus its limited 
resources on issues such as our inadequate border control system. Prop. 187 is 
missing the issue and is just another quick-fix scheme that will not work.

CREWS BATTLE FIRE NEAR PIRU SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County firefighters responded late Wednesday to a brush fire near Piru 
Elementary School. No structures were immediately threatened, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several fire engines, a tanker truck, and hand crews were called in as the 10 
p.m. fire spread quickly over 20 acres of hillside about one-quarter mile from 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a full brush response," said Charles Carranza, spokesman for the Ventura 
County Fire Department. He said 8 to 10 m.p.h. winds were fanning the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the fire was headed toward the Piru Mansion, but was no immediate 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby resident said sprinklers were turned on at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole area is burning," said Jon Hur, referring to the blaze that he 
could see from his Center Street home.

AS NATO BOMBS FALL, WESTERN DISARRAY WORSENS; A FEW AIR STRIKES ARE NO SOLUTION 
TO THE BALKANS WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nato warplanes on Wednesday bombed Serb missile sites in northwest Herzegovina 
and neighboring Croatia. The NATO action, the third air raid in three days, 
came as a coordinated assault by Bosnian and Croatian Serbs threatened the 
destruction of Bihac, a Muslim town in a U.N.-declared "safe area" in northwest 
Bosnia. The attack was not described as a measure taken in defense of Bihac, 
however, only as a retaliation for Serb missile attacks on British 
reconnaissance planes. This was for a clear if regrettable political reason: 
NATO does not attack except by request of the United Nations, and the world 
body fears that taking sides would provoke Serb attacks on UNPROFOR, the U.N. 
peacekeeping force. The British and French, having contributed the largest 
troop contingents to UNPROFOR (the United States has contributed no troops), 
counsel restraint both in U.N. and NATO deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the restraint, unfortunately, has been neither to rescue Bihac 
nor to moderate the aggression of the Bosnian Serbs. Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic has announced that his response to the NATO raids will be 
"all-out war" and revenge against UNPROFOR. On Wednesday, the Bosnian Serbs 
ordered U.N. officers at nine weapons-collection sites in Bosnia confined to 
quarters, presumably to permit the Serbs to reclaim the heavy weapons 
previously surrendered under threat of NATO air attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Bosnian mission chief, Yasushi Akashi, claimed Wednesday to have the 
support of Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic and Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic for a peace agreement of undisclosed terms, but Milosevic's armed 
forces are not participating in the assault, and Martic's forces could easily 
withdraw across the Croatian border and allow Karadzic's Bosnian Serbs to 
finish the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, NATO has managed only to make a bad situation worse and seems, 
dismayingly, to have demonstrated once again its virtual irrelevance in the 
Balkans war. Unlike the United Nations, NATO clearly does have the wherewithal 
to intervene decisively, but the political will to take military action is 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 No less important, however, than the impending slaughter in Bihac is the far 
less noticed horror being perpetrated in parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina where no 
shooting war is under way. Speaking to the House of Commons, British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd, clearly referring to the outbreak of fighting around 
Bihac, said last week, "This setback followed a period during which some signs 
of normal life returned to Bosnia." But just a week earlier Human Rights Watch 
had published a well-documented study charging that "the most savage and 
institutionalized 'ethnic cleansing' today in northern Bosnia is taking place 
in areas where there is no fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 The report detailed frequent murders and beatings of non-Serbs. "Ethnic 
cleansing" means that women are terror-raped, men (sometimes women too) are 
enslaved, Serb soldiers and police are subject to no civilian restraint and 
even the Serb Red Cross engages in extortion. It is because this is the 
effective meaning of what Hurd referred to as "a lull in the fighting" that the 
fighting will inevitably recur. For the Bosnian Muslims, death is the 
consequence of peace no less than of war. The only question is whether the 
European powers will continue to ensure that the balance of power remains 
tipped toward the Serb side even as, in a strange charade, they engage in 
symbolic air strikes against the side they favor. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. proposals for military escalation now being made to the United Nations by 
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and to NATO by other U.S. officials are 
likely to be rejected, even as Republicans in Congress call for unilateral U.S. 
action without facing the practical impossibility of U.S. action in Europe 
without European support. The disarray worsens daily, and, tragically, what is 
at stake is the survival not just of Bosnia but of NATO itself.

BREEZE OF BIPARTISANISM; DOLE AGREES TO HELP ADMINISTRATION PASS VITALLY NEEDED 
WORLD TRADE ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole has committed to helping to pass 
the free trade pact "in any way I can," bipartisan support to liberalize trade 
ought to grow and result in Senate approval of a new world trade agreement next 
week. The House appears to have the necessary votes. The 103rd Congress may be 
a lame duck but it can still make history by implementing the General Agreement 
on Tariffs & Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's cooperation is a watershed of sorts in marshaling bipartisan support. 
The Kansas Republican had been threatening to not support GATT unless President 
Clinton separately agreed to cut the capital gains tax. The political blackmail 
was shameful; Clinton wisely did not buckle under and make any promises on 
capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in exchange for Dole's support the Administration did agree to the 
senator's request for a mechanism to make it easier for the United States to 
withdraw from the World Trade Organization, which would be set up to police the 
GATT accord. Dole had been concerned about the lack of safeguards to protect 
U.S. sovereignty in trade disputes under the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dole's request, the Administration backed the creation of a U.S. judicial 
panel to review disputed WTO rulings. If the panel finds three unjustified 
rulings against the United States within a five-year period, it could trigger a 
congressional vote to pull out of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex, highly technical GATT accord is far from perfect. There are also 
other concerns about the WTO, which must be followed closely before and after 
Congress approves the agreement. The dispute settlement process, as proposed, 
is closed to the press and public. It should be opened up. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord also leaves much to be desired when it comes to protecting children 
from being exploited as workers in foreign manufacturing plants. Some U.S. 
firms insist that overseas contractors hire workers over age 14. American 
companies and consumers must guard against doing business with those who use 
child labor. Yet despite these concerns and others, the international community 
would be far better off with a world trade agreement. For the United States, 
increased trade in the long run will mean jobs, jobs, jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The countdown to the first big test of bipartisan cooperation since the 
elections now begins. Failure to ratify the accord would cost the United States 
dearly.

AN ANSWER THAT'S NO ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problems of homelessness and hunger appear to have become chronic, 
bringing with them increasing levels of annoyance and anger among the 
better-off. Aggressive panhandlers and men using front yards as toilets assault 
the senses and sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of fed-up residents in the Orange County community of Costa Mesa 
think they have an answer: Shut the three respected charities that help the 
homeless. That would drive away those down on their luck -- to someplace where 
they would become someone else's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 How simplistic. How wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, city officials have been meeting for months with those running a 
soup kitchen and a shelter and a group that assists people who want to learn 
how best to help the homeless and ease concerns of residents, many of whom fear 
that petty crime is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's mayor was right in urging the charities to remind those they help 
that they have to live by the rules. Of course, given the number of homeless 
people with mental problems, that is easier said than done. Still, the mayor 
said the problems caused by those using the shelters were not as bad as critics 
claimed, and that in any event throwing out the charities and hoping the 
clients followed was not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Homelessness and hunger are regional problems, demanding regional answers. All 
cities have to help solve the problem and show some compassion.

GOP PROPOSAL ON SCHOOL PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a perfect headline: "GOP Pushes for Local Control of School Prayer" (Nov. 
18). I cannot imagine a more locally controlled event than prayer in school. 
Rep. Ernest Istook Jr. (R-Okla.), conservative politicians and the religious 
right just don't get it. We already have prayer in schools. It is under local 
control by every student at all times.

 President Bill Clinton should know better than to acquiesce to the Republican 
proposal to violate the United States Constitution ("Clinton Signals 
Willingness to Consider School Prayer," Nov. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 The necessary bills proposed by the Republicans to introduce an amendment to 
the Constitution will in themselves be "laws respecting the establishment of 
religion," which are prohibited by the First Amendment. Besides this 
prohibition, the Constitution gives Congress no power to legislate about 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an amendment would put a strain on the last clause of Article VI, that 
"no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification for any office or 
public trust under the United States." Having to swear to uphold such an 
amendment would be a "religious test."

 It looks as though President Clinton is considering jumping onto the school 
prayer bandwagon started by the Republicans. None of these politicians seems to 
realize that there already is prayer in schools: at lunch, at recess, before 
exams, etc. There is no reason why the government should have to interfere in 
the decisions of children as to whether and when to pray. Isn't it ironic how 
the politicians who talk the most about government being too big are the first 
to expand its role in people's personal lives?

 Rep. Newt Gingrich has been quoted as saying that "Children should be allowed 
to pray." Children do not need the government to "allow" them to pray or 
meditate or whatever, in school or out. Religious children pray whenever they 
want to anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Extremists of the Republican Party together with the religious right cover 
themselves with tax-free "Christianity" in order to advance their political 
agenda. They oppose government regulation of big business but insist on 
government intrusion into the private lives of individual citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 One does not have to be a liberal to ask them to please leave our children 
alone and please leave the rest of us alone. They should pray for their own 
enlightenment, on their own time, without governmental decree.

 The Republican sponsors of a measure to impose "voluntary" school prayer say

 How can parents who support school uniforms, because they keep outside 
conflicts and rivalries from invading the classroom, now support school 
prayers, which do the opposite? Imagine African American Baptists refusing to 
join Latino Catholics in praising the Virgin Mary. Imagine the Jews and Muslims 
refusing to bow respectfully in any Christian prayers. Imagine what kids who 
will stab each other over a baseball cap will do to those who diss their God.

 What were the people of Georgia thinking when they elected Gingrich to 
represent their interests in Congress? Is school prayer the biggest issue 
facing our education system today? Is this how he prioritizes the challenges of 
making positive changes in our country, by reinstating prayer or "a quiet 
moment" during class? More importantly, where is the separation of church and 
state? I'm all for everyone's religious freedoms, but on an individual's time, 
not on the taxpayers' time. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of agenda item is not progressive nor will it have any effect on our 
education system. It is merely idle posturing of the GOP and a manifestation of 
Gingrich's ego.

CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to commend The Times for calling the public's attention to one of the 
most tragic occurrences in our society, child abuse. The Nov. 9 article points 
out that child abuse is on the rise.This horrifying problem not only robs our 
children of their youth -- and the possibility of life -- but perpetuates 
violence in the future. Studies show abused children are more likely to be 
involved in violent crimes and batter their own children, continuing the cycle 
of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the impact of child abuse on society, the Junior League of Los 
Angeles made violence prevention one of its focus areas. Not only does the 
league endorse and support legislation stiffening the penalties for child 
abuse, it has developed a project to combat child abuse in our community. Our 
project -- Building Blocks -- pairs experienced mothers with at-risk families. 
Trained volunteers offer new mothers tips on stress management and child 
development, and help families access social services. With the support of our 
co-sponsor, Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, the program 
is expanding to include parent-education classes acclimating new mothers to the 
child development process. 
</P>
<P>
 The league welcomes collaboration with social service agencies and other 
community organizations in the fight against child abuse. By joining forces, we 
can halt this tragedy and improve our future.

HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD THE ONE ABOUT THE LAWYER?; CAREER: THE ONLY THING MORE 
BORING THAN LAW SCHOOL IS THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAMERON KENNY, Cameron Kenny works for Fox Television Stations Inc. in New 
York. She is a lawyer who would rather be a comedy writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like may other law school graduates, I just learned that I passed the 
Connecticut State Bar examination and I'm tickled pink. I think the last time I 
was so excited was when Pepsi started dating its cans for freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing the bar means that I now have the authority to practice law, which in 
my estimation ranks in importance between having the authority to donate my 
organs and having the authority to feel superior to Connie Chung. Put another 
way, the only thing in life more tiresome than the potential practice of law is 
the actual study of law. Yet, despite the growing public awareness that law 
school and all things legal are monstrously dull, the nation's law schools keep 
filling up at an alarming rate. How can this be? 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to get to the bottom of this frightening national trend, I 
examined my personal motivation for entering law school as a sort of test case 
for all law students. I reflected on my own calamitous decision and then tried 
to determine, essentially, what went wrong. In other words, when did the 
tendency toward law school first develop? Were there any warning signs? Was 
breast-feeding a factor? After reviewing all the evidence, I arrived at the 
hideous truth: Like most saps who enroll in law school, I just had nothing 
better to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to enter law school is not without real costs, though, and should 
not be treated lightly. I myself acquired numerous impairments during the 
experience, all of which deserve mention. First, I somehow lost 21% of my 
vocabulary and 43% of my goodwill toward men. As an example of the former, I no 
longer know what the word candor means, although I can tell you it generally 
evokes feelings of terror and loss. I now become irritable and withdrawn during 
McDonald's commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Other manifestations of my law-related disability are that I insist on calling 
tenants "lessees" and I'm no longer capable of pronouncing the word statue. Try 
as I might, the word always comes out as statute. (I've since discovered that 
this particular affliction besets all those in the legal community. It is, 
quite simply, the mark of the beast. The password into the coven. The Big 
Tip-Off. So consider yourself warned.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disturbing than these superficial malfunctions is the fact that many 
law students become truly addled. I, for example, am totally unable to make 
definitive statements and I'm actually frightened by "yes/no" questions. Just 
to give you real perspective on how badly I've deteriorated, I spent more than 
20 minutes last week trying to determine whether "material misrepresentations 
of fact" are "lies." I still have no idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But I did get something out of law school -- a treasure I'll carry with me for 
the rest of my life. It's an IOU for One Zillion Dollars payable to various 
student loan programs. (I'm considering making up T-shirts: "My Law School Got 
$90,000 and All I Got Was This Lousy JD.") 
</P>
<P>
 To sum up, law school is a costly, boring and a genuinely debilitating fiasco. 
Its only purported reward is admittance to a bar and thus a lifetime of boredom 
as a practicing attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I've passed the bar, I guess the drinks are on me.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; FOR HUNGER, MORE THAN A HANDOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GOTTLIE; CAROLYN OLNEY, ; ELIZABETH RILEY, Robert Gottlieb supervised 
the Seeds of Change study. Elizabeth Riley and Carolyn Olney are the executive 
director and associate director of the Interfaith Hunger Coalition of Southern 
California. Gottlieb and Riley are members of the City of Los Angeles' 
Voluntary Advisory Council on Hunger. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, a day to feast and give thanks, more people than at any time in the 
recent past are going hungry in Los Angeles. These are not only the homeless, 
not even just the unemployed or those on welfare. Today there are working 
people, retired people, illegal immigrants and native born, and children of all 
colors and from different communities who are not eating well or regularly. If 
not today, then sometime soon they will not have enough to eat, influencing 
their ability to function in school, on the job or in relating to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Indications of the scale of this hunger abound. Food banks and pantries have 
seen demand soar, a demand that cannot be met as donations are down and 
threaten to erode further. Eighteen percent of full-time workers are now paid 
less than the poverty level for a family of four. It is now common to work full 
time and receive government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new congressional majority proposing major cutbacks in 
food-assistance programs like school lunches, by next Thanksgiving hunger will 
be worse than ever. Some congressmen assert that charities can handle it; we 
know that's not true. Our food banks and pantries are stretched to the limit 
and we're turning people away by the thousands.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, appeals to charity and staffing soup kitchens on 
Thanksgiving sends the signal that hunger can somehow be solved by giving out 
turkeys one day of the year. But we know from our research and our experiences 
on the front lines that hunger -- or rather the lack of food security -- is not 
just an individual issue, it's a community concern. It's a nutrition issue, 
including access to healthy, safe and reasonably priced foods. It's about where 
supermarkets are located, and how much income has to be spent on food. It's 
about having jobs and making jobs. It's about farmers being local, or close 
enough to market directly to people who need fresh food. Food security is not 
about charity; it's about community empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 With Republican's threats to cut the few remaining food safety-net programs 
and their desire to push the problem onto the states through block grants, it 
will ultimately be the cities that have to address the enormity of this hunger 
or food insecurity problem. Yet cities like Los Angeles are not equipped to 
deal with these issues. There is no city "food department" or "food agency," as 
there is for housing and environment or transportation. There is, in fact, no 
food security or hunger policy of any kind. If we are to deal with hunger as a 
community issue, then we need to both plan for and implement a new, more 
proactive and integrated approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of such an integrated approach are germinating in new community 
efforts and institutions:  
</P>
<P>
 * Several dozen farmers' markets, including a number in the inner city, have 
sprung up recently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Community gardens, providing a source of food and urban greening. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joint ventures between community organizations and supermarkets to bring 
markets back to the inner city, while providing jobs and other community 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Innovative programs at food banks and shelters that provide job training, 
community gardens and even restaurants for garden products. 
</P>
<P>
 * Community food businesses, such as Crenshaw High School's Food from the 
'Hood salad dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 While these efforts are impressive as grass-roots undertakings, they suffer 
from the absence of an integrated, citywide policy. In several communities 
around the country, food policy councils have been created to meet this crucial 
need for integration and planning. Councils help link different programs, such 
as the use of food stamps at farmers markets or healthy-snack programs for 
schools. Councils bring together different stake holders in the food system who 
have the capacity to map out and implement an integrated food-security 
approach. While most councils are city-based, they can also operate at the 
county or regional level, given some of the regional dimensions of the problem, 
such as supermarket closure and relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a food-security policy for Los Angeles. Eighteen months ago, when the 
UCLA study "Seeds of Change" was released documenting widespread hunger in the 
community, a call for a food policy council for Los Angeles was raised and 
supported by many, including this newspaper. The City of Los Angeles has now 
established a Voluntary Advisory Council on Hunger to come up with a proposed 
hunger policy for Los Angeles within the year. 
</P>
<P>
 By next Thanksgiving, we need to be able to say that solving hunger is not 
just a matter for charity but has become a community policy, addressing a 
problem that is not going to disappear by itself, even on a day when we feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Free turkeys once a year don't do much for the underfed; Los Angeles urgently 
needs a food-security policy.

 What is causing the right wing to go ballistic? Is it pornography? Another 
controversial artistic exhibit funded by taxpayers' hard-earned money? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's history. A few weeks ago, the National Center for History in the 
Schools (funded jointly by UCLA and the National Endowment for the Humanities) 
released the standards to be used in textbooks teaching U.S. history and 
immediately ignited another battle in the cultural wars. They then released the 
guidelines for teaching world history, an act some compare to throwing gasoline 
onto a firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over the nation's memory of its past is nothing less than a struggle 
for political control of the country's future. Americans may be famous for 
their historical amnesia, but they are passionately divided about how they want 
their nation's history told. 
</P>
<P>
 It began when Congress decided to bolster students' competency in the 
humanities by commissioning a teachers' guide for fifth through 12th grades. 
Lynne Cheney, who as chair of the National Endowment during the Bush 
Administration, appointed a panel of historians to provide a standard for the 
history curriculum. To her dismay, these scholars have emerged with a story she 
didn't want told. The document is too "gloomy," Cheney complains. American 
history should celebrate the country's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 What is so repugnant about this new history curriculum? It views the past with 
a critical, rather than a simply celebratory perspective. It argues that no 
nation, not even the United States, is without flaws. Massacres of indigenous 
peoples, the enslavement of Africans and the killing of striking workers are 
also a part of our nation's complicated past. But the new history is not all 
gloom and doom. It also celebrates the passionate efforts by the named and 
unnamed to broaden the nation's commitment to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The new history is inclusive. Rather than focusing only on great men and 
triumphant events, the new history integrates the lives of ordinary people -- 
women, ethnic and racial minorities and workers -- into the nation's story. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the new history, as some critics claim, an example of political correctness 
gone awry? No, but it may seem that way to those who insist upon an "official" 
story that fantasizes the unblemished triumph of American democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, every generation of historians rewrites the past. What the right 
really hates about this new history is that it has been written by some of the 
same people who fought against segregation and gender discrimination, who 
protested the Vietnam War and gave birth to the environmental and gay-rights 
movements. It is a generation that has witnessed -- in Watergate and in the S & 
L failures of the 1980s -- too much political and economic corruption to 
collaborate in a cover-up account of the nation's past. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a generation that believes the democratic promise of America, 
magnificent as it is, is still unfolding and has yet to be realized by 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 This generation of historians has produced an immense body of scholarship that 
challenges the congratulatory story of American history. They have asked hard 
questions and sought honest answers. Why, for example, did a nation founded on 
the stunning vision of justice and equality establish a republic reliant on a 
slave economy? Why has a society that has depended on the cheap labor of 
immigrants launched periodic crusades against them? 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural critics on the right worry that such questions will erode students' 
patriotism. But real love -- whether for a person or a nation -- develops out 
of a full acceptance of the beloved's strengths and weaknesses.  
</P>
<P>
 The new history depicts successive generations of Americans seeking access to 
the nation's political and economic life. But it also describes the racial, 
gender and class barriers that have excluded some citizens from participating 
in the American dream. For the new historians, the great experiment in American 
democracy is still unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
 The right's quarrel with this version of the past is that they believe the 
United States has already fulfilled its democratic promise. History, in other 
words, is over. 
</P>
<P>
 But history never ends. Nor do unpleasant truths destroy a nation's social 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 The real danger to a democracy is an official history written to justify the 
status quo. George Orwell understood the magnitude of this threat, writing in 
his classic novel, "1984": "Who controls the past, controls the future; who 
controls the present controls the past."

 "Good Hair: For Colored Girls Who've Considered Weaves When the Chemicals 
Became too Ruff" 
</P>
<P>
 Author: Lonnice Brittenum Bonner 
</P>
<P>
 Info: Crown Trade Paperbacks, 1991. $10 paperback.Fully illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 KINKY AND LOVIN' IT: For African American women suffering from "nappy hair 
phobia," Lonnice Brittenum Bonner offers an alternative that turns kinky locks 
into good-looking tresses without chemical straighteners. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a generous sprinkling of humor, Bonner, a former reporter for the 
Oakland Tribune, chronicles her journey from the days when she was a "hair 
outlaw" and her bangs were stuck to her forehead, to her new attitude and 
philosophy that not only is black hair good hair, but it's also beautiful in 
its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the real meaning of this book. For too long, Bonner says, black women 
have tried to live up to unattainable ideals of Caucasian beauty. She says it 
is time for black women to look to themselves for role models and the ideal 
beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the book, Bonner tells of the years when her locks were 
"straightened to an inch of their life," her Afro moments and the days of the 
braids and weaves, as she sought an easy, direct route to "bouncin' and 
behavin' " hair. 
</P>
<P>
 However, through working with her hair, Bonner has found that there is no easy 
route, no quick fix -- except cutting it all off -- for broken, overprocessed 
heads. But her styles and conditioning tips can help black women move 
gracefully away from chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 98-page book includes chapters on the anatomy of a hair follicle and 
shampooing and conditioning, with how-to photographs of several styles. CYNDI

SCREEN STYLE: VERY MERRY TRADITIONAL

 The Movie: "Miracle on 34th Street." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Kriss Kringle (Richard Attenborough), a department store Santa, 
swears he's the real thing, but Susan Walker (Mara Wilson, pictured) and her 
mom, Dorey (Elizabeth Perkins, pictured), are nonbelievers in this remake of 
the 1947 classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Kathy O'Rear, whose credits include the films "Quiz 
Show" and "A River Runs Through It" (with Bernie Pollack), and television's 
"Anything but Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: In the original, little Natalie Wood sat on Santa's lap in a plaid 
coat. Now, Mara sits on Santa's lap in a plaid coat; in other scenes, she wears 
a hand-knit red sweater with kitties on the pockets and a snow-white flannel 
nightie with heart-shaped buttons. Why does she look so cute? Because these are 
feel-good but not-really-the-'90s costumes. The children I know wear only 
jeans, leggings, T-shirts and sport shoes, none of them plaid, and my niece 
wears sweat pants to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "When anyone thinks of Christmas, you think of traditional, 
old-fashioned images, and even though it's a modern film, that's the feeling we 
worked very hard to create," O'Rear says. "I live in New York, and little girls 
really do dress in a more classic, conservative style. But it was a little 
confusing to the Fox executives, because they're out in California." 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: If it looks as if Kringle's Santa uniform is several notches 
spiffier than that of other department store Santas, consider that his ruby 
velvet jacket was stitched with gold thread, trimmed in white fox and decorated 
with hand-carved buttons (each adorned with the name of a reindeer). 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: To contribute to the traditional mood, not even extras were permitted 
to wear synthetic fabrics. "We also tried to avoid neons or anything too 
trendy," O'Rear says. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: O'Rear researched Santa uniforms through the ages, starting with 
long capes over dressing gowns, but settled on the Santa costume immortalized 
in Cola-Cola's Christmas ads of the '30s and '40s -- the prototype for modern 
Santa garb, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Susan Walker's and Kringle's costumes were custom-made in New York, 
except for Kringle's Santa boots, which were made at Angels in London. Other 
Santa costumes were rented from Western Costume and Eaves Brooks Costumes in 
New York. BETTY GOODWIN

SOUND AND SPIRIT OF LIFE IN A NEW MEXICO BORDER TOWN; FACE OF AN ANGEL, B Y 
DENISE CHAVEZ ; FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX; $23, 467 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY DRABANSKI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While most novels of the '90s center on the fast track -- urban as well as 
urbane existence -- Denise Chavez's book detours off the highway of life to the 
gritty, fictional southern New Mexico town of Agua Oscura to introduce us to 
Soveida Dosamantes, a career waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, in her engaging novel, takes us out for a wild cruise, full of hairpin 
turns. Soveida's philosophy is: "If you are a waitress, you have to live hard, 
drink hard, love hard. There is no other way." Soveida also pursues life 
outside the restaurant with a passion. She makes her share of mistakes, but she 
definitely believes that it's better to have loved and learned than to allow 
life to meekly pass her by. 
</P>
<P>
 But in many ways the book is more than Soveida's life story. Chavez pays 
tribute to everyday people -- those who spend their lives serving others -- the 
cooks, janitors, waitresses and maids. While they might live from paycheck to 
paycheck, Chavez recognizes that they live passionate, multidimensional lives 
as well, full of big drama, tragedy and joy. 
</P>
<P>
 A master storyteller, Chavez draws on her years as a playwright and actress to 
develop lively dialogue that reveals the inner thoughts and desires of her 
characters. Similar to the flamenco dance, Chavez's dialogues often start at a 
slow, deliberate pace, then finish in a frenzied heart-stopping rhythm of 
passion. Her characters bring us in on back-room conversations that often are 
more raunchy and gut-wrenching than any soap opera.  
</P>
<P>
 Chavez tells us Soveida's story of her family and its roots in Mexico. Soveida 
doesn't look at her family with rose-colored glasses, but with eyes wide open, 
albeit often welling with tears. "I never knew my great-grandfather Manuel 
Dosamantes. Nor did I know my grandfather Profetario very well. To me he was a 
blustery man, big as the sky, always yelling at my grandmother Lupe. He was a 
man who lived under the yoke of his father Manuel's perfectly balanced life." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the novel, there's a sense that the women are destined to pay for 
the sins of their fathers. Yet, the women come out victors -- stronger with 
each passing generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Soveida works on a handbook for waitresses titled, "The Book of Service," 
developed during her three decades working as a waitress at El Farol 
Restaurant. These earthy chapters -- a book within the book actually -- are 
filled with practical, often humorous observations. Take her chapter on bras 
and girdles: "No girdles. Tight pinching underwear is a waitress's nightmare. 
That and ill-fitting shoes. There is nothing worse than a tight bra that grips 
the fleshy part, or panties that grab." 
</P>
<P>
 Soveida sees value and art in her humble work: In the chapter titled, "The 
Waitress Fugue," she observes: "Everyone should wait on tables. A waitress is 
the observer/observed sanctified by food. That happens on occasion. Great 
happiness ensues." And: "If you are a good waitress, you forget your physical 
self, you become a motion, color, machine, movement itself etched on the 
elusive insubstantial canvas of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Soveida's whole life becomes one of service -- washing her alcoholic father's 
laundry after he's divorced from her mother, and constantly tending to her 
mother's physical and emotional needs. She will serve two demanding husbands, 
neither willing to give her the unconditional love and commitment she 
desperately seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Soveida grows to despise her family lies and the whispers that surround her. 
The once-timid Soveida, whose grandmother, Mama Lupita, prayed that Soveida's 
destiny was to be a nun, develops a loud and often angry voice. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, Soveida embraces her religion. She wants to please her 
grandmother. She's enthralled with stories of the saints -- the more bizarre, 
the better. She shares the joy of her first Holy Communion as well as the 
emotional pain as she endures an exorcism requested by her family. Soveida 
continues to be drawn to the religious traditions that are integral to her 
cultural upbringing, but at the same time questions the doctrines. Out of her 
own exploration and infusion of mysticism introduced to her by her mother's 
Mexican-Indian servant Oralia, Soveida forges her own brand of spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 Soveida discovers that while she was serving enchiladas during the '60s, a 
whole social movement had developed around her. Her first husband, Ivan, and 
later her professor, J. V. Velasquez, talk at length about La Raza and being 
Chicanos. But while both these men can spout the popular rhetoric, Soveida 
seems to instinctively know in her heart and bones what it means to be Latina 
-- with or without any labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez peppers her dialogue with Spanish, adding to its authenticity, and 
giving the book the cadence and lyrical rhythm of the Southwestern Latino 
world. Much as Henry Roth, in his masterpiece "Call It Sleep" magically blended 
English and Yiddish, bringing the Jewish immigrant world alive, so Chavez has 
captured the sound and spirit of life near the American-Mexican border: 
</P>
<P>
 "Oralia was making a caldo from sirloin tips. She would throw out the meat and 
skim the broth, and then later bring it to Luardo to sip. . . . She had told me 
that Luardo was very ill. ' Tengo Miedo ,' she said, her soft gray eyes 
watering. He was a strong man once, but no longer. Something snapped. Like 
Maria Mejia's back. Some people are like that, especially men. You look at them 
and see victory, what others thought was a happy, successful life. But their 
hearts are like the swirling wind without a place to rest. Como el dicho: Quien 
siembra vientos recoge tempestades. Who sows the wind reaps the whirlwind." 
</P>
<P>
 (One minor quibble: perhaps subsequent editions might include a brief glossary 
of expressions, since many are -- as they should be -- regional, slang 
expressions not often found in conventional Spanish dictionaries.) 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Chavez's story of a woman's whirlwind of a life is a powerful and 
memorable tale.

 Voodoo Economics?: Mick Jagger proved a Rolling Stone can gather some votes. 
He was elected honorary president of the London School of Economics student 
union Tuesday. Jagger attended the school in the early '60s before leaving to 
pursue a different breed of economics. Well behind Jagger in the student 
balloting as runner-up was suspected terrorist Carlos the Jackal. "This is an 
honorary office of the students' union, not a college position," said a 
spokesman for the prestigious school. "But it would be fair to say that we are 
quite pleased that Mick Jagger was picked over Carlos." Previous holders of the 
honorary post include South African President Nelson Mandela and Terry Waite, 
the Anglican priest who was held hostage in Lebanon. Jagger and the Rolling 
Stones are currently in Washington as part of their international "Voodoo 
Lounge" tour.

estimated 203,000 units last week and will continue to command the No. 1 
position on Billboard's pop album sales chart when the trade magazine hits the 
newsstands Saturday. New holiday collections by Kenny G and Mariah Carey burst 
into the Top 10 this week placing No. 6 and No. 7, respectively. Fans purchased 
98,000 copies of Kenny G's "Miracles" album and 90,000 of Carey's "Merry

 The Price of Talk: Phil Donahue's insurers have tentatively agreed to pay 
about $20,000 toward an estimated $100,000 damages caused by a stampede of fans 
after the Texas taping of a show about "millionaire bachelor studs," a building 
executive said Tuesday. The incident occurred at the end of a show on April 15, 
1993, and resulted in damage to the Fort Worth convention center's 25-year-old 
orchestra lift, on which the show's set was located. After the show ended, a 
crowd of women stormed the stage to meet four bachelors, who included Dallas 
Cowboys' running back Emmitt Smith, said Melvin Morgan, executive director of 
the Fort Worth/Tarrant County Convention Center. "They all got on one corner of 
the platform, which put excessive pressure on one hydraulic piston," Morgan 
said. "It blew a gasket. . . . The orchestra lift just settled down 15 feet 
below. We ended up working through the night stabilizing the 50,000-pound 
platform." The county expects to pay for the balance of the repairs.

 Islamic Protest: Muslim and Arab organizations are upset about "Jihad in 
America," a public TV show that they say portrays Muslims as violent fanatics. 
The Council on American-Islamic Relations decried the documentary as part of a 
trend toward "anti-Islamic McCarthyism in the Western media" and said it fuels 
anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States. WETA, the PBS affiliate in 
Washington, defended the show as well-researched and well-documented. The show

 Jessica Tandy Remembered: Theater and screen notables paid tribute to actress 
Jessica Tandy at a memorial service Tuesday at Broadway's Shubert Theater. 
Director Mike Nichols said that a Marlon Brando-Jessica Tandy scene in "A 
Streetcar Named Desire" in 1947 "is the reason I'm in the theater. I wanted to 
be in the place where these things happen." Nichols, who directed Tandy and her 
husband, Hume Cronyn, in "The Gin Game" on Broadway in 1977, recalled the 
couple "drilling, rehearsing, repeating, improving, drilling and working far 
more and longer and harder than I thought necessary or possible. . . . And 
that, of course, is the secret. To be righter than anyone else to begin with 
and then beat the blazes out of it." Taped tributes from Sir John Gielgud and 
Sir Alec Guinness were among many eulogies for the actress, who died Sept. 11 
at the age of 85. ART

 Mixed Impressions: The Turner prize, Britain's top art honor, was awarded 
Tuesday to sculptor Antony Gormley, who risks suffocation to take impressions 
of his own body while using breathing tubes. The $31,410 award was given for a 
collection of five iron-clad dummies bent double against a wall. About 300 
young artists heckled outside London's Tate Gallery before the award ceremony, 
contending the prize is elitist. Gormley frequently exhibits at Burnett Miller 
Gallery in Santa Monica and is currently in a show at Newport Harbor Art 
Museum. QUICK TAKES

 A Modesto Superior Court judge threw out a paternity suit brought against pop 
star Michael Jackson by Michelle Flowers, who accused Jackson of fathering her 
10-year-old son and sought $20 million a year and a mansion. Genetic tests 
cleared Jackson and indicated the woman's ex-husband is probably the boy's 
father. . . . "Baywatch" co-star Pamela Anderson, 27, sued the Globe tabloid 
for $12 million for writing that she was a heroin addict and in danger of 
losing her role. In the lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court, Anderson 
denied she has a drug problem. A Globe spokesman said Wednesday the tabloid 
stands by its story. . . . Zsa Zsa Gabor, noted for her clash with a Beverly 
Hills policeman, takes the part of that city's mayor-elect today in a guest 
role on "Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters From Beverly Hills," a new 
action-adventure series on cable's USA Network. . . . When Rush Limbaugh heard 
that Mary Tyler Moore had offered $1,000 to free Spike, an 12 1/2-pound, 
65-year-old lobster that resides in a tank at a Pacific Palisades restaurant, 
Limbaugh doubled the offer, but with a clearly different intent. "Tell him he's 
invited for dinner but not to plan on dessert," Limbaugh said on his TV show.

CLUB REVIEW; WHISKY ONCE AGAIN A PLACE OF IMPORTANCE FOR BANDS

 More than any other venerable Sunset Strip club, the Whisky has moved adeptly 
into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has it shed its " '80s rock" status for a more alternative music mix 
-- that's simply good business in today's climate -- but the famous West 
Hollywood club has also developed an ability to be unpredictable in a 
predictable scene.Unlike the nearby Roxy, which always feels like a showcase 
setting, or the Coconut Teaszer, whose crowd rarely varies, you never know 
quite what you're gonna get when you step inside the dark, 400-capacity Whisky. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nights, the bi-level space is so hot and sweaty that you dread entering. 
Other times the crowd is so complacent that their drinks seem to be about to 
slip out of their hands. In recent months, however, the latter scene has been a 
rare occurrence. As in the past, the Whisky is one of the clubs where you want 
to see bands perform, and once again it means something to perform on that 
historic stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that tears things down as fast as it can build them, all this is 
encouraging. In rock 'n' roll years, the Whisky has been around since the 
beginning of time, and has been the chosen site of nearly every Next Big Thing 
born out of the city's musical imagination. If the Whisky is thriving, so is 
L.A.'s creative spirit.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; AMERICAN MUSIC CLUB TAKES SAD SONGS TO UPBEAT LEVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm the ugliest lead singer in rock 'n' roll," Mark Eitzel told the audience 
near the end of the American Music Club's show at the Roxy on Wednesday. He 
seemed to mean it (and he could well be right), but his jocular delivery and 
the ongoing banter that surrounded the statement definitely played against 
type. 
</P>
<P>
 The music on which Eitzel has built his cult reputation is really pretty 
varied -- never more so than on the AMC's latest album, "San Francisco," named 
for the band's hometown -- but its overwhelming impression is one of 
introspection and loneliness. The man behind it, you figure, should be 
withdrawn and visibly neurotic, and the performance should cast a dark spell 
with its achingly slow tempos and melancholy voicings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eitzel and his three musicians (supplemented periodically by a third 
guitarist) were straightforward and fairly upbeat Wednesday, avoiding prolonged 
displays of despair as they turned ballads into piercing-guitar battlegrounds 
and offered high-energy rock songs reminiscent of the Replacements and Cracker. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's distinctive configurations of folk, rock, jazz-tinged pop and even 
lounge music wore pretty well through the hour-plus set, though Eitzel's voice 
seemed a little rough and restricted even by his own idiosyncratic standards. 
The approach made for an accessible performance, at the expense of the music's 
potential to clutch the listener's heart more insistently. RICHARD CROMELIN

MUSIC REVIEW; FRENCH TRADITIONS SURFACE IN ROBSON'S PASADENA RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before the mid-piece announcement of a cuckoo's call, one had identified 
Mark Robson's new and pleasant Nocturne as an hommage to Olivier Messiaen, at 
the pianist-composer's recital at Neighborhood Church in Pasadena, Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The brand-new work concluded the first half of a heavily French-accented 
program, and charmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 A former student of Yvonne Loriod (Messiaen's longtime associate and wife) in 
Paris, the 37-year-old musician -- also an organist, if one is compiling 
hyphens -- began his program with Stravinsky's Serenade in A (1925), as French, 
and pianistically grateful, a work as Stravinsky ever wrote. He ended it with 
three Debussy Etudes, brilliantly and idiomatically performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Robson's gifts are more than merely multifarious; they seem to be evolving. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the parts of this recital -- also including music by Brahms and 
Scriabin -- achieved the admirable intensity of his playing of Janacek's "V 
Mihach" (In the Mist) suite, yet all of it was approached with musicianly 
thoroughness. Live acoustics in the square Neighborhood Church sanctuary, as 
well as a resourceful, covetable new Fazioli piano did not hurt the strong 
impression the pianist was making. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the playing, however, seemed less than completely realized, closer to 
half- than fully baked. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the score for Stravinsky may have put a scrim between player and 
listener. Many of Brahms' emotional complexities -- in the Variations, Opus 21, 
No. 1 -- were indicated, but not with ultimate clarity or sweep. And the 
quirkiness, the dark side, of Scriabin -- in two short pieces and the brief 
Tenth Sonata -- seldom materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Robson's accomplishments are considerable. One assumes he also wrote 
the literate and entertaining annotations accompanying the printed program. 
</P>
<P>
 The new recital series continues Jan. 17, when Vicki Ray plays music by 
Busoni, Berg, Knussen, Crockett, Santos and others.

JAZZ REVIEW; MAKING MUSIC WITH THE BARRY HARRIS TRIO AT BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Harris is a people sort of player. Whether working for a large audience 
or a small collection of ardent fans, the connection he establishes with his 
listeners is an implicit element in his art. 
</P>
<P>
 As so often happens at jazz venues early in the week, it was the lesser-sized 
audience that greeted Harris' performance at the Jazz Bakery on Tuesday night. 
But it was no problem for the New York-based pianist. He simply brought the 
small circle of listeners into the center of his music, encouraging them to 
share an off-the-cuff, interactive musical evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Chuck Israels and drummer Billy Higgins became implicit to the 
process, tossing musical ideas back and forth, responding spontaneously to 
Harris and the audience, with Israels making an occasional whimsical aside and 
Higgins offering his familiar smile of joy in the sheer process of making jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was something like an entertaining, but never didactic seminar -- 
appropriately so, given Harris' impressive background as an educator. He kicked 
off his first set by asking the crowd to supply a few numbers from one to 
eight, which he immediately converted to several successive notes. The notes 
were then incorporated into an improvisation ranging from a middle groove to a 
rolling rumba. 
</P>
<P>
 Most jazz players can do the technique with ease, but with Harris, it was a 
spontaneous, completely unacademic explanation -- experience, actually -- of 
the process of improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' piano playing is a distinct extension of the classic Bud Powell be-bop 
style. Typically, on the faster numbers, his right-hand lines had the 
free-flowing surge of a horn, while his left hand chopped out crisp 
accompanying accents. But he also is more lyrical and more compositionally 
structured than Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 His ballads were as romantically tender as they were harmonically complex, and 
the playful shifts of key in his rendering of "Tea for Two" were the product of 
a highly focused musical imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris concluded by gently leading the way through a sing-along to the melody 
of a complicated original tune. Remarkably, within a few minutes the audience 
had it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was pleased. But he felt compelled to give a homework assignment. 
"Tomorrow night," he said, "I want each of you to come back here with 10 more 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the relatively rare opportunity to connect with a jazz artist of this 
quality, it's an assignment he shouldn't have to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barry Harris trio at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver City. (310) 
271-9039. $20 admission. Harris plays two sets each night, 8:30 and 10:30, 
through Saturday.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: A GOOD-NEIGHBOR POLICY THAT INCLUDES HOME COOKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BAKE SALE: If you crave fruit pizza or cream cheese in won ton skin, you can 
turn to "A Taste of Palos Verdes," a cookbook published by a local nonprofit 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Neighbors Club of Palos Verdes Peninsula is selling the cookbook to 
raise money for charities that include the Rainbow Shelter for battered women, 
the Harbor Interfaith Shelter for homeless families and the FISH Pantry, an 
emergency food center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just housewives out scrounging up some money for those shelters," said 
cookbook chairwoman Pat Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, dedicated to welcoming new residents to the peninsula, sells the 
book for about $10 at Bristol Farms in Rolling Hills Estates and at Curt Wagner 
furniture in Redondo Beach. The book will be available soon at Brentano's 
bookstore in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, the group has sold about 300 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members donated the recipes, and other club members tested them before 
they were published, said Fran Mazzeo, publicity director. 
</P>
<P>
 For those lacking a taste for the exotic, the book also includes spaghetti 
carbonara, courtesy of Italian native Gloria Siriaco, and Betty's Meat Loaf, 
courtesy of Minnesota native Betty Sawyer.

 FIRST STEPS: It seems the slow wheels of bureaucracy are starting to turn as 
plans to clean up an unsightly area in Wilmington got under way this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday morning, a team of city workers and members of the Port Police 
Department and the Los Angeles Police Department were on the dirt streets of an 
East Wilmington business area (deemed the "Third World" by locals) collecting 
huge piles of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have sewers laid, streets paved . . . That's the big plan," 
said Officer Donna Tuk, who is coordinating LAPD efforts. "We're going to move 
the illegitimate businesses out and redo the whole area." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 9, Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents the harbor area, will 
hold a meeting of government, police, railway companies, businesses and other 
organizations involved in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cleanup bill is expected to come to $13 million. Tuk said the money 
probably will come from the city and businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case anyone doubts the degree of filth, drugs and prostitution in 
the area, the LAPD is compiling a videotape of activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuk calls it a "reality" video. "So we can show we have city streets that look 
like junkyards," she said. 
</P>

 CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH: Carwashes and coffee bars and chiropractors, oh my! 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of a Manhattan Beach carwash don't put clean cars ahead of bad backs. 
While patrons of Red Carpet Car Wash wait for their luxury coupes to be 
scrubbed and waxed, Marie Cosgrove carefully examines patrons' spines for 
imperfections. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosgrove works for a Manhattan Beach chiropractor who rents out a small room 
at the carwash. As the cars roll through the rinse cycle, Cosgrove asks patrons 
if they'd like a free spinal exam, and about 10 to 15 people take her up on the 
offer each day, she said. Sometimes, Cosgrove recommends the patrons see the 
chiropractor for a checkup. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the carwash's kill-several-birds-with-one-stone philosophy. 
Patrons can sip java, have their loafers shined and have their spines examined 
over the whirring and swishing sounds of carwash spigots. Business at the 
carwash hasn't gone up because of the additional services, managers say, but 
customers are responding enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 As Eleanora Thomas' 1988 Ford Tempo rolled through the rinse cycle recently, 
Cosgrove studied Thomas' spine. The service is great, Thomas said, adding that 
her neck has been bothering her lately. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to tell what the new Congress will be like. It certainly will 
be different." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), who was leading Republican Susan Brooks 
by 546 votes with at least 1,000 votes left to be counted. J3

LAPD OPENS NEW OFFICER ACADEMY IN WESTCHESTER; LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE FACILITY, A 
FORMER HEWLETT-PACKARD PLANT, WILL BEGIN TRAINING 90 RECRUITS IN JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's new academy, set to begin training 90 
recruits in January, opened its doors Saturday to an enthusiastic welcome from 
a community hoping for increased business and an expanded police presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and Deputy Mayor 
William C. Violante and more than 100 local residents toured the partially 
completed facility, which once housed electronics giant Hewlett-Packard Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "What impressed everyone was how spacious it is and that they didn't have to 
readjust the building's configuration -- the computer and training facilities, 
cafeteria and showers are already there," said Don Savoie, executive director 
of the Westchester/LAX Chamber of Commerce and a local resident. "The new 
employee base will also bring more income to the area," he said. "I'm already 
telling everyone to buy stock in Winchell's," which has a doughnut shop nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joe Cunningham, another Westchester resident: "Platoons of recruits will 
be jogging down our roads, students and instructors driving down our streets . 
. . it might make the criminals in the area think twice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they felt increased pressure to find a suitable facility 
for a new training center after the unveiling in October, 1993, of a public 
safety plan outlined by Mayor Richard Riordan and Williams. The plan set a goal 
of hiring an additional 2,855 officers over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council's approval last December, the facility was purchased in 
March for $13 million using police bond funds. An additional $10 million will 
be used for the property's refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
 City and police officials said the empty building had necessary amenities such 
as classrooms, a cafeteria and a near-complete computer room on the second 
floor. The existing Hewlett-Packard offices were also large enough to 
accommodate plans for a new 911 communications center, which, combined with the 
academy, will save the city about $50 million, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they saved about four years that would have been needed 
to construct a new academy.

PEOPLE: A LIFE'S LESSON FROM A CENTENARIAN: KEEP MOVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 80 years since he arrived in New York with only the clothes on his 
back, Antonio Rodriguez has retired from two different careers, served in two 
World Wars and seen 15 U.S. presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Rodriguez, of Torrance, celebrated his 100th birthday. And last 
month he received a medal from the Department of Veterans Affairs commemorating 
the 75th anniversary of the end of World War I. About 100 living WWI veterans 
in Southern California have been awarded the medals.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez recalls standing shoulder to shoulder with other soldiers during his 
voyage to Europe in 1917 and scanning the Atlantic for enemy submarines in the 
wake of the sinking of the Lusitania. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the Americans changed the way the war was fought, Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans had tended to stay in their trenches and not shoot until they were 
shot at, he said. "You get along family-like. You just stay in your trench," 
Rodriguez recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans were more aggressive, advancing behind the cover of trees and 
bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either you shoot or you get shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is the oldest resident of the Huntington Retirement Hotel, where he 
shares a suite with his wife, Augustina, 88. He's one of the most active 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 He rises at 6 each morning to press hot towels on his head and neck -- a 
practice he credits with keeping his circulation moving and keeping him in 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 After his bath, he dresses and walks several blocks to Hawthorne Boulevard, 
where he stops to buy a plain doughnut. On his way back to the hotel he does 
his shopping at the grocery store and buys his daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he occasionally can't remember the name of a particular place or 
person, he easily remembers the day he enlisted in the Army (Dec. 5, 1914), the 
date he retired from the Army (it was four days after Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
died, April 12, 1945), and his 100th birthday (Aug. 23, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in New York after a turbulent childhood. He was born in a rural 
part of Puerto Rico. When his father died and his mother remarried, she sent 
him to an orphanage. At 18, he left the orphanage but returned there to work 
soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 The schoolmaster hired him to make shoes for the orphans -- 40 cents for small 
pairs and 50 cents for large pairs. After a year of making shoes, he had enough 
money saved to go to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 With some help from Puerto Ricans already established in the city, he found an 
apartment over a bar and shared the room with a schoolmate from Puerto Rico. 
For $4 a month they rented a room with one bed, lit by flickering gas lights. 
It was 1914, the same year the Model-T was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later he saw a recruiting station, and within days he was signed 
up and shipped out to Galveston, Tex. During his 30-year military career, 
Rodriguez earned the rank of master sergeant, played clarinet in the Army band 
and saw Douglas MacArthur in Texas when MacArthur was a second lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring, Rodriguez returned to New York and started a career with the 
Postal Service. He and his wife lived near the city and raised two sons. Until 
he turned 70, he worked in New York City post offices. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the Postal Service transferred him to a new station because of 
the appointment of a new postmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was after that young fella (John F. Kennedy) was elected; he wanted to 
make a job for somebody who worked for him on the campaign," Rodriguez said 
with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing his second career, he moved to Manhattan Beach, following his 
son, who worked for Douglas Aircraft. (His other son is a lieutenant colonel in 
the Air Force, stationed in Korea). Rodriguez and his wife have lived in 
California for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month he added the newest medal to his boxed collection, which hangs on 
the wall of his room. The velvet-lined case holds a silver star and medals for 
combat in Europe, including the battle of Verdun, France. He also holds medals 
for conspicuous service in World War II, and for being a crack shot with a 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Above the case of medals, hang frames containing letters wishing him a happy 
100th birthday -- from Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton, and from 
the governor of Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 An enlarged photo of his 1935 wedding in New York City hangs on another wall 
of his neat room. In the photo, Augustina clutches a bouquet of calla lilies 
and beams at her uniformed husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez says he's too old to do much traveling now, although he plans to 
keep up his daily walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always goes to check and see that Hawthorne Boulevard is still there, 
that's what he tells us," said one nurse.

 Standing behind the front counter of the Irvine planning department is quite 
an experience for city planner Glen Worthington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else besides a front counter can a planner talk to someone who is 
proposing a $1-million development project, and the next minute help a 
homeowner figure out how to turn a back-of-an-envelope sketch into a room 
addition?" Worthington wrote in a recent issue of Planning magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "And where else does a planner face the challenge of explaining with a 
straight face why the viewing of 'specified anatomical parts' requires a 
conditional-use permit, as I did once when reviewing a request for an adult 
theater?" he continued.

HEY, IT'S ONLY CLIPPERS (0-11); PRO BASKETBALL: BARKLEY RESTS UP WHILE ALL 10 
AVAILABLE SUNS SCORE IN DOUBLE FIGURES, 140-109.

 Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns, who has yet to play this season because 
of a pulled stomach muscle, said he felt well enough to play in Wednesday 
night's game against the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could play tonight, but I don't think they really need me against the 
Clips," Barkley said after undergoing accupressure treatment from a specialist 
in traditional Chinese medicine. "I'm saving it up for (San Antonio center) 
David Robinson Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Charles was right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns didn't need Barkley to beat the NBA's only winless team, building a 
39-point fourth-quarter lead en route to a 140-109 victory before a sellout of 
19,023 at the America West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played like we were on the road," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said after 
watching his club extend its season-opening losing streak to 11 games, six shy 
of the NBA record set by the expansion Miami Heat in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, who has maintained his composure throughout the losing streak, was 
upset after the Clippers allowed the shorthanded Suns, who were without guard 
Kevin Johnson (sore left knee), forward Wayman Tisdale (sprained left ankle) 
and Barkley, to score their highest point total in 10 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That thing right there," Fitch said, pointing at a reporter's tape recorder. 
"I could just take a bite out of it right now, I really could. For the first 
time I think losing is starting to affect them a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley feels for Fitch, the all-time leader in NBA coaching losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad for Bill Fitch," Barkley said. "He's a nice man, but he's going to 
have a long season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers will try for their first victory Friday afternoon, when they play 
the New Jersey Nets at the Sports Arena. The Clippers almost beat the Nets last 
Sunday at the Meadowlands, taking a 15-point lead before losing, 98-97. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Clipper Danny Manning had 15 points, six rebounds and two assists 
despite playing only five minutes in the second half as the Suns beat the 
Clippers for the seventh time in a row.  
</P>
<P>
 Guard Danny Ainge had 11 points, 12 assists and six rebounds. Rookie guard 
Trevor Ruffin, who was the Lakers' final cut, had 17 points, nine rebounds and 
five assists. All 10 Suns who played scored in double figures as Phoenix set an 
America West Arena record by shooting 64.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, who spent the first 5 1/2 seasons of his NBA career with the Clippers 
before being traded to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins last February, 
feels sorry for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of friends on that team and a lot of friends in the 
organization," Manning said. "(Losing is) not fun. We went through a lot of 
hard times when I first got there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns didn't take long to dispose of the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of an 18-0 run in the fourth quarter of Tuesday night's 105-93 loss to 
the Chicago Bulls, the Clippers were outscored, 15-0, in a 3:46 span of the 
first quarter as the Suns took a 36-23 lead. Phoenix led by 19 points at 
halftime and 34 points going into the final quarter. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lamond Murray, the Clippers' top draft pick, had a season-high 30 points, 
making 12 of 22 shots. Murray scored 21 points in the fourth quarter. . . . 
Former Clipper guard Ron Harper, now with the Chicago Bulls, presented 
expensive watches to Clipper trainer Keith Jones and equipment manager Pete 
Serrano before Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley, on the injured list because of a pulled stomach muscle, said 
his condition improved after visiting Cao Guoliang, a specialist in traditional 
Chinese medicine, who determined that his abdominal injury was caused by his 
chronically sore back. "It was amazing," said Barkley, who plans to visit the 
accupressurist twice a week for the rest of the season. "He was the doctor for 
the premier and the vice premier of China and now he's got the Chuckster."

SYLMAR PREVAILS IN OVERTIME; CITY 4-A PLAYOFFS: TOP-SEEDED SPARTANS FALL BEHIND 
BY 21, BUT DEFEAT BANNING IN A CALIFORNIA TIEBREAKER, 28-27. 
</P>

 It couldn't have ended in a stranger fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar High quarterback Gerrod Taylor's keeper for no gain on Wednesday night 
gave his team a 28-27 victory over Banning by California Tiebreaker in a City 
Section Division 4-A quarterfinal playoff game before an overflow crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Sylmar (12-0) overcame a 21-0 first-quarter deficit and tied it, 
27-27, on Durell Price's one-yard run with 3 minutes 18 seconds left in 
regulation. But Shaun Avalos' extra-point attempt sailed wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams traded possessions twice in the final three minutes, but neither 
could score. 
</P>
<P>
 In the California Tiebreaker, play starts at the 50 and teams trade 
possessions four times from the spot of the previous play. Whichever team has 
penetrated the other's territory after the eight plays is the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams made progress until Sylmar's Davon Young intercepted an Ira McKenna 
pass on Banning's third play. The ball was brought back to the line of 
scrimmage at the Banning 40. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sylmar's third play, Taylor ran 33 yards on a quarterback draw to the 
Banning seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Banning countered with a 42-yard pass play from McKenna to Eric Whitfield. 
With the ball at the Banning 49, all Sylmar had to do was maintain the line of 
scrimmage to win. And that's where Taylor laid it all on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my line to block and I'll do the rest," said Taylor, who was 
congratulated by several Banning players and coaches after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved Sylmar to the semifinals Dec. 2 against Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring was fast and furious for Banning in the first quarter. On the game's 
opening possession, Sylmar stuffed two Banning runs near the line of scrimmage. 
But on third and eight, McKenna faked a handoff to Dupree Tave and raced 64 
yards down the Banning sideline to the Sylmar eight before Young knocked him 
out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Lewis scored two plays later on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar went backward on its opening possession, which ended when punter Jeff 
Facer mishandled a snap and tried to run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilots' second and third possessions started inside the Sylmar 20 because 
of the fumbled punt attempt and an interception of a pass by Sylmar quarterback 
Greg Marquez. Banning capitalized on both for a 21-0 lead just 8 1/2 minutes 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But just when Sylmar fans fell silent for the first time all year, Taylor 
lifted their spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 He received a kickoff at the 20, ran through a host of tacklers at midfield 
and scored on an 80-yard return. And the comeback was on.

NEWSWIRE: HOLYFIELD CLEARED TO RESUME BOXING CAREER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Evander Holyfield, who was found to have a heart condition after his loss of 
the World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation titles to Michael 
Moorer last April, received medical clearance to resume boxing Wednesday from 
the Mayo Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, 32, is in "excellent health," said Mike O'Hara, a spokesman for the 
hospital in Rochester, Minn. "We have put no restrictions on his activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The former champion underwent extensive tests over three days, O'Hara said. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing a majority decision to Moorer on April 22, Holyfield was found to 
have a "stiff heart," a non-compliant left ventricle that prevents sufficient 
oxygen from being pumped to muscles and tissues. Holyfield, hospitalized for a 
few days after his loss to Moorer, announced his retirement April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Holyfield said he had been cured by a faith healer and was 
considering fighting again. Later that month, doctors at Crawford Long Hospital 
at Atlanta said they found some improvement in his heart condition. Hockey

 The NHL's executive committee, in its weekly labor update, was told an 
agreement with the players' union probably will not be reached on Friday, when 
negotiations resume in Boston. That makes starting the season Dec. 1 impossible 
and casts doubts on starting by Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty games remain on each club's schedule, but the league has outlined plans 
for 54- and 50-game seasons that would end around April 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Wayne Gretzky and Friends '94 Tour," expected to include later stops in 
Europe, will begin with a charity exhibition game against the International 
Hockey League's Detroit Vipers on Dec. 1 at the Palace of Auburn Hills. 
Proceeds will benefit retired NHL players and amateur hockey leagues in the 
Detroit area.

 Team owner Howard Baldwin, denying the NHL lockout has left his team short of 
cash, sold the Pittsburgh Penguins' broadcasting and merchandising rights to

 Didier Auriol became the first Frenchman to win a season's world rally title, 
but his triumph was tainted by allegations of sabotage in the final race, the 
RAC Rally at Chester, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Auriol, his title hopes in jeopardy, clinched the championship when Spanish 
driver Carlos Sainz crashed on the final day of the RAC. Spectators along the 
route allegedly placed logs in Sainz's path to ensure victory for Sainz's 
Subaru teammate, British driver Colin McRae, who was leading the race and went 
on to win.

OLDER IS BETTER IN THIS LAKER ROUT; PRO BASKETBALL: DIVAC AND CEBALLOS LEAD 
118-106 VICTORY OVER RELATIVELY YOUNG MAVERICKS AS L.A. REACHES .500. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of the few games that could make the Lakers, of all teams, feel old 
-- but not too old. 
</P>
<P>
 They played the role of graybeards Wednesday night against a Dallas team that 
averages only 24.5 years old, relying heavily on the Sunshine Boys to pull away 
in the fourth quarter of a 118-106 victory over the Mavericks before 11,124 at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlade Divac, 26, had nine of his team-high 27 points in the final period. 
Cedric Ceballos, 25, had 11 of his 24 during the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Score one for experience, or at least as close as the Lakers get. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two in a row," said Divac, who made 12 of 15 shots on the night and also had 
six rebounds and three blocks. "And we have an opportunity to beat all four 
teams we are going to play on the road. I think we are good enough to beat 
Washington, Atlanta, New Jersey and Cleveland. So far we have played better on 
the road than at home. There is more pressure at home." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also where the Lakers got well, recovering from several bad showings to 
beat the Cavaliers last Friday on Tony Smith's three-point bank at the buzzer 
and now the much-improved Mavericks. Nursed back to .500 with a four-game trip 
next up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the alternative," Coach Del Harris said of going to 5-5, "it's 
very important." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, who shot a season-best 55.7%, got a boost where they were hoping 
merely to hold the line. With Elden Campbell in Georgia for an uncle's funeral, 
Antonio Harvey went from averaging 9.5 minutes per game, the third-fewest on 
the team, to the opening lineup. He also went from almost being cut the day 
before the season to becoming the Lakers' fourth starting power forward in the 
first 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 All Harvey did was respond by collecting 16 points, tying his career high, 
eight rebounds and three blocked shots in 43 minutes, 33 fewer minutes than he 
had played all season before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antonio certainly played an outstanding game for us at both ends of the 
court," Harris said. "The 16 points was a bonus, because we wanted him for his 
defense and full-court game, his running." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harvey: "I was excited, not nervous. You practice on this game every day 
and you play as hard as you can play and things are going to happen the way 
they're going to happen. So I don't get nervous about playing this game 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a four-day break, their longest of the season, the Lakers fell 
behind by 10 points after 5 1/2 minutes but then recovered. They took the lead 
with 2:33 to go in the first quarter, and took control of the game while 
shooting 57.1% in the second period, going up, 63-48. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 63-50 at intermission, the Lakers' highest-scoring half of the season 
and a nice breakout after scoring 82 and 89 points the two games before and 
averaging 93 over the four previous outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers led by as many as 15 points in the third quarter but could not put 
away the Mavericks. The cushion was down to seven late in period, at 10 heading 
into the final quarter when Jason Kidd picked up a loose ball and hit a runner 
down the lane, and at eight with 10:42 left in the game. That's when Dallas 
fell off the pace finally, on the wrong end of a 10-0 run a few minutes later 
that made it 103-83. Laker Notes 
</P>

 Cedric Ceballos has been slowed by a painful left big toe, the result of an 
ingrown nail and infection. It was numb during last Friday's game against 
Cleveland after a visit to the doctor, but when the pain hit, he missed 
practice the next two days before returning Monday and Tuesday. "It hasn't 
changed since (Friday)," he said. "I thought I'd just start practicing. I 
didn't want to get out of shape." . . . Dallas' Jamal Mashburn led all scorers 
with 29 points, and teammate Jim Jackson added 27.

 Shaquille O'Neal scored 30 points and Anfernee Hardaway had 29 points, nine 
rebounds and a career-high seven steals Wednesday night to lead the Orlando 
Magic to a 117-94 victory over the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets at 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fifth in a row for the Magic. The Rockets lost for the 
second consecutive night after opening the season with nine victories in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try and make a statement every night, against every team," Orlando's Nick 
Anderson said after the Magic improved to 5-0 at home. "We try and protect our 
home court, but we want to go out and play every team like they are the champs 
-- not just when we play Houston." 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon led the Rockets with 27 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 113, Seattle 103 -- Jeff Hornacek made all eight of his three-point 
shots, breaking an NBA record, and scored a career-high 40 points to lead the 
Jazz at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 113, Chicago 111 -- Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf made a three-point shot with 2.2 
seconds to play to lift the Nuggets at Denver.

 B.J. Armstrong's 16-foot jumper had given the Bulls a 111-110 lead with 4.6 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 100, Cleveland 87 -- Glen Rice scored 30 points and sparked a 
third-quarter rally at Miami to help the Heat end a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Bimbo Coles added 19 points and 10 assists for the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 98, Charlotte 91 -- Dee Brown scored 24 points and the Celtics held on 
after leading by 26 late in the third quarter at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston overcame an outstanding performance by Alonzo Mourning, who had 36 
points, 12 rebounds and six blocks and helped the Hornets cut into the Celtics' 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 113, Milwaukee 108 -- Terry Mills had 24 points and 14 rebounds to 
lead the Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich.

second half and the Hawks survived a six-point second quarter at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta won consecutive games for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 110, Portland 105 -- Chuck Person of the Spurs made a three-point

 New Jersey 103, Sacramento 98 -- Armon Gilliam had 24 points and 10 rebounds

ESPERANZA STAYS CALM, COLLECTS A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Esperanza's water polo team had trailed Servite before, so the Aztecs weren't 
too worried. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind by three late in the second quarter, Esperanza gave up 
only one goal the rest of the way and came away with a 9-8 victory in the 
Southern Section Division II title game Wednesday at Belmont Plaza in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 8-8, Esperanza's Mike Stanley scored from two meters on 
the first play of the fourth quarter. It was the quarter's only goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Esperanza (21-7) won its second section title in three years. No. 2 
Servite (22-7) was making its first appearance in a final since it won the 2-A 
title in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The game had a certain familiarity to it. Esperanza and Servite played in a 
regular-season finale, and the Aztecs rallied from an 8-4 second-half deficit 
to win, 11-9. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Servite took a 7-4 lead with 1 minute 30 seconds left in the second 
quarter on a spectacular goal by Rob Mattivi. Mattivi took a pass into two 
meters, made two 360-degree turns to shake his defender and put in the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But Esperanza scored two quick goals on the counter attack in the last minute 
of the half. John Zinn scored with 33 seconds left and Stanley fired in a skip 
shot with 10 seconds left to make it 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza senior Jason Mericle said his team never doubted its ability to 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were able to come back the last time we played them," Mericle 
said. "That's the only thing that kept us in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mericle tied the score at 3:39 of the third quarter on another counter attack, 
and after Mattivi gave Servite its last lead a minute later, Mericle scored 
again from two meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite, which averaged 17 goals its first three playoff games, couldn't 
regain its offensive productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading scorer Jerry Smith struggled under the defensive pressure of Ben Breig 
and didn't score. Brian Heifferon scored three goals in the second quarter, but 
only got free for two shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite Coach Jim Sprague, who was coaching in his 14th section final, wasn't 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the ball into scoring position; we just didn't get the ball into the 
goal," said Sprague, who led Sunny Hills to four section titles. "That's 
probably the best goalie in the division, but he didn't hurt us. We hurt 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lange, the goalkeeper, had nine saves, including one on a close-range 
shot by Heifferon late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite had two chances to tie the score in the last minute, but turned the 
ball over on a breakaway and then couldn't get off a shot as time expired.

CORONA DEL MAR FALLS TO LONG BEACH WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corona del Mar versus Long Beach Wilson, the Southern Section Division I water 
polo title game that many envisioned, ended the way it seemed destined to -- by 
one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Wilson prevailed, 10-9, in front of 1,400 Wednesday night at 
Belmont Plaza, but the outcome wasn't certain until Wilson's Richard Westberg 
made a steal at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied nine times, but Keith Feldman's goal with 5 minutes 19 
seconds left in the fourth quarter gave the Bruins their final lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have gone either way, but that's how it has been all year," Wilson 
Coach Ricardo Azevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams had met four times this season, with each team winning twice. Three 
of the games were decided by one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings (22-5) appeared to have gained a little control early in the 
third quarter, taking a 9-7 lead, the only two-goal margin in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam McFarland, who scored four goals, put the Sea Kings ahead, 8-7, with 5:35 
left in the quarter and then Jeff Marchiorlatti scored at 5:19. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's Pat Cochran scored the next two goals, including a shot from six 
meters with 49 seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran, a senior who has more than 400 goals in his four-year career, scored 
four goals and junior Adam Wright scored three for Wilson (24-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "Adam Wright and Pat Cochran played very well," Corona del Mar Coach John 
Vargas said. "We knew coming in that we had to stop those guys and we didn't. 
That was the difference in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem for the Sea Kings was their offense for most of the second 
half. Wilson forced 12 of the Sea Kings 22 turnovers in the half, and the 
Bruins' sophomore goalkeeper Nicholas Hill made four saves in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Matt Aramato had six steals, including one that stopped a crucial Sea 
King possession with 1:27 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings had several chances to tie in the last several minutes, but 
their final good opportunity ended with a turnover with 50 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar got the ball back with 13 seconds left and called timeout at 
three seconds, but goalkeeper Doug Jetton's long pass was stolen Westberg an 
instant before time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive season Corona del Mar lost in the final, 10-9. 
El Toro won in overtime last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we played a good game but they were better," said Vargas, coaching in 
his eighth final in 12 seasons at Corona del Mar. "I don't have a problem with 
the way the guys played. I have a problem with the outcome."

NO. 1 BREA LOSES TITLE TO ROWLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-seeded Brea-Olinda came into the Division VI championship game with a 5.00 
goals-against average, but Rowland Heights Rowland didn't seem too impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats gave up more than that and lost to third-seeded Rowland, 11-8, 
Wednesday at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda (25-5) was seeking its first Southern Section boys' title in six 
years after finishing the regular season atop the Division VI standings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Wildcats will have to settle for second-best, even though they 
did break a school record for victories in a season and advanced to the 
semifinals for the first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a few scoring chances we didn't convert on," Brea-Olinda Coach Dave 
Wright said. "The major factor was on offense, they got it done and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 3-3, after the opening quarter, but Rowland took the lead 
in the second quarter and never let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mineo, who scored a game-high four goals, converted on a two-man 
advantage a minute into the quarter and then backhanded a shot past Tim Beschel 
at 3:22 for a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Flesher cut the lead to one with 2:08 left in the half and the Wildcats 
had a chance to tie on the next possession, but an offensive foul forced them 
to give the ball to Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (24-6) took advantage and scored on a pass from Tony Grosso to 
Kenny Clements to take a 6-4 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Mineo used the backhand move again to beat Beschel and Rowland increased its 
lead to 8-5 with 2:52 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda followed with a goal from Eric Matthews and another from Tad 
Murphy 21 seconds later as the Wildcats cut the Raider lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, the Orange League most valuable player, was held to three goals, 
including one over the final three quarters.

INTERCEPTION RETURN ON LAST PLAY BEATS TAFT; CITY 4-A FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS: 
TOREADORS BLOW 13-POINT FOURTH-QUARTER LEAD AND FALL TO DORSEY, 26-20. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seemed almost too cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft High football team was granted a reprieve in Wednesday's City Section 
4-A Division playoff quarterfinal when the Dorsey kicker missed a tiebreaking 
extra-point attempt with 34 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreadors recovered the subsequent onside kick -- a victory in itself -- 
and overtime appeared a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft gingerly attempted to move the ball into field-goal range, but Dons 
defensive back Antwain Wilson intercepted a pass by Dayon Shaw and raced 
untouched down the sideline for a 65-yard touchdown as time expired, and the 
Toreadors lost, 26-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the defeat more painful was the fact that Taft (10-2) allowed three 
touchdowns in the game's final four minutes after taking a 20-7 lead with only 
five minutes to play. Take into account that it was the second consecutive 
season the Toreadors lost to Dorsey in the playoffs, and it was all too clear 
how deep Taft's heartache ran. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dream just went down the drain," Taft lineman Edwin Preza said. "It was 
time for people to step up and show their character. We just couldn't pull it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey (10-2) advances to the semifinals next week against Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft appeared to have the game well in hand after scoring two touchdowns in 
the fourth quarter to take a 20-7 lead. The first came on a 23-yard pass from 
Shaw to running back Dion Gaston on a third-down play. Taft missed the extra 
point and led, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dorsey's next play, quarterback Roderick Brown fumbled the exchange and 
Toreador lineman Juan Madera recovered at the Dons' 18-yard line. Two plays 
later, Shaw ran 16 yards on a bootleg for the touchdown, and Gaston ran in the 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Taft players relished the thought of avenging last season's 33-7 loss 
to Dorsey, the Dons struck quickly. They needed only three plays to score after 
Raymont Skaggs returned the kickoff 43 yards, cutting the lead to six points on 
a 25-yard pass from Brown to eventual hero Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came what has proved the bane of Taft -- the onside kick. For the third 
time in two playoff games, the Toreadors were unable to recover the squib kick, 
and Dorsey took over at the 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't get a bounce," Preza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine plays later, Dorsey's Brown scored on a three-yard keeper. Raul Menjivar 
missed the extra point to keep the score tied. 
</P>
<P>
 But the flub turned out not to matter. Taft recovered the onside kick at its 
own 44-yard line with 34 seconds to play and hurriedly tried to get in position 
to kick a winning field goal. Shaw took a snap from the 50 with 10 seconds to 
play. He tried one last pass, a sideline route to receiver DaShon Polk, but 
overthrew him, right into the chest of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson bobbled the ball, grabbed it, then raced untouched up the sideline to 
end the contest in shocking fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life," Wilson said 
while standing in the middle of a jubilant crowd. "I told the guys, 'Never get 
your head down, because anything can happen' -- as you can see."

BIRMINGHAM FINDS ITS PRINCE IN VICTORY OVER MONROE; CITY 3-A PLAYOFFS: 
QUARTERBACK'S FEW PASSES OVERSHADOW RUSHING STARS.

 On a field filled with dangerous runners, the spirals of Paul Prince put an 
improbable spin on Birmingham High's 20-12 victory over host Monroe on 
Wednesday night in the quarterfinals of the City Section 3-A Division football 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Birmingham quarterback completed three of five passes, one for a 
touchdown, another setting up a score.Prince's measly 75 yards passing 
overshadowed two running backs -- Monroe's Nick Nuccitelli and Birmingham's 
Courtney Blunt -- who each came into the game with more than 1,200 yards 
rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to key on Blunt, and that left (fullback Marvin) Powell and the 
receivers wide open," said Prince, who has thrown for 1,025 yards and eight 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew the play-action passes and bootlegs would work. And our defense 
stepped up." 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt was held to 66 yards in 19 carries. But three other Birmingham backs 
rushed for 178 yards in 12 carries, an average of 14.8. Powell led the way with 
101 yards in six carries, including a 52-yard scoring burst in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuccitelli rushed for 125 yards and both Monroe touchdowns in 20 carries to 
finish with 1,767 yards and 20 touchdowns. But he said his team wasn't 
prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two days is not enough time to prepare for a playoff game," he said. "Both 
teams played sloppy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (6-6) pounded straight ahead seven times on their first possession 
before Nuccitelli ran 43 yards for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince hit Jason Howard with a 37-yard pass to tie the score and found Lavon 
Rocket on a 34-yard pass play that set up a three-yard run by Blunt to give 
Birmingham (6-5-1) a 13-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuccitelli's 17-yard run in the third quarter narrowed the gap to 13-12 before 
Powell's long run clinched the victory.

CLEVELAND HAUNTED BY DEFEAT; CITY 3-A PLAYOFFS: OFFICIALS WIPE OUT TOUCHDOWN 
AND TWO-POINT CONVERSION IN 21-14 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sure, Cleveland High made a remarkable turnaround this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers rebounded from a 1993 campaign in which they won only one game 
and advanced to the playoffs this year for the first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now the players are haunted by the missed opportunities in a 21-14 
loss to Manual Arts in a City Section 3-A Division quarterfinal at Gardena High 
on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's last gasp ended when Russell Burwell was tackled at the Manual 
Arts' 20-yard line on a fourth-down play. Burwell (50 yards in 10 carries) was 
six yards short of a first down after gaining 13 yards with one minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the missed chances were the result of rulings by officials. Twice, in 
fact, penalties took points off the scoreboard for Cleveland (6-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Johnny Lopez threw an 18-yard pass to Alex Kalinowski in the 
second quarter for an apparent touchdown. However, an official threw a late 
flag on Lopez for crossing the line of scrimmage before throwing the pass and 
the score was nullified. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive eventually stalled at the Manual Arts 13-yard line when Lopez was 
sacked on a fourth-and-goal play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Cleveland tied the score, 14-14, on Burwell's 28-yard 
touchdown run. Damon Williams was ruled by one official to have scored on a 
two-point conversion run, but the officials conferred and overturned the call, 
ruling that Williams was stopped just short of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds like sour grapes, but I'm angry right now," Cleveland Coach 
Joe Santellano said. "These guys (refs) are paid to see things that they just 
didn't see. It's frustrating and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts (8-4) drove 61 yards in nine plays for the winning score, a 
15-yard pass from John Hildred to Lavar Mahony on the final play of the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland attempted two rallies in the final minutes. One drive ended when 
Lopez, who completed 12 of 19 passes for 120 yards, threw an interception in 
the end zone with less than five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland then forced a Manual Arts punt and took over on the Toilers' 44. The 
Cavaliers drove to the 23, but two incomplete passes and a quarterback sack 
stalled the drive.

 Dorsey 26, Woodland Hills Taft 20 -- Trailing, 20-7, with five minutes to 
play, Dorsey (10-2) rallied for the 4-A victory at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey tied the score at 20-20 with 34 seconds remaining but missed the 
extra-point attempt. The Dons then tried an onside kick, but Taft recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to get Taft (10-2) into field-goal range, Dayon Shaw had his pass 
intercepted by Dorsey's Antwain Wilson, who raced untouched down the sideline 
for a 65-yard touchdown as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar 28, Wilmington Banning 27 -- Top-seeded Sylmar (12-0) overcame a 21-0 
first-quarter deficit and won in overtime over the Pilots (6-5-1) after tying 
the score at 27-27 on Durell Price's one-yard run with 3:18 to play in 
regulation in a 4-A game at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerrod Taylor's quarterback keeper for no gain from the Banning 49 gave Sylmar 
a victory by California tiebreaker, in which play starts at the 50 and teams 
trade possessions four times from the spot of the previous play and whichever 
team has penetrated the other's territory after the eight plays is the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw 33, San Pedro 6 -- Crenshaw running backs Brandon Seales and Farrel 
Payton combined for 252 yards and five touchdowns as the Cougars (11-1) 
defeated the Pirates (7-5) in a 4-A game at Fremont High. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson 27, Washington 11 -- Arlin Slayton rushed for 157 yards and scored two 
touchdowns to lead the Mules (10-2) to a 3-A victory over Washington (5-7) at 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell 29, Venice 3 -- Vern Benard and Juan Diaz rushed for two touchdowns each 
to lift Bell (9-3) in a 3-A game at Bell. Benard had 101 yards in 16 carries 
and Diaz gained 70 yards in nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell quarterback Gus Valenzuela completed nine of 17 passes for 133 yards and 
a touchdown to help the Eagles advance to the semifinals for the first time 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Birmingham 20, North Hills Monroe 12 -- Paul Prince completed only 
three of five passes, but two of them went for touchdowns as Birmingham (6-5-1) 
held on in a 3-A game at Monroe (6-6). 
</P>
<P>
 The game was expected to be a battle of running backs, with 1,000-yard rushers 
Nick Nucciteeli of Monroe and Courtney Blunt of Birmingham doing battle. But 
Prince stole the show with a pair of touchdown passes that increased his season 
total to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts 21, Reseda Cleveland 14 -- John Hildred's 15-yard touchdown pass 
to Lavar Mahony in the third quarter gave Manual Arts (8-4) the lead for good 
in a 3-A game at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland ended the season at 6-6.

<TEXT>
<P>
 While its high-powered offense remained off the field for most of the game, 
Carson High used its defense to defeat South Gate, 21-13, Wednesday night at 
South Gate in the quarterfinals of the City Section Division 4-A football 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring on its first two possessions, South Gate (10-2) successfully 
controlled the clock, but failed to score five times inside the 25-yard 
line.The Rams missed field-goal attempts of 40 and 28 yards in the second half. 
They also had a pass intercepted in the end zone during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Redmond, who rushed for 94 yards in 15 carries, scored on a four-yard 
run to put Carson ahead, 14-13, in the second quarter. Quarterback Ramon 
Rodgers scored on a 12-yard scramble to give the Colts an eight-point lead with 
11 minutes to play in third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate running back Hoffman Cortes did most of the work, rushing for 266 
yards and a touchdown in 30 carries. His 82-yard touchdown run in the first 
quarter gave South Gate a 13-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our opportunities, but we didn't get the ball in (the end zone)," 
South Gate Coach Gary Cordray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson (4-8) qualified for the playoffs despite forfeiting three games for 
using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm elated to win because of all the controversy we've been through," Carson 
Coach David Williams said. "It's time to move forward." SEAN WATERS

HOLLYWOOD PARK; VALENZUELA ENDS SUSPENSION WITH RETURN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela, who hasn't ridden since Oct. 6, returns from suspension today, 
named on three horses at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, 32, rode the first two days of the Oak Tree meeting at Santa 
Anita, then took off his mounts Oct. 7 and was scheduled to ride Alex The Great 
in the Turf Classic at Belmont Park for trainer Rodney Rash on Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The jockey, who has had previous substance-abuse problems, went to New York 
but called the Belmont Park stewards and said he was ill and couldn't ride. 
</P>
<P>
 That set off a chain of events that ended in Valenzuela's being suspended 
indefinitely by the Oak Tree stewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Then that ruling was set aside after the jockey had met with the stewards and 
he was handed a 20-day suspension, which ended Wednesday. Since Nov. 13, 
Valenzuela had been allowed to work horses in the morning at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 If morning-line maker Russell Hudak is right, Valenzuela will return with a 
winner. He is aboard 8-5 favorite Preferred Road in the fourth race. His two 
other mounts are longshots, 8-1 outsider Snow Major in the sixth and 30-1 shot 
Ataboy Chad in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Uncaged Fury, who won the California Cup Sprint by a head over longshot Ke 
Express, is the 2-1 favorite in the $100,000 On Trust Handicap today at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3-year-old gelded son of Kleven, Uncaged Fury hasn't been worse than second 
in six starts and earned the first of his four victories in his initial start 
on June 17 at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Pete Fer and trained by Lewis Cenicola, Uncaged Fury has returned 
with three good workouts at Santa Anita since the victory and will again be 
ridden by Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 Restricted to California breds, the On Trust, which is run at 7 1/2 furlongs, 
attracted nine other entrants, among them defending champion Echo Of Yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 5-year-old Pirate's Bounty gelding, Echo Of Yesterday has never lost in 
three starts at Hollywood Park and all of the victories have been at the On 
Trust distance. The 5-2 second choice will be handled by Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the other challengers is J.F. Williams, who had a lot of trouble in 
finishing fifth in the Cal Cup Sprint and who has always been most effective at 
Hollywood Park. Six of his seven victories have been at the Inglewood track. 
Laffit Pincay will ride for trainer Ron McAnally. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field includes Hill Pass, Evil Wizard, Softshoe Sure Shot, 
Bossanova, Subtle Trouble, Goldigger's Dream and Arp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Randy Romero, three-time Breeders' Cup winner who retired on July 4, 
plans to return to action next Wednesday. "I didn't want to retire," said 
Romero, 36, who had worked as a bloodstock agent in recent months. "The reason 
I did it was because my knee was bothering me. I had an operation on (his right 
knee) in December and I rushed it coming back. It was my fault and when I got 
ready to ride, it started bothering me more and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I could make myself have another operation was to quit, so I did 
that. I got my knee cleaned up with arthroscopic surgery by a doctor from the 
University of Kentucky and I worked out with (the basketball team) there. It 
was really fun and I decided I wanted to go back (to riding). I told my wife, 
'I want to go back and I want to go to California.' She said, 'Go for it,' so 
here I am." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His Legacy, the only three-time winner in the California Cup, has been retired 
after pulling up sore after a workout last weekend at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Pete Parrella's Legacy Ranch and trained by Dave Hofmans, the 
9-year-old gelding finished his career in style, winning the Cal Cup Starter 
Handicap for the third time on Oct. 29. He finished his career with 14 
victories in 46 starts and earned nearly $421,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say?" Hofmans said. "He's what racing is all about. We'll miss 
him." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Post time today will be at 11:15 a.m., 75 minutes earlier than usual. There 
will also be a special 4 p.m. post Friday, when 13 live races are carded, six 
of them maiden races. . . . Strodes Creek, who hasn't run since finishing third 
in the Belmont Stakes, worked a mile in 1:38 3/5 Wednesday morning. Romarin, 
who will take on Slew of Damascus in the Hollywood Mile on Sunday, went five 
furlongs in 1:02 2/5. . . . Alywow, one of 10 probable starters for Sunday's 
$400,000 Matriarch, worked five furlongs on the grass in 1:00 4/5 Wednesday 
morning. Alywow was second to Raintrap in last month's Rothmans International.

rebounds as Glendale College improved to 4-0 with an 88-78 nonconference 
victory over Citrus on Wednesday night at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, a graduate of Eagle Rock High, made 10 of 14 field-goal attempts and

<P>
 Yoshimura enters his second season with possibly even more strife than his 
first. Like last year, he has to replace all five starters again, but this time 
he doesn't have 11 seniors to choose from as replacements. "We have to replace 
88% of our scoring, 87% of our rebounding and 87% of our assists," Yoshimura 
said. "And we have little varsity experience." Adding to Valencia's woes, two 
of Yoshimura's returning players--Gray and Secoda--are busy with football 
playoffs. Gray (5.2 points) and Secoda (1.1) are being counted on to become the 
team's main scorers. Hoping to ease the burden is Gamboa, a transfer from El 
Dorado. "A real slasher," Yoshimura said of Gamboa. "When the game starts, he's 
real tough and doesn't back down. He will get minutes." To win the league title 
again would border on miraculous, but the playoffs are a realistic goal. Still, 
Yoshimura--like a couple of other Orange League coaches--may need all of the 
nonleague games to figure out what works. SCHEDULE

 The Rebels could be quite good if two key players can return from injuries. 
Nguyen, a first team all-league selection (and the only such honoree from the 
Orange League to return), had back problems that forced him to miss the summer 
league games. But Snider says the recovery has been "almost miraculous; he's 
now practicing at or near full speed." Dougan sustained a broken leg last June. 
"The cast came off in November and he's a bit overweight because he couldn't 
move around," Snider said. "But the shooting touch is still there." As it is, 
the Savanna roster is experienced--10 seniors--and strong; at least five 
players bench press 250 pounds or more. There's another "X" factor; Long Beach 
Jordan 6-4 transfer Lee Myers. "He's raw, but he's extremely gifted and can run 
like the wind," Snider said. "He can be an impact player, but it may take until 
league before he's comfortable." SCHEDULE

 Lloyd's return to the Wildcats last season after a seven-year absence was less 
than triumphant--he took over the coaching chores Sept. 1 and in essence never 
caught up. But while Brea is still probably a year away, Lloyd vows this season 
will be different. "The kids know me, I know them, and we're bigger, stronger, 
quicker and hopefully more skilled," he said. "Now we have to put it together. 
In our league the team that puts it together best is the winner because the 
talent is evenly spread." Heredia (5.9 points) and Bodiford (10.2), two 
all-league honorable mentions last season, run the backcourt and the team. But 
how far Brea goes may depend on how quickly Reff and Collier develop. If they 
don't to Lloyd's satisfaction, he'll probably go with smaller, quicker players. 
For now, Lloyd doesn't want to look beyond earning a playoff spot. But winning 
10 games would give Lloyd 250 career victories. SCHEDULE

 After 10 years of struggling to build a lasting program here, Conrad Byars 
left Anaheim for Western High. In his stead, first year coach Castellanos will 
try and figure out how to make the Colonists more than just competitive. He 
inherits a team that won three league contests last season. Add in the fact 
Anaheim has no dominating player, and it's easy to see what could lie ahead. 
"We're going to play hard," said Castellanos, who was previously an assistant 
for two years at Loara. "We've got tough kids, and they're coachable. But we're 
in a tough predicament; we just got our new gym floor put in. We had limited 
summer practices. I'm going with man-to-man defense and a motion offense, but 
the kids need time to learn it. I'll have a better idea by league what we have, 
and I think we could surprise people. But they have to learn the system first. 
Right now the goal is to play hard and smart." Which is another way of saying 
wait until next season. But expect the Colonists to keep giving everyone a 
battle as they have in the past. SCHEDULE

THEATER REVIEW; AN OFFBEAT YET TOUCHING SEASON'S 'GREETINGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dysfunctional families and their salvation have been a staple of Christmas 
stories from the Scrooges on up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gorskis fit neatly into the pattern. Papa Phil is angry at his life. Mama 
Emily is angry at the loss of the happy young ballplayer she married. Son Andy 
is riddled with guilt over his father's lifelong inability to admit any love 
for his family. The only happy Gorski is son Mickey. He's mentally challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mickey holds a winning card none of the others hold -- the solution to the 
family disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second year in a row, Way Off Broadway is presenting Tom Dudzick's 
"Greetings," a way offbeat comedy that, though it sometimes looks like a 
sitcom, develops into an entrancing, literate and life-affirming testament to 
the indestructibility of the human spirit. It also makes a strong case for some 
of the metaphysical reasons we're all here to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, Mickey, who has never been able to form words, looks at his mother 
and says, "Greetings." The word is the opening salvo of a decisive visit by a 
soul entity, channeled through Mickey's subconscious, to correct some of the 
errors made by Mickey's loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, sometimes predictable and sometimes startling, is handled 
intelligently and affectionately by director Tony Reverditto. The pace is brisk 
but never neglects to pause when a heart tug is ready to hit home. Reverditto 
never lets it get maudlin, though, and balances the very basic seriousness with 
gentle comic and insightful cosmic touches. 
</P>
<P>
 If David Rousseve constantly pushes Phil's anger and bitterness, there is 
still an evident softness behind the pain, a warm touch of tough love that 
helps round out his character. As Andy, an advertising writer, David Walloch 
alternates between the son's just-as-bitter resentment of his father's attitude 
and a breezy attempt to make his family look fairly bland for the sake of his 
fiancee, Randi, an affecting and calming Denison Glass. 
</P>
<P>
 The richness and depth in Reverditto's staging, however, is mainly brought 
about through the fine performances of Karen Mangano as the mother, and David 
Alan Nelson as Mickey. Mangano's long-suffering Emily is maintained by a subtle 
and offhand sense of humor, and Mangano has a vulnerability that gives deep 
shading to a difficult role. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's Mickey is an impeccably shaped portrait, from the joyously buoyant 
giddiness, without any trace of condescension, of the earthly Mickey, to the 
highly evolved, intellectually superior aura of the spirit he has summoned 
through his subconscious. It's a Christmas gift of a performance. 
</P>

FAMILY; DESPITE HOLIDAY SPIRIT, GOLDILOCKS GETS A BIT LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever wonder what happens to fairy-tale characters after the last page is 
turned? 
</P>
<P>
 Take Goldilocks. Here's a kid who barges into a home, destroys the family's 
furniture and slurps their breakfast. Then, when caught, she doesn't even have 
the decency to apologize before skipping into the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 That's it ? Does this flaxen-haired felon get off scot-free? Does Goldi get 
sent up the river for breaking and entering? Do the bears decide the forest is 
full of wackos and move to a gated community? 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Harder has her thoughts on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goldilocks and the Christmas Bears," a one-act musical, will be presented 
through Dec. 18 by the Orange-based Broadway on Tour children's theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapped in a 1950s setting, the play finds Goldilocks returning to the forest 
at Christmastime to make up with the bears but ends up involving all the 
woodland creatures in her holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an admirable premise played out by likable characters but, like 
Goldilocks herself, it tends to wander. 
</P>
<P>
 Harder has a hard time determining who the primary characters in this play 
are, and the '50s jargon is initially entertaining, but ultimately wears thin. 
Director Dan Halkyard's addition of '50s and Christmas pop standards to 
Harder's score is carried off well by the cast, but at times the segues are 
awkward and slow the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of this bothered the kids at Saturday's show. The crowd, which 
looked to be mostly preschoolers through second- or third-graders, stayed tuned 
in from the first doo-wop to the curtain call -- aided by the show's frequent 
audience-participation bits and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Halkyard leads the cast nicely as Papa Bear. A veteran community theater 
actor, Halkyard supports his 6- to 15-year-old cast with obvious ease, playing 
it large when it's right and stepping back when it's not. The bear family works 
well as a unit, rounded out by Kim Cohen's fuss-budget Mama Bear and Ashlee 
Gillespie's bull-headed Baby Bear. Their pre-hibernation rendition of "Good 
Night, Sweetheart" is one of the show's high points. 
</P>
<P>
 Halkyard has put together a strong ensemble to play the bears' neighbors, each 
bringing something distinct to the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal Dancer plays Southern belle Rock'n Robin with a languid petulance, a 
fine foil for the industrious Ms. Squirrel, played with squinty-eyed comic 
fervor by Wendy Holden. Loren Wildish's Fonzie J. Fox is as cool as they come, 
and Nicholas McKim (who was a smashing Mr. Smee in Broadway on Tour's "Peter 
Pan" earlier this year) is a wonderfully neurotic Mr. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the supporting roles in this play get so much attention, Goldilocks' 
part seems almost an afterthought by the time she arrives late in the show. 
Bedecked in bobbing ringlets and a wide-eyed expression, Kelly Hanenberg is a 
relentlessly cheery repentant, determined to give the bears their holiday due 
whether they like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Though adequately danced by the cast, the musical numbers don't always work; 
many seem to be shoe-horned in for the sake of the '50s theme. Although meant 
to be cozy, a slow-paced delivery of "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" 
was an unnecessary drag near the show's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Gillespie's costumes were delightful, especially the bears' 
teddy-bearish heads and feet and Robin's feathery crimson topknot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Huber's single set was colorful and workable; the bears' individually sized 
wall peepholes were an endearing touch. Practical, too. With a kid like 
Goldilocks on the prowl, it's smart to have a good surveillance system. 
</P>

ART REVIEWS; 'SINCERITY' FOCUSES ON BEAUTY, BUT NOT WITHOUT IRONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the myriad offerings of "LAX/94," the biennial survey of Los 
Angeles-based art currently at a variety of area venues, is a large, group show 
at Otis Art Gallery called "Sincerity and Other Peccadillos." The title is 
provocative, if misleading. Lumping sincerity in with unspecified peccadilloes 
is meant to imply that in the context of 1990s art, sincerity is a slight 
offense, somehow off-color and therefore quite daring. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, sincerity is increasingly to the '90s what irony was to the '80s: 
ubiquitous, and all but obligatory. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, sincerity appears in art in various guises. Among them is the 
much-heralded "return" of beauty (which begs the question of when beauty was 
ever truly out of style), and the plethora of installations and objects 
gathered under the rubric of "identity politics" -- the half-accusatory, 
half-celebratory embrace of autobiography as art. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerity, of course, goes hand-in-hand with authenticity. Too often, though, 
they kiss criticality goodby -- and with it the possibility for a truly 
political art. 
</P>
<P>
 Curator Anne Ayres notes that the artists she has selected are "in retreat . . 
. from complex media-based critique" -- another way of saying that they have no 
use for the theoretically informed challenges mounted in the last two decades 
by feminists and others to a hegemonic, patriarchal and racist establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meant to augur a breath of fresh air, the retreat is in fact nonsensical in 
this context. Most of the artists display a knowing wit, a smart-alecky charm 
and a penchant for irony unvanquished by the years or by the art world's 
incessant trend-mongering. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the ironists are Martin Kersels, who projects on a plastic lid a Super 8 
film of himself swinging back and forth, again and again, to the music of Cheap 
Trick -- a witty allegory about the tiresome nature of the liberated artist; 
Robert Gunderman, whose painting "Probably My Happiest Day Ever: Square Sun" is 
a classic of faux-patheticism; and Tyler Stallings, whose mixed-media ode to 
fashion in technology, "Most Beautiful Cyborgs," features home-sewn astronaut 
suits customized to match responses to an absurd questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 A very tenuous connection exists among these three artists. But however 
appealing, the show's other works refuse to hang together. 
</P>
<P>
 The dense, lapidary paintings of Monica Majoli and the fabulously over-the-top 
rubber concoctions of Jacci Den Hartog continue to stand out in any context in 
which they are placed. But they work in spite of their context, which is 
unusually and unproductively contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Otis Art Gallery, 2401 Wilshire Blvd., (213) 251-0555, through Jan. 14. 
Closed Sundays and Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 Doodling Everything: Russell Crotty is the Ur -doodler of our time, someone 
who can turn a mindless preoccupation, performed in a semiconscious haze, into 
something akin to a religion. His obsessiveness is a fine and awesome thing to 
behold. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, Crotty has been producing grids of up to thousands of tiny 
images, each one scrawled in ball-point pen. These are intensely focused and 
slapdash at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known are his multitudinous surfers, triumphantly riding waves or 
ignominiously wiping out, each tiny image a spiraling line jammed into a 
horizontal pile, or a zigging mark zagging right out of its allotted spot, like 
a libidinous jolt of inky energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Crotty's new work, which inaugurates the Dan Bernier Gallery, turns from the 
ocean to the stars, toward Mars, Jupiter and Venus. Crotty's astronomical 
observations have produced the artist's usual, ample yield. 
</P>
<P>
 These include rhythmic grids and stacks of ink and tinted gesso drawings of 
the planets, seen in different lights, from different angles and at different 
focal lengths. Each image is both a relic of what is seen and an emblem of what 
can never be known, for a technologically assisted view is inconclusive at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 Crotty's work aligns with a particular strain of 1970s Conceptualism, which 
purportedly recorded everything about everything. In this vein are Ed Ruscha's 
"Every Building on the Sunset Strip" and Douglas Huebler's plan to photograph 
everyone alive. 
</P>
<P>
 These artists were making a point about the fallacy of objectivity and 
totalizing systems. Crotty is onto something quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 He is mesmerized not by ideas, but by things. This lends his work a certain 
naivete completely at odds with Ruscha's and Huebler's cynicism, as well as a 
formula for a self-sustaining system that just could prove them wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dan Bernier Gallery, 3026 1/2 Nebraska Ave., Santa Monica, (310) 264-4482, 
through Dec. 10. Closed Sundays and Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 Stretching It: "Minus Equals Plus," Patrizia Giambi's installation at Shoshana 
Wayne Gallery, is laconic, elegant and probably about something. What that is, 
however, remains disappointingly muddled. 
</P>
<P>
 Each piece in the show is composed of a single long, thick rubber band, 
stretched between a pair of steel clamps affixed to the gallery wall or floor. 
Sometimes the rubber band is aligned along the horizontal axis, sometimes the 
vertical. Each band is a different, primary color and stamped repeatedly with 
one word: space , time , male , female , law or beauty . 
</P>
<P>
 The work plays out a familiar Minimalist idiom: These are simple, geometric 
structures presented in serial form. The words themselves form additional 
serial subsets, and Giambi selects them very deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
 Each relates to a category of measure, a code of conduct, a mode of 
classification or a system of logic. As Minimalism itself enshrines a rigorous 
and exclusionary logic, Giambi seems poised to offer some kind of critique. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet none is forthcoming. Giambi could have stretched the rubber bands to an 
unendurable point of tautness, as if to suggest that a breaking point was 
inevitable. But the rubber bands are slack -- much like the work. 
</P>
<P>
 One piece in the show is different from the others. It consists of nine bands 
hanging from metal hooks, each band marked to resemble a tape measure, extended 
to 41 inches. The piece pivots on the understanding that though ostensibly 
identical, each band could be stretched to a different length while continuing 
to assert its identity with the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Giambi manages to suggest the arbitrary, eminently unstable nature of 
truth. Her take on elasticity recalls a well-known work by Robert Morris, but 
this doesn't detract from its strength. It merely offers a well-tested 
precedent for Giambi's inquiry into Minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shoshana Wayne Gallery, Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan Ave., Santa Monica, 
(310) 453-7535, through Dec. 3. Closed Sundays and Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 All in the Vision: Michael Norton's small landscape paintings are executed in 
egg tempera on wood panel. This venerated technique, most familiar from Early 
Renaissance painting, is uncommon today. It might be construed as an antique 
affectation, except that pretentiousness makes no sense when one is speaking of 
affectless painting. 
</P>
<P>
 The colors of Norton's five paintings at ACME Gallery are muted (golds, 
umbers, mauves and blues), and their surfaces are flat. Swirling strokes, short 
and choppy marks, and the feathery edges of the brush are visible; but stripped 
of all texture. There are only cool notations or impassive descriptions of 
forests, skies and mountains: a horizon line, a hint of darkness suggesting a 
clump of trees, a burst of light denoting dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is specified. This makes the images seductively blank. Like any 
vacuum, they draw everything around them inside. 
</P>
<P>
 In the space of an instant, they become bloated with meanings and metaphors. 
They are dreams, which seem to fade upon consciousness, or Proustian memories 
that come suddenly, startlingly into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not landscapes at all, but allegories of vision and, like all systems 
of knowledge, only deceptively trustworthy. Yet mostly, these very beautiful 
paintings are icons of the recalcitrant romantic sensibility of the viewer. The 
artist may or may not be similarly besotted. 
</P>

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: WE WON'T LET SEASON CATCH YOU OFF GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, that is Santa Claus you saw on the cover. And, yes, this is the holiday 
edition of Ventura Life. I know, you haven't even gotten the Thanksgiving meal 
out of the oven let alone onto the table, and here we are dumping you right 
into holiday music and plum pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 For readers who observe Hanukkah, this edition might be considered a blessing. 
Or it could just be considered late, since the holiday, which runs according to 
the Jewish calendar, shows up early on this year's Gregorian calendar -- Monday 
evening the first candles will be lit. 
</P>
<P>
 But readers who celebrate Christmas -- especially those poor souls who think 
they can sort of creep up on the season and find it, warm, welcoming, 
gift-wrapped and ready to go -- may feel they are being held hostage by an 
early preoccupation with holiday hysteria. Don't panic, we really are here to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year the Christmas season seems to come upon us earlier and earlier," 
said free-lance writer Leo Smith, who wrote the cover story for this issue. 
"Yet the fact that we all know it's coming makes no difference. Hordes of us 
are still rushing around at the last minute, going crazy buying gifts, making 
food and trying to pull the holiday together." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Smith and the rest of us at Ventura County Life thought that 
besides providing a vast array of information on where to go and what to do 
this holiday season, we would offer a centerpiece story specifically for the 
terminally frazzled, a story that would provide timesaving tips to help readers 
enjoy rather than suffer through the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big countdown used to be the number of shopping days left before 
Christmas," said Smith, "but with the hectic lifestyle led by the average 
person nowadays, it comes down to the number of minutes left." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides helping you get in and stay in a festive mood, Smith's story provides 
a list of people and services that will, for a fee, do some of those holiday 
tasks that tend to put a hum at the end of your ho ho ho. The story may also 
revive the entrepreneurial as well as the holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the guys I interviewed who hangs lights, just did it for family 
members for a number of years," said Smith. "When people saw the work he did, 
many asked him to do the same thing for them. And a business was born." 
</P>
<P>
 If after reading Smith's piece you are tempted to chuck much of this holiday 
season, along with the guilt, right out the window, you'll be in good company. 
Judith Sitko, the family therapist mentioned in the story, has done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitko stopped inviting the extended family over for holiday dinners a while 
back. It was too much work and too much pressure," said Smith. "She actually 
tries to enjoy the holidays instead."

FIRM DECIDES TO BOLSTER ITS INVESTMENT IN HOSPITAL

 In an unexpected turn of events, the company that operates South Bay Hospital 
says it will stop trying to find another hospital to sublease the financially 
ailing facility. 
</P>
<P>
 American Medical International, which has operated South Bay Hospital for a 
decade, plans to invest in the hospital and strengthen its ties to local 
physicians, said Steve Balalian, the hospital's vice president of finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've made a commitment to do all they can to make it a market leader," 
Balalian said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay Hospital has been hurt in recent years by lagging patient admissions 
and the loss of managed-care contracts, fueling concern that it could close. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, AMI has been negotiating with other hospitals interested in taking 
over management of the 203-bed facility in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The most promising plan appeared to be one by Daniel Freeman Hospitals, which 
has expressed interest in expanding into the Beach Cities area. The nonprofit 
Catholic concern already operates Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood 
and Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 But Daniel Freeman announced last week that it had decided to terminate the 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay Hospital is owned by a public agency, the Beach Cities Health 
District, which was formed in 1955 to build and operate a community hospital. 
Taxpayers in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach pay about 
$900,000 annually to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1984, the district has leased the hospital to AMI, a commercial chain, 
for about $3 million a year in rent. The interest is used to fund 
health-related programs in the Beach Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the lease does not expire until 2014, AMI had been exploring whether 
it could sublease hospital operations, only to decide to continue operating the 
hospital itself, Balalian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had come to the conclusion that the economics (of a sublease) would not 
work," he said. "We are making a new commitment to serving the South Bay 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials are developing an extensive business plan that will be 
presented to the health district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're enthusiastic about the proposal," said district board member Dick 
Fruin. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials speculated that AMI's commitment to the hospital could have 
been firmed up by the company's pending acquisition by National Medical 
Enterprises, the nation's second-largest health care concern. The new 
organization will have more than a dozen hospitals in the Los Angeles Basin, 
Balalian said.

E'X-MANAGER SUES SPORTS BAR, CLAIMING BIAS, HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The former manager of a popular Santa Monica sports bar is suing her 
ex-employer, claiming that her bosses canceled her health insurance after 
learning she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Roman-Neary, 30, former general manager of Legends, on The Promenade 
in Santa Monica, alleges she was the victim of sexual harassment and 
discrimination in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which comes amid a surge in pregnancy discrimination cases 
nationwide, was filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court and seeks 
unspecified damages. Legends' co-owners said they have not seen the suit but 
have denied the allegations after learning about them from press reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman-Neary describes a frat-house atmosphere at the bar, which opened on The 
Promenade in 1991. The company's male co-owners told workers to plaster the 
walls with posters of buxom women and urged waitresses to wear tight or 
revealing clothing, according to the suit. Roman-Neary says one of her bosses 
would call the bar and ask other employees what she was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman-Neary says she was singled out for harassment once her bosses learned 
she was pregnant. After giving birth to her son in January, she discovered that 
the company had stopped paying her health insurance premiums and had demoted 
her during maternity leave. Her attorney said that she eventually paid the 
hospital bills from savings and her husband's income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was humiliated and really embarrassed," said Roman-Neary, who lives in 
Northridge. "People asked me what I did wrong (to deserve the demotion). . . . 
I lost all incentive to really try hard at work." 
</P>
<P>
 John Morris, a co-owner and former executive at Long Beach-based Sports 
Legends Inc., which owns the sports bar chain, denied Roman-Neary's 
allegations, but said he had not seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear on my kids, we have the receipts that prove the insurance company 
paid" for Roman-Neary's maternity, Morris said. He added that the January 
earthquake damaged the building housing the bar and caused a 60% drop-off in 
business that required the elimination of Roman-Neary's position as general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned from maternity leave in April, Morris said, she was offered 
a position as manager at the same pay as her previous job. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman-Neary has since filed for disability and says she will not return to 
work at Legends. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said that lawsuits against pregnancy discrimination have become 
more commonplace since the U.S. Supreme Court held in 1991 that employers may 
not limit jobs for women to protect the health of a fetus. The court reasoned 
that companies had historically used health rules to deny women equal 
employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing recorded 6,563 
complaints of sex discrimination in 1993. Of these, 1,015 were for pregnancy 
discrimination.

HARMAN DECLARES VICTORY OVER BROOKS; ELECTIONS: DEMOCRAT HAS 546-VOTE LEAD WITH 
ABOUT 1,000 ABSENTEE BALLOTS UNCOUNTED. CHALLENGER REFUSES TO CONCEDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two weeks after she saw many of her freshman colleagues defeated, Rep. Jane 
Harman (D-Rolling Hills) declared victory in her race against Rancho Palos 
Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks and celebrated at a low-key gathering that 
emphasized survival more than triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, however, was still clinging to hopes that about 1,000 remaining votes 
will put her over the top, and has not conceded. The remaining ballots will be 
counted by Monday at the latest, elections officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, a Democrat, had a 546-vote lead over Brooks after the latest tally 
Tuesday of absentee votes cast in the 36th Congressional District, which 
includes coastal communities from San Pedro to Marina del Rey. She had 93,282 
votes to Brooks' 92,736 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has now become almost mathematically impossible for the outcome of this 
race to change," Harman said at a news conference at her campaign headquarters 
on Century Boulevard near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she gathered with supporters at the Jerry's Famous Deli in Venice where 
they feasted on sandwiches and beer and expressed relief that Harman had 
apparently emerged a victor from one of the closest congressional battles in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Harman's Democratic colleagues got swept out in the GOP romp on 
Election Day. At the top of the ticket in the 36th district, gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown lost out to Gov. Pete Wilson by almost 30 percentage 
points. Harman was initially 93 votes behind, only to overtake Brooks as 
absentee ballots were counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a national tide, but what is significant is this district resisted 
it," Harman said. "I'm a Democrat and I won here. Why did I win? I won because 
I believe my record, my style, my bipartisan support is what this district 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
 That Brooks came so close surprised many political observers because Harman is 
regarded as a star member of her freshman class of representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have believed Jane Harman would have lost, just viewing the 
campaign from the outside," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, senior associate at the 
Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate School. "She did 
everything right. Her strategy, of building bipartisan support, could not be 
faulted." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman mounted a $1-million campaign that included commercials on local TV 
stations, a barrage of last-minute mailers, and a list of endorsements from 
aerospace executives and police chiefs. She opposed Proposition 187, which 
limits services to illegal immigrants, but made the announcement only a week 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign brought in Clinton Administration officials to meet with 
aerospace officials or to announce job-creating projects. But they seldom 
attended campaign rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before the election, when Clinton came to California to announce a 
Chinese order of McDonnell Douglas aircraft, she was side-by-side with the 
President. She did not attend a better-publicized campaign rally later in the 
day, when Clinton campaigned for Brown and Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 As the last votes trickled in from the registrar-recorder's office, it became 
clear that one of Harman's wisest decisions was investing in an absentee 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman teamed with Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) and state Sen. 
Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo), with each candidate chipping in $38,000 for the 
absentee campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we saw how bad turnout was in the primary, we thought we had to do 
something," said Harman campaign spokesman Roy Behr. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote-drive targeted "inconsistent" voters -- those who went to the polls 
in 1992 but not during the 1994 primary -- on the theory that these were 
constituents who had yet to make up their minds about the race, said Tim Mock, 
Dills' campaign coordinator. The Democrats sent about 30,000 applications, 
already filled out with the registered voter's name and address. On Election 
Day, workers called about 9,000 voters who had requested and received the 
ballots. The callers made sure that the voters had sent ballots or knew they 
could still drop them off. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy proved important in light of Election Day results, when Harman 
finished 93 votes behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly wasn't fun and I knew the election wasn't over," Harman said. 
"My first priority was to console my family and to console my staff. I saw the 
strong possibility this could be turned around, how important it was to be 
positive and to not despair." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks was so confident of victory that she flew to Washington to be part of 
Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich's (R-Ga.) transition team. She appeared at news 
conferences and on network news broadcasts, although "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
NewsHour" issued a retraction after mistakenly identifying her as a 
representative-elect.

FINE ART GALLERY CAPTURES ESSENCE OF BLACK LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is an unlikely spot for a fine art gallery -- the far end of a sprawling 
horseshoe-shaped shopping center populated mostly by beauty salons, cleaners 
and small markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Black Gallery, founded to showcase rarely seen talent, is accustomed 
to being viewed as something of an oddity. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its 10th year at the Santa Barbara Plaza, the gallery operators take 
pride in providing a haven for photographers striving to capture aspects of 
black life that are seldom shown on the pages of daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is very rich visually, but most images that are supposed to represent it 
are not done by people in the community," said gallery co-founder and director 
Roland Charles. "We've got to go beyond that, bring out the best in people." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the Black Gallery's neat storefront is a spare, airy interior 
frequently filled with the mellow, piped-in strains of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The stark white walls are lined with works by Cameroonian photographer Angele 
Etoundi Essamba. Her dramatic and sensual images of African women, wrought in 
black and white, were selected from those included in her book "Passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetics such as these, Charles said, are rarely displayed in mainstream 
galleries but find a home at the Black Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have a limited idea of what art is, who don't even accept 
photography as an art form, particularly among African Americans," said the 
soft-spoken Charles, a Louisiana native and photojournalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "With black photography, we're used to seeing social statements, reflecting on 
crisis situations. But the comments (that) photographers are making now are a 
lot more subtle, a long ways from the civil rights era." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles co-founded the Black Gallery with three other photographers who, in 
the wake of a successful group show at the California Afro-American Museum, 
decided that the city needed a permanent spot for black fine-art photography. 
The gallery relies primarily on the nonprofit Black Photographers of California 
and corporate sponsorships for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Gallery also has opened and curated several exhibits that have 
toured the world, including the comprehensive "Life in a Day of Black L.A.," a 
10-photographer exhibit that premiered at the California Afro-American Museum 
and traveled to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were amazed," Charles said of reactions to the show in countries such 
as Germany and England. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only images they had of blacks in Los Angeles came over the news -- boys 
with their hands up against a wall, wearing rollers in their hair, 
gangbangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't to say that the gallery doesn't have its share of works depicting 
social strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes from riots nearly 30 years apart -- 1965 and 1992 -- adorn the walls of 
the back room, with eerily similar images of National Guardsmen and smoldering 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more dominant are fine-art images by artists such as Essamba and local 
jazz photographer Bob Douglas, ethereal moments such as one Charles himself 
captured in an uncharacteristically still moment at the First AME Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles said he believes that reflecting black life accurately also entails 
showing interaction among races. To that end, he has gathered 14 black and 
Korean photographers, painters and sculptors for "Collaborations," a series of 
jointly created works scheduled to open next year at both the Black Gallery and 
the Sabina Lee gallery in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea for this show is really working together," Charles said as he leaned 
forward excitedly. "There's so much energy, so much harmony. It's going to be 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 And how did he turn up so many artists willing to commit to the project over 
several months? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," he said, smiling, "that was easy."

OFFICER SEES RESULTS IN CRIME-FIGHTING EFFORT; POLICE: SUCCESS IN DRIVING 
ACTIVITY OUT OF HARBOR CITY BUSINESS AREA ON PCH SPURS PLANS TO EXPAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fifty Harbor City businesses as diverse as McDonald's restaurant and Joker's 
Wild Tattoo shop have joined forces with the LAPD's new Harbor City lead 
officer to drive criminal activities out of the business area on Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 With the business owners' backing, Officer Donald Jenks initiated several days 
of LAPD operations involving up to 45 officers, who made arrests and issued 
citations and warnings.  
</P>
<P>
 "In just one month, (crime) had gone down," said Jenks, who was transferred to 
Harbor City after serving as senior lead officer in San Pedro for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers also took day laborers to the city-sponsored pickup point down the 
street in Harbor Park. Business owners had complained that the workers 
loitering outside their storefronts deterred customers.  
</P>
<P>
 Ping Own, who has owned Ping's Auto Service for eight years, said nearly all 
of the prostitutes, dope dealers and day laborers who used to hang out in the 
area were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years (authorities) said there was nothing they could do about it," Own 
said. "We changed the face of the street."  
</P>
<P>
 Now Jenks wants to expand the police-community cooperation that has improved 
the Pacific Coast Highway district to fight crime in other areas of Harbor 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime in one neighborhood just blocks from the business area frightens some 
residents so much that on Halloween, a woman was seen walking with the arm of 
her trick-or-treating child in one hand and a can of Mace in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came another parent, with a baseball bat perched in the back of his baby 
stroller, said resident Nick Chinetti. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackle of gunfire is common in the neighborhood around 253rd Street and 
Belleporte Avenue, residents say. Gang members, prostitutes and crack dealers 
are attracted by five abandoned buildings near the corner. Activities have 
worsened during the past 18 months as promises by Los Angeles city officials to 
demolish the fire-gutted, one-story apartments have fallen through, Chinetti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could go over there and make arrests all day, but the key is to knock (the 
buildings) down," Jenks said. It would "eliminate a lot of police time." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard C. Sanchez, chief building inspector in the Building and Safety 
Department's Bureau of Community Safety, said the buildings will be torn down 
and the property fenced by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 A nuisance abatement official, who did not want to be identified, said the 
city has been tied up in litigation with the property owner and it is 
overloaded with hundreds of similar cases in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists have long complained that authorities ignore Harbor City. 
They cite their efforts to get the buildings torn down, and point out that just 
one patrol car is assigned to the community from the LAPD's Harbor Division. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jenks said he will work to get more police on the beat in the community. 
"We have to stay on top of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A new LAPD Harbor City Community Service Center, which opened at 1522 W. 
Pacific Coast Highway two weeks ago, is also expected to discourage crime in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Division officers can use the center as a substation for paperwork and 
lunch breaks, helping to increase police presence in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamco Transmissions donated the building, which is full of other community 
gifts, including carpet, furniture, a refrigerator, a television and a vacuum 
cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is open Mondays and Wednesdays through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m., and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesdays.

SIGHTS; PATIENTS BENEFIT WHEN SHOPPERS CHOOSE THEIR ART; IN FACT, BUYING 
CREATIVE WORK FROM ANY ARTIST HAS A POSITIVE RICOCHET EFFECT ON THE BUYER AND 
THE SELLER.

 To trot out a twisted adage -- and what are the holidays for if not trotting 
out adages? -- art makes for a gift that gives more than once. Buying art 
benefits both the beholder and the creative forces behind making the art, as 
well as nurturing the artistic process. Gift-seekers, take heed. 
</P>
<P>
 One such appreciation and acquisition opportunity comes via the Art 
Therapy-Fine Arts Discovery Program at the Camarillo State Hospital. From Dec. 
10 through 15, there will be a holiday show, the third annual art exhibition 
and boutique. The periodic displays of art by the patients can make for 
rewarding viewing, a chance to see art from fresh and often unadulterated 
perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Art-and-crafts-as-gift potential is the theme at the Conejo Valley Art Museum, 
which is hosting the holiday-oriented multimedia show "Gifts for the 
Discriminating Tastes." Among the objects for sale will be pottery, weavings, 
woven baskets, special paper, dolls, glass, jewelry and artwork, including 
traditional, representational, abstract, watercolors, oils, mixed media, glass 
and sculptures. An artist's reception will be held on Dec. 3 from 6 to 9 p.m. 
GALLERY CROSSINGS 
</P>
<P>
 The sign remains, but the venue has changed. These days, you'll find the 
kindly signage on Santa Paula's Main Street promising "Mr. Nichols," but 
there's no one home. But, have no fear, Mr. Nichols is back in business 
directly across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nichols has long stoked the flames of art exhibition in Santa Paula, with 
a special emphasis on fine art photography. Four months ago, Nichols moved 
across the street, to the ample and stolid neoclassical quarters of what was 
originally the Farmers and Merchants Bank, built in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols' first official art exhibition in the new space, of serigraphs and 
ceramics by Parmlee Duke, is a modest but enjoyable outing. Duke takes a 
quirky, endearing path to expressiveness, and her work is appropriate for 
family viewing -- a fine thing in this holiday time. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Duke's art-related activities are teaching young children and 
illustrating children's books, and a sense of wonder -- without smarminess -- 
characterizes these pieces. A gently loony imagination and a flair for bent 
logic also comes through. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the charm is the idea of casual meetings of disparate creatures and 
objects. The subjects of "Brunch Time" include a hefty walrus, a parasol-toting 
squirrel and a breakfast tray. 
</P>
<P>
 Llamas appear matter-of-factly, for no apparent reason other than a flexing of 
fantasy. A humongous sunflower and a looming ostrich head invade the picture 
planes. Kids cavort with a giant sea horse and a rabbit on the beach. We don't 
flinch. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Pretender," an artist at her easel faces a penguin with a beanie and a 
hula hoop. Another day, another daydream. ART TAKES OVER LIBRARY 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, down the road, the Santa Paula Public Library is presenting the 
large "Santa Paula Art and Photography Exhibit," sponsored by the Santa Paula 
Society of the Arts. Close to 200 works in various media stage a benevolent 
takeover of a fair portion of the library space. 
</P>
<P>
 Evocative street scenes account for some of the better paintings, from Ben 
Abril's pulpy ode to a Los Angeles intersection, "Pirate Radio," to Eugene 
Marzec's view of a row of vertical Victorian houses and Henry Richards' rural 
"Hwy. 1 Thru Pt. Reyes Station." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Jankowski shows an attractively desolate and precision-rendered farm 
scene with "In the Heart of Ventura." Katherine Rhoads shows a strong painterly 
touch, with the loopy charm of her "Ostrich Parade" and the ruddy sea-swept 
realism of her Winslow Homer-esque "The Fisherman." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps predictably, landscape painting gets a lot of play here, but with some 
unpredictable turns-of-convention. Patti Robinson finds a way to energize what 
is potentially homely kitsch in "Pumpkin Paradise at Faulkner Farms." The 
representational image dissolves in seeping, dripping rivulets of orange paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Betts Waite portrays droopy sunflowers in "Flowers of the Sun" with an air of 
mortality and melancholy beneath the yellow glitz. Sherry Loehr's "Composition 
3" is less about plant life, per se, than it is the result of a photorealist's 
foliage fetish. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the photography, Terry Schuller's "Underwater Paradise" is a 
retinal-prickly, hyper-vivid undersea garden scene. From another mind-set 
entirely, Andrew Glover's droll, mock-antique images from a trip to Scotland 
take the role of strange travelogue entries. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever there was a doubt about the abundance and variety of art activity in 
Santa Paula, let this be a lesson to the wise. MOSAICS AND SILK 
</P>
<P>
 Splitting the difference between 2- and 3-D work, Helle Scharling-Todd is 
showing both her mosaics and silk-screen prints at the County Government 
Center. Her handiwork with mosaic can be seen in a dramatic form at the Ray D. 
Prueter Library in Port Hueneme, spilling under the front door. 
</P>

SOUNDS: TIME-HONORED SONGS RING IN SPECIAL SEASON; ALL ACROSS THE COUNTY, 
PERFORMANCES WILL SPARKLE WITH MUSIC FROM TRADITIONAL CAROLS TO CLASSICAL 
WORKS.

 How can you tell when the holiday season is upon Ventura County? The weather 
isn't normally a reliable indicator, but there are other telltale signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorations dangle in the periphery and Christmas carols are piped into the 
public hearing space. Kindly fat men in red outfits perch themselves in 
shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the classical music scene here, the tunes turn decidedly seasonal. 
Concert-goers and other music observers know by now that, in this region, 
December is given over to holiday consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday season means time-honored traditions on the musical scene, in 
Ventura County as much as anywhere else. For the 15th consecutive year, the 
Ventura County Symphony will be joining forces with the Channel Islands Ballet 
to bring "The Nutcracker," that Yuletide perennial, to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 At the helm of the symphony will be conductor Paul Polivnick. Currently 
director of the New Hampshire Music Festival, Polivnick keeps up a busy 
schedule of guest conducting and is presently the guest conductor with the UC 
Santa Barbara Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances, all at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, will take place at 7 p.m. 
Dec. 2, 2 and 7 p.m. Dec. 3 and 2 p.m. Dec. 4. Tickets are available through 
the symphony office or at the Oxnard Civic. 
</P>
<P>
 As it does every year, the Gold Coast Community Chorus, under Kurt Bernstein's 
direction, will present its holiday program at the First Baptist Church in 
Ventura on Dec. 17 and 18. For information, call 649-3471. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the Ventura Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Burns Taft, will be 
at least partly celebrating the season at the second concert of its season. The 
orchestra's Dec. 3 concert will feature Corelli's Christmas Concerto, Op. 6, 
No. 8, and Vaughan-Williams' "Fantasy on Greensleeves." Guest guitarist Matthew 
Greif will perform Giuliani's "Guitar Concerto in A." 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, which starts at 8 p.m., is at the Ventura College Auditorium, 
4667 Telegraph Road. 
</P>
<P>
 And what would any civilized Western city be without Handel's "Messiah" this 
time of year? The choirs of Trinity Lutheran Church, under Minister of Music 
Ron Zell's direction, will perform the oratorio at 4 p.m. Dec. 4 at the church, 
at Ashwood and Loma streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the shiny new Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, 2100 Thousand Oaks 
Blvd., Handel will be having a field day. Los Robles Master Chorale, under 
James Stemen's direction, along with the Amadeus Boys Choir, will perform a 
varied program at 8 p.m. Dec. 3. Included are segments of the "Messiah" as well 
as Conard Sousa's "A Christmas Garland" and other treats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Symphony's program, "Sounds of Christmas and the Holidays," will be 
on the main stage at 8 p.m. Dec. 10. This sampler plate program includes 
excerpts from both the "Messiah" and "Judas Maccabaeus." The evening will also 
feature music by Bach, Gabrielli and Rutter, and seasonal fare arranged by 
Carmen Dragon, with baritone Sylvester Blue as the guest of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more exciting seasonal concert prospects is the program entitled "A 
Christmas Odyssey" from the Ventura County Master Chorale. The program includes 
Vaughan-Williams' "Carol Fantasy," Britten's "A Boy Was Born" and Santa 
Barbara-based composer Emma Lou Diemer's "A Feast for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be three performances around the county. At 8 p.m. Dec. 10, it will 
be at Assumption Church, 3175 Telegraph Road, Ventura, and at Mt. Cross 
Lutheran Church, 102 Camino Esplendido, Camarillo, at 8 p.m. Dec. 17. But the 
most enticing venue will be at 4 p.m. Dec. 18, when the ensemble sings in the 
historically rich, reverberant San Buenaventura Mission, 211 E. Main St., in 
old town Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking toward New Year's Eve, the Ventura County Master Chorale and Opera 
Assn. will be serving up another of its annual gala dinner-dances, this time at 
the Financial Plaza Hilton in Oxnard. Music Director Burns Taft will be leading 
the ensemble in a program of Irving Berlin songs, alongside dancers led by 
choreographer Eileen Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 The event raises funds for the Master Chorale's community outreach programs, 
which include Outreach to Schools, a children's choir, a high school Choral 
Mentor program and Senior Outreach. For information, call 653-7282. 
</P>
<P>
 Out at California Lutheran University, the Advent-Christmas-Epiphany season is 
ushered in with the official CLU Christmas Concerts, a tradition dating back 
more than 30 years on campus. The combined CLU choirs, led by Wyant Morton, and 
the Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Daniel Geeting, will perform a varied 
program of carols, both beloved chestnuts, lesser-known songs and Britten's "A 
Ceremony of Carols." The concerts take place at 8 p.m. Dec. 2 and 3 and 4 p.m. 
Dec. 4 at the university's Samuelson Chapel.

FITNESS; BUILDING BETTER BODIES IN THE LIVING ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's where chrome meets crystal, velour rubs up against velvet couches and 
pink light washes the entrance to the women's shower room. 
</P>
<P>
 A gym of ill repute? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's one man's vision of the ideal place to build muscle and burn 
fat. It's the Better Bodies Cross-Training Center in West Los Angeles -- the 
$2-million brainchild of Tom Wilson, 32, the former manager of a Gold's gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence abounds that there's something different about this gym. There's a 
chair converted into a mini-garden, tabletops made from authentic manhole 
covers and, starting soon, a revolving art collection. Small, crystal 
chandeliers hang between velvet drapes across from the health bar, which serves 
up the standard power drinks and health candy. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no blaring music, harsh lighting or people jumping up and down. In 
fact, aerobics don't figure into this program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We adopted the outcome of studies that showed that cardiovascular 
conditioning is more effective than general aerobic classes," Wilson said. "So 
we designed the club with 50% weight strength equipment and 50% cardiovascular 
machines -- like Cybex bikes, Stairmaster and treadmills." 
</P>
<P>
 The yearly membership fee is $750, which includes two sessions with a personal 
trainer. Wilson also offers a six-week, $1,500 program of "personal 
reconstruction," in which clients receive a detailed nutritional and body 
analysis, a menu plan and four 90-minute sessions each week with a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 All gym members start their workouts with a Cybex bike warm-up. Using 
headphones, they can tap into a 16-channel stereo system, whose offerings 
include the sounds of rainfall and waves hitting the beach, or play a CD or 
videocassette from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes a session on a machine used to elevate the heart rate and work on 
different parts of the body in 30 exercises, each of them one minute long. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has been hanging around gyms and muscle people since he was a 
child, encourages his members to participate in other sports. "The whole 
philosophy is about cross-training. It's more than going to a gym. We offer 
cardio adventures -- hiking, rowing, roller-blading -- through our affiliations 
and outdoor programs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says that most people want to burn fat rather than build muscle. But 
staying fit, he adds, should include muscle building. That approach and the 
posh, living-room feel of the gym appear to have won converts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," said Alison Thorpe, 31, a paralegal who arrived in Los Angeles 
two months ago from New Orleans. "There are serious people here. It's not a 
showplace in terms of people showing off. I would much rather look at (the 
decor) than any gym." 
</P>
<P>
 If you still enjoy an old-fashioned massage, the former team masseur for the 
Edmonton Oilers hockey team, Hans Juergen-Merz, and his daughter, Britta, offer 
them for $1 a minute. Members use them to wind down from workouts that, despite 
the unlikely surroundings, are as tough as those found in any gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to this gym, however, to use a writer of Greek tragedies to put the 
hard work in perspective. A quote from Euripides, inscribed on a plaque outside 
the women's locker room, says: "Discipline. Do not consider painful what is 
good for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Better Bodies Cross-Training Center is located at 1400 W. Olympic Blvd. Los 
Angeles: ( 310 ) 473-1470.

 The 1974 Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the Civil War, "The Killer Angels" 
by Michael Shaara, which was made into the movie "Gettysburg," also inspired 
Ken Burn's incredible 1993 PBS Civil War documentary. Shaara's book has been 
recorded by Tony- and Emmy-award winning actor George Hearn for Cathedral Audio 
Books and will be broadcast by KCRW-FM as a Thanksgiving Day special from 9 
a.m. to 4 p.m. today and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday. The broadcast can be 
heard in Ventura and Oxnard on KCRU-FM 89.1, in Ojai on 102.1 and in Santa 
Paula, Fillmore and Moorpark on 102.3. The audio book, which is available at 
bookstores and museum gift shops includes comments from "Gettysburg" director 
Ron Maxwell and selections from the movie soundtrack.

 The major feasting is finished and family gossip has been revisited along with 
the leftovers. Now it's time for a change of pace. Visit the Ventura Bookstore, 
522 E. Main St. at 2 p.m. Saturday to meet master fabulist Clive Barker. He 
will read from his new novel, "Everville," the sequel to his "The Great and 
Secret Show," which has more than 1 million copies in print. Barker, a Los 
Angeles resident, has also produced and directed films including "Hellraiser" 
and "The Candyman."

 A wonderful way to support public libraries is to shop for holiday treasures 
in their gift stores. It's a win-win situation. You discover and purchase 
unique items and the library returns your investment by acquiring books, and 
funding activities in which you participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry, folk art, books, educational toys, posters, art prints and 
collectibles are on sale at the Thousand Oaks Library's Foundation Store, 1401 
Janss Road.

<P>
 The Oxnard Library's Friends, Books and Things gift shop is dressed up for the 
holidays and provides reasonably priced merchandise at 251 S. A St.

FESTIVITIES NEED NOT BE SUCH WEIGHTY AFFAIRS; 'TIS THE SEASON FOR LOADS OF 
RICH, TEMPTING TASTE TREATS. HERE ARE WAYS TO AVOID HAVING THEM ADD TO 
WAISTLINES.

<P>
 The holidays are a time for friends and relatives to get together. A time for 
office festivities, church and community celebrations. Unfortunately, holiday 
meals and parties often mean overeating and weight gain. But that doesn't need 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Clarke, extension specialist in nutrition education at Kansas State 
University, offers these ideas for planning your holiday events: 
</P>
<P>
 * Focus your events on people, not food. De-emphasize the importance of 
eating. This is a time for friends and family, for socializing and enjoying the 
pleasure of being together. Take the time for open communication and laughter. 
Relax and help others let go of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep foods low calorie. Offer low calorie, low fat foods -- fruit and 
vegetable plates, low fat dips, fruit cups. Prepare main dishes, sauces and 
dressings in a lighter way. Avoid high fat, high sugar foods. Try to make 
changes gradually, however, not all at once. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit food choices. The bountiful buffet table is a hazard to the overeater. 
When planning a meal, select a limited menu instead of a full buffet table. 
Studies show people eat more when they have a wider selection. With less 
choice, people eat less and are happier with themselves for not eating out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Offer smaller portions. Cut bars, cake, pie and other foods into smaller 
pieces. Offer moderate servings and don't urge "seconds." Avoid passing serving 
platters laden with food repeatedly up and down the tables. This encourages 
people to eat more, just because it's there, or because others urge them to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider including activities at the party like a song fest, games, card 
playing and contests. Focus the entire party around active fun or sports such 
as skiing, sledding, skating, hiking, backpacking, dancing or basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce eating time. Our appetites are stimulated by the sight of food. Avoid 
having food such as candy or nuts constantly at hand. Consider delaying the 
serving of appetizers or other refreshments. Put food away after a meal. For 
many social events, food is not needed. Consider omitting food and offering a 
soft drink, coffee or tea instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you serve alcoholic beverages, have nonalcoholic drinks, tea and coffee 
available, as well. Help your guests maintain moderation. Besides the many 
other problems it can cause, alcohol is high in calories. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have an overeating problem, be cautious in cleaning up after your 
party. Avoid eating that first "harmless" cracker or piece of cheese that can 
lead so easily to an after-party binge. Ways to avoid this are to ask someone 
else to put the food away while you straighten the living room and stay out of 
the kitchen. Or, spread leftovers quickly on a cookie sheet and pop them in the 
freezer.

SOUTH BAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; CHURCH GETS PROPERTY BACK AFTER LOAN SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Carson church finally got ownership of its property back recently after 
being tricked in a business deal and nearly evicted -- all while trying to help 
a congregation in Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, members of the Samoan Congregational Church were looking for a way to 
raise money for a building project in Samoa. One of the leaders of the church 
signed what he thought were preliminary loan documents, but among the papers he 
signed was a quitclaim deed, which relinquished title to the property, said 
Richard Lyman, attorney for the church. That document gave the church property 
to Gwendolyn Joseph and her company, Contractor's Surety Bonding Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph took the deed to two lenders and borrowed more than $1.2 million 
against the property. Although Joseph eventually gave the church some of the 
money, she never made payments on the loans, Lyman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After foreclosure on the unpaid loans, title to the property was sold again, 
this time to Holm Inc., which served the Carson Street church with an eviction 
notice in 1988. That's how the congregation found out the ownership of the 
property had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the quitclaim deed was signed by only one member of the church, and 
not two as required by church bylaws, the court later found that the deal was 
invalid. But in the meantime, the company that bought the unpaid notes had the 
right to demand payment for the church's use of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation agreed to pay Holm Inc. $25,000 a month until the lawsuits 
were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Through bingo games, other fund-raisers and the contributions of its members, 
the 500-member church scrambled to pay the money, which added up to $575,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when the judge presiding over the last lawsuit said he would probably 
rule in favor of the church, a settlement was reached. The church got back 
title to the property, and Holm Inc. kept the money the church had paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the lawsuits, church leaders say, the project in Samoa never got 
off the ground. MARY GUTHRIE

WESTSIDE WATCH: HOSPITAL'S REOPENING GIVES BIRTH TO UNUSUAL CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It will no doubt be years before Matthew Onda and Kassey Cordova understand 
the oddball contest that preceded their births in Santa Monica last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mothers, Michele Onda and Maria Cordova, were engaged in a maternal 
battle of the birthing room. Each mother-to-be wanted her baby to be the first 
one born in the newly reopened St. John's Hospital & Health Center, which had 
been closed for earthquake repairs as long as the babies had been in gestation 
-- nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage their babies to cooperate, the moms-to-be turned to their 
respective obstetricians, David Edwards and Gene Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was on. 
</P>
<P>
 Onda took the lead early, when Edwards set up a Cesarean section appointment 
for noon, Oct. 3, the hospital's post-quake opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Cordova, who needed to have her labor induced for medical reasons, 
arranged to come in as soon as the hospital opened -- 5 a.m. Parks said he 
figured that Cordova, who was having her second child, could deliver before 
Edwards' C-section. 
</P>
<P>
 Another obstetrician, Sam Alexander -- who insists he wasn't participating in 
the contest -- complicated matters when he scheduled a C-section for 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This last-minute schedule change prompted Onda to ask for an earlier C-section 
time -- 8 a.m. Using a little professional persuasion, Edwards got the 
pediatrician and the anesthesiologist to come in earlier. Shortly before 10 
a.m., Matthew Onda crossed the finish line first -- at 8 pounds, 8 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cordova baby, a girl, finished in second place that afternoon. The other 
C-section appointment was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the strange contest says it "took the edge off" her surgical 
procedure. Said Onda: "It added a lot of fun to it, and excitement." 
</P>

 PRICEY PATROL: Crime fighting is often downright dull for the police officers 
who cruise the tame streets of Beverly Hills. But don't tell that to the two 
men who spent big bucks to purchase ride-alongs with Beverly Hills Police Chief 
Marvin Iannone. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was the Police Department's Black and White Ball and auction, 
Nov. 9. The jeweled crowd of Beverly Hills residents was in a feisty mood after 
spending $250 each on the dinner-dance, so no one thought it extravagant when 
an evening with singer Michael Feinstein sold for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The final item, the ride-along with the chief, started at a modest price but 
just kept climbing, as two tuxedoed gentlemen vied for the honor of patrolling 
with the top brass. When the bidding stalled at $6,000, the chief generously 
offered to sell each bidder a ride-along for the bargain price of $5,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
 After the applause for the $11,000 deal died down, one amazed Beverly Hills 
police officer was overheard saying, "He'll have to take them into L.A. to get 
their money's worth."

 A memorial to two police officers killed last February by an attempted robber 
during a management seminar has been approved by the Palos Verdes Estates Art 
Jury, ending a months of wrangling.  
</P>
<P>
 The Art Jury, a private organization that reviews city building plans, 
approved the memorial Monday under the condition that two walking paths be 
removed and a sundial be lowered from 12 to 11 feet, said Philip J. Frengs, 
chairman of the memorial committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial, which will also honor war veterans, will be located in a park 
across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the memorial in August, but the Art Jury rejected 
the original plans in September after residents complained that it was too 
elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
 Memorial supporters, who have raised $10,000, must raise an additional 
$90,000. Originally, the memorial was estimated to cost about $226,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Frengs said he hoped the approval will aid fund-raising efforts. JEFF KASS

 Low-income Los Angeles residents may soon be sporting Looney Tunes T-shirts 
with characters such as Wile E. Coyote, Bugs Bunny and the Tasmanian Devil 
thanks to a plea-bargain agreement with a local businessman accused of 
counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes resident Robert Pae, also known as Song Woe Pae, will 
donate $100,000 worth of T-shirts and other clothing to the nonprofit Los 
Angeles-based Shelter Partnership, City Atty.Jim Hahn announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pae, 38, a corporate officer of Sung Ji Products Inc., pleaded no contest to a 
charge of manufacturing counterfeit goods, said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the 
city attorney's office. A Municipal Court judge also ordered Pae to pay $3,430 
in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into Pae's business was conducted by National Trademark 
Investigations, a company hired by major trademark holders to track down 
counterfeiters, and the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Looney Tunes T-shirts, counterfeit clothing bearing the names 
of sports teams was uncovered by the investigation. JEFF KASS

SIZE OF CENTER

<P>
 City officials are considering doubling the size of the interpretive center at 
Point Vicente, a Rancho Palos Verdes bluff-top popular for whale watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4 to 0 earlier this month to pay a consultant up to 
$35,000 to draw up plans for expanding the interpretive center, which now 
includes a museum, gift store and viewing area. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubling the interpretive center's 2,200 square feet is expected to cost about 
$750,000 from the Measure A Parks Act bond passed in 1992. The city has been 
awarded a total of $2.4 million in Measure A money. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens advocates urged the council to dedicate space in the 
interpretive center for administration and counseling services for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The council said that before hiring the consultant, it will discuss space for 
seniors at the interpretive center with the recreation and parks committee.

 A new blood donor center has opened at Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center, where officials hope the larger quarters will encourage people to 
donate blood.

<P>
 The Harbor-UCLA blood donor program provides about one-third of the blood 
required for the county hospital's patients, including those at the trauma 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The new center is on the first floor of the main building at 1000 W. Carson 
St., near Vermont Avenue east of Torrance. It is open Monday through Friday, 
8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

SOUTH BAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; NO CHARGES AGAINST MAYOR IN SHOOTING 
INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Larry Guidi will not be charged for firing his nine-millimeter handgun 
into the air while trying to scare off three juveniles who were breaking into a 
neighbor's car, Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Randall J. Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office reached a decision Friday after a three-week 
investigation. In the Oct. 27 incident, Guidi said he attempted to stop the 
youths after he caught two of them loitering outside his house and one inside 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested three suspects, ages 14, 16 and 17, and two of them admitted 
that they intended to steal a vehicle, Baron said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although state law prohibits firing a gun within the city limits, Baron said 
he declined to prosecute Guidi because it is unlikely that a jury would find 
Guidi's actions unreasonable and unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not appear that justice would be served in prosecuting a citizen for 
his actions in trying to prevent a crime in his neighborhood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still holding the gun, which was confiscated shortly after the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Guidi told his wife to call 911 after he saw several youths 
outside his house and went outside to confront the youths. When Guidi found one 
inside a neighbor's car, he yelled for the youth to stop. The boy came out of 
the car with his hands up, but he dropped his arms, and Guidi feared for his 
life because he thought the youth had a weapon, a district attorney's report 
said. Guidi fired once into the air.  
</P>
<P>
 Although police apprehended three suspects, Guidi said he was not sure he 
handled the situation correctly.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recommend (firing a weapon in the street), but when your life is in 
danger, you've got a split second to make a decision and I decided to shoot in 
the air," Guidi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi said he intends to retrieve his gun as soon as he can. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTCHESTER; LAPD ACADEMY OPENS AT FORMER HP FACILITY 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's new academy here, set to begin training 90 
recruits in January, opened its doors Saturday to an enthusiastic welcome from 
a community hoping for increased business and an expanded police presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by Police Chief Willie L. Williams, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and 
Deputy Mayor William C. Violante, more than 100 local residents showed up to 
take a tour and express support for the partially completed facility, which 
once housed electronics giant Hewlett-Packard Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "What impressed everyone was how spacious it is and that they didn't have to 
readjust the building's configuration -- the computer and training facilities, 
cafeteria and showers are already there," said Don Savoie, executive director 
of the Westchester/LAX Chamber of Commerce and a local resident. "The new 
employee base will also bring more income to the area. I'm already telling 
everyone to buy stock in Winchell's," which has a doughnut shop nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joe Cunningham, another Westchester resident: "Platoons of recruits will 
be jogging down our roads, students and instructors driving down our streets . 
. . it might make the criminals in the area think twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they felt increased pressure to find a suitable facility 
for a new training center after the unveiling in October, 1993, of a public 
safety plan outlined by Mayor Richard Riordan and Williams. The plan set a goal 
of hiring an additional 2,855 officers over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council's approval last December, the facility was purchased in 
March for $13 million using police bond funds. An additional $10 million will 
be used for the property's refurbishing. 
</P>
<P>
 City and police officials said the property's empty four-story building had 
necessary amenities such as conference rooms, classrooms, a cafeteria and a 
near-complete computer room on the second floor. The existing Hewlett-Packard 
offices were also large enough to accommodate plans for a new 911 
communications center, which, combined with the academy, will save the city 
about $50 million, police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they saved about four years that would have been needed 
to construct a new academy. ADRIAN MAHER

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: IN STEP WITH THE SEASON; A STREET FAIR IN VENTURA LAUNCHES THE 
FESTIVITIES FOLLOWED BY A PARADE AND SEVERAL DANCE EVENTS.

 There are loads of country-Western holiday happenings planned around the 
countyand up the coast. Not every venue has made its holiday plans. So watch 
the column for updates and more events. Meanwhile, here's a sampler of what to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 4: Thousands of visitors are expected along downtown Main Street between 
Fir Street and Ventura Avenue for the city of Ventura's 18th Annual Holiday 
Street Festival. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. you'll find loads of free family 
activities including a Santa Claus, pony rides, art projects for kids and food 
and crafts booths. The Rhythm Rangers, a popular country-rock band, will 
perform from 1:45 to 4 p.m. on the main stage located at Fir and Main streets. 
For details, call 654-7830. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 13: Join deejay-dance instructor Rick Henderson for a Splash Country 
Christmas Fair at his Tuesday Rockin' Rodeo dance night at Splash Night Club. 
$5 gets you in the door, dance lessons at 6:30 and 7:15 p.m., a chicken buffet, 
and dancing, 8 to 11 p.m. Meet "Santa Claus" and enter the Rick Henderson 
look-alike, chili or baked goods contests. The judging starts at 9 p.m. at 
Splash in the Radisson Hotel, 999 Enchanted Way, Simi Valley, 583-2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 17: The 18th Annual Ventura Harbor's Parade of Lights has gone country 
with this year's "Country-Western Theme," and it's expected to attract 15,000 
to 20,000 spectators. The family-oriented festivities begin at 2 p.m. in 
Ventura Harbor Village with caroling, Santa Claus, a children's petting zoo, 
pony rides and country music and dancing to the Rhythm Rangers band. The 
popular Parade of Lights, featuring dozens of decorated vessels and a 
spectacular light show, will start at 6 p.m. Ventura Harbor Village is at 1559 
Spinnaker Drive in Ventura, 642-6746. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 29 and 30: Club-owner Susette has the good sense to spend New Year's Eve 
at home in her bunny slippers. So at the Galleon Room, Santa Barbara's favorite 
place for couples-oriented country dancing, you get the jump on 1995. It's your 
last chance to catch the popular Sky King band before it adds vocalist Troy 
Robinson and become Caught Red Handed. There's never a cover charge at the 
Galleon and free dance lessons on Dec. 29 will be for Rocky Top and Texas 
County Line, a classic couples' dance done to the song, "Darlene." No 
reservations needed -- just look inside the Orchid Bowl, 5925 Calle Real, 
Goleta, 967-0128. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 31, New Year's Eve parties: Most bands start playing at 8:30 p.m. and 
reservations are a must: 
</P>
<P>
 Folks can dance the night away with Jimmy Dale and the Desperados, longtime 
house band at the Ban-Dar, Ventura County's original honky-tonk. This is where 
many country dance instructors got their start or first took lessons. And the 
place will probably be there long after others have switched to reggae or salsa 
music. Management says, "New Year's Eve is always our biggest night." But 
there's no fancy menu planned. Just place an order at the Ban-Dar Bar & Grill's 
back window and Marilyn will fix you up at her "kitchen." Reservations 
suggested. $9 in advance or $15 per person at the door includes champagne and 
party favors. The Ban-Dar is at 3005 E. Main St., Ventura, 653-9176. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crazy Bull Steakhouse & Saloon has again enlisted Shiloh to help usher in 
the new year. Choose between two couples packages or -- space permitting -- 
skip dinner and just dance. Either way it's reservations-only. Package A for 
$135 per couple includes lodging at the adjacent Del Norte Inn, prime rib 
dinner for two, champagne and party favors. Package B for $100 per couple 
excludes lodging. The Crazy Bull is located at 4426 Central Ave., Camarillo, 
988-4209. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Dean and the Shooters are always a delight. About 90% of his songs are 
originals. But all his traditional country vocals are perfect for high-energy 
two-steps, couple-clutcher ballads and anything in between. Be sure to request 
my favorite, "Man in the Spotlight." $30 per person buys a prime rib dinner 
served from 6 to 8 p.m. Cousin's is at 2381 Tapo St., Simi Valley, 522-2559. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxie's will be jumpin' with the Rhythm Rangers' cover tunes and tons of 
originals off their new compact disc, to be released mid-December. Details are 
not available yet, but expect to "party hearty and boogie-woogie" at Maxie's, 
W. 101 Short St., Oak View, 649-9931. 
</P>
<P>
 That fun band, Spaghetti Western, will help you break a sweat while 
two-steppin' and line dancin' at the City Line Club. The cost for champagne, 
favors and buffet breakfast is $20 per couple, $13 per person. Cover charge for 
dancing only, $6. Inside the San Marcos Bowl, 4050 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, 
967-5631. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not spend New Year's Eve dancing on one of the biggest dance floors in the 
area to music provided by C & C Productions/deejay, Vince Fiske? This 
country-western dinner-dance starts with a social hour at 6 p.m., followed at 7 
p.m. by a barbecue chicken and tri-tip buffet and a floor show featuring 
Folklorico Dancers. $25 per person includes dinner and midnight party favors 
and champagne. It all happens at the American Legion Hall, 83 S. Palm St., 
Ventura, 643-8833. Some rooms at a special rate of $65 plus tax per night may 
still be available at the nearby Ramada Inn, 181 E. Santa Clara Ave., Ventura, 
652-0141. Ask for Confirmation Group 1230. 
</P>
<P>
 If swing's your thing, head for the Ventura County Swing Dance Club's lesson 
at 8 p.m. Then dance 'til midnight in a beautiful setting overlooking the ocean 
at Poinsettia Pavilion, 3451 Foothill Road, Ventura, 643-3114. 
</P>
<P>
 Local fans of Art Green and the Posse will have to go way, way up the coast to 
Zaca Creek in Buellton to share New Year's Eve with the band. And you'll find 
Platte River Crossing at Boulder Station in Las Vegas. Good luck, fellas -- we 
knew you when.

SOUTH BAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; ADULT EDUCATION CENTER OPENS AT EX-NAVY

 The Torrance Unified School District opened its first new school since the 
1960s this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Adult Education Center is expected to serve about 40,000 students each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The site, which served as a food storage facility for the Navy during World 
War II, was donated by the military to the school district. Cleaning up the 
site and stationing 16 portable classrooms and an administrative building on 
the property cost the district $1.1 million, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bulge in the middle school population forced the district to reclaim Newton 
and Jefferson middle schools, which had been used as adult schools. Newton 
Middle School was renamed Richardson Middle School to honor former Torrance 
School Supt. Edward Richardson.  
</P>

SOUTH BAY / COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; CHEVRON GIVES $25,000 TO HELP CITY 
LIBRARY 
</P>

<P>
 Chevron Oil Co. has donated $25,000 to Manhattan Beach to benefit the city's 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation, made at a Nov. 15 City Council meeting, will help city officials 
upgrade the technology used in cataloguing books, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to put some things on CD-ROM," said Jim Wolfe, city Parks and 
Recreation director. "That's the way things are going these days." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has spent thousands of dollars this year to keep the library open 
additional hours after the county cut funding for library services. As a 
result, the library's services have been neglected, Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's library commission is expected to recommend how the money should be 
spent before a final decision is made, he said. JAMES BENNING

YOUTHS: LEARNING FROM POSITIVE FEEDBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am tired of hearing negative things about the youth of today. Items about 
our young people, being pushed by the news media, are almost always negative. 
The media say that this is what the public wants to hear about, what sells 
their newspapers or broadcasts. Adults complain about the terrible pressures 
today's parents have: worries about drugs, gangs, drive-by shootings or HIV 
infecting or corrupting their children. 
</P>
<P>
 I have worked with the youth of the area for 25 years. Kids have not changed. 
What has changed is the way adults are treating today's youth. As adults, we 
have the task of giving our youth what they need to develop into the adults we 
want them to become. They need our love, respect and acknowledgment when they 
accomplish positive goals. We should be acknowledging their successes, and we 
are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago I managed an all-star team that won the U.S. championship and 
placed third in the world. We struggled to get newspeople to acknowledge this 
achievement. However, when one of these young men tragically took his own life, 
his family and the other young men on the team were flooded by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 In viewing the sports pages in our newspapers, I find column after column 
devoted to the sports labor problems but little about our high school sports 
programs. When I called one newspaper, I was told that the coverage given last 
year to high school teams had been cut out because with the strikes in the 
professional sports, fewer pages were needed in the sports section. Try to find 
a television station that gives any coverage to high school sports. They used 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Until we start giving the positive responses our kids need, they will continue 
to turn to gangs, drugs and other negatives to get some kind of attention from 
us. It isn't easy, but whoever said that raising our youth would be easy? It is 
work, but the rewards are the greatest life has to offer, because our young 
people are our greatest treasures.

PROP. 187: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND SCAPEGOATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The kids came by this morning shouting, "187 -- no." I applaud them. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not thinking money, as so many adults do.They may not even think 
about the gangsters, who, with nothing to do all day, may be waiting to jump 
them when school lets out. 
</P>
<P>
 They are thinking about people: their friends and buddies, who are being given 
a dirty deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these friends may get sick and be denied medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 They think of fellow students, some outstanding, who will be cheated out of 
the rest of their education. 
</P>
<P>
 They think about hard-working mothers and fathers who may lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was their age, a gentleman named Adolf Hitler decided to blame all the 
nation's troubles on the Jews. Jews had to be specially identified. Teachers 
and others who helped them were severely punished. 
</P>
<P>
 An old Jewish friend who spent time in Auschwitz told me that every morning 
the stench of human fat stunk up the barracks, and you wondered who it was that 
you would never see again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of my wartime buddies lost their lives driving this evil man from power. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's back. Adolf Wilson blames all our troubles on poor illegal 
immigrants, many of whom are working hard to make this a better country. 
</P>
<P>
 When I came to Carson, 11-year-old Victor folded and prepared 2,000 flyers for 
me. No other kid has ever worked so fast or thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 He was illegal. He's back in Mexico now. But whether he's American or Mexican, 
he was a wonderful little kid.

ELECTIONS: NEGATIVE VIEW OF POLITICAL FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after the elections I realized that I hadn't mentioned voting day or 
the campaigns even once to my young students. At first I was horrified at my 
omission, wondering how I could have forgotten this very important topic so 
easily and completely. I searched my soul and discovered that my revulsion at 
what we had just been witnessing for the past weeks and months might have had 
something to do with my mental lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that we have, as a society, finally sunk to our lowest depths. Our 
candidates demonstrated the worst in the human spirit, mindlessly and 
ruthlessly snarling at each other, mad with the lust for power. Their only 
apparent thought was to shred their opponents, not to build a better life for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, we have a microcosm of the ills of government. In Rancho Palos 
Verdes, the politicians have been busy turning their side of the peninsula into 
another version of Beverly Hills, stripping the community of any hope of a 
beautiful riding and hiking trail system. So much for keeping the historical 
memory of the old Rancho days alive.  
</P>
<P>
 In Rolling Hills Estates, the politicians have been busy as well. Our street 
has a potentially hazardous and unhealthy situation that the majority of the 
council has ignored for years. The one person on the council who wanted to help 
us residents was thrown off our committee and replaced with people who will do 
anything to defeat justice in our case. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been cloistered in the classroom too long. I truly used to believe that 
civic government was formed to help protect public health and safety, among 
other things. To further complicate our misery, this same champion of our 
well-being was repeatedly denied the opportunity to serve as mayor. As mayor, 
our representative would have automatically served on the board of the agency 
that could have effected a cure, but was denied that opportunity for obviously 
political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish I could say better political times will come, but I don't believe they 
will. No great leaders are on the horizon, and with our lack of commitment to 
even educate our children, we have no reason to believe we can nurture one.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; HOMELESS CHILDREN GET SHOES THANKS TO HOLIDAY DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A podiatrist from St. John's Hospital is making sure that homeless children 
are well-heeled for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the Stride Rite shoe store chain and students from the John 
Thomas Dye school in Bel-Air, Dr. Michael Levi has collected more than 500 
pairs of children's shoes over the past few weeks.He donated them to Para Los 
Ninos, a family support center in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the main thrust of the holiday shoe drive -- "Shoes for the Needy" -- 
ended last week, Levi says he is still accepting donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Stride Rite donated 300 new pairs and set up collection bins in its Los 
Angeles area stores for used shoes. Students from the John Thomas Dye school 
donated an additional 200 pairs, and Levi also received an unspecified number 
of donations from employees of St. John's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 This holiday children's shoe drive is a special twist on an ongoing project 
that Levi started in 1990. A volunteer at the Venice Family Clinic, Levi 
noticed that many of the homeless patients he treated went barefoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "People usually donate clothes, not shoes," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 To donate shoes, contact Levi at (310) 829-3636. MARY MOORE

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; MAN ARRESTED IN SERIES OF ROBBERIES OF CONVENIENCE 
STORES, GAS STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police last week arrested a man believed responsible for at least 
six armed robberies of convenience stores and gas stations in the Hollywood 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Michael Jones, 19, also may be charged with attempted murder in 
the Nov. 9 shooting of a clerk at a Mobil gas station at 655 N. Western Ave., 
said Los Angeles Police Detective Steve Bucher. The attempted murder charge is 
pending an interview with the victim, who is hospitalized in stable condition 
with a gunshot wound in the abdomen, Bucher said. The victim has not been 
identified by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who was arrested Nov. 16, has been charged with six counts of robbery. 
He is likely to face additional robbery charges as police continue their 
investigation into similar holdups in the area, Bucher said. Jones may have 
committed eight or more robberies in the past month, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In most of the crimes, the gunman entered the store and brought an item to the 
cash register for purchase. When the clerk rang up the sale and the cash drawer 
opened, the suspect pulled out a handgun and demanded that the clerk empty the 
register, Bucher said. It is unclear why the robber shot the Mobil station 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the robberies netted the suspect a few hundred dollars each, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Security cameras captured several of the robberies on videotape. The video, 
which was aired on local news broadcasts, and a $5,000 reward offered by Mobil 
Corp. led to a number of tips to the robber's identity, Bucher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses also described a man fitting Jones' description after a Nov. 
7 robbery of an AM/PM mini-mart at 5777 Hollywood Blvd. Among the witnesses was 
KCBS-TV reporter Judd McIlvain, who was reportedly held at gunpoint after he 
walked into the robbery in progress, police said. McIlvain reported that the 
gunman robbed him of a gold ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators tracked down Jones, who was living on the streets in Hollywood, 
and arrested him without incident. SUSAN STEINBERG

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; STUDENT BODY POLITIC; PROP. 187 BATTLE HAS SPURRED 
TEEN-AGERS TO ACTIVISM. THEY HAVE STAGED MARCHES, WALKOUTSAND FORUMS, AND THE 
MOMENTUM IS STILL GOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the days following the passage of Proposition 187, school officials around 
the South Bay tried to reassure students that nothing had really changed. 
</P>
<P>
 In schools from Lennox and Inglewood to San Pedro, the official message is 
that, for now, everything will be just as if the measure had not passed. 
</P>
<P>
 But everything isn't the same, because many of the kids are different. Now 
they are political. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Proposition 187, which denies non-emergency medical care and education 
to people who are not legal residents, it was enough to study, hang out with 
friends, primp for boys or posture for girls. But propositions and petitions, 
the U.S Constitution and elections became major concerns for many students in 
the days before the Nov. 8 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Students have marched into city halls, walked out of school or stayed past 
dismissal time, and organized political forums and discussions. Now some are 
trying to keep the new activism alive, and they are working on citizenship 
drives and pressuring local politicians to fight the initiative in court. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, meanwhile, continue to stress that neither students nor 
their parents have anything to fear -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the Inglewood Unified School District would like to assure you that 
even with the passage of this proposition, all children will continue to be 
enrolled," reads a letter from Supt. McKinley Nash and board President Lois 
Hill-Hale. "We do not report the legal status of any student or families to 
government agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox Supt. Kenneth L. Moffett wrote a similar letter to parents, sent on the 
eve of the election: "All of our procedures and activities will go on as usual. 
Nothing will change in Lennox tomorrow, or in the next few weeks, if at all." 
</P>
<P>
 At Inglewood High School, Principal Kenneth Crowe said he made the rounds to 
classes with heavy Latino enrollment to assure them that "we love them and that 
they are wanted and welcome here. They know that they're my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The reassurances seem to have quelled the fear that many Latino students and 
parents felt on Election Day. But for students, Proposition 187's passage has 
left in its wake a powerful awareness of the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lennox, a district that prides itself on meeting all of the education needs 
of its primarily Latino population, faculty are using the election results to 
teach lessons on political activism. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Tuesday after the election, Lennox Middle School students held a 
"stay-in," hoping to counter the impression made by student walkouts. Students 
remained in school for half an hour after the bell for dismissal, doing 
homework or talking about Proposition 187 with teachers. That night, students 
attended the school board meeting to ask school officials to give financial 
support to lawsuits against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers and some students in Lennox wore black the Thursday after the 
election, and counselor Pam Rector purchased black bows for colleagues and 
students to tape to their clothes. They met in the school library during lunch 
period to discuss their feelings about the passage of Proposition 187. The 
cardboard casket left over from a Halloween dance was propped up in front with 
"Our Hope Will Resurrect" on the front. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, Rector asked them, did they think people were wearing black? Answers 
included "Because justice died" and "Because the spirit of little Mexican kids 
died." 
</P>
<P>
 The answers reflected the shock many students felt. They simply did not 
believe the initiative would pass because nobody they knew was for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is they live in Lennox, so they don't see anything but people like 
them," Rector said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt bad and kind of scared when it passed," said sixth-grader Michael 
Galindo.. "I figured that maybe California people wanted their own place, with 
all the space for themselves, without Mexican people or Japanese or others."  
</P>
<P>
 Lennox, an unincorporated community of about two square miles located north of 
Hawthorne, has about 20,000 residents, most of whom are Latino, with the rest 
divided among Pacific Islanders, blacks and whites. Lennox voted against 
Proposition 187, with 53% rejecting the measure and 47% supporting it, but only 
about 1,000 people -- half of those eligible -- voted Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, when Lennox Middle School held elections Nov. 8, virtually the 
entire student population voted; 800 students were against Proposition 187 and 
64 were for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90 students who participated in the library forum after elections were 
unanimously against the initiative. Attendance was voluntary and the first few 
minutes were devoted to discussion about students' fears and hurt feelings. But 
the talk did not linger for long on bad feelings. Soon faculty were asking the 
students what they wanted to do in response to the election.  
</P>
<P>
 Marie Smith stood up in front of her classmates and exhorted them to hold the 
stay-in. "People will say, 'Wow, those kids must really want their education,' 
" said Smith, 13. "But whatever it is, you've got to be committed to what 
you're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 students ultimately participated in the stay-in, remaining in school 
half an hour past dismissal time. 
</P>
<P>
 After Smith rallied her classmates, social studies teacher Wayne Fugate 
congratulated the students on their political activism. "But one thing that's 
important is to respect it if your friends or other people don't agree with 
you," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Counselor Jim Keese, who walked precincts in Lennox the weekends before the 
election, told the students how sad he was that Proposition 187 had passed, but 
that their desire to express themselves politically gave him hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that you are learning to stand up for what you are entitled to," 
Keese said. 
</P>
<P>
 The air of activism in Lennox is not unanimous, and not all students took part 
in the discussions or protests against Proposition 187. But if they wanted to, 
their teachers helped them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Lennox teachers say that opposing Proposition 187 and reassuring their 
students that they are safe and welcome in school are one and the same. But 
even some teachers who are adamant opponents of the measure say they worry 
about whether their zeal is always appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a close line that we're walking," Fugate said after the library forum. 
"I know some parents and teachers have asked that we be sure to present the 
other side of Proposition 187 -- not just our opposition to it. That's why I 
urged them to respect everyone's opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Rector also wrestles with how much activism is appropriate. After floating the 
idea of the stay-in, she backed off and let the students organize it 
themselves, she said. "I decided that I'd really done enough and that if they 
really wanted to do it, that they would go ahead and do it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 In Inglewood, adults at Morningside High School were not guiding the students 
in political activism, mainly because the high school students had taken the 
lead.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has forced us to be politically aware in a way that we never were 
before," said Carlos Barragan, a senior who is president of the Morningside 
chapter of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, a student organization 
known as MEChA, focusing on Mexican and Mexican American issues that has 
chapters on high school and college campuses, mainly in the West. "Our group 
was really cultural, but now we see that we're going to have to be political 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the election, Principal Liza Daniels allowed MEChA to have lunchtime 
forums and pass out literature against the proposition. MEChA took a leading 
role in organizing students, informing them about the specifics of the 
proposition and persuading them not to join walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told the other kids that the school is on our side," Barragan said. 
"There's no reason to walk out of it."  
</P>
<P>
 Daniels had spent the days before the election making announcements over the 
intercom to students. After Proposition 187 passed, she met with teachers to 
discuss how to direct students' feelings about the initiative into classroom 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sense a silent positivism here," Daniels said. "I think our students know 
that they're cared about." 
</P>
<P>
 Barragan and MEChA member Nora Cisneros agreed. "The school has done all it 
can to make us feel secure," Cisneros said. "They explained over the intercom 
how we all have the right to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 But in spite of the school's efforts, Barragan said he believes Latino 
students in general have a sense of being on the margins of society. 
</P>
<P>
 "People stereotype us as Latinos and as teen-agers, saying we don't care about 
this country, but teen-agers care," Barragan said. "It's just that this country 
doesn't take us how we are. We don't learn about our contributions to America 
and so we don't feel like we're really in." 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of not fitting into American society increased exponentially for 
Barragan after the election, he said, partly because he misread the mood of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think it would pass," Barragan said. "I thought it was 
inhuman." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in Inglewood supported Proposition 187 by a margin of 53% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the initiative passing, Latino students benefited from their 
efforts to defeat it, both Barragan and Cisneros said.  
</P>
<P>
 "What was good was that young people got together, and it was people our own 
age who told other kids what was happening," Cisneros said. "Adults didn't do 
it. We did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Morningside MEChA chapter holds holiday food drives and works with the 
National Assn. of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO) on citizenship projects. 
Those efforts will see new vigor because of Proposition 187, Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now what we need to do is to tell people to go to school, go to adult school 
if necessary, learn English and learn how to have a voice and vote," Cisneros 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at San Pedro High School were also responsible for rallying their 
peers against the initiative before Election Day, and while life is back to 
normal on campus, the activism remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike students at Morningside, many at San Pedro High walked out of school 
before Election Day to protest the proposition. Five students were the primary 
organizers, meeting during lunch periods to plan the marches. Carrying homemade 
signs and Mexican flags under the watchful eye of police and at times school 
administrators, the students made their point by walking more than 25 miles 
over two days, marching from San Pedro High to Banning High School in 
Wilmington and on to Carson High School.  
</P>
<P>
 After the second march, Principal Rey Mayoral asked the protest leaders to 
return to class. They complied, and the campus has not seen disturbances since 
the proposition passed Nov. 8, but they are planning post-election forums to 
keep the issue alive. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the student leaders, senior Daniel Velasquez, said that although the 
protests did not help defeat the measure, the efforts were successful in other 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people now understand what was going on," he said. "It brought out 
the best in the Latinos on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said he understands now that carrying Mexican flags did not 
accomplish the political ends that students desired. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were unsuccessful, it was our own fault," he said, referring to the 
group's failure to include American flags in the marches. 
</P>
<P>
 The new student activism undoubtedly will recede for some but not for others. 
And in places like Lennox, teachers say their students have no plans to let it 
die down. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox students have formed a political action committee, which will encourage 
the community to attend a citizenship fair Jan. 28 at the school, to take the 
first steps toward becoming citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids have found that they've been empowered to act," Lennox's Rector 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 She said that also means that school officials should be ready to have 
students question their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because if the school implements something that they think isn't right," 
Rector said, "we've already taught them some strategies so they can be heard."

CENTERPIECE: PULLING OFF SOME SEASONAL MAGIC; YOU CAN ENSURE THAT FESTIVITIES 
ARE A CELEBRATION INSTEAD OF A CHORE BY MAKING USE OF SPECIALITY SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tick. Tick. Tick. 
</P>
<P>
 If you hadn't noticed before today, the sight of Santa Claus bringing up the 
rear of a Thanksgiving Day parade probably pounded the point into your head: 
The holidays are upon us, big time. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hanukkah, Christmas and New Year's looming ahead, there are parties to 
host and attend; out-of-town guests to house, feed and entertain; food to buy 
and prepare; cards to send out; gifts to select, pay for, and deliver; houses 
and trees to decorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is tight enough February through October for the average Ventura County 
resident. But add on the extra holiday chores (sorry, make that pleasures) and 
there's not much time left to breathe. And better make that a shallow breath. A 
deep one and you've wasted a good three to five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tick. Tick. Tick. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't it about this time last year you said, "Next year, I'll shop early, say 
no to hosting the family get-together, and just keep it simple?" Oops. Forgot 
about that, didn't you? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't mean to seem Scrooge-like -- the holidays are a festive time of year. 
Time can be a problem, but as with most problems, there are solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 We here at Life would like to offer some suggestions on saving time this 
holiday season. You may be one of those independent types who likes to take on 
a challenge all alone, but don't be ashamed to accept help. There are plenty of 
businesses more than willing to lend a hand as the holidays gain momentum and 
the stress builds. 
</P>
<P>
 But before we get to the tips, let's talk briefly about the stress. With 
relatives visiting and malls packed with shoppers, lack of time is only one 
aspect of holiday stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Sitko, a Ventura therapist, sees another. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I hear most about holiday stress is the guilt, the feeling of 
obligation," she said of the mandatory gift-giving and party-throwing. "If 
someone doesn't have the time to do everything, but they don't feel guilty 
about it, they just say, 'I'm just not going to do it this year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, no sense of obligation, no guilt, no stress over the shortage of time. 
It's great if you can do it. But for those of you who do feel that obligation, 
and do hear the ticking of the holiday clock, here are some suggestions 
regarding gift-giving, party planning and house decorating. LIMITING THE LIST 
</P>
<P>
 We'll begin with the gifts. Sitko suggests limiting the list of recipients to 
a precious few -- maybe just the very closest relatives and friends. "I buy 
gifts just for the children," she said, "and that has eased a lot of the stress 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 There's always the generic gift certificate, to save on time. And don't 
forget, you can always invoke that "naughty or nice" clause for the 
undeserving. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalogues and home shopping networks are two other ways to go. You can shop 
to your heart's content by phone without leaving the comforts of your favorite 
chair. Unfortunately, it's a little late in the game, since you often must 
allow four to six weeks for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 If it ultimately comes down to conventional department store shopping, 
however, there's still no need to feel overwhelmed. At Bullock's in Thousand 
Oaks, there's a person on staff who helps people shop. And if you can afford to 
spend an extra few bucks, you can hire someone to shop for you. We tracked down 
a few of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Albanese of Simi Valley loves to shop. She had considered turning the 
pastime into gainful employment for several years, but it wasn't until a couple 
of months ago that she finally started her Shop Around Town service. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is a crisis negotiator for the city of Los Angeles (Police 
Department). He was at the mansion when O.J. surrendered. There was all this 
hoopla around him," said Albanese. "I said, 'You know, honey, you get to do a 
lot of fun things. You've done what you wanted to do your whole life. Don't you 
think it's time I get to do what I want to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Shop Around Town was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a fair amount of people in our community who have the financial 
resources, but they have those financial resources because they are 
workaholics. They have the money, but what they don't have is the time," said 
Albanese. "Most of my clients are men because they lack the real desire to 
shop. Absolutely one of the most distasteful things for them to do is enter a 
mall." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Albanese's clients know exactly what they want her to buy, other 
times she needs to conduct an interview. She may offer suggestions, or let them 
browse through her couple of hundred catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us buy gifts we enjoy receiving, so it's not so much that I need to 
understand who the recipient is, but who the giver is," she said. "I try to 
please the giver. If they are proud of the gift and pleased to give it, then my 
job is done." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak View's Lynne Stanfield, operator of Santa's Little Helper, a year-round 
personal shopping service, sees her business as a way of helping people 
prioritize their chores during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows people to take away one of the pressures of the holidays. It's 
enough to sit down and make a shopping list," she said. "If someone is willing 
to do your buying and even wrap the gifts for you, then that allows you to 
focus on spending time with the family, or planning a dinner, or putting up 
decorations, or sending out cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanfield's clients range from men who don't have a clue about what to buy for 
that special person, to women who don't like to shop or can't fit the activity 
into an already hectic schedule. Nonetheless, like Stanfield, her clients 
realize the significance of gift-giving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the basic things in our culture that shows caring," Stanfield 
said. "It's a tradition of showing love and respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Before meeting with prospective clients, Stanfield conducts introductory 
telephone conversations to determine general needs. Then, like Albanese, she 
meets with the gift-givers to determine specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find out their needs and directions. Do they know specifically what they 
want? Do they need ideas? Shopping is my specialty and I have a knack for 
knowing where to find something. I know the importance of efficiency and I know 
the value of a dollar," said Stanfield. PLAYING HOST 
</P>
<P>
 As with gift giving, there are simple solutions to the hassles of hosting a 
holiday dinner, whether it be for a large group of friends or a small 
collection of relatives. Just say no, would be one, said therapist Sitko. Short 
of that, a potluck might do wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Potlucks are very popular," she said. "People are beginning to ask guests to 
bring a pie or the vegetables. I know some people say that's not appropriate, 
but it's becoming more accepted. People like to be invited to parties, so they 
don't care if they have to bring something." 
</P>
<P>
 If you do end up stuck with the entire holiday meal, you may want to consider 
hiring a caterer or a personal chef. Let's start with the personal chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Kidd of Mira Monte, a perennial finalist in local cooking contests, is 
such a person. Earlier this month, she began her What's for Dinner? business, 
in which she meets with clients, prepares a menu, buys the groceries and 
delivers 10 customized dinners to be frozen and heated when desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd had an instant response when she first promoted her business, and expects 
a feeding frenzy over the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women will spend three weeks planning, shopping and preparing for just one 
meal -- Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner," she said. "This is stuff you can go 
home and heat up; the longest takes about 30 minutes." Just pop them into the 
oven when the guests arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd greets prospective clients with a food questionnaire to help her plan the 
menu. Typically, the result is five different sets of meals prepared for two. 
But she'll gladly prepare a holiday party and charges a set fee per 10 meals. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're talking catering, however, often it means large orders. But there 
are independent caterers who will serve small gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Corning of Kay's Gourmet Catering in Westlake tends to do huge events 
(such as the Sears Roebuck employees party), but she and her staff are 
available for groups as small as 25. And if you pick up the precooked food 
rather than having it delivered, served and cleaned up, she will prepare as few 
as 10 meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, your pocketbook may dictate the amount of food you have catered. 
But if you're willing to take on some of the main dish cooking chores, you 
might want a caterer who just provides the appetizers or desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually people call us because they want a dessert that's a little fancier 
than they've normally dealt with in the past, and the idea of trying to make it 
during the holidays is a little overwhelming for them," said La Starr Heiliger, 
owner of La Starr and Company in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the most obvious form of dinner help? Just because you're 
hosting a fancy feast, doesn't mean you should ignore takeout food. And the 
ultimate in takeout may very well be The Town Waiter, operated by Rick and 
Meredith Solano. 
</P>
<P>
 The Town Waiter offers a stable of drivers who will pick up meals from 
selected restaurants around town and deliver them to your home (provided you 
live in Ventura, Oxnard, Port Hueneme or Camarillo.) 
</P>
<P>
 Though they are closed Christmas Eve and Day, and New Year's Eve, they plan to 
be busy the rest of the season. "People have already begun making Christmas 
plans and parties," Rick Solano said. "They call and reserve a time, even 
though they don't know what they're having yet." 
</P>
<P>
 One last suggestion: Suppose you are more than happy to prepare all the food 
yourself, or you manage to get guests to bring dishes. What about the cleanup? 
Guests are more likely to race toward the front door than toward the kitchen 
sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiliger, an instructor in Oxnard College's Hotel, Restaurant, Management 
program, suggests employing some of her students. "They can do service and then 
clean up," she said. LIGHTING DECOR 
</P>
<P>
 You know those Christmas lights you shoved into a box several years ago and 
have never found the time to restring on the outside of the house? Wouldn't it 
be nice if they would magically attach themselves to the eaves? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sorry, they won't. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are people out there willing to do the hanging for you. They're 
called handymen, or painters, or anyone with the right tools and skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's Eric Kinsey has hung lights for friends and family in past years, 
but this season is extending the service to total strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once word got around, I realized how great the demand was," Kinsey said. "I 
talked to people after last Christmas and they said, 'Yeah, we really wanted to 
hang lights but we didn't have the time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey said time really is the major obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people pretty much have a set way of how they want their homes 
decorated, they just want someone to do it," he said. But that doesn't mean 
Kinsey won't offer some decorating advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hartman of Hartman Handyman Service in Ventura has been asked to hang 
lights on occasion. He said it's usually a last-minute thing, when people find 
they've run out of time to do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also been asked to pick up and haul away Christmas trees, and even put 
together those daunting gifts that require assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once got a call on Christmas Day," he said, "to put together a dollhouse." 
</P>
<P>
 So there you have it. There's no need to worry about time as long as you have 
a little extra money to pay someone to work for you. That, or some very close 
friends who will pitch in for free. Now you can breathe easier, right? Take a 
deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Tick. Tick. Tick. 10 Ways to Save Time 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 10 tips to help you save time over the hectic holidays, as offered up 
by local experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Instead of preparing all the food for your holiday dinner party, make it a 
potluck. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you don't want to have a potluck, have the dinner catered, or suggest 
instead that everyone go to a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy gifts for a select group of friends and family, not everyone you've ever 
met. 
</P>
<P>
 * Or consider drawing names out of a hat, especially if you have a large 
family. Buy a gift only for the person whose name you pulled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hire a personal shopper. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hire a personal gift wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get a handyman to put up the Christmas lights. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay someone to haul the Christmas tree from the farm to your front door. If 
selecting a tree is too much of a tradition to tamper with, at least hire 
someone to dispose of the tree after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you end up with one of those hard-to-assemble gifts, contact the 
neighborhood handyman for some help, rather than fuss over it for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get out of town. HELP IS HERE

COVER STORY; TEAM EXTREME; SPORTS: FIVE FITNESS DEVOTEES SACRIFICE SWEAT AND 
PAIN TO TEST THE LIMITS OF ENDURANCE IN A GRUELING 300-MILE RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the prospect of little more than bragging rights, five Westsiders are 
offering up their bodies on the altar of physical fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 Machismo or masochism? You be the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking marathons here. Marathons are for wimps. We're not even 
talking 50-mile ultra-marathons, which these people see as little more than 
training tuneups. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking a virtually sleepless weeklong (or more if you get lost) race 
across 300 trackless miles of Utah. On foot, horseback, canoe, bicycle and 
river raft. Up who knows how many thousands of feet of mountain and rappelling 
down the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and for any of this suffering to count, everybody on the team has to 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Eco-Challenge, not some namby-pamby relay race. 
</P>
<P>
 So, from now until the competition's April 25 starting date, Michael Carson, 
Charles C. Adams IV, Laurie Ward, Andy Petranek and Michael Lowe will devote 
mornings, evenings and entire weekends to riding, rowing, running, biking, 
climbing, weightlifting, map-reading and -- perhaps the toughest exercise of 
all -- psychological bonding. 
</P>
<P>
 And for what? 
</P>
<P>
 Team members claim not to know what the prize is. For them, the chance to 
participate in the craziest of all endurance events is motivation enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all had experience in extreme activities and this goes way beyond what 
any of us could do individually," said Petranek, 27, a chemical engineer and 
former Marine captain who lives in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning purse is actually $10,000 -- and free entry for next year's 
competition, organizers said. But if the Westsiders are fuzzy about the 
monetary reward, they are clear on what they are giving up to compete against 
49 other teams for a chance at glory, and they are scouring the woodwork for 
sponsors to defray costs that are expected to total $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all going to put in more time and money than we'll ever get back," said 
Carson, 27, a Brentwood aerobics instructor, after a recent group horseback 
riding lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to mention burning through a hundred relationships along the way," added 
advertising executive Adams, 30, of Malibu, another former Marine captain. "You 
don't have much of a personal life." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for this five-way marriage of sorts, all are single. 
</P>
<P>
 They teamed up almost at random. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams and Petranek, buddies since the service, heard about the race from a 
would-be competitor who was pitching the event on a radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 They interviewed him but dismissed him as a potential team member. Putting up 
a flyer on the bulletin board at Gold's Gym, they quickly found Ward, 36, a 
legal secretary, long-distance runner and Century City resident. Contest rules 
say teams cannot be all men or all women. 
</P>
<P>
 A notice in a sporting goods store brought in Lowe, 27, of Venice, a high 
school English teacher, filmmaker and recent graduate of mountaineering 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 And mutual friends put them together with Carson, who survived an earlier 
effort in the French-sponsored Raid Gauloises, a similar endurance derby in 
which his team broke up amid acrimony in the Sultanate of Oman. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Mark Burnett, a former British army paratrooper and Carson's captain in 
that ill-fated foray, who organized Eco-Challenge as the U.S. version of the 
French event. Teams will be required to perform a community service project 
before the race, and the rules will penalize teams that do anything to harm the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 For Eco-Challenge, Carson brought with him the sponsorship of the Ex Officio 
outdoor clothing firm, which picked up the $7,500 tab to enter the Utah race. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 40 teams from 22 states have already signed up for the competition, along 
with 10 foreign entries. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis, but Burnett said 
some sifting had to be done to insure a geographic spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we could have had 50 teams from Southern California with its 
strong triathlon base, which wouldn't have been very interesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still more teams from California than anywhere else, but other 
entries will be coming from the East Coast and the South. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Westside team, the first steps were easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so pumped," Petranek said. "I met Laurie Friday night and by Monday we 
had a sponsor and a five-person team. It was destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, they were destined to get to know each other almost too well. Since they 
started getting serious about training in early September, they have devoted 
virtually all their free time to a grueling practice regimen intended to 
replicate the harsh conditions of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lowe put it, "We threw ourselves into several frying pans to see how we'd 
fare. We learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing they learned was that spending all that time with your extreme 
sports buddies takes a toll on relationships with significant others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things get kind of testy," Carson said. "It just puts a strain on it." 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the harshest lessons came in the San Bernardino Mountains last 
month when a hike up the flank of Mt. San Gorgonio turned into a miasma of 
mountaineering missteps. 
</P>
<P>
 They started the trek at midnight. When the day dawned with the team at 9,000 
feet, Ward saw what she thought was a simple cold bloom into full-blown flu 
just as an unexpected snowstorm whipped the summit of the mountain, Southern 
California's tallest peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran marathoner was close to a potentially fatal case of hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 But with two miles to go to the peak, the decision was made to press on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so cold. I was dying," Ward said. "I didn't want to stop the team and 
I didn't want to back down. Being a woman, I felt like I needed to prove myself 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they got to the 11,499-foot summit, the thermometer had dropped to 
19 degrees and a brisk wind made for a windchill factor of well below zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Petranek and Adams started down, hoping to set up a tent and a stove at a 
lower altitude, but the strong wind and steep terrain offered no place to make 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 As she followed, Ward's pace faltered and her body temperature dropped to 90 
degrees. She felt lethargic and was unable to lift her hand to feed herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could easily get into a coma, so I got into a sleeping bag with her," 
Lowe said. "After an hour of hugging and kissing . . . " The kissing part was a 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey! You said you wouldn't tell anyone," Ward laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her strength returned, but the team was sobered by the dangers of extreme 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every week we've learned about each other," Ward said. "This race is going to 
be 90% mental." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the team was within five miles of finishing a 50-mile 
ultra-marathon when Petranek's knees gave out. They all dropped out rather than 
break up the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Team members have found themselves taking headers off mountain bikes, dunking 
themselves in the water at Marina del Rey and quivering with fear before 
dropping down a vertical cliff face, supported by nothing more than a rope. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom calls me every Monday and I tell her what I did on the weekend and she 
goes, 'Ooh, I don't like that,' " Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Carson: "The event requires an incredible amount of will and pushing 
beyond yourself, but there's still a call for good judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight months of training, his previous team fell apart in bitter 
acrimony well before the finish line of the 1992 Raid Gauloises in Oman, an 
event that one survivor described as "the Outward Bound trip from hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "Each person was out for himself after being lost for days," Carson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Their confusion was understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Utah race, as in the Raid Gauloises, competitors will have no idea 
where they are going until 24 hours before the race begins, at which point they 
will be issued a set of maps and coordinates for 30 checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 During the previous French-organized versions of the race, winning teams have 
come in as much as four days ahead of last-place finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make this equally brains as it is brawn," Burnett said. 
"There will be a lot of intelligence needed, a lot of cryptic stuff, misleading 
clues and things you've got to think through. Things will not always be as they 
seem, just like real life." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be up to each team to find its way, deciding when and where to make 
concessions to physical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the competition's promotional literature puts it: "They will sleep when 
they dare and move while they can . . . They will search for their limits in a 
beautiful but untamed and sometimes harsh landscape . . . Their friends are the 
map, the compass, the full moon and each other. Their enemy -- time." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers will provide the horses (each team will get three to distribute 
among its five members), rafts, bicycles, canoes and mountain-climbing gear. 
But additional help will be limited to four spots along the route where backup 
teams will supply food, medical care and whatever moral support they can. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westside team's backup crew is scheduled to include E.S. (Bud) Beggs, 
co-owner of the San Dimas stable where they have been learning the rudiments of 
horsemanship, and Robert Forster, a Santa Monica physical therapist whose 
clients include prominent athletes such as Olympic champion Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee. 
</P>
<P>
 And now that tired old question: Why? Because it's there? 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who do this race have either experienced something deep in life or 
they're at that point where you want to draw that out," said Jon Aguilar, 25, 
of Santa Monica, a member of a rival team called Spirit Extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week on the run, said Aguilar, a former Marine reconnaissance 
specialist, "You learn to appreciate things in life a lot more -- just a cup of 
coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, said Michael S. Goldstein, a professor of public health at UCLA, 
self-denial on this scale "makes you appreciate normalcy in a different way, . 
. . and it's one of the very basic things found in lots of religions." 
</P>
<P>
 For the competitor, he said, "there's a spiritual component." 
</P>
<P>
 And even for couch potatoes -- the race is to be featured in an MTV special -- 
"it seems to epitomize the drive to convert physical sacrifice and even 
physical pain into something positive that people seek out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people hearing about it," he said, "it's providing a kind of icon for 
what they could hope to aspire to. . . . If you could do what they're doing, 
boy, you could really be responsible for controlling yourself in a way that 
most people can't."

 Most of Ventura County's actors, actresses and behind-the-scenes folk enjoy 
spending the holidays at home with their families. Still, the show must go on. 
And indeed it does, with a number of local companies providing holiday 
entertainment, with some of the productions more holiday-related than others. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to know who Sholem Aleichem was to enjoy the richness of 
"Fiddler on the Roof." The musical show, based on the turn-of-the-century 
Jewish author's stories of life in a pre-revolution Russian village, is filled 
with tradition -- not to mention songs including the best-known "If I Were a 
Rich Man" and "Sunrise, Sunset." The Ojai Art Center's stirring production ends 
this Saturday night. For more information, call 646-0117. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bolt's "A Man for All Seasons" concerns Christianity, specifically the 
decision by Henry VIII to rebel against the Roman Catholic Church, which 
wouldn't allow him a divorce, and to form the Church of England, which would. 
The Santa Paula Theater Center's production is top-notch, featuring a number of 
Ventura County's best actors in top form. The show closes Dec. 4, and will be 
followed -- if current plans work out -- by a special holiday presentation of 
songs and readings. For more information on either program, call 525-4645. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the same material that provided the inspiration for the '50s film 
"Lili," the Broadway musical "Carnival" has nothing to do with the holidays. 
But the story of romance in a small traveling French show is tune-filled, 
colorful and festive entertainment for all but the youngest family members. The 
Conejo Players' production concludes Dec. 10. For information, call 495-3715. 
</P>
<P>
 To be reviewed next week, the California Shakespeare Company's production of 
"Henry V" is amusing and action-packed, though again not holiday-themed. It 
closes Dec. 18. For information, call 498-3354. 
</P>
<P>
 We haven't seen the Elite Theatre Company's production of "The Cemetery Club," 
which opens in Oxnard's Heritage Square on Dec. 18 and runs through Jan. 14. 
But the play, written by Ivan Menchell, concerns three Jewish widows who meet 
for tea once a month before visiting their husband's graves. One falls in love, 
upsetting the group's balance. The Oxnard company's shows have been decent 
enough in the past. For information, watch these pages or call 525-6219. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama & Vaudeville Company, "The Ransom 
of Rudolph" opens Friday and will be reviewed here next week. In the musical, 
Rudolph the Reindeer has been kidnaped by a rogue French-Canadian trapper, and 
it's up to Detective Inspector Lance Sterling of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police to nab the culprit in time for his holiday deliveries. Songs, costumes 
and wigs are Moorpark Melodrama hallmarks, and the group's quality is nothing 
if not consistent. For more information, call 529-1212. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they missed last year, the Santa Susana Repertory Company has made an 
annual event of "A Christmas Carol," and will bring their fifth edition -- 
again starring Eric Christmas as Scrooge and Rick Livingston as Bob Cratchit -- 
to the Forum Theatre at the new Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. The show runs 
Dec. 9 through 23, with performances Wednesdays through Sundays. For 
information, call 449-ARTS. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only two local companies have announced special New Years Eve plans, 
both with shows that will continue through January. Ventura's Plaza Players 
will open the variety show "Sophisticated Rhythm Lip-Syncs" on Dec. 31 with 
special food, drink and years-end paraphernalia. Call 643-9460 for details. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Melodrama will open its January show, "The Phantom of the Melodrama," 
with a New Years' Eve Italian buffet dinner, champagne and noisemakers at 
midnight. The show opens the Melodrama's new season, devoted to encores of 
previous productions. "Phantom" is advertised as the most requested melodrama 
show ever. For information, call 529-1212.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: WARM WELCOME, HOT PIZZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Borrelli's is a plainly decorated 22-seat pizza place (the visual highlight is 
a poster advertising a 1920s car show in Milan) in the pleasant Palos Verdes 
Estates community of Lunada Bay. Recently I went there with a friend who used 
to be a Borrelli's regular but hadn't been back for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 When we entered, manager Raphael Dominguez greeted her by name, as if he had 
just seen her the night before. It's probably that warm greeting, as well as 
the pizza, that has allowed this little neighborhood establishment to survive 
for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 While the pizzas won't make Wolfgang Puck overhaul his menu, they're reliable 
old-style pies with a slightly puffy, medium-thick crust and lots of gooey 
mozzarella. The toppings are traditional ones such as pepperoni, crumbled 
sausage, green bell peppers, button mushrooms and Canadian bacon. No 
mashed-potato-mango-smoked-Gouda pizzas here, though there is an ever-so-slight 
concession to the lighter modern taste in the offering of a shrimp and chicken 
sausage. Pizzas range from $7 to $17.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta choices include meatball or sausage-stuffed ravioli ($5.95), lasagna 
($5.95) and baked rigatoni ($5.25), short, ribbed tubes of pasta in a casserole 
with meat sauce and melted mozzarella cheese. All pastas come with soup or 
salad and garlic bread. 
</P>
<P>
 A word of warning: During the week, the place is taken over from 2 to 4 p.m. 
by students from the nearby junior high school, who flock to Borrelli's for a 
square piece of pizza ($1.25) and the two video machines. Basically, the place 
becomes a raucous school playground for two hours, so if you prefer a quiet 
atmosphere, pick another time to come.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if you're nostalgic for your school days, go there about 
quarter to three. Right around then, as Cab Calloway and his friends might have 
said, this joint is jumpin'. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrelli's is at 720 Yarmouth Road, Palos Verdes Estates. (310) 541-6545. Open 
Sunday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to 9 
p.m.

ROCK TALK; WHAT KILLS THE SEASON'S SPIRIT QUICKEST?; MUSICIANS PAN THE WEATHER, 
THE EARLY START, THE HYPE AND 'SANTA CLAUS WITH BAD BREATH.'

 Hurry. Counting today, there are only 31 shopping days left until Christmas. 
The holiday spirit, which begins as a mild uproar the day after Halloween, 
becomes a full blown frenzy starting the day after Thanksgiving. This makes 
Christmas the longest running one-day holiday of the year, and at the same 
time, grants eternal life to Christmas music. 
</P>
<P>
 Most local male musicians want the same thing for Christmas: a record deal, 
platinum records, videos all over MTV, a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills and all 
the women in every Aerosmith video. But until then, they'll have to be content 
with answering questions from local rock writers. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, the 64-cent question is: In addition to Christmas music itself, 
what kills the holiday spirit quickest for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Ball (harmonica player and singer, Ball & Sultan): "Santa Claus with bad 
breath, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Balbinot (guitarist, Roadhouse Rockers): "Well, I'm from Illinois, so 
it's probably that there's no snow or icicles. But I do like Christmas music." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Barajas (guitarist, JuJu Eyeball, Tijuana Hound Dogs): "Work." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Barnitz (singer, Spencer the Gardener): "I actually like Christmas 
music, so that doesn't kill my spirit. But I don't really like Christmas 
shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bays (bass player, Pinching Judy): "There's no snow, so that's a big 
downer for me, because palm trees don't make it for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 J. Peter Boles (folk singer): "It must be all the people out there tailgating 
you and trying to run you down, forgetting what Christmas is. In one word, it's 
probably the commercialism. But Christmas is a pretty big day; it's Jesus 
Christ's birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Brown (guitarist, Popsicko): "I'm not a Christmas pro, but I'm a 
Christmas fan, and I like Christmas music, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Denger (guitarist, Bloody Mary Morning): "Long lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Dru (singer, This Ascension): "It must be the commercialism of it all, and I 
spent too much money last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Emery (guitarist, Raging Arb & the Redheads): "I guess it's all the 
consumers for Christ at the mall parading around like robots." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Fishell (guitarist, Convertibles, Ordinaires): "Hey, I love Christmas. I 
have a separate box for all my Christmas albums. I love the Ventures Christmas 
album and the Phil Spector Christmas album; and you can't go wrong with the 
Elvis Christmas album. Also, Christmas is the only time of the year when you 
can overeat, drink dark beer and say 'Peace on Earth' without everyone thinking 
you're a hippie." 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Jeans (keyboard player, Lion I's, Trouser Trouts): "Having to shop, I 
guess, because I do my shopping the day before." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Jones (guitarist, House of Games): "Having it start right after 
Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Lawton (guitarist, Little Jonny & the Giants): "I'd say the decorations 
that go up right before Halloween, the Christmas decorations." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Lee (guitarist, Rice & Beans): "It would have to be all the fast-food 
promotions, with green milkshakes and stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Lemaire (guitarist, Ariel): "Mariah Carey." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Longo (guitarist, Led Zepagain): "When they start all the Christmas 
promotions too early and I have to start thinking about Christmas. Shopping is 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Lunetta (singer, the In Betweens): "Probably the overall commercialism 
of it all, and of course, having to spend time with the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Maddalone (singer, Ska Daddyz): "It's a drain on my bank account, but 
it's also a good reason to get drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Morris (guitarist, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy): "When Santa has gas." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Nack (singer and songwriter): "I always like the Christmas season -- 
really -- but hot weather ruins it for me. I'd like to go to Australia 
sometime. They have Christmas in the middle of the summer and Santa wears 
shorts in the mall." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Rainbow (guitarist, Zoo Story): "Probably just the over-commercialization 
and all the materialistic hype going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Ramirez (guitarist, J.D.'s Last Ride): "Christmas commercials, 
definitely, but otherwise, it's a happy time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 J.R. Richard (singer, Dishwalla): "Unhappy people pretty much kills the 
Christmas spirit for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Seiden (bass player, the Upbeat): "That's hard because I like 
Christmas. There's a lot of days in the year, and Christmas is just one of 
those days to be mellow and hang out with the family. Usually, I don't have to 
work, so it's just a day for us to enjoy ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Semple (guitarist, Contradiction): "It's probably all the people out and 
about. I was out today, and everybody is shopping for the happiest holiday of 
all time, cutting you off in the parking lot, and cutting you off in line." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Travolta (bass player, Phooey): "It's got to be elves. I don't like 
elves."

CHRISTMAS TREES CAN TRIGGER SOME ALLERGIES; IN MOST CASES, A LITTLE EXTRA CARE 
CAN PREVENT THE PROBLEM FROM OCCURRING, DOCTORS SAY. 
</P>

 Real Christmas trees can pose problems for millions of chronic allergy 
sufferers. But there are some simple steps allergy sufferers can take to 
significantly reduce the likelihood of such allergy attacks this holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Christmas Tree Assn. estimates that 34.1 million real trees will 
be purchased this holiday season. While very few people are allergic to pine 
and fir trees, at least half of the country's 40 million chronic allergy 
sufferers are sensitive to mold. And a freshly cut tree placed in water is a 
"perfect environment for mold," according to Chicago allergist Dr. Allan 
Luskin. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, many Christmas trees are already heavily covered with mold. When 
brought into the warm house, these molds release thousands of spores, said 
Luskin, a regent of the American College of Allergy and Immunology. "But the 
bigger problem is mold build-up in the tree water." 
</P>
<P>
 Mold spores are microscopic particles light enough to float in the atmosphere. 
When inhaled by a mold-sensitive person, they may cause a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reactions are often immediate for mold-sensitive people when walking into a 
house with a live tree loaded with mold," Luskin said. "The symptoms may 
include itchy eyes, runny nose and heavy wheezing." 
</P>
<P>
 How can this be prevented? Luskin recommends that mold-sensitive consumers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hose down the tree and dry it off before bringing it into the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintain a minimal amount of water in the tree stand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Run an air purifier in the room or place a mold inhibitor in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only in rare instances, where an allergy sufferer is highly sensitive to 
mold, does a real tree need to be avoided," Luskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Artificial trees solve the mold problem, but decorations and artificial trees 
can pose allergy problems because of the dust they gather, particularly while 
in storage 11 months out of the year, according to Dr. William Storms, a 
Colorado Springs allergist. 
</P>
<P>
 Storms said dust-sensitive allergy sufferers can reduce the risks of attack by 
following these tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Take decorations outside and clean them before setting them up in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give an artificial tree a good rinse before setting it up. 
</P>
<P>
 * After the holidays, clean the decorations and tree thoroughly and store them 
in sealed plastic bags or containers.

NIGHT LIFE: TIMELESS SONGS THAT TORTURE -- BUT NO LATER THAN DEC. 25; CHRISTMAS 
SOUNDTRACKS INCLUDE SOME '94 RELEASES, THEN SOME OLDER ONES (BUT NO DOGS 
BARKING 'JINGLE BELLS').

 Christmas is the only holiday with its own soundtrack. There's no expiration 
date on those timeless songs that keep coming around every year about this 
time. Fortunately, we will be tortured no later than Dec. 25 again this year. 
What follows is an opinionated guide to Christmas music. The first part deals 
with some of the 1994 releases, then some older releases (but not dogs barking 
"Jingle Bells"). As to the following list, any delusions of completeness or 
similarities to reverence are purely coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvin & The Chipmunks -- "A Very Merry Chipmunk" (Chipmunk Records) 
</P>
<P>
 Not as old as Chip & Dale, these venerable rodents at thirty-something are 
back again, this time aided and abetted by the likes of Kenny G, Gene Autry, 
Patty Loveless and Celine Dion, among others. Release the hounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Bennett -- "Snowfall" (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>
 Barely more than 30 minutes long, this one is mostly reissues except for "I'll 
Be Home for Christmas," which was recorded live from "The Jon Stewart Show." 
Tony and the big band cruise comfortably through the usuals: "My Favorite 
Things," "White Christmas" and like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariah Carey -- "Merry Christmas" (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>
 This disco diva is wearing a red Santa suit on the cover and performs the 
obligatory Christmas stuff inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Cole -- "Holly & Ivy" (Elektra) 
</P>
<P>
 Nat's daughter is not wearing a red Santa suit on the cover. Also available as 
a one-hour video. 
</P>
<P>
 Kofi -- "A Very Reggae Christmas" (Atlantic) 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has a plan that will not work -- here's a whole album. Most of this 
is the one beat, one song, one week variety of rootsy reggae. The "leetle 
drummer mon?" Ska, maybe, but reggae? No, mon. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sinatra -- "The Sinatra Christmas Album" (Reprise) 
</P>
<P>
 Sinatra cruises and croons through the usual tunes, giving them all his own 
inimitable twist. Most of these are from the mid-'60s, with several duets with 
his kids and others with Bing. Reportedly, Duets III is in the works -- that's 
the one where Frank sings with Moses, Cardinal Richelieu and Gen. Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear -- "The Record" (Slash) 
</P>
<P>
 This is the classic punk rock album from 1982 that contains parent-hating 
Satan music such as "New York's Alright if You Like Saxophones," "Let's Have a 
War" and "I Don't Care About You." Anyway, the CD, unlike the record, contains 
the grinchiest of all Christmas songs, "Bleep Christmas." You won't be hearing 
this one at the mall; but at 44 seconds, at least it's over before you get 
tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mojo Nixon & the Toadliquors -- "Horny Holidays" (Triple X) 
</P>
<P>
 From 1992, it's Mojo in a relatively festive mood as he folds, spindles and 
mutilates the Christmas spirit. "Jingle Bells, shotgun shells, Satan is a 
smurf. Take me to Toys R Us 'cuz I don't want to work." That's a pretty tame 
take on "Jingle Bells," but "We Three Kings" becomes "We three kings of Orient 
are drinking whiskey in a nude bar. . . ." This is the same Mojo who gave us 
"I'm in Love With Your Girlfriend," "Burn Down the Malls" and "I Hate Banks." 
Gee, I wonder why he doesn't get any airplay? 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Preston -- "(I Want a) Rock and Roll Guitar" (Mercury) 
</P>
<P>
 From 1962 or so, this is a single about a kid staring at a guitar in the music 
store window. He doesn't want no plane, no train, no dump truck, nothing square 
like that; he wants something that swings. Sounds like Jimmy Page or Keith 
Richards' younger daze. 
</P>
<P>
 Various -- "A Christmas Gift for You From Phil Spector" (Rhino) 
</P>
<P>
 Released in 1987, this is one of the best Christmas albums, rock 'n' 
roll-wise. Recorded about 30 years ago, Spector then had a formidable lineup 
that included the Ronettes, the Crystals and Darlene Love. The usual Christmas 
tunes get the full-blown Spector treatment with his wall-of-sound 
orchestration. The Ronettes sing up a storm on "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town," 
likewise the Ronettes on "Sleigh Ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Various -- "Christmas Party With Eddie G." (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>
 From 1990, this is an eclectic mix of screwy songs such as an R & B rocker 
called "Christmas Day" by Detroit Junior that sounds as if it fell off the 
"Animal House" soundtrack. On "Cool Yule," Tony Rodelle Larson offers a 
hipster's take on the holidays, including the observation: "I saw a fat short 
that was making square tracks being pulled by eight dogs that were wearing hat 
racks. . . ." There's an a cappella NRBQ song and all sorts of cool stuff in 
addition to three helpings of Eddie Lawrence, "The Old Philosopher." 
</P>
<P>
 Various -- "PLG Holiday Sampler" (Polygram) 
</P>
<P>
 From 1993, this Polygram Label Group sampler features songs about Christmas, 
but not traditional Christmas songs. E, an artist who wastes no time signing 
checks or autographs, showcases his funky bluesy voice on "Everything's Gonna 
Be Cool This Christmas." For sheer nightmarish energy with no direction, 
there's nothing quite like William S. Burroughs' "The Junky's Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Various -- "A TV Christmas" (Scotti Brothers) 
</P>
<P>
 From 1992, this 12-song CD offers the rare opportunity to hear the Cartwrights 
of "Bonanza" sing "Merry Christmas Neighbor." Also, Howdy Doody, Gene Autry, 
the Partridge Family, the Brady Bunch and three-fourths of the Monkees get 
festive all over the place. How 'bout a Rush Limbaugh / Howard Stern duet on 
"Joy to the World"? 
</P>
<P>
 Various -- "Yulesville" (Warner Brothers) 
</P>
<P>
 From 1987. C'mon, where else are you gonna hear Ed (Kookie) Byrnes, for a 
while the coolest cat on television, recite the title tune back when things 
were the utmost? Madonna shrieks a direct order: "Don't Drive Drunk!" Others 
singing, giving advice and wishing happiness to all include Brian Wilson, 
Depeche Mode, Fleetwood Mac, the Pretenders and even Ice-T and others signed to 
the label. A very curious collection.

SPORTS; HART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Torrance High football Coach Rock Hollis was asked his opinion of Hart 
fullback Ted Iacenda after Friday's playoff opener, Hollis' response was short 
but to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Boehm can relate to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehm, whose Leuzinger team plays host to Hart in the quarterfinals of the 
Southern Section Division II playoffs Friday night, says Iacenda and the rest 
of the top-seeded Indians (11-0) are deserving of superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking at videos, and they're just as good as everybody says they 
are," Boehm said of the state's sixth-ranked team. "That fullback is a tank." 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda, a 6-foot-1, 215-pound junior, was a one-man gang against Torrance, 
accounting for 309 yards in total offense and four touchdowns to lead Hart to a 
42-13 victory. He has scored 35 TDs this season, giving him 55 in two years as 
a varsity player, and has gained nearly 2,000 yards rushing and receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 But Iacenda doesn't do it alone. The Indians' quarterback, Steve McKeon, has 
passed for 2,148 yards and 23 TDs, and the offensive line boasts three players 
who are at least 6-3 and 280 pounds. To further confound defenses, Hart uses a 
no-huddle, hurry-up attack. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how does Leuzinger plan to keep up with the bad boys from Newhall? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is going to change," Boehm said. "It all depends if we can control 
the ball and keep it away from them. We need seven-minute drives." 
</P>
<P>
 Ball control is Leuzinger's game, as it demonstrated last week in a 21-8 
victory over Burroughs of Ridgecrest. The Olympians had three time-consuming 
touchdown drives, nothing new for a team that relies on a big offensive line 
and the one-two running punch of tailback Derrick Norris, who has rushed for 
more than 1,400 yards and 11 TDs, and bruising fullback Aaron Williams (6-3, 
235), who has rushed for more than 1,000 yards and 14 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehm knows his team is a big underdog, but he still has hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a matter of us getting after them and running hard," Boehm said. 
"We're going to do what we can to upset these guys." ROLE REVERSAL 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking with tradition, the Peninsula High football team keeps breaking loose 
for big plays. Of the Panthers' five touchdown runs Friday in a 34-6 Division 
II playoff victory over Canyon of Canyon Country, four covered more than 60 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 On the season, Peninsula has gained 40 yards or more on 26 plays, with 18 
going for TDs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been surprising," said Coach Gary Kimbrell, whose team previously was 
known for its grind-it-out, ball-control style. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Petros Papadakis leads Peninsula with more than 1,500 yards 
rushing and 21 TDs. Thirteen of his runs have covered 40 yards or more, 
including three longer than 80 yards. He had scoring runs of 83, nine and 62 
yards against Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers' other big-play specialist is quarterback Peter Krogh, who has 
rushed for more than 700 yards and 16 TDs and had scoring runs of 67 and 77 
yards last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula, averaging 41 points in winning its last nine games, plays at 
Arcadia (9-2) Friday night in a quarterfinal game matching two teams that 
emphasize the running game and tough defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arcadia is like our clone. It's amazing," Kimbrell said. "I think they've 
attempted fewer passes than us." TIP-OFF TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula, ranked No. 1 in the South Bay in football most of the season, also 
might have the area's best prep basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers return four starters from last season's 21-7 team and have added 
a promising transfer. They open the season at 6 p.m. Tuesday against Torrance 
in the Pacific Shores tournament at Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be very disappointed if it's not one of my best teams," said veteran 
Coach Cliff Warren, starting his second season at Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, though, still thinks Inglewood is the team to beat. Peninsula was 0-3 
last season against Inglewood, which graduated several of its top players but 
returns All-America forward Paul Pierce and has added a couple of talented 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're good, but at this point we're not up to Inglewood's standards," Warren 
said. "We lost 25 games this summer and never beat a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Peninsula to beat some good teams this season. The Panthers are led 
by juniors Phil Belin, a 6-4 guard, and Andrew Klein, a 6-6 center, both Bay 
League selections as sophomores. The other returning starters are senior point 
guard Andy Jensen and 6-5 senior forward Marcus Boyd, who had a good summer. 
A.J. Jones, a 6-3 junior transfer from Texas, can play all five positions, 
Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a rundown of first-round games in the 43rd annual Pacific Shores 
tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Monday (At Redondo): Artesia vs. Bell, 6 p.m.; St. Bernard vs. Hawthorne, 7:30 
p.m. (At Mira Costa): Banning vs. Serra, 6 p.m.; Ocean View vs. Leuzinger, 7:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday (At Redondo): Morningside vs. Carson, 6 p.m.; North Torrance vs. 
Redondo, 7:30 p.m. (At Mira Costa); Peninsula vs. Torrance, 6 p.m.; San Pedro 
vs. Mira Costa, 7:30 p.m. STUNNER 
</P>
<P>
 No, that wasn't a misprint in your newspaper last weekend. Santa Maria, a team 
that entered the playoffs with a 1-9 record, really did upset top-seeded Culver 
City, 33-29, in a Division VII opener Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 How it happened is anyone's guess, but Santa Maria Coach Frank Bentz has a 
hunch that Culver City didn't take his team as seriously as it should have. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign came before the game when the public address announcer began 
rattling off who Culver City would most likely play in the subsequent rounds of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got our attention," Bentz said. "Plus, they were barking at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Barking? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, all the Culver City players and coaches," Bentz said. "They were 
barking at us and giving us the thumbs-down sign." 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Santa Maria could have given Culver City the choke sign. The 
loss snapped an eight-game winning streak for the Centaurs (9-2), who are 1-2 
in the playoffs the past two seasons as Ocean League champions. Mira Costa, the 
Ocean runner-up in each of the past two seasons, has a 5-0 playoff record 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Maria qualified for the playoffs under unusual circumstances. The Saints 
were 0-9 before beating Righetti in their last Northern League game to finish 
in a three-way tie for third at 1-3 with Righetti and San Luis Obispo. Under 
league rules, Santa Maria was awarded the last playoff spot because it had gone 
the longest without reaching the playoffs. MARKED MAN 
</P>
<P>
 One of Mira Costa's chief concerns Saturday night will no doubt involve 
keeping close tabs on South Hills' versatile Brett Pierce when the football 
teams meet in the Division VII quarterfinals at Covina District Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce did a little bit of everything last week in South Hills' 14-3 victory 
over Los Amigos. He passed for a touchdown and ran the ball effectively playing 
quarterback, caught a 53-yard option pass, punted, returned punts and kickoffs, 
and intercepted three passes playing defensive back. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Loyola Marymount defeated St. Mary's and Santa Clara last weekend to win the 
West Coast Conference women's volleyball title and an automatic berth in the 
NCAA tournament, starting Wednesday. The Lions (19-9, 12-3 in the WCC) are 
ranked 24th in the nation and had three players named all-conference. Junior 
middle blocker Mardell Wrensch and freshman setter Tracy Holman were selected 
to the first team and sophomore outside hitter Kim Blankinship was chosen to 
the second team. Holman, from West Torrance High, was also named WCC freshman 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three South Bay youth football teams, all champions of the Pacific Coast 
Conference, will play in Pop Warner regional title games Saturday at Torrance 
High's field. Wilmington-Carson meets Tucson at 2:15 and 4:15 p.m. in the Pee 
Wee and Junior Midget division finals, and Palos Verdes plays Tucson at 6:15 in 
the Midget Division final. Winners advance to national title games Dec. 9 in 
San Jose. Wilmington-Carson's Junior Midget team is coached by Andy 
Subingsubing, an All-City Section linebacker at Carson High in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Camino College (9-1), featuring record-setting quarterback Steve 
Sarkisian, has accepted an invitation to play Foothill Conference champion 
College of the Desert (8-2) in the Southern California Bowl Dec. 3 at Desert. 
El Camino finished Mission Conference play Saturday with a 41-0 victory over 
Pasadena, as Sarkisian passed for 337 yards and three touchdowns to set the 
national single-season record with 3,659 passing yards. The Brigham Young 
University-bound Sarkisian has set nine El Camino and three national passing 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bishop Montgomery and Mira Costa each won opening-round matches Tuesday in 
the State girls' volleyball playoffs. Bishop Montgomery (23-2), the Southern 
Section Division II champion, defeated Exeter, 15-5, 15-3, 15-7, in a Division 
III match behind 14 kills by Cindy Weglarz and will play host to Rim of the 
World on Saturday night. Mira Costa (30-2) got 14 kills from sophomore Kristin 
Sigel in beating Chatsworth, 15-10, 15-4, 15-11, in a Division I match and will 
play at Bakersfield on Saturday. ROB FERNAS

SANTA WILL BE CARRYING SACKFUL OF CD-ROMS; THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE HOT GIFT 
ITEMS, AS MORE AND MORE HOME COMPUTERS ARE EQUIPPED WITH MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retailers expect CD-ROMs to be one of the hottest-selling gift categories this 
holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade magazine MacWeek reports 80% of all personal computers currently 
being sold are purchased for the home and have CD-ROM drives, allowing families 
to enjoy software that integrates text, audio and sophisticated graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 For computer owners who do not have a multimedia system, a variety of easily 
installed sound kits are available at consumer electronic stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the CD-ROM drive is installed, the question becomes, what software to 
buy? Consumers who grew up in the B.C. (before computer) age will be lost in a 
maze of titles: interactive games, reference guides and, for everyone from 
children to adults, educational entertainment products. 
</P>
<P>
 To help make buying a CD-ROM an easy and enjoyable shopping experience, here 
are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Software must be compatible with the computer system; before you buy, find 
out if the child has a Mac or PC. 
</P>
<P>
 * To avoid buying a duplicate or similar title, have a list of the child's 
current software in hand when you go to the store. Seeing what titles the child 
has already purchased will also help the clerk guide you to something similar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid purchasing software that requires a large amount of disc space or 
memory; the disc capacity of many PCs is limited; insufficient memory can 
result in slow speed game play or stop the user from loading the program onto 
the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider what type of software title you want to give: education, reference, 
simulation, sports, action or adventure game. A clerk can explain different 
types. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be sure the selected game is appropriate for the child's age; specific age 
groups for which the title is designed will be indicated on the package. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interactive entertainment computer games are rated on violence, sex/nudity 
and profanity; check the package for a seal offering a brief title content 
description and rating the content on any or all of the three areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the price; software titles are generally available for between $29.95 
and $69.95. The best prices will be at computer superstores, software-only 
stores or general merchandise/discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, view the software program before purchasing to make certain it 
is what you expect. Most consumer electronic and software only stores have 
demonstration systems available.

POLITICS: HOMELESSNESS AND THE DEFEAT OF TONY VAZQUEZ FOR SANTA MONICA COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "3 Police-Backed Candidates Win Seats on Council" (Nov. 10), ousted 
Santa Monica City Council member Tony Vazquez, in playing the race card to 
explain his loss in the Nov. 8 elections, revealed not only a lack of contact 
with reality, but a lack of class. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez was rejected for the simple reason that he spent all his political 
capital on the "rights" of homeless people instead of those of the bona fide 
tenants (i.e., voters) of Santa Monica which his party, Santa Monicans for 
Renters' Rights, purports to represent.That Vazquez is a Hispanic was 
completely irrelevant to his defeat. The people that elected him in the first 
place are the very same people that, this time around, voted him out. In the 
interim, we'd been able to remove the mask of rent control he'd been hiding 
behind, and saw him for what he really is. 
</P>
<P>
 With his passion for advocating the needs of the disenfranchised in our 
society, he'd be a great candidate for the mayor of Skid Row, but he proved 
himself utterly incapable of representing the people of Santa Monica. I don't 
even think he knows who we are. But at least he's now finally heard our voice.

DEVELOPMENT: OK OF APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on Sunday, Nov. 6, "Panel OKs Apartment Complex Near Tribal 
Springs" was nearly correct, with the exception of two details.There has been a 
change of heart by the Tongva Tribal Council. Martin Alcala, Tongva Tribal 
Council chairman, rescinded the tribe's support given to Barrington Plaza Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Also missing from your report was that Councilman Marvin Braude, in whose 
district the Barrington Plaza Project is situated, gave an impassioned plea to 
the committee to disapprove the project on the grounds that it would exacerbate 
an already terrible traffic problem in West Los Angeles, specifically at 
Wilshire and Barrington.

PLAYHOUSE: EFFORTS TO RETROFIT THE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although I now live in Maryland, I am deeply interested in the continued 
welfare and progress in my chosen "hometown" of Santa Monica. I feel qualified 
by my interest and experience as a former Landmarks Commissioner to comment 
regarding a matter I understand is now in the hands of Santa Monica officials 
for consideration: earthquake retrofitting, restoration, and future operation 
and maintenance of the Miles Playhouse and selection of a nonprofit 
organization to carry out the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miles Playhouse lay in a heap of rubble the day after the January 
earthquake. I, and other Landmarks Commissioners, had been reviewing the 
prospects for earthquake reinforcement of the building for quite some time. The 
catastrophic destruction, instead of discouraging us, only intensified our 
concern that its retrofitting and restoration be started as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not necessary to detail the historic significance of the Miles Playhouse 
to the community. This designated Santa Monica Landmark has already been 
documented by others more highly qualified than I. Considering the cost and 
effort required to retrofit it to earthquake standards, restore and preserve 
it, as well as maintain and operate the structure in the future for the 
greatest benefit of the community, it appears almost axiomatic that the 
undertaking would require a concerted effort by a dedicated and fully 
self-supporting effective community organization. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost 20 years, the Santa Monica Historical Society has performed its 
important goals as established through the Santa Monica Centennial Committee on 
its inception. It has persevered to preserve local history, to encourage others 
in the community, particularly students, to be proud of their heritage and 
participate in preserving Santa Monica's few remaining historic structures, to 
research the history and make available to the community at large, historians 
and others researching the area's cultural heritage, its collections of 
multicultural memorabilia, artifacts, oral history, documents and other 
resource materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The society has managed to provide a dignified, articulate and relevant 
historical museum and cultural resource center appealing to all ages and 
diverse ethnic and interest groups in the community in whatever location it had 
at the time. This, in spite of difficult economic times and many moves from one 
location to another in its quest to find a permanent home for its vast 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 At the present time, the Santa Monica Museum of History and Cultural Resource 
Center is located at 1539 Euclid St. The number and variety of visitors to the 
museum, and their unsolicited comments, indicate that this venture has been 
successful despite constraints of space and lack of an appropriate ambience 
(not a historic structure). While not profitable in the sense of a commercial 
venture, the growing membership of the society has continued to support the 
museum and its other activities promoting Santa Monica's history throughout the 
community without relying on public city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not on-site or sufficiently familiar with the floor plans to detail 
exactly how the building might most effectively be used. However, it seems to 
me that we have two needs in our community for which the fulfillment of each 
might be found by fitting them together like the missing pieces of a puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we have a designated Santa Monica Landmark in urgent need of funding to 
cover expenses of retrofitting and restoration. This work must be started soon 
to prevent further deterioration of the structure. It will require the 
concentrated effort of a strong volunteer group to finance, operate and 
maintain the structure for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, we have a historical society that critically needs as soon as possible 
a permanent location for its museum and collections of historical artifacts, 
memorabilia, documents and resource materials. The most appropriate location 
would be in a structure of historical significance to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Historical Society has already proven its ability to forge a 
cohesive and effective membership willing -- and able -- to provide the 
organizational and financial support needed for this project. The society, of 
which I am still a member, is aware of -- and qualified to apply for -- various 
grants and funds available to a nonprofit organization for preserving such a 
landmark as the Miles Playhouse. In addition, the society has the capability of 
mounting a communitywide fund-raising campaign and access to private funds to 
carry out this endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces of the puzzle seem to me to be a perfect fit. One could quibble and 
nit-pick for years. I am sure that such activity is now going on in the 
community. Many organizations want the Miles Playhouse for their pet project. 
However, it would be a travesty to rely on an unproven organization without a 
track record of raising sufficient resources or marshaling the necessary 
volunteer support to undertake such a monumental venture. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge every civic-minded resident of Santa Monica to look carefully at the 
solution to the two community needs which I propose. I believe that after 
serious consideration the entire community will come together to support the 
Santa Monica Historical Society in restoring the Miles Playhouse.

 The only thing more hectic than Christmas shopping is the holiday movie 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 This year an unprecedented seven films are scheduled for national release on 
Dec. 25. Add to that another seven films set to debut earlier in the week and 
several films coming out after Christmas Sunday and you've got a huge traffic 
jam at the turnstiles. 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to stay home. If you do, here's a shaggy list of some 
lesser-known holiday movies: 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas in Connecticut" -- no, not the 1945 fluffy romantic comedy starring 
Barbara Stanwyck. This is the pointless 1992 made-for-cable redux that's 
notable because it's the directing debut for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Directorial 
credits for Arnie have been slow to materialize since. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Christmas Carol," June Lockhart fans will instantly recognize this 
picture as the one in which Lockhart made her film debut. Be sure you get the 
one filmed in 1938. There are several remakes of the classic Dickens story, a 
couple of them far too good to be included here. The 1951 British version 
directed by Brian Desmond is probably the best. Avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas Eve" -- Loretta Young made her celebrated return to acting after a 
23-year hiatus in this hokey 1986 melodrama about a dying grande dame 
determined to track down her three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 On the subject of Loretta Young and Christmas, consider "The Bishop's Wife," 
in which Cary Grant performs as an angel come to Earth to set straight the 
lives of Young and her minister husband (David Niven), who have forgotten the 
importance of family. Sound like a familiar theme? Jimmy Stewart made a similar 
movie one year earlier in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 You could make it a Loretta Young holiday viewing frenzy. Also check out "Come 
to the Stable," a 1949 film, in which Young plays a French nun living in New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 Not enough wholesomeness for ya? Here's how the video sales market is shaping 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney will flood video stores with 27 million copies of "Snow White and the 
Seven Dwarfs" for the holiday buying season. Another big title for video buyers 
this year, based on the number of copies ordered, will be "Jurassic Park," with 
more than 12 million copies shipped. 
</P>
<P>
 One title that will attract plenty of attention even if it doesn't sell as big 
as Snow White is the O.J. Simpson workout video. Playboy Entertainment Group, 
which produced the tape geared toward sedentary men, said it will go ahead with 
plans to sell the video during the holiday buying season as originally 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
 The video sells for $17.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah we have that one," said Jim Salzer, owner of Salzer's Video in Ventura. 
"I got that along with a couple of other things I never thought I'd buy. I've 
got a John Wayne Bobbitt porn video and Tonya Harding's Honeymoon video." 
</P>
<P>
 Salzer said it goes against his sense of ethics to stock the tapes, "but my 
21-year-old daughter told me I had to get them."

 The Westside's top five football teams were all losers in the first round of 
the high school playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City, Westchester, St. Monica, Beverly Hills and University lost by a 
combined score of 178-87. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice scored the only victory among area teams, beating Van Nuys, 28-18. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the seventh consecutive season that the Westside has failed to 
produce a City or Southern Section champion. In 1987, Westchester won the City 
2-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood continues to dominate the eight-man level. The two-time defending 
champion Eagles (10-0) play Faith Baptist (9-1) in the large division 
championships at 1 p.m. Saturday. SYLMAR INVESTIGATION 
</P>
<P>
 University's football season came to an end Friday, but the Warriors almost 
received a second chance in the aftermath of an investigation into the Sylmar 
program by the City Section office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar, the top-seeded team in the 4-A playoffs, allegedly used an ineligible 
player in a 46-0 first-round playoff victory over University. 
</P>
<P>
 City Commissioner Barbara Fiege investigated the allegations against Sylmar 
Tuesday, but said the evidence was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "(A reporter) brought allegations to the office stating that a player on the 
Sylmar football team had transferred from Saugus High in the middle of the 
season, but did not change residency," Fiege said. "I went to the house he said 
he lived at and I went to the old house in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 "After going through eight hours looking around, I decided the evidence was 
inconclusive and conflicting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to declare him ineligible and eliminate the Sylmar team from the 
playoffs, I would have needed more proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Fiege decided to bounce Sylmar from the playoffs, University would have 
advanced to play Banning in a playoff game on Sunday or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Sylmar played host to Banning Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar, which entered Wednesday's game with an 11-0 record, is on probation 
for holding an illegal practice during the preseason. TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City, the area's top-ranked team, had high hopes entering the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want nothing short of a championship," Centaur quarterback Damon Williams 
said during the preseason. "This is the team to do it. If we don't do it, it 
will be another five to 10 years before this school has this many skilled 
athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 When the clock started ticking on their season, the Centaurs didn't react 
until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City, seeded No. 1 in the Southern Section Division VII playoffs, 
sleepwalked through three quarters before succumbing to Santa Maria, 33-29. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints entered with a 1-9 record, the worst of any playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Maria came out with nothing to lose and everything to gain," Centaur 
Coach Robert Moore said. "Our guys came out too relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 33-14, the Centaurs scored two fourth quarter touchdowns to pull 
within four. Culver City had the ball on the Santa Maria six-yard line with 56 
seconds left, but were penalized for a personal foul after a run by Aki Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referee kind of killed us," Moore said. "The films clearly show that 
Wilson was face-masked and there was no call." 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Centaur quarterback Rashad Stroops did not complete a pass in four 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really didn't get focused until the last 13 minutes of the game," Moore 
said. "That's when the true Culver City team woke up. But by then it was too 
late." COMETS' TALE 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester lost its first and last games of the season. But in between, the 
Comets were unbeaten for nine consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester's season ended with a 14-6 loss to San Pedro in the first round of 
the City 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did a team that won its third consecutive Coastal Conference title play 
so poorly in the playoffs again? 
</P>
<P>
 "We had very few returning starters from last year's team," Westchester Coach 
Larry Wein said. "We had a few players like Tony Griffin and De Travor Turner 
who made us seem like a veteran team." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, a senior defensive end, was the team's leading defensive player with 
66 tackles and 18 sacks through 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, a senior tight end and defensive back, caught 24 passes for 659 yards 
and 12 touchdowns in eight games. He caught a 44-yard scoring pass from 
quarterback Damion Ward on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Griffin is probably one of the most exciting receivers and potential 
stars since Ken Norton played here," Wein said, comparing Griffin to the 
current San Francisco 49ers linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the quick exit, Wein says he plans to return for his 14th season at 
Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people would like to shoot me, but yes I plan to be back," he 
said. FINAL COUNTDOWN 
</P>
<P>
 St. Monica also made a last-minute effort before losing to Yucca Valley, 
36-30, in the Division IX playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve Pulley threw a long pass to Dwight Carter to give the 
Mariners a first down at Yucca Valley's 19-yard line. With no timeouts left and 
eight seconds remaining in the game, Mariners Coach Norm Lacy wanted Pulley to 
throw the ball out of bounds to stop the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulley, however, thought his coach wanted an out-pattern and completed a 
seven-yard pass to Carter, who failed to get out of bounds. Time ran out with 
the Mariners 12 yards away from the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lacy was pleased with the Mariners season. St. Monica finished 7-3. 
Pulley completed 19 of 29 passes for 195 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the seniors played up to my expectations in regards to statistics 
and what they did on and off the field," he said. IN SEARCH OF 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Polo? 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Pleas? 
</P>
<P>
 When University High standout running back Marco Pleas was counted absent from 
the Warriors' 46-0 loss to top-seeded Sylmar in a first round game of the 4-A 
playoffs, teammates and coaches came up with a host of alibis. But who can you 
believe? 
</P>
<P>
 One teammate said Pleas went to his grandfather's funeral in Georgia. An 
assistant coach said Pleas had gone to his brother's out-of-town wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I'm gonna say is that he's not here," said Coach Marshall Jones after the 
Warriors' loss. RAGS TO RICHES 
</P>
<P>
 Despite losing in the first round of the playoffs, Beverly Hills can take 
pride in rebounding from a 4-7 record in 1992 and 2-8 mark in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Normans finished 6-5 after losing to Covina, 49-22, Friday in the first 
round of the Division VII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills, which averaged 30 points a game, was led by senior quarterback 
Chris Wallace, junior running back Aaron Kogan and senior wide receiver Mike 
Hakim. Wallace threw for 2,197 yards and 18 touchdowns. Hakim caught 53 passes 
for 1,129 yards and 14 touchdowns. Kogan rushed 1,498 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great group of seniors who helped put our program back on track," 
Beverly Hills Coach Carter Paysinger said. BROKEN STRING 
</P>
<P>
 Taft's reign as two-time 4-A tennis champion came to an end Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades, seeded second and winners of 15 City titles, reclaimed the crown 
with a stunning 6-1 victory over the top-seeded Toreadors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was time to bring the trophy back to the Westside," said Palisades Coach 
Bud Kling, who has won nine titles in the past 11 years. "Most people thought 
Taft had the advantage. No one expected us to dominate." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Feldman, Taft's No. 1 singles player, extended her three-year unbeaten 
streak to 47 games. But it was the Toreadors' only victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise came when Palisades sophomore Shana Miller rallied after 
losing her first set, 6-0, to defeat Ravid Levy, who has not lost a match in 
singles or doubles team competition. Miller won the next two sets, 6-0, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Lee also pulled off an upset when she beat Alicia Whelan, 7-5, 6-0. 
Whelan is a two-time City doubles champion player. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling in for Jennie Wilson, sophomore Christin Cho teamed with Alison 
Fischer to win their doubles match, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they underestimated us," Kling said. "We started four freshmen. We're 
very young, but we're deep in talent." SPEED RACER 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Gilmore of Palisades erased a disappointing 1993 finish and the 
Palisades girls won their first City cross-country title in 13 years Saturday 
at Pierce College in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore led from the start to win the three-mile race in 14 minutes, 56 
seconds -- the fastest winning time since 1983 -- to lead the Palisades boys' 
to second behind Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore finished third in last year's finals after entering the meet with the 
fastest qualifying time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I choked last year," Gilmore said. "I'm more confident about my training and 
went in hoping to break 15. If the first mile went out fast I didn't care about 
whether I was in the lead or not as long as I got my time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kara Barnard (19:21), Diana Epstein (19:21) and Genevieve Cruise (19:37) of 
Palisades finished fourth, fifth and seventh, respectively, to lead the 
Dolphins to the team title. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Bernier of Hamilton finished second in 19:12 to qualify for the 
state meet. The top two teams and first five individuals advanced to the state 
meet, which is Saturday in Fresno. GENTLE REMINDER 
</P>
<P>
 The problem that plagued the UCLA men's soccer team toward the end of the 
regular season was the inability to score goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (16-4-0) were shut out in their last three regular-season games, 
including a 1-0 loss to Fresno State in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did the forwards for seventh-ranked UCLA manage to score three goals in 
a 3-2 overtime victory over unranked Alabama Birmingham (15-4-1) Sunday at UCLA 
in a first-round game of the NCAA tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Coach Sigi Schmid showed the Bruins a highlight film of the 
goals they had scored earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The motivational tool worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've obviously had trouble scoring goals over the past few weeks so we were 
happy to get some goals," Schmid said. "It was important to get the first win. 
I think this was the tougher one for us to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Bruins' first playoff win in three years. UCLA will play a 
second-round game at eighth-ranked Southern Methodist (15-3-1), at 11 a.m. 
Sunday. SEAN WATERS and KIRBY LEE and PAIGE LEECH and WENDY WITHERSPOON

FASHION; HANDICRAFT FAIRS OFFER FINE ARTS, HOMESPUN CRAFTS; THE STREET FESTIVAL 
IN VENTURA IS THE LARGEST AND WILL OFFER THE DIVERSE CREATIONS OF SOME 500 
VENDORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About this time of year, handcrafts come into their own. December is National 
Nostalgia Month, although congressional oversight has left this designation 
unofficial -- and it's not likely that the Republicans are going to be into 
correcting the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it's up to crafters to carry on without formal recognition of their aims 
-- providing satisfaction for the craft-driven at a time when folk art has wide 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming holiday craft fairs will make that easy. There's no lack of artisans 
in the area, nor venues for their talents. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest of them all, the Holiday Street Festival, will descend on Main 
Street in Ventura on Dec. 4, giving the Ventura Police Department its best 
opportunity of the year to practice public relations under stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 500 craft vendors will be there, spilling over onto side streets and 
staging a quiet rebellion against the Industrial Revolution. If you can't 
fulfill your craft needs here, you need more help than we can give you. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair is not juried and has grown to include a range of items from fine 
arts to homespun crafts, drawing from a variety of traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unusual is Native American crafts made by Eydie and Bill Noll 
of Newbury Park. The couple, who formerly worked in professional sales, now 
make a living creating ceremonial fans and pipes, authentic medicine wheels and 
dream-catchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The dream-catcher, a framework decorated with feathers, glass beads and 
deerskin, was traditionally hung by the sleeping place to keep evil spirits 
from entering dreams. Such a piece was the inspiration for their business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gotten one for Bill, and I brought it home, and he said, 'You know, 
I've done those before,' " Eydie recalled. "I said, 'What do you mean, you've 
done them before?' and he said, 'I just feel like I've done that; I know how to 
do them.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said OK and just fluffed it off. The next morning, I woke up and he had one 
made -- that was six years ago, and he hasn't stopped since." 
</P>
<P>
 Another fair craft borrowed from religious tradition is the Mexican luminaria 
. According to custom, the candleholders were placed in yards as symbols of 
light to guide the three kings to the Christ Child. 
</P>
<P>
 Handmade luminarias will be offered by potter Xavier Gonzales of Sherman Oaks, 
who will be making his third trip to the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kill them there with those luminaria s," he said, adding that hand-cut, 
silhouetted clay work is rare because of the demands of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gonzales has found an unusual source for cutting implements. "I walk along 
the gutters of the street and pick up broken street sweeper blades," he said. 
"The steel they use is really strong stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Most customers buy his candleholders for patio use or to hold indoor aromatic 
candles. The potter also offers crystalline-glazed art pieces, and functional 
bowls and pots. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside such professionals at the fair will be weekend hobbyists. Eraina Ann 
Taylor, a medical secretary from Ventura, is making her fair debut this year 
with child-size muslin tepees. 
</P>
<P>
 The tepees are four feet on a side at the base and have frames that make them 
free-standing for inside or outside play. Taylor made one up as a gift for a 
friend's children in the spring and has been swamped with orders ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's grown and grown, and I thought maybe I'll try the street fair," she 
said, "I'm having a hard time getting enough of them made up." 
</P>
<P>
 Another part-time crafter, Melanie Garrett, a realtor's assistant from Vista, 
will be offering felt reindeer antlers on headbands at a booth she shares with 
her sister, Sherman Blench. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime crafters, the women have shown their jewelry at various fairs for 
several years. The antlers "are by and large the most fun thing we've ever 
carried," Garrett said. "'We've sold them to firemen, bus drivers. Nurses and 
teachers are among our best customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when not promoting their craft items, the sisters often like to wear 
antlers, Garrett said, especially when they travel to such destinations as Las 
Vegas or Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister and I make a bit of a madcap team," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other items offered at the fair this year include freeze-dried vegetable 
wreaths, handmade skateboards, table-top topiary plants and bug barns for 
insect pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost any handmade item will be accepted at the event if shown by its 
creator, said Faye Campbell, the festival's coordinator at the city of Ventura.

 "It's a shopping opportunity for people of all tastes and all levels of

<P>
 If you're celebrating Hanukkah this year, there's more for the kids than eight 
nights of candle-lighting, gift-giving and the traditional potato latkes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if your family is not Jewish, children can get a glimpse of Jewish 
culture at a slew of events around the county -- everything from a zany, 
musical production about the holiday to the lighting of a giant 20-foot 
menorah. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day holiday begins Sunday and celebrates the ancient victory of the 
Maccabees over the Syrians, who wanted the Jews to give up their religion and 
become assimilated. The lighting of the menorah commemorates a miracle after 
the Jews had recaptured their temple: a day's worth of oil kept the menorah 
burning for eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 The story takes a comical spin when the Shpieler Troupe performs "Hanukkah 
Lights" on Dec. 4 at Temple Beth Torah in Ventura. This family show begins at 
11:30 a.m. and is geared for kids 4 and older, as well as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 For openers, the Los Angeles troupe belts out "Hooray for Hanukkah" to the 
tune of that old chestnut, "Hooray for Hollywood." From there, it's on to the 
crazy Mac and the Bees -- complete with silly antennas -- who weather the 
pressures of the encroaching Christmas holiday by better understanding their 
own Jewish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the troupe, two men and two women, go back in time to the events that led 
to the Hanukkah celebration, the battle scene and the search for oil, which 
leads to some humorous audience participation. The show has its serious 
moments, too. It ends with the lighting of the menorah and Peter Yarrow's song, 
"Light One Candle." 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong show was created by the troupe, which has performed it for five 
years throughout Los Angeles, in other parts of California and out of state. 
They also wrote some of the songs and have included some written by Debbie 
Friedman, whose religious music is well known. 
</P>
<P>
 While people are at Temple Beth Torah for the performance, they can also see 
the results of an unusual contest. For the first time, the temple invited its 
families to enter a menorah-making competition. Awards will be given that day 
for most colorful menorah, funniest, most ecological, most spiritual, most 
creative, smallest, largest and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no restrictions on what materials to use or the size, according to 
Tamara Lawson, who runs the temple's Torah School. One entry, she said, is made 
of Legos. 
</P>
<P>
 Temples around the county have Hanukkah services and celebrations geared 
especially for families. Temple Beth Torah's service will be Dec. 2 at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At Temple Etz Chaim, 1080 E. Janss Road, Thousand Oaks, a Hanukkah celebration 
will be held Sunday at 5 p.m. Menorahs will be lighted, children will sing, 
Yossi Levy's Band will perform, and traditional Jewish food -- latkes and 
applesauce -- will be served. A family service will take place at 5 p.m. Dec. 2 
at the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 At Temple Adat Elohim, 2420 E. Hillcrest Drive, also in Thousand Oaks, a 
special Hanukkah musical program, "Miracles Aren't Just Magic II," will be 
presented at 7 p.m. Dec. 2. Several members of the temple will be featured in 
the performance, which will be followed by latkes and applesauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Congregation B'nai Emet will have a children's Hanukkah service 
at 7:30 p.m. Dec. 2 at 4645 Industrial St. On Dec. 4, a Hanukkah party from 1 
to 4 p.m. will include music, crafts, a play and food. 
</P>
<P>
 For a different perspective on the holiday, Brian Bemel will be telling 
Hanukkah stories at Adventures for Kids bookstore, 3457 Telegraph Road, 
Ventura, from 6:45 to 7:15 p.m. Dec. 1. Bemel, who lives in Ojai, is also a 
teacher and involved in bringing performing artists into county schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah will be at the malls, too. Chabad of the Conejo will hold a Hanukkah 
festival from 7 to 8 p.m. Dec. 1 in the Robinsons-May court at the east end of 
The Oaks mall, where a 20-foot menorah will be lighted. The event will include 
Jewish music, a children's show with clowns, jugglers, magician, and dreidels 
for the kids. Latkes will also be served. 
</P>
<P>
 Chabad of Ventura will have similar festivities at 6 p.m. Sunday at the 
Buenaventura Mall in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will also hold a candle-lighting ceremony and children's program in 
Ojai from 6 to 7 p.m. Dec. 4 at the Jack Boyd Community Center, 510 Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids can see just how puppets and marionettes work from a longtime pro 
Saturday at the Camarillo Art Center. John England will bring his cast of 
handmade characters in for an 11 a.m. program that also includes a workshop on 
how to make a little puppet. 
</P>
<P>
 England, who lives in Ventura, has created his own puppets since he was 10, 
and since then he has worked with all phases of the art, from staging to 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, he traveled the country giving seminars on how to use puppets in 
education. In addition to local performances, he now works as a technical 
director and cameraman when the city of Camarillo videotapes meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 For his Saturday program, England will perform traditional tales and original 
skits with his puppets. The cost is $3 for children, free for adults. The 
center is at 3150 Ponderosa Drive. For information, call 445-7061. Details

EARTHWATCH: AN ENVIRONMENTALLY CORRECT PRESENT IS A GIFT FOR THE FUTURE; 
SUGGESTIONS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF BOOKS AND A MAGAZINE THAT WILL HELP THOSE WHO 
RECEIVE THEM TO REMAIN ECOLOGICALLY AWARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Tis the season to be giving, and here are some Earthwatch-style ideas: First, 
give something that benefits both the recipient and the planet. Second, give 
something that keeps on doing that again and again. Third, cut yourself in on 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of all three might be a gift subscription to an environmentally 
oriented shopping guide like Consumer Reports. Yes, the magazine has gone 
green. It's not just about stuff for the Ozzie and Harriet crowd any more. The 
editors have been sly about going environmental, but this month confessed in 
print, "We admit that there's a message here: Ame ricans are consuming more 
resources than are needed to maintain their high standard of living." 
</P>
<P>
 The current issue is pretty typical of the new slant. After casting its 
knowing gaze on the retail industry and deciding to praise the value-for-money 
offered at Price/Costco, Target and Wal-Mart, the magazine admonishes readers 
to shop this season for energy-miser lights, less-toxic cleaning products, 
energy-efficient appliances and fuel-efficient cars. Plus, a la Earthwatch, it 
calls on readers to shop for more vegetables because of what the magazine calls 
the "environmental price" of meat. If you give yourself a $22 year's 
subscription to this monthly you can also have it sent to your environmentally 
aware friends for $16 each. Call (800) 234-1654. 
</P>
<P>
 That vegetarian angle, by the way, is one reason for my choice of this year's 
under-$5 stocking stuffer. The others reasons are terrific taste and doing 
something for your fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide array of prepackaged bean mixes is available by mail order from The 
Women's Bean Project. This provides an easy way to acquaint yourself and your 
friends with a health-building and soil-building legume. The soups, chili and 
bean salad mixes -- at $5 each or in gorgeous little boxed sets of various 
mixes for $10 and $15 -- are packaged by a Colorado organization that provides 
employment for homeless and poor women. Call (303) 292-1919, or fax (303) 
292-9072. If you're in business and need to give multiple, memorable little 
gifts, this is just the item. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's something else for business people: a giant-sized holiday gift-giving 
suggestion which works two ways. If you manufacture or sell consumer products 
-- be it toothbrushes or T-shirts, eyeglasses or eye shadow, there's a national 
organization called Gifts In Kind that wants to hear from you. By arranging 
through them to provide a certain volume of inventory to nonprofit 
organizations that serve the needy, homeless, ill or elderly, you can obtain 
tax savings of up to twice the cost of the goods. They currently distribute 
$110 million worth of such goods to the 50 top national charities the year 
around. When amounts are large, they're distributed nationwide, but charities 
in the donor's hometown, such as United Way or Boys & Girls Clubs receive 
special attention. Call (703) 549-1481. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying on with this giving-as-well-as-receiving theme, there are two books I 
want to recommend as presents, at $15 each at major booksellers: "Shopping For 
A Better World" and "Sustaining the Earth: Choosing Consumer Products That Are 
Safe For You, Your Family and the Earth." Each is about green living as well as 
a guide to green giving. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, compiled by the Council on Economic Priorities and published by 
Sierra Club Books, factors in questions of people-friendly management practices 
along with an environmental slant in calculating which companies and which 
products you should support with your consumer dollar. I think this council is 
one of the most level-headed groups of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The second book, written by Debra Dadd-Redalia and published by William 
Morrow, is about sustaining our families and our planet. The quality and 
thoroughness of this author's advice on environmental consumerism is tops. 
</P>
<P>
 My final holiday gift recommendation may seem odd. It's also a book, "Material 
World," but it's not unequivocally pro-environment or anti-materialist. This 
$30 Sierra Club Book by Peter Menzel with astonishing photographs by 16 of the 
world's top photographers, shows what ordinary people in 30 different countries 
have. Yes, what they have. You see everything they own arrayed in their front 
yard, if there is one, or the street. One home was a yurt, one yard was a pond, 
with the stuff on a raft. Everything has been brought out for display -- pots, 
TVs, rugs, pets, cars, carts -- plus ma, pa, kids and oldsters, winsomely 
arranged for the camera.

JAUNTS; 'CHOOSE-AND-CUT' TREES; PICKING A PINE FROM URBAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
FORESTS GAINS FAVOR AMONG FAMILIES -- AND PROVIDES THAT FRESH-CUT SMELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Traipsing off to the forest to cut a Christmas tree is the stuff of fairy 
tales these days, at least in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do you do if the thought of buying a cut tree at a vacant lot has all 
the appeal of warm eggnog? 
</P>
<P>
 You go to one of Ventura County's "choose-and-cut" Christmas tree farms. It 
isn't quite the serene forest experience, but the tree will have that fresh-cut 
smell and the kids can still yell " timber! " when it falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these urban forests open this weekend. When you go, expect company. 
Cutting down your own Christmas tree is gaining favor among American families, 
according to the Merced-based California Christmas Tree Growers. They cite a 
1990 Gallup poll showing that 27% of the trees gracing living rooms across the 
country are from these farms, up from 5% in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect to find the popular Scotch pine, Douglas fir or white fir growing 
on these tree farms. They can't survive the warm Southern California climate. 
What thrives best in the county is the Monterey pine, so that's almost 
exclusively what you'll be buying. 
</P>
<P>
 The farms supply the saw and you do the cutting. Most have carts or rides of 
some kind to help you haul out the tree. Netting and twine is usually available 
to make the job of wrestling the tree to the top of the car easier. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, some farms charge a flat rate for their choose-and-cut 
trees -- about $25 to $28 for trees that range up to 12 feet. Others charge by 
the foot, $3 to $3.50. And a few farms also sell cut trees brought in from 
colder climates. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get the tree home, the Merced organization recommends making another 
cut off the bottom before putting it in a water stand. If you don't, the sap 
will seal the base and the tree won't absorb water. 
</P>
<P>
 Put the tree in a stand that will hold at least one gallon of water. Then 
water it daily because the average tree will drink a quart to a gallon a day. 
That will keep the needles from drying out and causing a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 If a Christmas tree outing makes you think that the tree farmer's life is 
easy, Thursel Roatcap will set you straight. She and her husband, Ralph, have 
owned the Santa Paula Christmas Tree Farm for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "People probably don't think the (trees) are work," she said. But from the 
time they are planted, the trees are pruned, fertilized, protected from pests 
and disease, then finally hand-finished -- groomed with a special knife to make 
them look attractive and natural. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the trees look good, farmers around the county report. For the 
holiday season, some farms keep their sales simple, offering just the trees. 
Others are more festive, providing weekend Santas and candy canes for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner Farm Christmas Forest in Santa Paula probably offers the most festive 
extravaganza. There, people can pay $1 and ride an authentic narrow-gauge train 
through the stands of trees, or hop on a hay truck or a Model T truck. Carolers 
and choirs entertain on weekends beginning in December. For those with some 
decorating flair, a tree-trimming contest will be held there Dec. 3. Details 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; FAMILIAR FARE TOPS THE SEASON'S SHOW BILLS; FROM TRADITIONAL TO

 Boy, it seems like only a year ago we theater lovers were reveling in a 
cornucopia of "Nutcracker Suite" and "A Christmas Carol" revivals, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, with change the order of the day, the rich array of holiday fare in the 
Santa Barbara theater scene this time around consists of -- um, "A Christmas 
Carol" and "The Nutcracker Suite." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Santa Maria-based PCPA Theaterfest is already up and running with its 
lavish holiday production of "A Christmas Carol," featuring James Edmondson of 
the Oregon Shakespeare Festival spitting out "Bah humbugs!" with the precision 
of a classically trained thespian. Ends Dec. 22. Tickets: $13-$18. Call 
1-800-549-PCPA (7272). 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, the Santa Barbara Shakespeare Festival will tackle a different 
version with "A Christmas Carol: Scrooge and Marley" at the Center Stage 
Theatre in Santa Barbara's Paseo Nuevo Mall. This Israel Horowitz adaptation is 
scrupulously faithful to Charles Dickens' original story, except for one 
intriguing spin: Jacob Marley, Scrooge's deceased partner, assumes the role of 
a recurring narrator in addition to his cameo as the initiator of the miser's 
comeuppance. Runs Dec. 2-Dec. 23. Tickets: $12-$14. Call 963-0408. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative liberties are taken with Dickens in the American Family Theater's 
contemporary musical adaptation of "A Christmas Carol," featuring original 
songs and a 75-minute running time sure to please even the most discriminating 
attention spans. The Philadelphia-based touring company brings its full-scale 
production to the Lobero Theatre Dec. 10, 2 and 5 p.m., and Dec. 11, 2 p.m. 
Tickets: $7-$12. Call 963-0761. 
</P>
<P>
 Had enough? Perhaps you might enjoy some sweet revenge for all the "Christmas 
Carols" you've had to squirm through. In that case, the sight of an inept group 
of tacky British society matrons staging the worst rendition ever might be just 
your cup of tea, as "The Farndale Avenue Housing Estate Townswomen's Guild 
Dramatic Society Production of 'A Christmas Carol' " makes a return engagement 
at the Ensemble Theatre Company. One of the troupe's most popular productions, 
this wicked David McGillivary-Walter Zerlin satire carries on the Monty 
Python-Fawlty Towers tradition. Runs Dec. 7-Dec. 31. Tickets: $15-$20. Call 
962-8606. 
</P>
<P>
 On the "Nutcracker" front, students of the Ellen Schipper Classical Ballet 
Studio will dance their way through Tchaikovsky's classic score at UC Santa 
Barbara's Campbell Hall. Reid Olson of Pacific Northwest Ballet is among the 
guest artists dancing the lead roles in a traditional staging, with original 
embellishments -- such as envisioning the entire piece as a little girl's 
dream. Runs Dec. 17 at 7:30 p.m., Dec. 18 at 2 p.m. Tickets: $7-$15. Call 
583-8700.

TIDBITS: PROGRAMS FOR HUNGRY EMPHASIZE THE SPIRIT OF GIVING; DRIVE FOR 
DONATIONS TO SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES GAINS SPEED AT HOLIDAYS. SEVERAL OPTIONS 
ARE AVAILABLE TO THOSE WANTING TO HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every day, thousands of people in Ventura County look to social service 
agencies to provide them with something to eat. The homeless, the elderly, the 
poor, the homebound and others count on free or low-cost food for their 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the problem exists throughout the year, the big drive for contributions 
tends to center on the holidays, when the "spirit of giving" is emphasized, and 
a "happy holiday" means turkey and fixings for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what just a handful of the many organizations are doing to help the 
cause: 
</P>
<P>
 Food Share Inc., the food bank of Ventura County, serves 127,000 people 
countywide, year-round, said spokeswoman Dee Volz. "Almost everybody who feeds 
the county gets food from us," she said. "We have 257 nonprofit agencies in the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has begun to make a big push for its Hunger 2000 campaign, an 
attempt to raise enough money over the next five years to wipe out the county's 
hunger problem. Promotional television ads featuring actress Mary Steenburgen 
of Ojai are scheduled to air through December. 
</P>
<P>
 Food Share receives donations from a variety of public and private sources, 
including local restaurants, which provide food served as hot meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Volz said donations of money and canned or packaged food are accepted, but 
that the monetary donations go further. "Every dollar donated makes $34.88 of 
food going to the hungry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time of year, Food Share counts heavily on in-house corporate canned food 
drives, as well as public food drives. Among the latter, The Gap has a drive 
running through Christmas, and Vons grocery stores are collecting canned goods 
through Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in contributing, send monetary donations to P.O. Box 
4596, Ventura, 93007, or call 647-3944. Donations also may be dropped off at 
the Food Share warehouse at 4156 Southbank Road, Oxnard, from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The Manna Conejo Valley Food Bank, a 24-year-old organization serving areas 
south of the Conejo Grade, will provide about 2 1/2 weeks worth of groceries to 
3,300 families over the holidays. And the organization is working with local 
schools and clubs to provide full holiday meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "One school wants to adopt 17 families for Christmas," said Administrator 
Pauline Saterbo. "One of the churches has asked for the names of 200 children. 
. . . First Financial Group has (Ralphs grocery store) coupons to give to our 
clients. They're hoping to take care of the fresh vegetables and fruit for the 
holidays." To help, call 497-4959. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Family to Family, a program of Project Understanding, works with the Catholic 
Charities Program of Ventura County to supply hot meals in the Ventura and Ojai 
areas. The organization accepts non-perishable, unopened, generally canned 
goods, or monetary donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Private donations are welcome, as is the assistance of local community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 With the holidays in mind, De Anza Junior High School in Ventura held a Turkey 
Trot earlier this week, with children winning Thanksgiving turkeys -- which 
they were encouraged to donate to the Family to Family program. Family to 
Family and Catholic Charities will provide holiday food baskets to needy 
families in the area. About 160 baskets will be delivered for Thanksgiving, and 
another batch is expected for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Call Family to Family at 652-1326 and Catholic Charities at 643-4694.

 So you've had it up to here with culinary servitude. This is the year you 
finally heed Harry Truman's advice and free yourself from holiday cooking 
chores. 
</P>
<P>
 Go ahead, take time to join that pinochle game with the in-laws. Sink into the 
cushy recliner and take your crack at the eggnog and Aunt Bertha's fruitcake. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're thinking of eating out this holiday season, we've done some of the 
legwork to help you decide what to eat and where. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring your Thanksgiving dining plans have long been solidified, we came up 
with a list of just some of the Ventura County restaurants serving Christmas 
Eve and Christmas Day meals. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection process was about as scientific as channel surfing between 
football games and as arbitrary as choosing which log to toss into the 
fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 But what follows are several alternatives to plunging your arms into another 
turkey cavity. The list runs the gamut from sumptuous traditional feasts to a 
variety of ethnic cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Some of the restaurants contacted have not decided on their Christmas 
holiday menus just yet, but were able to provide a pretty good idea of what you 
can expect.

 DEMOCRATIC DISTRESS: Just how low have Democratic spirits sunk in the wake of 
their party's midterm election drubbing? Low enough for some to talk openly 
about Clinton as a one-term President. Rep. Robert G. Torricelli, an outspoken 
New Jersey Democrat and occasional critic of Administration policies, said 
Clinton is likely to be history if the Republicans nominate someone such as 
California Gov. Pete Wilson or former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in 1996. 
"Clinton is in the unenviable position that his fate is less in his hands than 
in his opponents,' " Torricelli said. "Under the current political 
circumstances, Bill Clinton running against a moderate and thoughtful 
Republican officeholder has the makings of a disaster." But Torricelli said he 
remained optimistic that the GOP would tap an "ideological extremist." Which 
means, he said, "at this point, one could envision a landslide in either 
direction."

 LOBBYIST DISTRESS: Opinion polls regularly place lobbyists near the bottom of 
the Washington public image food chain -- down there with journalists and 
lawmakers. This year has been particularly harsh for the profession as debate 
raged around the lobbying reform legislation approved by Congress. So how are 
lobbyists responding? By forming an association to lobby for their interests. 
The new nonprofit National Assn. of Registered Lobbyists is meeting Monday to 
"address the need for a strong lobbying association," said John L. Zorack, 
president and founder. "I may be getting thin-skinned, but I'm angry when the 
public, Congress and even the President lambastes lobbyists." If lobbyists did 
indeed "have Congress in their hip pockets," he asked, then why were just 140 
bills approved by lawmakers in a year when 2,076 were introduced? Lobbyists 
work long hours for corporations, trade associations and others, "protecting 
and furthering the interest of many entities petitioning government under the 
First Amendment."

 GORE LITE: At least someone in the Clinton Administration is having fun these 
days. Vice President Al Gore, who has achieved as much notice for his 
self-deprecating humor as for his public policy positions in recent months, 
told a group of health, safety and food specialists this week that shedding the 
leg cast he had worn since August has left him in better physical condition to 
fulfill his vice presidential duties. "It takes me half as long to walk Socks 
now," he said. The vice president had undergone Achilles' tendon surgery after 
injuring himself in a basketball game with fellow Capitol Hill round-ballers at 
the House gymnasium.

 WHITEWATER SNIPING: Unhappiness over the selection of former Solicitor General 
Kenneth W. Starr as independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation has 
been renewed with two new complaints: Critics say that Starr is carrying on his 
private law practice while conducting the probe and that he showed partisanship 
by attending a recent unveiling of the portrait of the last attorney general in 
the George Bush Administration. Starr is among the lawyers for Hughes Aircraft 
Co. in the appeal of the largest patent case in history, but his defenders 
claim there will be no heavy duty in that matter for some time to come. Starr 
attended the unveiling earlier this month of former Atty. Gen. William P. 
Barr's portrait at the Justice Department, but Starr's supporters dismiss the 
raised eyebrows among some Justice Department officials by noting that he 
served under Barr.

LOCATION OF RAPIST'S VICTIMS MAY PREVENT PAROLE TO COVINA; CRIME: REGINALD 
MULDREW WAS CONVICTED OF RAPING TWO WOMEN WHO LIVE WITHIN 35 MILES OF THE CITY, 
POLICE SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Continuing their attempt to prevent a notorious rapist from being paroled to 
their community, Covina police said Wednesday they have found two victims of 
"pillowcase rapist" Reginald Donald Muldrew living within 35 miles of the San 
Gabriel Valley suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Penal Code says an inmate cannot be paroled to a community within 35 
miles of a victim or witness to his felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the findings, "we feel very confident" that Muldrew "will not 
be released to our city," Police Chief John Lentz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Goya, a deputy regional parole administrator, said the state parole 
board will need to confirm the identities of the women cited by Covina police.  
</P>
<P>
 Lentz said state officials informed him last week that Muldrew, 46 -- a 
suspect in more than 200 sexual assaults and 150 burglaries in Los Angeles from 
1975 until his arrest in 1978 -- would be paroled into the city Dec. 4.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, residents and city officials have been fighting to stop him from 
being paroled to the tightly knit community.  
</P>
<P>
 The two women who came to police over the past few days are victims of rapes 
for which Muldrew was convicted, said Covina Police Lt. Kim Raney.  
</P>
<P>
 Before police knew his identity, Muldrew was dubbed the "pillowcase rapist" 
because he covered his victims' faces with pillowcases, blouses or scarves. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina police said they have been contacted by 15 other women who say they 
were victims of Muldrew, and have matched their names with a Los Angeles Police 
Department list of cases in which Muldrew was suspected but not prosecuted. 
Raney would not say where the victims live, except to say that the closest 
lives 12 miles from Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Goya would not comment on whether the Penal Code restricts a parolee from 
living within 35 miles of a victim in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Raney said police are going through the process of verifying all 17 women's 
addresses and helping them fill out written statements protesting Muldrew's 
parole to the parole board. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew, convicted in 1978 of four counts of rape with force, two counts of 
oral copulation with a child, one count of assault with intent to commit rape 
and several counts of burglary and robbery, is confined at Pelican Bay State 
Prison in Northern California. Officials plan to administer a psychiatric 
examination on the day he is paroled, even though he has no history of mental 
illness. If he fails the exam, he could be sent back to prison for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A rally in Covina to protest Muldrew's parole drew more than 3,000 people 
Monday night, some carrying signs that read "Where's Bobbitt When We Need Her?" 
and "Don't Drop a Serial Rapist Here." 
</P>
<P>
 Raney said most of the women who came forward did so after media coverage of 
the rally. Muldrew has served time in several prisons, including San Quentin, 
where he was a suspect in the 1971 murder of a prison guard but was not 
prosecuted.  
</P>
<P>
 Raney said he doubted that the Department of Corrections could parole Muldrew 
in Los Angeles County because of the multitude of victims. "We are not just 
looking to keep him out of Covina," said Covina Councilman Thomas Falls. "We 
think there are enough victims to keep him out of the county."

SANTA MONICA OKS TOUGH SMOKING BAN -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council has passed the toughest smoking restrictions in 
the Los Angeles area, a ban on puffing in all indoor workplaces -- including 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
 But barflies need not extinguish their smokes just yet -- the ban is expected 
to be repealed when two new council members are sworn in next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The law would prohibit smoking in all businesses, employee break rooms, hotel 
and motel lobbies, banquet and meeting rooms, and warehouses as of early next 
year. Its ban on smoking in bars would take effect in January, 1996, after a 
one-year grace period. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ordinance probably will be revisited next month, after council 
members-elect Pam O'Connor and Ruth Ebner are seated. They replace council 
members Antonio Vazquez and Kelly Olsen -- the ban's chief supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to call for the ordinance to be reconsidered as soon as the new 
council is sworn in," said Councilman Robert Holbrook, who was reelected to a 
second term in November. "I'm confident (the ban) is going to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook, who initially voted to oppose the ban, changed his vote after it was 
clear the ordinance had the support needed for approval. By voting with the 
majority, he is allowed to make a motion to reconsider the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In public hearings on the measure last week, the council was deluged with 
complaints by business and restaurant owners that a smoking ban would drive 
customers to bars and restaurants in neighboring cities where smoking is 
allowed. Representatives of hotels and travel agencies, meanwhile, said foreign 
travelers who smoke would avoid Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the ban consider the measure good for public health. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen said that the dangers of secondhand smoke are well-documented and that 
studies of the economic impacts of smoking bans are inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assuming there is (a fiscal) impact, which I doubt, I reject the argument 
that finances are more important than health," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Mayor Judy Abdo and Councilmen Ken Genser, Holbrook, Olsen and 
Vazquez voted for the measure, with Councilwoman Asha Greenberg and Councilman 
Paul Rosenstein in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, like Los Angeles, prohibits smoking in restaurants but not in 
bars. Because of a statewide law taking effect on Jan. 1, 1995, all cities 
statewide must prohibit smoking in restaurants, but the state law does not ban 
smoking in bars for four years.

2 CHARGED IN BEATING AT SURFING CONTEST; CRIME: WORLD-RANKED ATHLETE, FATHER OF 
OTHER COMPETITOR ARE ACCUSED IN ATTACK ON MAN WHO REFUSED TO LEAVE COMPETITION 
SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A world-ranked surfer and the father of another top surfing competitor have 
been charged with beating a man who refused to leave the waters off Malibu 
after a surf contest had started. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Henry Hookano, 34, of Oahu and Joseph David Tudor, 43, of San Diego 
failed to respond to letters and telephone calls from the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office after felony assault charges were filed Oct. 28. As 
a result, arrest warrants have been issued. Bail for each man has been set at 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hookano, who ranks fourth in longboard surfing worldwide, and Tudor, who is 
the father of third-ranked Joel Tudor, were at Surfrider Beach in Malibu the 
morning of Sept. 27 for the Oxbow World Longboard Championships. Richard P. 
Ernsdorf, who had been at the popular spot since early that morning surfing on 
a knee board, did not leave when the contest began. Tudor allegedly went out on 
a paddleboard to confront Ernsdorf after contest organizers asked non-competing 
surfers to leave the water. A fight ensued. Hookano paddled out a little later 
and joined in, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernsdorf suffered a concussion, 15 stitches to his face and a dislocated 
shoulder in the fight. He was treated by county lifeguards at the scene and 
taken to Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip Stirling said Ernsdorf's injuries were severe 
enough to warrant felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident has also served as a lightning rod for the Los Angeles County 
Department of Beaches and Harbors, which last month suspended issuance of surf 
contest permits until January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfrider Beach is the best surfing in L.A. County," said Ken Johnson, chief 
of community services for the department. "We're looking at whether the number 
of bookings at the beach were too much. We will change the policy if need be." 
</P>
<P>
 Three requests for surf contests, two professional and one amateur, have been 
temporarily denied, Johnson said. Los Angeles County lifeguards and beach 
administrators will review the way permits are issued at Surfrider Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Three surf events were held in September at Surfrider Beach, according to 
Department of Beaches and Harbors officials, monopolizing the popular surfing 
spot nearly every weekend that month. Six permits were issued from May to 
October, the region's surf season.

CARJACKING SUSPECT DIES IN GUNFIGHT WITH POLICE; VIOLENCE: AUTHORITIES SAY THE 
PAIR SHOT A MOTORIST AND FLED IN HIS VEHICLE. SECOND MAN IS ARRESTED AFTER 
HIGH-SPEED CHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Police Wednesday shot to death one of two carjackers who wounded a motorist 
and fled in his car on a high-speed chase through the streets of Pacoima before 
engaging officers in a gunfight, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacking victim, whom witnesses identified as a man in his early 20s, 
was in good condition at Holy Cross Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. Police and hospital officials would not reveal the victim's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent episode began about 3:30 p.m. when two robbers shot the car owner 
in the leg outside an auto parts store at the corner of Van Nuys and Laurel 
Canyon boulevards, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were laughing when they shot him," LAPD spokesman Lt. John Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjackers then fled in the victim's blue Chevrolet Blazer north on Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard, leaving the man writhing in pain in the store's parking lot, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, police pursued the Blazer until it crashed into a curb in the 
13900 block of Daventry Street, about seven blocks away. The carjacker in the 
passenger seat jumped out and began shooting at the pursuing officers, who 
returned fire, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy with the gun unloaded on police and tried to make a break for it," 
said Miguel Zeda, 20, of Pacoima, a bystander who saw the gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun battle ended when officers fatally shot the gunman behind a house at 
the corner of Daventry and Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Dunkin said. No officers 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The other carjacker ran east on Daventry, but surrendered to officers who 
found him hiding near a house about a block away, police said. He was arrested 
on suspicion of murder -- for his alleged involvement in a crime in which 
someone was killed -- and taken to Foothill police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the dead man as Billy Sales, 24, and the suspect in custody 
as Robert Vincent Estrada, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the auto parts store where the incident began, who asked not to 
be identified, said he called police after a woman ran into the store crying 
hysterically over the shooting outside. He ran out to find the wounded car 
owner, whom he said was a regular customer, in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 A worker at the store, who asked not to be identified, said he waited by the 
victim's side until police arrived minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we heard the commotion, we went out and police were here sooner than 
you can imagine," he said. "(The victim) was really quiet. He wanted his 
father." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's incident was the second carjacking in as many days in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hag Mahmoud Tahir, 34, of Los Angeles was being held by police on suspicion of 
robbery and assault. Tahir is accused of beating an Encino woman Tuesday, 
pushing her out of her van, running over her and then leading police on a 
nearly hourlong chase through Valley streets before surrendering, police said.

GROUP SEEKS AN END TO SCHOOL'S RACIAL STRIFE; EDUCATION: HARMONY COALITION 
SOLICITS STUDENT PLEDGES TO END CONFLICT BETWEEN LATINOS AND ARMENIANS AT GRANT 
HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like every other day, the Armenian students spent their lunch period under the 
four shade trees on one side of Grant High School's quad; the Latino students 
gathered on the opposite side. But in the middle, a new group seized its 
territory Wednesday, taking students and even some teachers by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling itself the Harmony Coalition, the dozen or so student council leaders 
and volunteers urged all Grant teen-agers to sign pledges promising peace on 
campus. They set up tables, blew up balloons and beckoned classmates, shaking 
hands and offering pens for signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get the kids to understand that schools should be safe and 
that violence against peers will not be tolerated," said Arthur Stevens, a 
financial services salesman who founded the group, which promotes safety on 
campuses. "There were concerns at Grant . . . and we thought that maybe 
everyone could come together and heal some of those wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 One month ago, two Armenian students were stabbed and a Latino boy injured in 
a drive-by shooting at about the same time in what administrators and students 
described as escalating racial conflicts. All three students have recovered and 
returned to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent outbreak had a sobering effect on Grant students, who said that 
tensions have been considerably reduced since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to get along now -- people are tired of violence," said Eric 
Mejia, a 17-year-old senior who was among the first students to sign a peace 
pledge. "Everything is calm now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmony Coalition has spent most of its time at schools were violence has 
occurred, most recently at Hollywood High School, where a student was fatally 
shot after school in September. Although the Grant incidents took place just 
off campus, fights had broken out earlier inside the school gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never gotten along together in the schools," said Harry Khorkhoryan, a 
16-year-old junior, referring to Latino and Armenian students. "I've never 
known why. But it should change." 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 students signed pledges -- a fraction of the 3,000-student body at 
Grant -- but administrators and student leaders said they were still pleased 
with the event. "People seemed to care about this," said Alan Stein, the 
student council president. "We hope it's the first step of many in bringing the 
Grant family together." 
</P>
<P>
 The school also launched a "Harmony Coalition Club" to continue the push for 
peaceful coexistence between groups. Students said the tension between 
Armenians and Latinos has been a continual problem erupting at least once 
during the school year into a fight.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, the focus was peace. "Look, it's like nothing ever 
happened," said Cecilia Salvador, a 17-year-old senior. "Everything is pretty 
low-key right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinning yellow ribbons to their shirts to symbolize their dedication to 
keeping violence off campus, the students signed the pledges to "extend my hand 
in peace and friendship to my fellow human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students signed but admitted later they weren't really aware of the 
significance. "Why did I sign?" senior Edzita Manoukian, 17, said, giggling. 
"Because my friends were signing them."

UNATTENDED BABY DIES; MOTHER TRIES SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A woman who neighbors said was suffering from depression apparently tried to 
commit suicide by jumping off a freeway overpass Wednesday morning, just 
minutes before her infant son -- left unattended by the woman -- died of 
unknown causes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be the baby died of natural causes and the mother was suffering from 
postpartum depression," Burbank Police Lt. Don Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragic series of events began about 10:06 a.m., when Burbank police 
officers tried to resuscitate 10-day-old Colin McCollough, who had been left 
alone at his family's duplex in the 1200 block of North Kenwood Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the baby's father, Jeffrey McCollough, 35, a self-employed roofing 
contractor, called authorities after he arrived home from work and discovered 
the infant in a bedroom, bleeding from the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother -- who had been at home with the infant -- was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was giving CPR to the baby when the officers arrived," Burbank Sgt. Scott 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics took the baby to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where he was 
pronounced dead at about 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes earlier, California Highway Patrol officers were notified that a woman 
had jumped from the Hollywood Way overpass onto the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, later identified as the baby's mother -- Tani R. McCollough, 31 -- 
was rushed to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where she underwent 
surgery and was listed in "extremely critical condition," with a fractured 
neck, skull and wrist, hospital spokesman Harvey Kern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Lt. Larry Koch said McCollough had apparently walked the mile or so 
from her home to the freeway before jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities gave conflicting reports of whether McCollough was struck by any 
cars after she landed on the freeway. One CHP officer said a trucker stopped 
his vehicle in an effort to protect the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not identified McCollough as a suspect in her son's death. They 
are awaiting autopsy results to determine whether the infant died of natural 
causes.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside the couple's home Wednesday afternoon, bouquets of flowers decorated 
the kitchen. On a table were two books, "What to Expect Your First Year" and 
"You Can't Afford the Luxury of Negative Thoughts." A banner exclaiming "It's a 
Boy!" hung over a doorway leading to the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and police in interviews described Tani McCollough as depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said that "Tani was getting real 
panicky" during her pregnancy and that she had said she was worried about 
caring for the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeffrey was so excited to have a child; this was their first baby," the 
neighbor said. "He was aware of the problem, he was always trying to have 
people around her." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Saldana, another neighbor, said that Jeffrey McCollough "had been 
fixing the place up real nice for the baby." Saldana said she had planned to 
offer to baby-sit for the couple because "sometimes you need to get away and 
have some space for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, who lived next-door to the McColloughs said: "They're a very 
wonderful family. . . . There's been a very terrible tragedy. I'm very 
distraught myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident triggered a massive traffic jam on the eastbound Ventura Freeway 
that lasted more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw her falling," said David Hines, who was heading to Verdugo Hills 
Hospital in Glendale when he saw McCollough jump from the overpass.

SMOOTH SAILING; FEW EXPECTED HOLIDAY HEADACHES MATERIALIZE AT LOCAL AIRPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 All preflight jitters aside, the Pasquini family of Granada Hills, bound for 
Chicago, took a bus from the FlyAway lot here to avoid the holiday crunch that 
stops cars in their tracks, clogs parking lots and turns easygoing folks into 
frustrated travel zombies. 
</P>
<P>
 Their worst fear -- a glut of people choking every corridor at Los Angeles 
International Airport -- never materialized Wednesday. It was the anticipation 
of trouble that had kept the family from traveling back home for the past nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first holiday we've gone back to Chicago since we moved here all 
of those years ago," Dan Pasquini said. "We were always worried about getting 
bumped off of our flight or having to deal with wall-to-wall crowds." 
</P>
<P>
 To their surprise, ticket counters were wide open at 10 a.m., and the family 
had the good fortune to be assigned to Gate 41, the first one in the terminal, 
less that 100 feet from the metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 This was just too easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd at LAX on Wednesday morning looked more like what you'd expect to 
see at the Columbus Airport than at the world's fourth-busiest, where on an 
average day 125,000 people pass through its portals. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at airports from John Wayne to Charles Lindbergh, from Los Angeles 
International to Ontario International, the crush of Thanksgiving holiday 
travelers proved more lamb than lion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear the horror stories of traveling through LAX, but when you go out and 
walk around, it's just not there," said LAX spokeswoman Diane Scully. "Yes, 
it's busy -- but the traffic is moving." 
</P>
<P>
 A national airline association estimated that nationwide 11 million people 
would fly during Thanksgiving week. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic at Burbank Airport, where about 15,000 passengers boarded 185 
departing flights, was more manageable than ever, said spokesman Victor Gill, 
thanks to added parking spaces and widened traffic lanes in front of the 
terminal. "If anything, we've gotten our act firmly refined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, John Wayne Airport spokeswoman Pat Ware said, "Everything's 
been going at a very brisk pace, but it's also been very smooth." One of the 
few emergencies among the 25,000 travelers passing through occurred when three 
passengers panicked after discovering they had lost their tickets. In each 
case, airport security officers found the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the nation, air traffic moved smoothly Wednesday, said FAA 
spokesman Fred O'Donnell. Only in Alaska, where snow slowed operations at 
Anchorage and Fairbanks airports, was weather a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What affects operations is weather, and we've got excellent weather virtually 
everywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Pasquinis may have dodged a bullet, they had prepared for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Pasquini worked until 2 a.m. cleaning house only to get up three hours 
later to call and ask about parking at the lot. By the time she called, the lot 
was full. 
</P>
<P>
 Plan B kicked in: Take a taxi to the airport bus service in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lot was full by 5:15 a.m.," said Jordan Rackerby, a security officer who 
has worked at FlyAway since it opened 20 years ago. And the overflow lot was 
itself overflowing by 6:45 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others weren't so lucky. At the other end of the travel spectrum, the Bledy 
family represented a how-not-to primer in holiday travel. 
</P>
<P>
 They arrived at the Van Nuys FlyAway lot at 7:15 a.m., 15 minutes before their 
bus, to find the parking and overflow lots filled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills family of six, which was headed to Crescent City near the 
Oregon border, went into emergency mode, driving their luggage-filled station 
wagon to the first street parking space they found so they could sprint back to 
the station in time. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, it was smooth sailing for the Pasquinis, who arrived at LAX in 45 
minutes. With plenty of time before the flight, there was time to anticipate 
all the fun they would have in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 30 people and two 20-pound turkeys waiting for us," Dan Pasquini 
said proudly. And Danny Jr., 16, would play in his first Turkey Bowl, an annual 
family post-Thanksgiving touch football game that has been a ritual for the 
past 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The family would meet a few new members, a couple of newborn nieces and 
grand-nieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Jr., a teen-ager in baggy shorts and a Michigan basketball jersey, 
stopped to listen to Ali Reza, a representative for Community for Human Rights 
in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you sign up?" his father Dan asked when he walked back to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I gave him Guy's name," he said referring to a high school friend. "He 
always does it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the people leaving town, an equal number were arriving in Southern 
California for the long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Kailukaitis was in the Southland on business, so he beckoned his wife and 
two kids from Dallas to join him for skiing at Big Bear. The family figures on 
eating out tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Carol Hough arrived at Ontario from Santa Cruz, and loaded their 
rental car with sports tools for a tennis weekend in Palm Desert. They too will 
eat out tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gene Bloch and his daughter, Vicki, arrived from San Francisco to join his 
parents for a weekend of boating on Lake Mojave, along the Colorado River north 
of Laughlin.

STUDENT EXCHANGE LIKELY TO ENDURE; DEATH: OFFICIALS SAID THE LOSS OF A CHINESE 
BOY'S LIFE SHOULD NOT END PROGRAM BETWEEN LAUSD AND A CITY NEAR HONG KONG.

 Officials overseeing the first large-scale student exchange program between 
China and the Los Angeles Unified School District said Wednesday that they do 
not expect the death of one of the students to mar the program's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Bin-Feng Zheng, 12, died late Monday night after he was struck by a car as he 
darted across Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Burbank Boulevard in Woodland 
Hills. Bin-Feng was one of 75 students who traveled from Guangzhou, a large 
city near Hong Kong, to attend a program at Hale Middle School, built around 
English as a Second Language courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Tung, director of the Sino-U.S. Business and Technology Exchange, a 
private company that works on Trans-Pacific business ventures and helped set up 
the student exchange, said she does not expect the boy's death to have a 
negative effect on the exchange program and that so far the rest of the 
students appear committed to finishing their courses here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accidents will happen anytime, anywhere," Tung said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bin-Feng, who had adopted the American name Roy and was known for his 
curiosity, apparently slipped away from the Woodland Hills apartment complex 
where he and the other students have lived since their arrival in September. 
Tung said an investigation has been launched to determine how the boy managed 
to elude his chaperon. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese-speaking crisis counselors continued to comfort Bin-Feng's companions 
Wednesday at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to be a little better, they're more refreshed," said Karen 
Stafford, an ESL coordinator. She said school officials planned to give 
individual counseling to any students, such as the boy's roommates, who may be 
having a particularly difficult time dealing with his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to continue to work through this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stafford said Hale students are planning to write to Bin-Feng's parents in 
China. Steve Lawler, an assistant principal at Hale, said that his office has 
also received an outpouring of concern from people in the community who read 
about the Chinese students in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are devastated by this and want to express their condolences to the 
family too," Lawler said.

WOMAN JUMPS OFF OVERPASS; NEWBORN SHE LEFT AT HOME DIES

 A woman who neighbors said was suffering from depression apparently tried to 
commit suicide by jumping off a freeway overpass Wednesday morning, just 
minutes before her infant son -- whom she left unattended -- was pronounced 
dead, Burbank police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be the baby died of natural causes and the mother was suffering from 
postpartum depression," said Lt. Don Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragic series of events began about 10 a.m. when Burbank police officers 
tried to resuscitate 10-day-old Colin McCollough, left alone at his family's 
duplex in the 1200 block of North Kenwood Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the baby's father, Jeffrey McCollough, 35, a self-employed roofing 
contractor, called authorities after he arrived home from work and discovered 
the infant in a bedroom, bleeding from the mouth. The boy's mother, who had 
been home with the infant, was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was giving CPR to the baby when the officers arrived," Sgt. Scott Wilson 
said. Paramedics took the baby to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where 
he was pronounced dead about 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes earlier, California Highway Patrol officers were notified of a woman 
who had jumped from the Hollywood Way overpass onto the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, later identified as the baby's mother, Tani R. McCollough, 31, was 
rushed to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where she underwent surgery 
and was listed in "extremely critical condition," said Harvey Kern, a hospital 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities gave conflicting reports on whether McCollough was struck by any 
cars after she landed on the freeway, but one CHP officer said a trucker 
stopped his vehicle in an effort to protect the woman from oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are awaiting autopsy results to determine whether the child died of 
natural causes, although authorities said there were no obvious signs of 
trauma.

EDELMAN TAKES JOBS WITH RAND, MEDIATION FIRM; GOVERNMENT: VETERAN SUPERVISOR 
RETIRES NEXT MONTH. HE WILL SERVE AS SENIOR FELLOW AT SANTA MONICA INSTITUTE 
AND NEGOTIATOR WITH ORANGE COUNTY SERVICE.

 Supervisor Ed Edelman announced Wednesday that he will split his time between 
a RAND post and professional negotiating when he retires from the Board of 
Supervisors early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who will end a five-term, 20-year stint on the board Dec. 2, said at 
a news conference he had considered several options, including practicing law, 
but settled on public policy and arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intention of retiring from public life," said Edelman, 64. "At 
RAND, I will be able to use their great resources to reach out to the community 
. . . and (because) I've enjoyed being on the board as a conciliator and 
mediator, I'm glad I will be able to continue that interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who has a campaign chest of more than $900,000, said he will use that 
money to start a foundation for music and performing arts in the county, 
although he was unsure when it would begin. 
</P>
<P>
 At RAND, Edelman will serve as a senior fellow and assist graduate students at 
the Santa Monica-based public policy institute. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND's president and CEO, James A. Thompson, said Edelman's 29-year career as 
an elected official would be especially valuable for students at RAND's 
Graduate School of Public Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our students come back and tell us, 'You gave us a great education, but you 
forgot to tell us one thing, that the world out there is so much more 
complicated and political than we thought,' " Thompson said. "We are looking 
for Ed to help us with that." 
</P>
<P>
 As a negotiator with Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services/Endispute based 
in Orange, Edelman will join a panel of other mediators -- most of them retired 
judges -- who attempt to resolve civil disputes before they reach the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman will focus on environmental, employment and government issues with the 
service, which is the largest of its kind in the United States.  
</P>
<P>
 As a supervisor, Edelman helped resolve several conflicts with labor unions, 
including a threatened county nurse's walkout in 1990 and the recent 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority strike. He is also credited with helping 
keep the peace between some of his more contentious colleagues on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman announced his retirement last December, less than a year before he 
would have faced reelection for a sixth term. The announcement came as a 
surprise to many on his staff, but Edelman said he decided to retire so he 
could pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Before serving two decades as a supervisor, Edelman was a Los Angeles city 
councilman for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, elected to the board in June, will fill 
Edelman's 3rd District seat starting Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman is the third long-serving supervisor to retire since 1991, following 
Pete Schabarum and Kenneth Hahn. Supervisor Deane Dana, who was elected in 
1980, announced earlier this month that he will retire when his term ends in 
two years.

1 DEAD, 3 WOUNDED IN GANG SHOOTOUT AT RESTAURANT

 A suspected gang member died and three of his friends were wounded after a 
shootout Tuesday night in a South El Monte restaurant, a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seyha Tauch, 19, of Pomona died early Wednesday at Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center after an argument between between rival gangs erupted in gunfire 
at the Cafe Thuy Au, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Tauch's friends, all teen-age boys whose name were withheld, were 
wounded. Two boys remain hospitalized while the third was treated and released 
into police custody. A 15-year-old girl, who was with Tauch's group, was not 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's spokeswoman Irma Becerra said that although Tauch and his friends 
were the victims in this crime, police suspect that they committed an armed 
robbery at a liquor store earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group was seen leaving the store in a stolen van," Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 A semiautomatic handgun believed to have been used in the robbery was 
recovered at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man who was treated and released from the hospital and the 
15-year-old girl were taken to Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the rival group escaped.

PARKS AGENCY WINS EMINENT DOMAIN RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major legal victory for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a judge 
ruled Wednesday that the agency has the authority to use eminent domain to 
seize Soka University's scenic Calabasas campus for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-hour hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court, Judge Barnet Cooperman 
said it was "only common sense" to interpret state law as giving the 
conservancy the power to condemn private property for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 That question has been at the center of the two-year legal battle between the 
conservancy and Soka over the school's campus at the corner of Las Virgenes 
Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, conservancy executive director Joseph T. Edmiston 
slapped high-fives with jubilant staff members. He called Cooperman's decision 
an "important threshold" in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said: "I think there are a lot of steps to go. It 
would be a good bet that case will not be settled one way or another much 
before 1998." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a considerable step forward for the conservancy, Wednesday's decision 
by no means assures that the university's property will fall into public hands. 
Although Cooperman said the conservancy has the legal power to condemn the 
land, he has yet to rule on whether it may. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, lawyers will return to court Dec. 8 to argue other issues relating to 
the conservancy's right to take Soka's land. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy -- a state agency that acquires parkland -- is trying to seize 
245 of Soka's 662 acres for use as a visitors center for the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, on the other hand, wants to expand its 200-student language school into 
a liberal arts college enrolling 3,500 students at the site, which includes the 
former ranch of razor magnate King Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cooperman, who retires from the bench in December, ultimately rules that 
the conservancy can take Soka's land, then a jury will decide how much the 
school should be compensated for its property. 
</P>
<P>
 That process, too, is fraught with difficulties. If the jury values Soka's 
property at more than the conservancy is prepared to pay -- roughly $20 million 
-- then the school has threatened to sue for damages.

WOMAN CHARGED OVER ABORTION CLINIC PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys woman has been charged with violating a court order to stay away 
from a medical clinic after she allegedly harassed a couple who were seeking an 
abortion because the fetus was diagnosed as brain-dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Vargovcik, 34, is scheduled to be tried Dec. 27 in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court on misdemeanor charges of violating a court order and violating a 
preliminary injunction, each of which is punishable by a maximum of one year in 
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mike Qualls, spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney's 
office, a Van Nuys couple -- whose names were not released -- arrived at the 
clinic in the 6900 block of Van Nuys Boulevard on Nov. 1 for a scheduled 
appointment in connection with the planned abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargovcik allegedly confronted the couple as they drove into the driveway of 
the clinic, repeatedly urging them not to enter the clinic and tossed into 
their car anti-abortion pamphlets containing photographs of dead fetuses. She 
then allegedly followed them to a parking space and continued to harass them 
and tried to prevent them from entering the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband told police that he and his wife had planned to have the baby, but 
decided an abortion was necessary when the fetus was diagnosed as brain-dead 
after five months. He said his wife was greatly upset by the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic officials called police, who arrested Vargovcik. She was booked and 
later released. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic had obtained a preliminary injunction last December against 
Vargovcik harassing patients outside the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Vargovcik nor clinic officials could be reached for comment.

SANTA CLARITA JOINS AGENCIES ASKING FOR A SAFER HIGHWAY; TRANSPORTATION: CITING 
THE DEATHS OF 29 PEOPLE SINCE 1989, OFFICIALS PRESS THE STATE FOR IMPROVEMENTS 
TO CALIFORNIA 126. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-mile stretch of California 126 west of the city has been a death trap in 
recent years -- since 1989, there have been 29 traffic deaths, about twice the 
average rate for a state highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities along the route have passed resolutions urging that 
improvements be made to the road. Fillmore Mayor Pro Tem Roger Campbell, one of 
the leading proponents of the improvements, said he wants the state Department 
of Transportation to place concrete center dividers on four-lane stretches of 
the road between Santa Clarita and Santa Paula, with the remaining two-lane 
portions expanded to four lanes as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every head-on collision would be stopped," he said. "People would also drive 
slower because of tunnel effect." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen government and civic agencies have supported the proposed 
improvements, including the Santa Clarita City Council, which unanimously 
endorsed a resolution Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy noted that Caltrans widened part of the road from 
two lanes to four earlier this year, but the highway remains dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did the widening, but there's no barrier in-between," she said. "When 
people get sleepy and there's not a great deal of lighting, they drift off into 
the other lane into oncoming traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is studying the possibility of installing median barriers, but won't 
know for at least a few months if they will improve the road's safety, said 
Rick Holland, spokesman for the state agency. He said the concerns expressed by 
Campbell and his supporters will be considered in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said two previous efforts to obtain the improvements since 1989 have 
been unsuccessful, but he renewed his efforts after two men were killed in a 
head-on collision east of Fillmore in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most dangerous highways in the state of California," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland said it is possible that the barriers would cause more problems than 
they solve. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might run into the median when they otherwise might adjust," he said. 
"It will also cut off a lot of people from their businesses and homes, and the 
U-turns they make could lead to hazards." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said his proposal calls for openings at all turnoffs, which would 
eliminate much of that risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of installing a safety divider has not yet been determined, but 
Caltrans would be able to pay for it out of a safety fund designated for small 
projects, Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Widening the road is another matter: Several such projects in the region have 
been put on hold because money has been diverted to seismic retrofitting 
projects in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Projects to widen the road are scheduled, but I'm not sure when it will 
actually take place," Holland said.

PUBLIC VOTE ON AIRPORT WORK DENIED; BURBANK: DIVIDED COUNCIL DEFEATS BID TO 
GAUGE SENTIMENT OVER TERMINAL EXPANSION PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to put Burbank Airport's terminal expansion plan to a popular vote 
has been defeated by a sharply divided Burbank City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was introduced by Vice Mayor Dave Golonski, who had hoped that a vote 
would influence the thinking of airport officials and signal the public's 
sentiment over the controversial multimillion-dollar project. 
</P>
<P>
 But three council members -- Mayor Bill Wiggins, Bob Bowne and George Battey 
-- voted against it, saying plans to quadruple the size of the present terminal 
have not progressed far enough to ask voters for an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we sit here, there is no project," said Battey, who is also one of nine 
commissioners on the Airport Authority, the facility's operating board. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority, which is made up of representatives from the cities of Burbank, 
Glendale and Pasadena, is under court order to halt work on the project until a 
lawsuit filed by the city of Los Angeles and four homeowners groups is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Design work on the project has not yet started, but airport officials released 
general plans for the new terminal in an environmental study that is required 
under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit against the Airport Authority, Los Angeles and the homeowners 
groups in the southeast San Fernando Valley dispute the study's conclusion that 
a larger terminal would not significantly increase aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Golonski's failed proposal would have asked Burbank residents whether they 
support a building any larger than the terminal is now. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Burbank residents ought to be able to exercise more control over the 
future of Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (airport officials) need that direction," Golonski said. "I don't 
know that the community's been consulted on this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Susan Spanos sided with Golonski on a 2-3 vote.

CITY HALL NEWS: JUDGE SLASHES JURY AWARD TO EX-MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $1.2-million jury award to former South Pasadena Mayor Lee D. Prentiss 
against the city for violating his civil rights was slashed to $500,000 last 
week by a Pasadena Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction will keep the city from emptying its reserves and cutting 
services to make up the losses, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing. It was a lot of money," David King, Prentiss' attorney, 
said of Judge J. Michael Byrne's Nov. 14 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Prentiss has until Monday to reject the new award and has yet to make a 
decision, King said. If he rejects the award, a new trial will be held on the 
single issue of economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury awarded Prentiss the money in July after finding the city had violated 
his civil rights in 1990. The jury ruled that the city conspired to revoke 
Prentiss' permit to expand his 86-year-old home because of his conservative 
political views. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Byrne wrote that jurors had failed to take into account 
Prentiss' already precarious financial position before the problems with the 
permit and that economists testifying on Prentiss' behalf had overestimated his 
losses.

 Alhambra, which is nearly three-fourths Latino or Asian, now has an all-white 
City Council after this month's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino Councilman Michael Blanco's two-term limit on the council expired this 
year, preventing him from running. And the sole minority candidate, Louis Kuan, 
finished last in a field of five candidates running for three open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there is no representation (for minorities) in Alhambra, period," Kuan 
said. "Seventy-five percent of the population has no representation." 
</P>
<P>
 His opponent, incumbent Councilwoman Barbara Messina, and several members of 
the community, including Chinese Americans, denied Kuan's claim that 
anti-immigrant sentiment embodied in Proposition 187 caused his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one other candidate bolsters his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Mack, who ran and lost in the District 5 race against businessman 
Paul Talbot, ran on an informal slate with Kuan. Mack said business owners and 
residents on the campaign trail were willing to display her campaign signs, but 
told her they would not display Kuan's signs, primarily because he is Chinese 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack, who is white, took 44%, or 5,445 votes cast in the District 5 race. Kuan 
took only 33% of the votes in the District 2 race against Messina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Proposition 187 had a lot to do with it," Kuan said. In Alhambra, the 
controversial measure to cut off many public services to illegal immigrants 
lost by 905 votes. "Certainly, being Asian didn't help my cause." 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian Pacific American Legal Defense Center will investigate Kuan's claim 
that racial bigotry played a role in the election, said Stewart Kwoh, legal 
center executive director. The legal center, one of four civil rights groups 
suing the state to stop implementation of Proposition 187, will also look into 
whether Alhambra's election process is unfair to the city's minority 
communities, Kwoh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other cities, Alhambra does not elect council members by district, 
a system that usually gives minority candidates an edge in heavily minority 
districts. While candidates must run in the district where they live, they are 
elected by the city at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The once predominantly white community has seen a 36% decrease in the number 
of white residents since 1980. It now is 36% Latino and 37% Asian American; the 
number of Asian Americans in the city has tripled in the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuan is the third Asian American to run for Alhambra council, and the third to 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Messina pointed out that she had the support of several prominent Chinese 
American business and community leaders, including the endorsement of Sophie 
Wong, the city's only elected Asian American official. Wong won a second 
four-year term to the Alhambra School District Board of Education in the Nov. 8 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone of any race can run for office," Messina said. "If they have any 
credibility they will be elected. Louis Kuan is a big crybaby. He had nothing 
to offer this community. He ran a terrible, terrible campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said an Asian American candidate should not expect the support of the 
Asian community just because of their shared ethnic background.

DISTRICT SUED FOR CANCELING SESSION ABOUT GAYS IN SCHOOL; COURTS: TEACHERS 
CHALLENGE DECISION BY PRESIDENT OF WEST COVINA SCHOOL BOARD, WHO SAID WORKSHOP 
MIGHT SEEM TO PROMOTE HOMOSEXUALITY. SEX EDUCATION CURRICULUM HAS ALSO BEEN IN 
DISPUTE.

<P>
 The West Covina teachers union filed suit against the school district Tuesday 
challenging a decision to cancel a teachers' workshop on homosexuals in 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court against the West Covina Unified 
School District, says the cancellation violated teachers' 1st Amendment right 
to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a right, as adults, to attend this workshop," said Kim Breen, 
president of the West Covina Unified Teachers Union. "They (the school board) 
simply censored it." 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop on how teachers can help gay and lesbian students was originally 
scheduled for Oct. 17 by the West Covina district as part of an all-day 
conference offering 62 workshops for teachers from 10 area school districts.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Spence, president of the school board, who took responsibility for 
canceling the workshop, said he thought the title of the workshop, "Out of the 
Closet and Into the Classroom," sounded as if the session would promote 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teen-agers are confused about a lot of things, and I think it's wrong to 
encourage sexual behavior among adolescents," Spence said. "We have school 
counselors if students need help." 
</P>
<P>
 Breen, who said a gay former student of hers recently attempted suicide, said 
that students often turn to their teachers with questions about sexuality, and 
that teachers need more information and strategies for helping students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not some bizarre topic," she said. "How many lives will it take for 
the members of the school board to realize that this is a serious issue?" 
</P>
<P>
 A 1989 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated 
that gay and lesbian youths are two to three times more likely to attempt 
suicide than are heterosexual teen-agers and that gay and lesbian teen-agers 
account for about 30% of all youth suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers already had been at odds with the district over a memo last year 
concerning sex education.  
</P>
<P>
 Breen said she and other district teachers received a letter instructing them 
not to teach sex education, but district officials said the only memo that was 
sent out asked teachers to temporarily stop teaching about sexually transmitted 
diseases, including AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Evans, assistant superintendent of the West Covina Unified School 
District, said she sent a memo last May asking teachers to postpone instruction 
on sexually transmitted diseases, and that was all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not write a letter telling them to stop teaching sex ed classes," Evans 
said. "Perhaps they interpreted the memo incorrectly, but they have not come 
forward to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't taught one sex ed class this year because of the letter," said 
Marilyn McQuown, an eighth-grade science teacher at Edgewood Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Breen, who also teaches science at Edgewood Middle School, said that one of 
her 13-year-old students recently gave birth to a baby boy and that four other 
students are pregnant at the West Covina school. Because of the letter, she 
said, she hasn't taught sex education this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the district) are out of touch with reality," Breen said. "We have 
children raising children and having unprotected sex. These are real problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bugbee, chairman of the science department at West Covina High School, 
said he never received a letter specifically prohibiting sex education but said 
there was some confusion over the memo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The memo implied that it might be best to postpone sex ed," Bugbee said. "I 
left it up to the teachers to decide, and as far as I know, some are teaching 
it and some are not." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans and Spence both told The Times that they know nothing about a letter 
specifically banning sex education instruction and that there is no record of 
it in their files. McQuown and Breen said they threw their copies away. 
</P>
<P>
 The May memo states that instruction on sexually transmitted diseases should 
be postponed pending revisions by the Communicable Disease Advisory Committee. 
The committee, a group of teachers, parents and school administrators formed by 
the district in the late 1980s, reviewed the course content over the summer. 
Such committees are standard practice for school districts.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommended a program stressing abstinence as the best 
protection against sexually transmitted diseases.

AIDE TO STALIN HAS LAST WORD; BOOKS: UNLIKE MANY IN THE DICTATOR'S ORBIT, 
POMONA COLLEGE PROFESSOR SURVIVED TO TELL HIS STORY. HIS MEMOIRS, 'AT STALIN'S 
SIDE,' DESCRIBE HIS YEARS AS A SOVIET INTERPRETER. 
</P>

<P>
 He was Stalin's interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike most people in the dictator's orbit, Valentin M. Berezhkov lived to 
tell the tale, which is just what the Pomona College professor does in his 
just-published memoirs, "At Stalin's Side." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1916 in Kiev -- when his country was still ruled by autocratic czars 
-- Berezhkov arced the trajectory of Soviet Communism, spanning the Russian 
Revolution, communism's long reign and the Soviet Union's collapse 74 years 
later. Completing the circle, Berezhkov's son Sergei interprets for Boris N. 
Yeltsin when the Russian leader meets with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Through eyewitness accounts of history, the elder Berezhkov offers Claremont 
students a priceless, first-person view of pivotal Soviet events. Tall, 
broad-shouldered, with a statesman's presence and leonine white mane, 
Berezhkov, 77, feels free to tell his tales now. The Soviet Union is no more 
and most of his contemporaries are dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Berezhkov "has an extraordinary ability not only to re-create what he thought 
and felt at the time but to reflect on it, without fear of political pressure, 
as a historical episode that has run its course," said David Elliott, a 
professor of government at Pomona College who co-teaches a class on the Cold 
War with Berezhkov. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berezhkov's survival during the terror unleashed by Josef Stalin, his fall 
from grace at the hands of dreaded KGB chief Lavrenti Beria, and his subsequent 
rehabilitation and rise to diplomat would be the stuff of spy novels if it 
wasn't real life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had the good fortune to be witness to some of the events that helped 
shape our century," Berezhkov wrote in the preface. "I was 1 1/2 years old when 
the czarist empire crumbled. . . . My grandson, Daniel, had reached the same 
age when the Soviet empire fell to pieces. May God spare him the experience of 
my generation!" 
</P>
<P>
 Berezhkov was born in St. Petersburg, but his family fled to Kiev during the 
Russian civil war that followed the revolution. He recalled that as a young boy 
in the early 1930s he stepped over the frozen corpses of peasants who died of 
starvation when Stalin closed off the Ukraine -- then known as the breadbasket 
of the Soviet Union -- to create an artificial famine that would force peasants 
onto collective farms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he escaped the fate of up to 7 million Soviets who died during the 
famine, Berezhkov recalls gnawing hunger during much of his childhood that left 
him too weak to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, moving fluidly between personal anecdotes and historic events, he draws 
colorful sketches of times between upheaval and famine when Russians snatched 
briefly at happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 On warm summer nights in the 1930s, family and friends gathered in the 
Berezhkov apartment for impromptu concerts, causing passersby to gather under 
the window to hear the music. Berezhkov was part of a bohemian crowd of 
painters, artists and writers, all of whom spoke many languages and were happy 
to gather with a little food and drink in someone's dacha, or country house, 
for a weekend of singing and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were convinced that in the Soviet Union we were building a system that 
would be fair for all; we didn't think we needed to lead the kind of lavish 
lifestyle that the capitalists indulged in," Berezhkov said of his youthful 
idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young man, he studied German, English and naval technology. While serving 
his army stint in Vladivostok, Berezhkov's language skills got him transferred 
to Moscow. World War II had just broken out and the Soviet Union, whose foreign 
service had been devastated by Stalin's paranoid purges, desperately needed 
interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
 Berezhkov recalls being shocked upon meeting Stalin in late September, 1941, 
while interpreting at a dinner for an Anglo-American mission of British 
statesman Lord Beaverbrook and U.S. diplomat W. Averell Harriman. Stalin was 
small and haggard, with a pockmarked face and one arm shorter than the other, 
Berezhkov recalled, but he could exert great personal charm when he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Stalin always treated me in the same, even indifferent manner," Berezhkov 
said. "Sometimes it seemed to me that he was looking right through me." 
</P>
<P>
 Berezhkov had to adapt to Stalin's nocturnal work habits. The Georgian 
statesman, who seized power in the U.S.S.R. after V.I. Lenin died in 1924, 
began work late in the evening and often continued until dawn, which meant that 
Berezhkov never went to bed until morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stalin unnerved him, Berezhkov said, filling him with a desire to hide like a 
child behind the curtains when the dictator appeared. Berezhkov was well aware 
of Stalin's fear of people who knew too much. The dictator's favorite axiom was 
"A dead man cannot bite." 
</P>
<P>
 When a war cable sent by Stalin was two days late arriving in Washington, 
Berezhkov was told to investigate but could turn up no mistakes, he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean, no one is to blame?" Soviet foreign minister V. M. Molotov 
thundered at him. "What will I say to Comrade Stalin, who demands an 
investigation and strict punishment for the culprits? When something goes wrong 
there is always someone to blame." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One time at his dacha, Stalin was kept awake by a barking dog, Berezhkov 
recalled. He summoned a guard and ordered him to kill the dog. The next 
morning, Stalin inquired about the dog and was told that the animal was a 
seeing eye dog for a blind peasant, and it was still alive. Instead of killing 
the dog, the sympathetic guard had succeeded in having the man hush the pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Enraged, Stalin ordered the guard brought before him and reordered him to kill 
the dog. "Next time you fail to obey my orders, I will order you killed too," 
Stalin warned the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Berezhkov has spent long years mulling over Stalin's legacy, which he says 
continues to haunt and hinder progress in Russia today. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the main reasons for the failure of perestroika is that Stalin's 
system continues to operate, particularly in remote areas," he wrote. ". . . 
The psychological basis for the command-and-administer system that Stalin had 
created over the years . . . was a combination of fawning, loyalty, blind 
enthusiasm -- and fear. When the master was no more, when fear disappeared and 
enthusiasm fizzled out, the system began to backfire and the country ended up 
on the edge of a precipice." 
</P>
<P>
 Berezhkov still doesn't understand why Stalin spared him after the KGB learned 
that the interpreter's parents had defected to the West during World War II, 
enough of a taint to send thousands of others to Siberia or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 But after being told never to speak of his previous job, Berezhkov, then 30, 
was put out to pasture to edit magazines with names such as "Peace and the 
Working Class." After Stalin's death in 1953, Berezhkov's old boss Molotov 
brought him back into favor, and he eventually rose to be first secretary of 
the Soviet Embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 When he received an invitation to teach in the United States, Berezhkov jumped 
at the chance to earn hard currency to send to his family back home. Since 
1991, he has taught at the Claremont Colleges, Occidental College and the 
Monterey Institute of International Studies.

BUSINESS; FIRM TO OVERSEE NAVAL BASE CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Navy has awarded a $21.8-million job to FSEC Inc. of Pasadena for the 
relocation of the Naval Air Warfare Center in Pennsylvania to the Naval Air 
Warfare Center in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena firm will supervise the consolidation of the two bases according 
to the cost reduction requirements of the Base Realignment and Closure Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will move a small staff of managers to the East Coast to supervise 
the transition and will hire employees there to perform the work. Although the 
firm's Pasadena staff will participate in the work, no new employees are 
expected to be hired locally, FSEC engineer Jim Hannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pennsylvania base will be closed in phases, and FSEC will receive payment 
in phases from the $21.8-million pool. The final award could be more or less 
than that amount, Hannon said. The project is expected to be completed in 
March, 1997.

LIBRARIES; 21 COUNTY BRANCHES KEEPING DOORS OPEN LONGER; SUPERVISORS USE $22.5 
MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO RESTORE SERVICES, REHIRE LAID-OFF WORKERS AND 
PURCHASE BOOKS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nig Mei Wang Chen and her 6-year-old daughter, Cia-Cia, sat one recent Monday 
on the carpet in the San Dimas library, reading about dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, it's a day the pair spend playing in the park or reading at their 
nearby home. But last week, the 21 branches of the Los Angeles County Library 
located in the San Gabriel Valley extended their hours -- including the one in 
San Dimas, which had been closed on Mondays and Tuesdays but now will be open 
on those days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great. It helps my daughter make real progress in her reading," said 
Chen, holding a stack of her daughter's favorite dinosaur books and Peter 
Rabbit videos. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors voted last month to use $22.5 million from the 
county's General Fund to restore library services to the level of two years 
ago, before harsh budget cuts were made. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional funding will allow every county branch in the San Gabriel 
Valley to be open at least four days a week and delays the need to implement a 
county library assessment fee, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said, dozens of library workers laid off over the last two 
years are being rehired. Book purchases, which had dwindled, will resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to find a new source of income for the county library system beyond 
property taxes, the supervisors this summer established a special assessment 
district to fund library branches. 
</P>
<P>
 The $28.50 annual assessment fee would have been levied on property owners in 
unincorporated areas, as well as in 16 cities that have county branch 
libraries. The councils of those cities had agreed to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a disputed county budget surplus appeared, the supervisors chose on 
Oct. 14 to allocate General Fund money for libraries and set the assessment at 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this region it means libraries (that were) open two days will now be open 
four days, those open three days a week will be open five days, and West Covina 
and Rowland Heights will be open every day," said Michael Garofalo, 
administrator of the library's east county region, which stretches from Arcadia 
to Claremont and has 655,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's book budget has been increased from about $100,000 a year to more 
than $1 million, Garofalo said. The countywide book budget is nearly $7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although dozens of extra library workers already have been recruited, Garofalo 
said many more will be needed. He said it will take until January to recruit 
enough staff to operate all the branches on the additional days they will be 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 County library managers said they will now be able to restart popular programs 
and stop renting books.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to reactivate morning storytelling for children," said Charles 
Kaufman, manager of the Hacienda Heights branch. "When we were closed in the 
morning, we were limited to serving older adults. Now this gives us the 
opportunity to help preschoolers." 
</P>
<P>
 The extra money for books will also put an end to his branch's controversial 
rentals of popular fiction books such as "The Firm." 
</P>
<P>
 "Funds will be available, so why should we have a rental collection that 
requires people to pay?" Kaufman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty people were waiting at the door last week for the branch's first 
morning opening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Dimas branch, reference librarian Judy Wineberg said: "We plan to 
buy new reference tools, dictionaries and other nonfiction books, as well as 
children's easy readers." She said the branch will eventually be open every day 
except Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wineberg said she is pleased with the infusion of funding, she agrees 
with County Librarian Sandra Reuben that the library's long-term funding 
problem is not resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still need a funding base so we don't have to beg and plead for money 
every year," Wineberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county library system receives about $30 million a year from property 
taxes, but it needs more than $50 million to maintain its 87 branches, library 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The county supervisors sought to allay some of those fears last month by 
voting to guarantee the system another $10 million a year -- $20 million if 
there is a county budget surplus. Open and Shut 
</P>

CONDO OWNERS SETTLE FOR $4.9 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners of a Baldwin Park condominium complex beset by roof leaks -- some 
so severe that ceilings collapsed in the rain -- have settled with the 
developer for $4.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leaks . . . would run across the lights," said David Muse, president of 
the Park Shadows homeowners association. "You would notice brown spots. In 
other cases the stucco would fall down and cause damage." 
</P>
<P>
 There also were cracks in walls and ceilings and problems with the decks and 
stairs, said the homeowners' attorney, Michael A. Hearn of Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The defects became apparent within a few years of the opening of the complex 
in 1988, Muse said. The homeowners association notified the developers, Devere 
Anderson Enterprises of Encino, of the problems and in 1991 filed suit in 
Pomona Superior Court. Several weeks ago the group accepted the $4.9-million 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that the developer used flawed construction materials, failed 
to supervise the work, knowingly sold the defective homes and failed to 
satisfactorily repair the damage when first notified of problems in January, 
1990. Of 264 units built, 114 showed signs of damage, Muse said. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the homes started at about $102,000, Muse said, making them 
affordable to first-time buyers. But the problems they faced were more than 
they bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, if it's someone's first home they sink everything they have in it," 
said Bob Fisher, a spokesman for Hearn's law firm. "When they have to pay legal 
fees or whatever they need to make repairs, it wipes them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Devere Anderson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction problems, and the ongoing suit, also hurt residents' ability 
to sell their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the defects prevented people from selling homes, especially when the 
market was high in 1992, and some had problems refinancing because the homes 
were in litigation," Muse said. "Some were actually selling at a lower rate 
than they had purchased the home for." 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.9 million will be used to renovate the roofing for the complex, a 
project Muse said will probably start in March, 1995.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; TERM-LIMIT PETITION SENT TO CITY CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena resident Nicholas T. Conway has turned in a petition containing about 
14,000 signatures to qualify a ballot measure that seeks to limit City Council 
members to two four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway, who ran unsuccessfully for City Council in 1991, turned in the 
petition Tuesday afternoon, City Clerk Maria Stewart said. To qualify for the 
ballot, 9,908 of the signatures must be valid, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said it is unlikely that county elections officials will be able to 
verify the signatures in time to get the measure on the city's March 7 primary 
election ballot. Instead, if the measure qualifies, it will probably be put 
before voters in the city's April 18 general election.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; MAYOR ANNOUNCES SHE WON'T SEEK REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena Mayor Kathryn Nack, saying she wants to spend more time with her 
family, has announced she will not run for reelection when her second term on 
the City Council expires in May. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference last Friday at City Hall, Nack said her retirement 
has nothing to do with intense infighting sparked by Councilman Isaac Richard, 
who was censured earlier this month after disrupting a council meeting and 
failing to heed Nack's admonishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Nack, 70, said the recent birth of a grandson contributed to her decision. She 
has served on the City Council since 1987 and has been a planning commissioner 
and a member of the Pasadena Unified School District's board of education.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; COUNCILMAN ENTERS PLEA IN TRAFFIC INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena City Councilman Isaac Richard has pleaded not guilty to charges that 
he gave police a false name and committed four other misdemeanors after a minor 
traffic accident in September in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial is scheduled for Dec. 14 for the volatile councilman, who was censured 
earlier this month for disrupting a council meeting -- his third such censure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the September incident, Richard was charged with two counts of giving false 
information to a police officer, and with reckless driving, throwing an object 
at a vehicle and driving with a suspended license after an accident involving 
an MTA bus. No injuries or damage were reported.

STRUGGLING TO ATTAIN HARMONY; PASADENA'S COALITION FOR A NON-VIOLENT CITY WAS 
FORMED AMID OUTRAGE OVER THE SLAYINGS OF THREE TEEN-AGERS. A YEAR LATER, THE 
POLITICALLY POTENT GROUP HAS RAISED FUNDS FOR YOUTH PROGRAMS BUT LACKS A 
COHESIVE VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The early morning sun had yet to warm the gray stone walls of All Saints 
Episcopal Church. But inside a conference room, 15 members of the Coalition for 
a Non-Violent City steering committee sat at tables littered with empty 
plastic-foam coffee cups. 
</P>
<P>
 They were 35 minutes into a full court press by Pasadena City Councilman Isaac 
Richard. With his trademark angry rhetoric and political moralizing, he urged 
them to back him when he proposes that the council ban concealed weapons at all 
city-sanctioned public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's members, however, were wary of entangling themselves in Richard's 
personal political battles. 
</P>
<P>
 One coalition member asked politely: Did the councilman have someone on the 
seven-member council to second his proposal? 
</P>
<P>
 "If the coalition shows up, I'll have seven votes!" Richard shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident illustrates the clout carried by the year-old anti-violence 
coalition. Spawned by outrage over last year's Halloween-night killings of 
three boys mistakenly gunned down by gang members, the Coalition for a 
Non-Violent City has rolled through Pasadena like a downhill snowball, picking 
up money, support and influence. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, the group incorporated as a nonprofit agency, raised 
$360,000, spent $40,000 on a giant community meeting, put 1,100 people on its 
mailing list and opened offices in Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in some ways, the coalition still is struggling to coalesce. 
</P>
<P>
 Members argue, sometimes in tears and anger, over whether it should offer 
traditional, social work-type programs or address racism in society. The 
coalition's unwieldy, Hydra-headed committee system lacks an overall game plan. 
Some have rejected the group's meetings as elitist talkfests that are short on 
action. Others, many of them young people at risk on the streets, know nothing 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most involved are not disheartened, pointing out that although people 
are arguing, at least they're talking to each other. Many of them are from such 
different walks of Pasadena life that, under ordinary circumstances, they 
probably would never have even met each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coalition represents a movement, not a program," insists the group's 
co-founder, Shirley Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost missionary zeal, Adams recounted a recent meeting that brought 
together the mother of a slain child, an Altadena gangbanger, a high school 
principal and a Junior League member. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole level of discussion going on in the city that has never taken 
place before," said Adams, head of the Pasadena-Foothill branch of the Los 
Angeles Urban League. "The coalition could be one of the most significant 
structures put in place in Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the coalition's early days, the governor's office sent a query to 
the group asking what it was working on, after it looked like an unusual 
movement was afoot in Pasadena. Residents had organized quickly in the wake of 
the shock and outrage that gripped the city after three young teen-age boys, 
mistaken for gang members, were gunned down by gang members on Halloween night, 
1993, in central Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 A first meeting of 12 community leaders called by George Regas, the rector of 
All Saints Episcopal Church, was followed by a second meeting of 50 
participants; hundreds more began attending as meeting after meeting took 
place. Participants included city department heads, social-service agency 
workers, community activists and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition initially focused on gun control. But as more people got 
involved, the group increasingly turned its attention to the roots of violence: 
lack of job opportunities, run-down schools and housing, and racism directed 
against large segments of Pasadena's population, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group focused particularly on the Northwest Pasadena area, where many of 
the city's low-income black and Latino residents live and which is plagued by 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $360,000 has been raised, including $100,000 from the Irvine 
Foundation and $250,000 from the city of Pasadena. With part of the money, a 
coalition office in the Dodsworth Building in Old Pasadena was opened and three 
staff members were hired. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also spread $75,000 among 17 grass-roots agencies and 
individuals that provide programs for young people, from theater projects and 
on-air radio and television training programs to drill and drum team 
performances and an overnight trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 An Oct. 1 conference held by the coalition at the Pasadena Center drew more 
than 800 people. At the conference, which cost $40,000, attendees were fed a 
free breakfast and lunch while they attended seven different workshops on 
violence. A follow-up meeting Nov. 1 resulted in the creation of six 
independent task forces. Each task force is devising a plan of action. Another 
citywide meeting is planned for March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is trying to decide how to spent the remaining $150,000 in city 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as it begins a second year, serious fissures have erupted in the 
coalition's image of unity and momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Nov. 1 meeting, community activist Roy Hayes, who prefers to use the 
African name of Malik, challenged the group to allow in-depth discussions of 
racism. He was cut off by Adams and stormed out of the meeting hall, protesting 
loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Later at the same meeting, coalition steering committee members Rena Dyson and 
Sharon Anderson came close to tears of frustration in a hallway as they argued 
with Adams and Regas. Dyson and Anderson, who founded the We Care group to keep 
Pasadena's streets quiet after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, had numerous 
complaints about the coalition but they followed one theme: Northwest Pasadena 
residents, those most harmed by violence, were being ignored and pushed out of 
the way by others flooding into the coalition, they insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A certain segment dictates the policy and the others are supposed to go 
along," Malik said on a recent morning at the Jackie Robinson Center in 
Northwest Pasadena. Further, every time the issue of racism is posed, the 
coalition shuts down the discussion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black men are viewed as the most violent and most underproductive element in 
this society," Malik said. "It's part of the problem that the coalition should 
address." 
</P>
<P>
 Malik outlined a host of criticisms that have been lobbed against the 
coalition. Among the complaints: 
</P>
<P>
 * The group has busied itself in endless meetings to discuss the city's 
problems, but, aside from fund raising, has produced few concrete results. 
</P>
<P>
 * The coalition is dominated by workers from social-service organizations and 
has too few everyday residents, especially blacks and Latinos who live in the 
Northwest section. 
</P>
<P>
 * Regas, a white Episcopal minister, and many others from All Saints' 
predominantly white congregation and staff have taken control of the group, 
resulting in whites helping out minorities in an old-fashioned "colonial 
mentality" setup, instead of minorities taking the lead and forging the group's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The coalition has attracted many from outside Northwest Pasadena who are not 
familiar with the problems there. 
</P>
<P>
 * The group has not created groundbreaking solutions. Instead, it upholds the 
status quo and fails to investigate allegations of police harassment or the 
effectiveness of current youth programs, which many in the Northwest believe 
should be examined critically. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coalition is trying to do good, but they don't know exactly what's going 
on," said Tim Rhambo, a former gang member and now a community activist, as he 
strolled recently along Fair Oaks Avenue across from Robinson Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhambo said many coalition members sit in offices or head programs, but, in 
part because they don't actually live in Northwest Pasadena, are limited in 
their effectiveness. It is the community's residents, including gang members 
and young street leaders, who could bring peace, Rhambo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who can regulate everything are right here," he said, pointing 
toward the street. "Pay them something and tell them to do something, and I 
guarantee results." 
</P>
<P>
 Other coalition critics come from the other end of town, such as Mark Talt. 
</P>
<P>
 A 34-year-old father of two who lives in the Oak Knoll neighborhood near the 
luxurious Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel, Talt, a securities broker, offended 
many at the Nov. 1 meeting when he stood up and confessed that he and his 
friends felt afraid living in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking around the room of 200 participants, he proclaimed that he didn't 
recognize a single person there, and he accused the group of shutting out 
people like himself. His comments prompted some at the meeting to accuse Talt 
of caring little for the rest of the city and showing up only when he feared 
violence might spread to his own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since the meeting, Talt said, he has received numerous phone 
calls, letters and business cards from coalition members, sympathizing with his 
concerns and urging him not to give up on helping out the coalition. He visited 
Northwest Pasadena and even showed up at the Nov. 15 steering committee 
meeting, where Councilman Richard appeared. Although there only to observe, 
Talt offered a few fund-raising suggestions when the discussion turned to 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Talt later said he was disappointed to find the coalition struggling with 
so many internal problems. And, he said, he still feels unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to help, I want to reach out, but Mark Talt carrying an olive branch 
will get the same (negative) reception I got before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regas points out that others who live in Talt's upper-middle-class 
neighborhood have been actively involved with the coalition since its 
beginning. Equally active and welcomed into the coalition, he added, have been 
blacks from King's Villages, a low-income housing project in Northwest 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing understanding among those from different sections of the city has 
been a daunting task for the coalition and is a high priority, Regas said. But 
even he and Adams differ over how to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, whose style is personal and hands-on and who greets acquaintances with 
"darling" and "baby," favors rotating coalition meetings to Northwest Pasadena. 
But Regas, who can be abrupt in his zeal to get things done, considers the 
issue of meeting locations a minor one. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the coalition has committed much of its focus to Northwest 
Pasadena, including funding youth groups there and proposing field trips for 
Pasadena residents to learn more about the troubled neighborhood. But the 
coalition is larger than the problems of Northwest Pasadena, Regas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of violence covers the map," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for criticism that those from All Saints and from other social 
service-oriented groups have dominated the coalition, Regas agrees but says he 
is working on a transfer of power, to include elections or some other method of 
choosing leaders. At this point, Regas chairs the coalition steering committee, 
composed of about 30 people, many drawn from the staff at All Saints, from 
social service agencies and from city of Pasadena management ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Regas admits he worries about the lack of concrete progress the group has 
made. But like Adams, he calls the coalition a movement and not a program. As 
such, he said, it needs the uninitiated and newcomers, the very people that 
some critics say slow down the group. Through the coalition, their efforts can 
be channeled, both said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coalition, working at its best, engages people in their normal, everyday 
life," Adams said. "It helps them do what they normally do, so that that 
becomes a deterrent to violence." 
</P>
<P>
 With people of good faith working together, Adams said, she expects the 
coalition to produce "good, meaningful work that can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds so simple," she said, "but it really will." COMMENTS ABOUT THE 
COALITION

 Tim Rhambo, Community Activist: "The coalition is trying to do good, but they 
don't know exactly what's going on. The people who can regulate everything are 
right here (in Northwest Pasadena). Pay them something and tell them to do 
something, and I guarantee results."

ACTIVIST'S PROGRAM FOR YOUTHS IS GOING PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At 5-foot-1 with a freckled face, Sheila Perry, 34, could be mistaken for one 
of the scores of children that always surround her. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one bus driver made that mistake last weekend during a trip to the 
Monterey Bay Aquarium with 85 of Perry's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little girl," he scolded when Perry hopped between two buses during rest 
stops. "You've got to stop jumping from bus to bus and sit down." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry turned, using a tone that can silence a roomful of chirping children, 
shame a rebellious teen-age gang member or coax free Lakers tickets for 60 kids 
out of a pro basketball player: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am Sheila Perry, director and founder of Make Me a Believer Foundation and 
the organizer of this trip," Perry said she told the bus driver. He cooperated 
from then on. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in a nutshell, is how Perry, the mother of a 9-year-old daughter, had 
managed for the past four years, without public funding, to take scores of 
children from Northwest Pasadena on trips to movie studios, rodeos, skating 
rinks, amusement parks, beaches, parks and television show tapings. She has 
used her commanding tone to persuade, cajole, wheedle, beg and plead with 
others to pitch in with bus rides, tickets, food and invitations to homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids are those she knows from the streets, from neighbors and from 
friends. They are children, she said, who plead with her, "Please, can we go 
somewhere?"  
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Pasadena, Perry has worked a variety of jobs, from 
cosmetologist to secretary to production assistant at a Los Angeles film 
studio. But her greatest passion has been for the children she saw standing 
idle on the street corner outside her mother's Northwest-area home.  
</P>
<P>
 For them, Perry has spent most of her spare time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 The children need relief, Perry says -- they need a view of life different 
from their community's grim streets so they can set goals and rise above their 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to support grass-roots efforts that help Pasadena's children 
avoid violence, the Coalition for a Non-Violent City distributed $75,000 in 
city money to 17 neighborhood-based programs. The $5,000 her Make Me a Believer 
Foundation received from the coalition was Perry's first grant ever.  
</P>
<P>
 The small taste of public funding, used for the overnight Monterey trip, has 
doubled Perry's zeal to find permanent funding for her activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little bit of money I've had, I've done all this," she said. "Can you 
imagine if I had a whole lot, what I could do?"

CLAREMONT: NEW POLICY ON FEES FOR LARGE GROUPS USING CITY PARKS IS CLARIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claremont's recently adopted park permit ordinance and fee structure is not 
about excluding anyone from Claremont's parks. It is about managing some 
serious impacts that threaten the very qualities that make our parks so 
attractive to such a wide diversity of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, the vast majority of individuals and families, residents 
and non-residents alike, will continue to be able to use and enjoy the public 
parks in our community just as they always have. 
</P>
<P>
 No reservation or fees will be required of gatherings of less than 50 people, 
a limit that birthday parties or most other family occasions seldom exceed. 
Similarly, groups of up to 300 people from Claremont public schools and local 
religious or community organizations are allowed to use park facilities without 
paying a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatherings of fewer than 50 people will have the option of reserving specific 
facilities within designated park areas. Our experience over the last 18 months 
shows that there is a very high demand for this type of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, non-resident small groups will be asked to cover the extra costs 
associated with providing this convenience by paying a reasonable fee, a policy 
in keeping with the community philosophy that everyone pay their fair share for 
services received. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary focus of the park permit ordinance is to address impacts created 
by groups of more than 50 people, regardless of where they are from. Because 
Claremont's parks are attractive and well-maintained, we have seen an increase 
in the number of large groups using them. The resulting impacts not only affect 
the parks but the surrounding residents and neighborhoods as well. 
</P>
<P>
 By developing a reservation system, fee structure and enforcement procedure 
that address these impacts, the city will be better able to maintain the 
quality of our parks and surrounding neighborhoods. Parks that are poorly 
maintained are of little benefit to anyone and can serve to undermine the value 
of nearby areas, if not the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is committed to having public parks and recreational programs that 
are inclusive in nature. It is our goal to further that commitment by 
implementing a park permit ordinance that balances the desire to have parks 
that can be enjoyed by everyone with the economic reality of maintaining parks 
that everyone wants to enjoy.

RIGHTS: PRAISE FOR COMMUNITY ACTIVIST NUNEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Fabian Nunez and to others like him who work on behalf of the 
oppressed in Pomona and neighboring communities (Nov. 3). Fabian has identified 
the civil rights movement of the 1990s and taken it to where no one has gone 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're waiting for another Cesar Chavez or Martin Luther King Jr., I hope 
that Fabian and others like him have the sustaining spirit within them to 
continue the good fight of the oppressed Latinos, especially the undocumented 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the charge that he is divisive and extreme in his tactics, what's so 
radical about wanting peace and justice for the Latino worker, family and 
students? Three cheers for his active voice!

BY YOUR LEAVES; AUTUMN IS NOT ONLY IN THE AIR, IT'S ON THE TREES AND CRUNCHING 
UNDERFOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That extra slice of Thanksgiving pie may weigh on your conscience (not to 
mention your thighs), and the kids will certainly howl if parents dip into 
what's left of the Halloween candy, but there is one seasonal indulgence that 
is guilt-free. The treat is not only pleasing to the senses, it's cheap, 
healthful and, at this time of the year, it literally grows on trees. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking fall color: the annual showcase of deep ambers, burnished golds 
and vivid oranges that Mother Nature presents gratis even in temperate Orange 
County. Granted, this is no New England, but if you're willing to scout around 
a bit, there's some pretty impressive scenery close by. And if adults play 
their cards right, the kids might even let them shuffle through a few piles of 
dry leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of Orange County's Department of Harbors, Beaches and Parks, Tim 
Miller knows his trees. And he says autumn is the best time of year for 
families to get out and enjoy them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather right now is beautiful; the sky is blue, and, after a rain, you 
not only have the fall colors, you get the grasses coming up too," Miller said. 
"The trees are starting to take a rest, and you have new life, so all in all, 
it's pretty spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says he doesn't expect the recent cold weather to shorten (or 
intensify) the fall color season, which typically lasts in this area into 
mid-December. However, the show could come to an earlier close if the Santa Ana 
winds kick up (as they did this week) and strip the trees of leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller recommends walking in the morning or late afternoon for the best light 
and the chance to spot migrating birds as well as deer, coyotes and the 
occasional bobcat (from a distance). 
</P>
<P>
 Although by no means comprehensive, the following list includes a few of 
Miller's favorite fall walking spots in the county's park system, along with 
suggestions from local hikers, bikers and nature buffs. Most of these sites 
offer ranger- or docent-led tours on a regular basis, but because of staffing 
shortages, it's wise to call before you go. Private tours can also be arranged. 
There is a parking fee at most of these locations, so be sure to pack a few 
bucks along with those extra socks and Barney canteens. 
</P>
<P>
 Trails in these areas vary in difficulty, but unless otherwise stated, all of 
these locales offer some access for young children and babes-in-backpacks. 
O'Neill Regional Park 
</P>
<P>
 California sycamores are the big draw in this 3,000-acre parkland, which 
Miller says is home to one of the county's largest and most mature populations 
of these deciduous trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The sycamores are dressed in a brilliant golden yellow right now, and although 
you'll have to wait until next fall to take in the park's flashiest show (the 
900-acre Arroyo Trabuco Wilderness isn't scheduled to open to the public until 
February or March), there are scattered groves of these trees throughout the 
park. Also look for the California holly, or toyon plant, a shade shrub that 
now sports bright red "Christmas berries," and masses of poison oak (remember 
kids: Look but don't touch), now dressed in shades of green, yellow and 
scarlet. 
</P>
<P>
 In O'Neill and other wilderness areas, Miller suggests you keep an eye out for 
the California buckwheat, a small rounded shrub currently topped by rusty red 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill park ranger Sara Girard coordinates a "Family Stroll" every Sunday 
afternoon at 4 and a campfire program on the first and third Saturdays of the 
month. Both are free. Maps outlining the park's six miles of nature trails are 
available at the park office, said Girard, who added that trails in the western 
section offer some of the best vistas. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Saturdays and Sundays at 9:30 a.m., rangers at this 7,600-acre park lead adult 
visitors on a one-mile walk through several natural environments, including an 
oak woodland and scattered sycamore groves. During the walk, guides discuss 
local natural history and demonstrate how Native Americans used some of the 
plants found here. Keep an eye out for possums, deer and coyotes. There's also 
a 7 p.m. campfire program most Sundays, also for adults only. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The park is restricted to visitors ages 18 and over, due to the danger 
of mountain lions in the area.

</P>
<P>
 Stop by this 3,400-acre parkland on the first Saturday of each month at 8:15 
a.m., and you can join a "fairly easy" three-mile walk through the canyon, says 
park ranger Tom Maloney. But keep your hands to yourself should you venture 
further up the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poison oak is the most colorful plant we have here," Maloney warns. 
</P>
<P>
 As the weather cools, the rarely-seen Southwestern ferret is making infrequent 
guest appearances as it dashes in and out of gopher holes in search of food, 
said Maloney, who adds that your best chance to sight animals is in the early 
morning or late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso & Woods Canyons Regional Park, Aliso Creek Road at Alicia Parkway, 
Laguna Niguel. (714) 831-2791. Santiago Oaks Regional Park 
</P>
<P>
 A ranger-led tour titled "A Stroll Through the Oaks" takes place at this 
550-acre park this Saturday at 10 a.m. And most Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m. 
rangers lead a one-hour program that includes a hike and visit to the 
interpretive center, a renovated 1939 cottage. The center is open most days 
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, which features a small playground and picnic area, has a good 
showing of sycamores and willows along Santiago Creek, as well as an "exotic 
forest" with Chinese pistaches and liquidambars, said ranger John Bovee. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Just south of Coto de Caza, this new 475-acre park will open Dec. 10 with a 
free day of tours, hayrides and exhibitions; Saturday morning programs are 
planned in the future. Visitors should look for golden yellow sycamores in the 
south end of the canyon and "bring your camera," says ranger Ginny McVikar. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The 124-acre Carbon Canyon Regional Park offers a kind of family "two-fer" 
package, says ranger Jeff Bukshpan. If you're toting children, you may 
appreciate its picnic areas, paved bike trails and tot lots, as well as the 
short (45 minutes, tops), ranger-led nature walk through its redwood groves 
each Saturday at 8:30 a.m. More ambitious hikers can take advantage of miles of 
more rugged trails inside the park and in the adjacent Chino Hills State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bukshpan said, hikers and mountain bikers often use the Carbon Canyon 
park as a staging area for forays into Chino Hills' 13,000 acres. The best 
spots here for fall color: Telegraph Canyon Trail, a moderately strenuous 
six-mile hike through oak and sycamore groves (there are break-off points on 
that trail if it proves too much for your brood). Guided tours are available by 
appointment. Visitors can pick up a trail map at the interpretive center.

Chino Hills. (909) 780-6222. And Beyond . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What, you want more? Several outdoorsy types suggested the Cleveland National 
Forest, where strong hikers who can reach 3,000- to 4,000-foot altitudes will 
be rewarded with lots of fall color and panoramic vistas. Hot spots outside the 
county include Rancho Cuyamaca State Park near Julian in San Diego County and 
the San Bernardino Mountains from Crestline into Big Bear, where Miller says 
dogwood trees are garbed this time of year in "all shades of red." 
(Unseasonably cold temperatures in both areas mean a shorter autumn show, so it 
would be wise to call ahead. You can reach the Lake Arrowhead Communities 
Chamber of Commerce at (909) 337-3715 or the Julian chamber at (619) 765-1857.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you're short on time, the 26-acre Fullerton Arboretum (1900 Associated 
Road) features a bite-sized deciduous forest with ash, catalpa and liquidambar, 
along with several distinct California environments ((714) 773-3579). By the 
way, according to Nick Percan of the city's landscape department, Fullerton is 
one of several cities in the county to earn the distinction of "Tree City 
U.S.A." for the variety and condition of its 40,000 trees. Other colorful spots 
in the city include the 100 and 200 blocks of North Cornell Avenue, where the 
leaves of dozens of gingko trees are turning a deep gold, and the 1200 block of 
East Nutwood Avenue, which is lined with multicolored liquidambars. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, the golds and yellows of California sycamores and California black 
walnut trees are intermingled with evergreen live oaks at the 60-acre Oak 
Canyon Nature Center (6700 E. Walnut Canyon Road). Popular with families for 
its variety of easy trails and its hands-on interpretive center, the center 
hosts regular family walks and educational programs for kids. Coming up on 
Wednesday is "Sleepy-Eyed Squirrels" for children age 3 to 6, and there's a 
family-oriented bird walk on Dec. 3. There is a nominal fee for most of their 
public programs, and reservations are suggested. Call (714) 998-8380.

</P>
<P>
 Simba had better invest in some woolly jammies, because starting today, the 
star of the popular Disney film "The Lion King" will be coexisting with Mr. 
North Pole himself, Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the popularity of this summer's "Lion King Celebration" parade 
(and, one might safely bet, the holiday re-release of the film), Disneyland 
officials have decided to keep the parade running through the Christmas season. 
Employing lifelike animated puppets and remote-controlled devices, the parade 
tells the story of the young lion cub as he travels through "The Circle of 
Life" to maturity. The parade runs today through Sunday, plus Dec. 3, 4, 10 and 
11, and Dec. 17 through Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the park's traditional "Very Merry Christmas Parade" will be 
presented daily with a seasonal array of dancing snowflakes, gingerbread 
people, Disney characters and, of course, Santa. The Christmas parade runs 
daily through Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Other holiday perks in the park include a 60-foot Christmas tree, strolling 
carolers and visits with Santa Claus. In 1995, Disneyland will mark its 40th 
year with several new parades and stage shows under the banner "40 Years of 
Adventures," highlighted by the spring opening of its newest ride, the Indiana 
Jones Adventure.

SWEET AND SOUR 'JELLY'; BECAUSE OF NEGATIVE FEELINGS FOR MORTON, MAURICE HINES 
HAD TROUBLE GETTING INTO THE ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Jelly's Last Jam" has plenty of songs and dances, but it isn't your usual 
Broadway musical. It's a musical with a mission, and a controversial one at 
that: To put jazz creator Jelly Roll Morton on trial as a bigot for denying his 
own black heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a monster," says Maurice Hines, who plays Jelly in the touring 
production, beginning Tuesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa. "Black, white, Asian -- anybody who denies his own race and takes 
from them, I will always think of as a monster." 
</P>
<P>
 George C. Wolfe wrote (and directs) the show to tell the story of Morton on 
his last day on Earth, as he stands on the brink of heaven or hell and reflects 
on his life. Wolfe's portrait of Morton is mostly an unflattering one, but the 
musical ends happily, with Morton redeemed and taken into the pantheon of great 
black American creators. 
</P>
<P>
 "In real life," counters Hines, "he didn't redeem himself. But we live in 
America, and they love happy endings." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Ferdinand Le Menthe Morton about 1890 in New Orleans (there are other 
ways of spelling his name and other dates for his birth year), he rose to fame 
playing music based on the rhythms and sounds he heard on the streets and in 
the brothels as a youngster. His great-grandmother had kicked him out of the 
house when he was 15 for hanging around such places and people, or "lower 
orders" as she called them. 
</P>
<P>
 He left New Orleans in 1915 and formed his own band, the Red Hot Peppers, in 
Chicago. The band became one of the top black recording groups for RCA Records. 
Calling himself "Jelly Roll" (to suggest sexiness) and flush with success, he 
started living a flashier life, bought lots of suits and had a small diamond 
inserted into a front tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1930, when he moved to New York, his music began to go out of fashion 
as a new kind of big band sound became popular. His career went into decline, 
and, after years of neglecting his health, he died, broke and largely 
forgotten, in the colored ward of the Los Angeles Hospital in 1941. To the end, 
he professed to be superior to black Americans, saying he was pure Creole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jelly's Last Jam" was first produced in Los Angeles in 1991 at the Mark Taper 
Forum. Its eight-week run broke all box office records for such engagements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gregory Hines, Maurice's younger brother, had been slated to star in 
the original production, he bowed out because of a conflict with a movie 
project that, ironically, never materialized. Morton was played in Los Angeles 
by Obba Babatunde. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gregory Hines took over when, after some minor tinkering, the musical 
moved to Broadway in 1992. There, the show played for 569 performances and 
gathered 11 Tony nominations. The production hit the road for the first time in 
September, with Maurice Hines as Jelly. The music is by Morton and Luther 
Henderson; the lyrics are by Susan Birkenhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his negative feelings, Maurice Hines, 50, admits that Morton is 
"certainly three-dimensional. He's got a lot of layers to him." And the musical 
does "show how he became the person he did through his family problems. There 
was racism in his own light-skinned family. It was that Creole way of life in 
New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
 But he disagrees with those who call Morton a genius. "I think he was 
innovative, I think that he was creative, but I think his own egomania stopped 
the creativity when it should have grown," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Duke (Ellington), Ella (Fitzgerald), Lionel Hampton, Cab Calloway -- they 
really nurtured each other, they loved each other. There was never a 
competition among them, as far as I see or knew. But there was with Jelly Roll, 
because of this race problem, and his egomania killed him." 
</P>
<P>
 As for airing such intra-racial strife, Hines isn't convinced it's necessary. 
His producer, he says, thinks it's "such an important thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Important for whom? As black people, we know (bigotry) exists in our race. Is 
it important for white people to know? I don't consider myself controversial. I 
think I'm politically aware. But I don't think it's that important to put it 
out for other people to see. We already know about it as black people." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Hines has his own understanding of the problem. His mother, Alma 
Hines Kilfoyl, now 75, also came from a light-skinned family, and when she 
married a darker-skinned man, Maurice Sr., her family looked down on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family certainly knew that attitude between the 'good' hair and the 'bad' 
hair, the 'white' and the 'black,' " he says. "But my mother put a stop to that 
immediately. She was light enough to pass (for white) but didn't. She never 
allowed things of that nature in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it was not difficult to get into that kind of part and bring truth to it. 
It's easy. The rage is also easy to touch." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Hines took over the role because his mother asked him to. "My mother 
knew I really didn't want to do it," he says. "But you know how mothers can 
give you that killing look, like 'Do this for me.' So I said finally, 'OK. I 
will.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His mother is so important to him that he dedicates all his performances to 
her (and to his manager, Stanley Kay). "My mother is one of the great ladies of 
my life," he says. "She wasn't a mother in name only. She said, 'What makes my 
sons happy, makes me happy.' She proved to us that she meant what she said. My 
brother and I have taken her to the mountaintop many a time, believe me. She 
held the family together when my father wasn't working. There are lots of stuff 
we remember." 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers that he and his brother, who is two years younger, began dancing 
as children, first as the Hines Kids and later the Hines Brothers. In 1962, 
Maurice Sr. joined the duo as a drummer and the act became Hines, Hines and 
Dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, however, Gregory Hines left to strike out on his own. The 
brothers had had a history of quarreling and Gregory's departure further 
chilled their relationship. After Francis Ford Coppola learned about their 
feelings, he made use of the conflict when he featured both brothers in his 
1984 film "The Cotton Club." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Hines, in an interview published in 1992, said that he and his brother 
hadn't spoken to each other for the past six years. Maurice, however, refuses 
to discuss the matter in the press. "My brother sees fit to talk about it," he 
says. "I never talk about my personal life with strangers." 
</P>
<P>
 So how does he feel about taking over his brother's role? First, he points out 
that Gregory was the second Morton, not the first, taking over for Babatunde. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, he's "completely re-choreographed" his dances, and even suggested 
dropping out of a second-act duet with 21-year-old Savion Glover, who plays 
Morton as a young man, because "Savion is now an acknowledged tap star. He 
should have his moment alone on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Maurice never saw the show, either on Broadway or in Los Angeles, 
where he lives. "I came as a clean canvas," he says. "In that way, it helped 
(director Wolfe) look at things and think what could have been done better, 
differently. It's always a work in progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Differences? "I cry a lot sooner, I am more tormented." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, "My brother and I tap completely differently although we were both 
taught by Henry LeTang. We have very different stances. My style tries to be 
exactly like Fayard Nicholas, a full body style. (Gregory) dances from the 
waist down, like Harold (Nicholas). I'm more pulled up. We are so different. No 
one has really compared us." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Fayard Nicholas, the dancer who really inspired him, he says, was 
Teddy Hale, a great black rhythm tapper who died before he became widely known. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style is a combination of Teddy Hale and Fayard," he says. "I don't get a 
chance to do it that much, because of the syncopation. But my style comes 
through every now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem, he says, is that Morton was a pianist, not a dancer. "So what I 
do when I dance is sort of play the piano at the same time. I throw the steps 
as if I'm playing the piano. It works because the man supposedly -- he did, but 
he wasn't the only one -- invented syncopation. Tap is really a percussion 
instrument -- it's not tied to anything melodic. You can use different forms of 
syncopation tap-wise to portray the music rhythmically. So I think, used 
metaphorically, it works exceptionally well." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, because of his negative feelings about Morton, he says he had 
difficulties getting into the role. "I finally got into the pocket of the show 
in the third performances in New Orleans. I felt I was really being truthful. I 
hit it. The whole cast knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 What had happened? "The creative process is so mystical," he says, "you don't 
even know where it comes from. When you hit it, it's just there. I don't 
over-analyze anything. I just go with it. Otherwise it becomes mechanical. I 
don't want it to be a trick. I want it to be real."

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: AEROSMITH / "ROCKS" (1976) / COLUMBIA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The five diamonds regally aligned on the front cover of "Rocks" accurately 
reflect this sizzling and hard-rocking album. Durable, awe-inspiring and 
invaluable, Aerosmith's fourth disc arguably is the best heavy metal opus ever 
concocted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it is apt to get overlooked by young fans just discovering the 
early works of the Boston Bad Boys. The quintet's best known songs from the 
'70s ("Dream On," "Sweet Emotion" and "Walk This Way") all are on other albums. 
"Rocks' " "Last Child" did climb to No. 21 on the singles chart, but it's not 
one of the group's most recognized numbers among the MTV generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's nary a bum track on this pummeling masterpiece. Even the 
melodramatic power ballad "Home Tonight" has a way of growing on you, thanks in 
part to a searing guitar break. The unforgettable moments, of which "Rocks" is 
chock-full, include Joey Kramer's savage drumming on the majestic rocker "Back 
in the Saddle"; guitarist Joe Perry's buzz-saw riffing that ignites the 
corrosive "Rats In the Cellar," and Tom Hamilton's funky bass patterns on "Last 
Child." 
</P>
<P>
 The album's rebellious spirit is best expressed by singer Steven Tyler, who 
screeches out the lyrics like a brash street kid with absolutely nothing to 
lose. Indeed, attitude-wise, "Rocks" mirrors the punk revolution that was 
beginning to bubble up from the underground in 1976. "I was a last child, just 
a punk in the street," Tyler sneers. It was no surprise that Aerosmith found 
great support among restless adolescents and young teens during this creatively 
dynamic period. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, "Rocks" helped forge a new type of suburban heavy metal that began 
to stray from the blues-based stomp of hard-rock trailblazers Cream and Led 
Zeppelin. In the '80s, this album's influence could be found in a slew of "sons 
of Aerosmith" bands, from Ratt to Guns N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rocks" -- along with the band's entire Columbia catalogue from the '70s -- 
recently was re-mastered and re-released on CD with all its original artwork.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: ROSCOE CHENIER / "ROSCOE CHENIER" / AVENUE JAZZ  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The name Chenier, especially one who comes from Louisiana, almost universally 
means zydeco. But while Roscoe Chenier is indeed related to the late king of 
zydeco Clifton Chenier (they were second cousins), there's nary a whisper of an 
accordion nor the happy clatter of a rubboard on his blues-steeped debut. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the only surprise on this jumping performance by the 53-year-old 
singer, guitarist and songwriter. The other big one is the fascinating way 
Chenier and his band meld traditional Southern blues with New Orleans R&B on 
several songs. They make it seem like the most natural marriage in the world -- 
so why haven't more blues or R&B musicians looked across that border? 
</P>
<P>
 The opening track, "Come On Home," begins as a medium-tempo, B.B. King-style 
shuffle, but when Vic Soileau's pumping piano kicks in, suddenly it echoes 
Frankie Ford's Crescent City classic, "Sea Cruise." Then he taps the spirit of 
Fats Domino's "Blue Monday" in the lamenting "You Don't Understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Other songs are blues pure and simple, like the instrumental rave-up 
"Louisiana Shuffle." Chenier's voice recalls King when he's in the upper 
register pleading for forgiveness or giving voice to heartache; he also reaches 
down to muster a soul-deep Howlin' Wolf growl when he needs one. His guitar 
work is economical rather than flashy, and, while not as mystically perfect as 
King's, is always tautly expressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when it seemed as if there were no discoveries left in the classic 
bluesman mold, along comes Roscoe in the nick of time.

HI HO, STEVERINO; WITH ALLEN AS GRAND MARSHAL, THE DAYLONG 'BASH '94' PROMISES 
TO BE ANOTHER ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, Bill Kohlhaase is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
jazz for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How could you top it? Last year's Orange County Musicians' Bash featured some 
300 musicians of all sorts offering music on five stages over a period of 10 
hours. Presided over by Grand Marshal Jack Sheldon, it was the year's biggest 
musical party. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Bash '94," featuring comedian and television pioneer Steve Allen as grand 
marshal, promises to be every bit as big, with nearly 50 groups and more than 
300 Orange County and area musicians taking part. The 24th annual edition of 
the festival, to be held at the Red Lion Hotel in Costa Mesa this Sunday, is a 
fund-raiser for the Orange County Musicians' Club, an offshoot of Local 7 of 
the American Federation of Musicians. Proceeds go to the club's financial 
assistance and scholarship programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, the original host of NBC's "Tonight Show," is also a pianist, prolific 
composer (he penned the upbeat "This Could Be the Start of Something Big") and 
respected music scholar. He will perform some of his original songs, 
accompanied by arranger-saxophonist Tom Kubis' Big Band, in what is expected to 
be a highlight of the daylong event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve's an absolute gentleman, and his tunes are great," says Kubis, whose 
band has backed Allen for the past several years. "He claims to have written 
something like 5,000 tunes, some 30 every week, that cover all the bases: 
Latin, jazz, different forms of rock 'n' roll. It should be rip-roaring, 
hilarious fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who was often seen at the piano during his "Tonight Show" days, likes 
to joke and reminisce on stage, according to Kubis, sometimes staying away from 
the keyboard completely. "We had a recent show," Kubis relates, "where Steve 
sat down with some bongos and stayed there the whole night." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's spontaneity and range should fit in nicely at the bash. With stages 
dedicated to Dixieland, big band, jazz, lounge and classical music, the event 
will pull back the curtain on a rich and varied -- though sometimes hidden -- 
entertainment scene in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're presenting as many forms of music as we can," says Frak Amoss, Bash 
chairman and president of the Orange County Musicians' Assn. "Live music is our 
business, and we'll be offering everything from piano and flute duos to 
18-piece big bands and everything in between." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the program is jazz in its various forms. Highlights include 
Kubis' orchestra, which will back singer Carol Jolin before welcoming Allen; 
pianist Amoss' big band, with guest vocalist Roberta Linn (the original 
"Champagne Music Girl" on the "The Lawrence Welk Show"), and Glen Garrett's 
Brazilian big band Feijoado Completa with vocalist Katia Moraes. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller groups will include guitarist and Concord recording artist Ron 
Eschete's trio, vocalists Micki Rhyne and Karen Gallinger, Frank Potenza and 
Luther Hughes with the Contemporary Jazz All Stars, and a tuba-fronted be-bop 
band known as Tubop. The revival of interest in Dixieland music will be 
reflected by 10 bands, including the Basin Street Stompers and the 20th Century 
Jazz Band, appearing in the hotel's Club Max room. Dancing is encouraged.

WANNA DANCE?: ROCKFIELD'S TAVERN GETS A BIKER-BLUES KICK-START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLANCA A. LA BOUNTY, Blanca A. La Bounty is a free-lance writer who 
occasionally contributes to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Turning a fading club into a success is no minor feat for even the shrewdest 
promoter. But longtime friends Chris Manfredi and Lynn Brown felt that 
Rockfield's Tavern in Lake Forest deserved a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owners took over in June and rejuvenated this vintage, kick-back bar. 
Live rock and blues bands play every night and the CD jukebox is stocked with 
everything from Nirvana to Stevie Ray Vaughan. There's no disco, metal, rap, 
country or deejays, Manfredi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about this place reveals an urban-biker, rock 'n' blues heart. Bike 
parts (seats, rear mirrors, wheels and everything Harley) hang among exposed 
tubes from the ceiling. A small, raised stage heads a 400-square-foot, wooden 
dance floor, illuminated by dim, multicolored lights. Where neon beer ads, 
customer snapshots and posters of Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and the Stones are 
not plastered, the walls come alive with the artwork of Cliff Larson. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired tattoo artist, Larson is a celebrity among locals for his murals at 
the Tavern. Bold strokes and painterly swirls form vast murals of psychedelic 
imagery. Fiery suns, foreboding skulls, desert-bound bikers and the soulful 
faces of ghosts that were born to be wild peer solemnly from all sides. With 
fluorescent colors tailored to black lighting, this head-trip art glows 
incandescently. 
</P>
<P>
 One regular noted that a band could be in the middle of a set and Larson will 
stroll in, find some vacant wall and start going at it with his paintbrush. 
Onlookers sometimes make a game of trying to decipher the mysterious images 
before the final strokes are applied. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of games, this place is rarely at a standstill for those who like 
to play. A couple of pool tables, a pair of pinball machines and an electronic 
dart board invite a steady pace of competitive action. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the weekday promotions: Mondays feature televised football, 
pool tournaments and a showcase for new bands. Satisfy your cravings with 
complimentary popcorn and $1 drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesdays, customers (you must be at least 21) can sign up for "Guest 
Bartender Night" and work the bar during an 8 p.m.-to-midnight shift. Besides 
tips, they get a bit of genuine bartending experience without having to go to 
school first. Wednesday night's happy hour, catered by Peppinos Italian 
restaurant, is from 6:30 p.m. to whenever the grub (consisting mostly of 
pastas) is gone. Thursday's entertainment strays slightly from the classic-rock 
bill by widening its format to include alternative rock, appealing to a 
dominantly college-age crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 While weekdays attract a friendly clientele of band fans and bikers, weekends 
pack the dance floor with a mix of locals and leather-clad yuppies taking a 
wild, rockin' detour from the drab workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free nightly except for special events and occasional appearances 
by heavyweight groups, such as the Walter Trout Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Spirits are limited to beer and wine. On weekdays, domestic drafts go for 
$1.75; pitchers $5.50 and bottled imports, $2.75. A glass of Chablis will set 
you back $3, and sodas are a buck. There's no menu and no kitchen, so don't 
plan on grabbing dinner here. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're in need of a last-minute birthday or anniversary gift, be sure to 
visit the Tavern's tiny curio shop selling New Age charms, jewelry and other 
trinkets. The shop was a ticket booth for comedy acts during one of the club's 
former lives. Now it lends yet another groovy touch to the decor.

 Once again, the nation's top swing dancers will compete in the 12th annual 
U.S. Open National Swing Dance Championships, Friday through Sunday at

observe the multi-category dance-off and enjoy about 18 hours of 
non-competitive dancing themselves, are available at the door. Admission is $35 
a day or $95 for all three days. Hours are Friday, 6 p.m. to 1 a.m.; Saturday, 
1 p.m. to 1 a.m.; Sunday, 1 p.m. to midnight. A $5 "Get Acquainted Dance" runs 
this evening from 8 to midnight; for information, call the Disneyland Hotel,

DO IT!: CYCLIST'S TOUR DE TURKEY IS PLUMPING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of The Times Orange County 
Edition staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The past several years haven't always been kind to 10K runs and group bike 
rides. Not only did the downturn in the economy cut into attendance, but a glut 
of events saturated the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to that, the organizers of the annual Tour de Turkey -- a road bike 
event with four courses ranging from 12 to 100 miles -- also had to contend 
with forces of nature. For two years straight, Santa Ana winds struck on the 
day of the event. If you've ever ridden in the wind, you know what a drag that 
can be, literally and figuratively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather ride hills all day than ride into a head wind anytime," said Randy 
DeMarco of Newport Beach-based Dimo Cycling, organizers of the Tour de Turkey, 
which returns to Anaheim for its 11th run Sunday. The event drew about 800 
riders last year, down from a peak of more than 2,000 a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the wind) had a lot to do with participation dropping," DeMarco 
said. "I got a lot of comments, like, 'You should rename this Tour de Tornado.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The Tour de Turkey it remains, however, and after the doldrums of the past few 
years, signs are pointing up for participation this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one is going to be 200, maybe 300 larger than it was last year, which is 
encouraging," DeMarco said. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers one of the more enjoyable ways to work off some of those 
holiday-dinner calories (although there is plenty of food at rest stops along 
the way -- and a burrito lunch at the end of the ride). 
</P>
<P>
 The event starts at Yorba Regional Park in Anaheim and offers a range of 
distances to accommodate riders of all ability levels. The addition of the 
12-mile course last year, DeMarco said, led to a greater number of families 
riding together. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the scale, the 100-mile ride is one of the best 
introductory century courses around -- a flat course that is also scenic, 
heading through Corona and then on to Lake Elsinore and Murrieta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's right on the valley floor all the way through," DeMarco said. "It's 
really a beautiful ride." 
</P>
<P>
 It's at its most beautiful right after the winds, when the views soar right up 
to the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains. During the winds, alas, it can 
be another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Tour de Turkey, bike ride of 12, 25, 50 or 100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, Nov. 27, at 7 a.m. Registration opens at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Yorba Regional Park, Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the Riverside (91) Freeway, exit at Imperial Highway and 
head north. Turn right on La Palma Avenue; the park entrance will be on the 
right, about three miles along. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $30 ($34.50 with lunch); includes T-shirt and water bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 645-3848.

TRIED & TRUE: HANDS-ON INSTRUCTION IN FLIGHTS OF FANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who regularly contributes 
to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I felt like a sparrow in a parking lot full of eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Was I actually going to fly this little plane out of the same airport that was 
used by those roaring behemoths with the big logos on their sides? 
</P>
<P>
 You bet. I was going to fly a Cessna 172. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you have to start somewhere, and this particular somewhere was John 
Wayne Airport in the left-hand seat of the single-engine Cessna. Long years had 
flown by since I had last spent any time in a light plane, and that, too, was 
for an assignment. And $52 and change seemed a pretty good bargain for about 40 
minutes in the air with my own hands on the controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike LeFave, a flight instructor at Lenair Aviation at the airport, said we'd 
cover one or two more things than the usual first-lesson menu of 1) flying 
straight and 2) climbing and diving. 
</P>
<P>
 LeFave, matter-of-fact and friendly, started the morning as we would end it, 
with a checklist. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything in aviation, he explained, begins and ends with one. We spent 
perhaps a good 15 minutes walking around and under the plane, taking fuel 
samples, checking flaps, ailerons and rudders, peering at tires for possible 
bald patches, poking into the engine cowling for birds' nests. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, buckled into the little cockpit, we went on with the pre-ignition 
checklist, toggling switches, yanking on mixture and throttle knobs, noting 
gauges (thankfully not too many of them), adjusting the compass as well as 
pulling, pushing and turning on the wing-surface controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, LeFave told me to turn the key. The engine sputtered and quickly 
caught, causing the plane to squat slightly on the ramp. I adjusted the r.p.m. 
to 1,000, and we went over yet another checklist. Finally, cleared by the 
tower, LeFave taxied the Cessna out of the tie-down area, onto the taxiway and 
told me I was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 You steer a plane on the ground with your feet, a thoroughly awkward-feeling 
arrangement at first. Students, said LeFave, are told to keep their right hand 
on the throttle and their left hand on their left knee. Turning the wheel will 
not help at all, but the temptation to reach for it is powerful. Just keep the 
yellow taxiway line right between your legs, LeFave explained, and all will be 
well. It felt like riding a unicycle on a tightrope. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it got closer to crunch time, LeFave took over and taxied us onto the 
runway, the nose pointed down the long, long black expanse. No waiting. Push 
the throttle all the way in, he said. Quickly we picked up speed as the center 
line wobbled in front of my eyes. Good Lord, I thought, I'm actually going to 
take this thing off. 
</P>
<P>
 After what seemed like a fairly short time -- and space -- LeFave told me it 
was time to pull back on the yoke (at last I got to use it!), but there was 
more resistance there than I had expected. I pulled a bit more. Nothing. Still 
more, LeFave urged. I gave the wheel a long, steady pull. 
</P>
<P>
 And suddenly we popped into the air. No thump thump of landing gear like a 
commercial jet, just a little swoop and, by golly, I was flying the thing! 
Right up and over the back bay! Smooth and clean and climbing steadily on a 
crisp, clean, bright, turbulence-free morning. Hey, Wilbur! Hey, Orville! . . . 
I did it! 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sort of. Then and throughout the flight, LeFave's hands and feet were 
nearly always covering the controls, insurance against my colossal 
inexperience. When my movements became too subtle or pronounced, he corrected 
them. But, once airborne, maneuvers -- climbs, descents, turns, coordinating 
rudder and ailerons -- came fairly naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in three dimensions, however, is unnatural to anyone used to driving a 
car. When you turn a plane, for instance, you not only change direction, but 
lose altitude, unless you compensate with the yoke. Once the plane is trimmed, 
however -- set at level flight -- it's possible to take your hands and feet off 
the controls and let the plane fly itself. 
</P>
<P>
 However, you have to keep up your housekeeping. What's your heading, your air 
speed, your altitude? Have you "squawked" for the tower (indicating your 
location)? And, above all, are you in the right pattern, away from other 
traffic? I thought of circus jugglers twirling dozens of plates. Heck, I was 
satisfied to keep us from stalling. 
</P>
<P>
 After turning back from our heading down the shore past Laguna Beach, we let 
down a bit over Newport Harbor and followed the coast to the Huntington Beach 
pier, where we turned inland. LeFave specified a compass heading that I should 
turn to and I was pleased when I saw the numbers on the compass line up 
smoothly and accurately. One correct maneuver, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1,000 feet, we were flying north and parallel to Runway 19 Right, the big 
jet runway where we would land. A 757 was on final approach several hundred 
feet below us. On our own base and final leg, we would stay above it to avoid 
its turbulence, LeFave said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there it was: the long, long runway directly ahead, slowly heaving up 
toward us. I had reflexively grabbed the wheel with both hands, so LeFave 
handled the throttle, cutting it back substantially. Lower and lower, we seemed 
to be floating. Nose up, LeFave said. Not that much. I pushed the yoke ahead. 
We seemed to be dropping a bit too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 We were. The Cessna hit with a decidedly non-professional thump and bounced 
once before all three wheels settled on the runway. LeFave took over and taxied 
it off the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oops," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," LeFave said, seemingly untroubled, "you know what they say: that any 
landing you can walk away from is a good landing." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxiing the Cessna back toward the ramp, I found the center line and kept it 
fairly steady this time, and felt better. Back at the tie-down, we turned off 
everything we had turned on, secured the craft and set the chocks under the 
tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving away, I made a note to myself for next time: Pull up harder on 
takeoff, less hard on landing. 
</P>
<P>
 I put it on my checklist.

SURFING: AMATEURS LOOK STRONG AS THEY GO EAST FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK FIGNETTI and DAVID REYES , Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The West Coast has sent one of its strongest contingents of surfers, including 
22 from Orange County, to the U.S. Amateur Surfing Championships, going on 
through Saturday at Sebastian Inlet, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to U.S. Surfing Federation officials, the state slate includes 
probably the strongest group of juniors (age 15 to 17) assembled, said Jane 
Moysa, secretary for the U.S. Surfing Federation's Western Region. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the East Coast is really scared. We're sending such a strong 
juniors team," said Moysa, who is also the mother of San Clemente surfer Geoff 
Moysa, 19, who will be defending his masters long-board title, won last year in 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, however, is that most of the 62 surfers will have to compete 
away from their families during Thanksgiving time. Falling into that category 
is our own Rockin' Fig, a top-ranked amateur and former national short-board 
title holder. He'll be going wave to wave with some of the top seniors, guys 
35-44. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm pumped up . It may be my last time to compete, though, because if I don't 
take the title, I'm hanging it up next year. It's getting too grueling to be 
competitive year after year.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig, you're lucky it isn't still churning from last week's Tropical Storm 
Gordon? 
</P>
<P>
 I called the other day for the surf report, and it was 8 feet and breaking 
over the jetty at Sebastian Inlet, but it was all stormed out. They said it's 
probably gonna stay big but stay a little stormy, and that's pretty much what 
happened. The surf is about 6 feet, but the weather's rainy and humid, with the 
water temperature about 72 degrees, while in California it's a chilly 55.  
</P>
<P>
 You got any predictions? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. I'll tell you who's going to take it in long boarding. That's Geoff 
Moysa, who's got all the talent and hot moves. He was named the "Iron Surfer" 
winner last year for competing in four events.  
</P>
<P>
 How about for the overall short-board crown? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Oxnard's Tim Curran, despite being a junior, has got a good shot to take 
it because he's got it going right now. This is the first trial for the 1996 
world amateur surfing championships, which will be in South Africa. The only 
thing is how many of these guys will still be amateurs by then . 
</P>
<P>
 The hot juniors from the western region representing Orange County include 
Mikey Reilly, of Seal Beach; Jon Rose, Laguna Beach; Justin Harcharic, 
Huntington Beach; Travis Acosta, Laguna Niguel; Travis Potter, Seal Beach; Iain 
McPhillips, Capistrano Beach; Chris Ward, San Clemente, and Troy Tecklenburg, 
Seal Beach, the defending junior's champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Hamrock, 34, of Huntington Beach, will be defending her women's 
championship. 
</P>

 In other news, it looks like Prime Ticket will be sealing its purchase of the 
U.S. Bud Surf Tour soon. Don Meek, Prime Ticket's marketing vice president, and 
the man who helped push the network to buy last summer's U.S. Open of Surfing, 
said, "It's still tentative, but we do have a handshake agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Aug. 5 sale of Prime Ticket to Texas-based Liberty Sports, a division 
of Tele-Communications Inc., Meek said Prime Ticket will change its name and 
logo to Prime Sports beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the event-development group of Prime Ticket that ran the U.S. Open," 
he said, "and put it with another group which is part of a new job I have to 
develop sports events around the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Meek said adding the Bud Tour to the Prime Sports lineup would increase the 
new company's equity and set the stage for a growing list of potential 
acquisitions, including tennis, golf, soccer or in-line skating events. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig's all for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like the Bud Tour could go bigger because Prime Ticket might be 
willing to better bankroll the contests. It could mean more purse money 
(possibly upgrading the contests from two stars to three) and bonuses for the 
tour crew!  
</P>
<P>
 Say, Fig, aren't you, as a Bud Tour announcer, saying this could mean more 
bread for YOU? 
</P>
<P>
 Heh heh heh.  
</P>

 Kudos: To Charlie Moore of Belmont Shores and a group of Surfrider Foundation 
surfers who gave $500 to Eco Soul (Ecological Economic Solutions), a nonprofit 
corporation that has chosen to help reforest kelp beds off Todos Santos Island 
in Baja, Mexico. For more information, contact Skip Staats at (714) 721-8747. 
</P>
<P>
 Bummed: Mike Kingsbury, who through his Huntington Beach public relations firm 
publicizes the world tour and U.S. Bud Tour, left California last week a very 
unhappy camper. It seems Mike and his wife, Barbara, bought non-refundable 
airline tickets to go snorkeling in Florida. Yup. When Tropical Storm Gordon 
was on its path of destruction. "I'm so bummed," Kingsbury said. "Don't ever 
buy non-refundable tickets!"

SHOWING THEIR HIDDEN COLORS

<P>
 There's a reason some leaves change colors in the fall, and, despite what the 
fairy tales say, it doesn't have anything to do with wood sprites. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaves contain millions of chloroplasts.In the summer, chlorophyll, the 
pigment that makes leaves green, is dominant. As a tree goes dormant in the 
fall, the chlorophyll breaks down and the pigments xanthophyll and carotene can 
be seen in leaves more clearly, turning them shades of yellow and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciduous trees on the West Coast play by a different set of rules than their 
eastern cousins, said Mike Evans, co-owner of Tree of Life Nursery in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Northeast, the temperatures get lower quicker, and the trees truly go 
dormant," Evans said. "Our area in Southern California is almost subtropical, 
and many of the native trees here are not as dependent on cold temperatures" 
for their leaves to change colors. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you think the local fall foliage arrived a bit more dramatically this 
year than in the past, it's not entirely your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "The few hours of cold we get are enough to trigger some species into 
dormancy," Evans said. CORINNE FLOCKEN

SPECIAL SCREENING: 'MIRACLE' THAT ALMOST DIDN'T HAPPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twentieth Century Fox mogul Darryl F. Zanuck didn't much go for "Miracle on 
34th Street" when it was first pitched to him in the mid-1940s. He didn't like 
the story and, more important, didn't think anyone else would either. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a zero kept coming up whenever he pondered the box office, Zanuck was 
finally persuaded by director George Seaton, who really believed in the Santa 
Claus Does Manhattan tale written by Valentine Davies. Seaton got the go-ahead 
and, armed with only a minimal budget, finished the movie several months before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaton's plan was to release the 1947 film just after Thanksgiving, but Zanuck 
wouldn't go along. Thinking the picture would soon disappear, he pushed it into 
theaters in the summer. Zanuck supposedly was shocked when it held up for six 
months, all the way through the holidays, and became one of Fox's biggest 
moneymakers at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, it's hard to understand what was going through Zanuck's head. 
"Miracle on 34th Street" (screening Wednesday and Dec. 2 in a free presentation 
at the Cypress Senior Citizen Center) belongs to a trio of films that have come 
to epitomize the season. It joins the ranks of "It's a Wonderful Life" and "A 
Christmas Carol" (especially the 1938 version), which are considered classics 
designed to trumpet the homey virtues of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other two movies, "Miracle on 34th Street" is thick with sentiment, 
the kind of happy-vibes heaviness that we might not forgive so readily any 
other time of year. But it's within that generous framework that these pictures 
find their appeal -- they're like holiday mantras we chant again and again to 
feel good. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping all this niceness go down is a sardonic touch to Seaton's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miracle on 34th Street" probably was the first movie to give the 
commercialism of the holidays a stiff caning as we watch mega-department stores 
Gimbel's and Macy's try to outdo each other in Christmas sales. The fact that 
the real Santa (Edmund Gwenn) is in the middle of this cash-crazy firefight 
puts everything in the right perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 The film opens on the eve of the Christmas parade with Doris, an advertising 
exec for Macy's played by Maureen O'Hara, facing disaster. Her regular Santa 
(veteran character actor Percy Helton) is fall-down drunk and she has to find a 
replacement. Santa, calling himself Kris Kringle, steps in out of nowhere and 
soon becomes the hit at Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything goes smoothly until the villain, Macy's resident shrink played by 
Porter Hall, steps in and accuses Kris of insanity for claiming to be who he 
is. Gwenn's Santa is blissfully bemused by the competency trial that ensues, as 
he is while convincing Doris' cynical daughter (a very young Natalie Wood) that 
he's the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwenn won an Oscar for best supporting actor, which he accomplished by 
embodying everyone's dream grandfather. He knows every fact there is but never 
seems arrogant. He's as soothing as Prozac. He gives and gives and gives but 
never indulges. He scolds but couldn't browbeat if he wanted to. In short, he's 
a chubby fantasy, the perfect poster boy for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone a bit more human, O'Hara is fine, combining exasperation over the 
predicament with a growing awe for Kris. And John Payne as her decent fiance 
and Kris' idealistic lawyer is appropriately stalwart. Tiny Ms. Wood seems too 
sugar-sprinkled once she sees the light, but early on, when her character is 
determinedly suspicious, she's more fun, like a Little Rascal with a big brain.

 There are plenty of nits to pick with this, the seventh movie version of the 
sci-fi TV series that began in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not enough action," complained Drew Ostrowski, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really confusing for kids to understand," chipped in Scott Fracalosy, 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no Spock," added Ned Algeo, 12, lifting up both ear tops to imitate 
the logical Vulcan. "How can you make a 'Star Trek' movie without Spock?" 
</P>
<P>
 This version is also the first to feature the stars of the revamped TV show, 
so there's neither a Dr. McCoy nor a Sulu, although Scotty returns from 
retirement to do some beaming up. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the kids' gripes really seemed to matter. The main thing, as Kirk 
explains in endearing self-parody, is that "the odds are against us and the 
situation is grim. It sounds like fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids were wowed by the special effects that woke one kid out of a doze, 
sent another flying off his seat and left a third wondering whether she would 
ever hear normally again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some parts were sort of shocking, and it was really good," said Nadeem Hakim, 
8. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed Glyer, 12, snoozed through the beginning scenes of a champagne bottle 
turning over through space, until it smashed into the hull of the Enterprise B, 
to christen the exploratory vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 "That thing woke me up. Phwoop! It started the movie off with a bang," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One hi-tech highlight was a jumbo screen computer graph on which the 
Enterprise crew could chart how Soran's diabolical plan to implode various 
planets in different galaxies would change the trajectory of the Nexus ribbon, 
so that it would scoop him up and deliver him to a place of endless joy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most thrilling special effect by far, the kids agreed, was a crash 
landing of the Enterprise in a valley that resembled Yosemite. As the 
saucer-shaped ship sliced off mountaintops, trees and finally dug into the 
dirt, the digital sound seemed to shake the theater's very seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really exciting," Scott said. "It was kind of like a weed whacker. On 
impact, I just flew across my seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Moss, 7, who sat right under a speaker, said the scene was loud. 
Maybe too loud. (Warning: Younger children could easily be frightened by the 
noise or the sight of bodies or children being separated from their parents 
during the crash.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the artificial life form, Data, drew plenty of laughs as he 
was forced to learn how to deal with human emotions after an "emotions chip" 
became fused to his circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
 Most kids preferred this movie to the TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 Action buffs, however, debated whether there was more action in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was better than the TV show," said Adam Hoyt, 12. "There's not 
enough shooting on the TV show." 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, no one mentioned that Soran, Kirk and Picard were near or past 
retirement age. Now, that's science fiction.

VEGETARIANS COULD GROW TO LIKE IT HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In our neck of the woods, the label "great vegetarian restaurant" is usually a 
contradiction in terms, unless you're talking Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 I've introduced my vegetarian friends to piquant South Indian fare at Madhu's 
Dasaprakash in Cerritos, to creative Vietnamese at Vien Huong (now closed) in 
Westminster and to quirky Buddhist temple cooking at Vegetable Delight in 
Chatsworth, where the chef uses sleight of hand to create mock squid, shrimp 
and duck out of gluten, nuts and yams. But so far, nothing around here has 
compared with say, Greens in San Francisco, a restaurant that succeeds strictly 
on the basis of great produce and sound recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we can throw an engaging little place called the Last Mango in Newport 
into the blender. On the surface, the Last Mango has everything going for it: a 
catchy name, a sunny Newport Beach location and an intelligent menu of 
appealing vegetarian favorites, from thin-crust pizzas and tangy Middle Eastern 
dips to wonderful, elegant pastries at dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant belongs to Lloyd Itano, and perhaps it is no coincidence that 
an Asian connection surfaces here as well. (Itano is Japanese American, and his 
kitchen puts out a mean miso soup.) However, though the front page of Itano's 
menu refers to Buddhist cooking tradition, this is no temple restaurant. Only a 
couple of items (a soybean-based meatloaf and a mock-chicken curry) actually 
attempt the illusion of meat, and the restaurant shamelessly peddles a line of 
nutritional drinks from a company called Sunrider. 
</P>
<P>
 Something intangible has been bringing me back to the Last Mango again and 
again. I'm not sure whether it's the delicious art in the back dining room 
(sensuous paintings of tropical fruits), the soothing jazz filtering in over 
the sound system, the quiet decor of white wood and straw carpeting, or the 
orchids and other plants that seem to flood this sky-lit room with oxygen. I 
only know that this is one of our area's most relaxing places to sit, and that 
I feel healthier leaving than entering. 
</P>
<P>
 But is the food great? Well, not quite.  
</P>
<P>
 You can get off to an interesting start with compana, a trio of dips with 
their own type of sensuousness. The menu describes them as whole roasted 
garlic, tapenade and creamy Gorgonzola spread, so I had to blink when the 
latter two turned out to be something else. The Gorgonzola spread came out as a 
creamy hummus, and the tapenade tasted of sun-dried tomatoes, rather than 
olives. Still, all three dips were certainly good, as was the focaccia garlic 
toast, a sensational accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better here are the thin-crust pizzas, which taste as if they have been 
finished in a wood oven. I could do without the bizarre-texture soybean 
"chicken" on the BBQ "anti-pollo" pizza, but this vegetarian take on barbecued 
chicken pizza is great anyway because of the Molto Buono barbecue sauce, 
mozzarella, smoked Gouda, red onions and cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the pizzas are closer to masterpiece standard. Pizza Funghi 
arrosti gets a flurry of oyster and shiitake mushrooms along with roasted 
garlic, mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes and basil. It's as delicious as nature 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
 The salads are conducted without fanfare (despite their rather quaint names) 
and hit some sweet notes. "Caesar's Caesar" has a zesty dressing that would 
satisfy all but the most resolute anchovy lover, as well as great focaccia 
croutons and a healthy topping of shaved Romano cheese. "Bearing Fruit" is a 
poached pear, fanned out and surrounded by chopped romaine, watercress, walnut 
halves and a sprinkling of Gorgonzola, all sprinkled with an appealing 
pear-balsamic vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gilded Mango" is basically Chinese chicken salad without the chicken. 
It's greens, jicama, red onion, mango, snow peas, cucumber and red bell pepper 
on the usual bed of rice noodle, mixed up with an oddball sesame-mango 
dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, most people not ordering a salad go for a sandwich, such as "big 
mock," a patty of sprouted grains on (what else?) a sesame-seed bun with 
lettuce, cheese, pickles, onion and special sauce. Funny name, but in my 
opinion the Big Mac doesn't deserve to be emulated. Besides, this particular 
mock burger patty reminds me of straw. 
</P>
<P>
 The "meatloaf" sandwich is an improvement. If I wanted meat, I'd go get a 
burger, but you'd be hard pressed to tell that this isn't an actual slab of 
cold meat loaf -- the flavor and texture are that close. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner, the entrees are more what you expect of a vegetarian restaurant. 
The Punjabi curry with paneer almost works. This is a hearty mixture of stewed 
carrots and potatoes, along with onions, peas and the cubed farmer's cheese 
known as paneer in India. The flaw is that the curry flavoring tastes as if it 
was thrown in at the last minute, instead of being grated and ground in, spice 
by spice, as the pot simmered. 
</P>
<P>
 Passion Pasta consists of oyster mushrooms, Roma tomatoes, shallots, garlic 
and basil on delicate angel hair pasta dosed with balsamic vinegar. The 
ingredients are all fresh, and the dish is fail-safe unless overcooked. Moo shu 
vegetables are a variation on the rice and veggies that put McDharma's in Santa 
Cruz on the map. Do yourself a favor and have them with fragrant basmati rice 
instead of the more wholesome, but gummier, brown rice. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll be doing yourself another favor if you dig into the great desserts, 
even though a couple of them would give a Vegan nightmares. One is a great, 
frothy cheesecake, delicately flavored with orange muscat. Another is a 
homemade apple crisp that is all oats, butter and hot apple slices, topped with 
rich vanilla bean ice cream. Personally, I save room for the walnut torte, an 
impossibly heavy suspension of nuts, syrup and sugar, with a streusel topping 
and a thick graham flour crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Call me a mango if this is on anyone's diet, and pass the whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The Last Mango in Newport is moderately priced. Starters are $3.95 to $5.95. 
Entrees are $7.50 to $9.50.

LOST IN O.C.: FRIENDS MAKE LIFE'S JOURNEY WORTHWHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to the Times Orange County Edition. T. Jefferson Parker's column resumes in 
this spot next week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a quick observation before we plunge in today: Am I the only guy who's a 
little concerned by the growing wave of Republican mysticism? First, there were 
the Reagans and their astrologer; then there was that cult thing Arianna 
Huffington belonged to. And now, following the election, do you realize that 
all legislation will have the aura of a witch's spell about it, since every 
time the new speaker of the House votes yes on a bill, it will be Aye of Newt?  
</P>
<P>
 It is my intention to try not to worry so much about these things. And I 
suspect I'm doing a pretty good job of it today, since, as you read this, I am 
most likely spending my Thanksgiving vacation paddling down a scenic chunk of 
the Colorado River in a canoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with having the usual things to be thankful for (like not being named 
Newt), I feel particularly warm and grateful for having friends who are as 
weird as I am, God help them. 
</P>
<P>
 Such friends are great. They get you into wonderful messes you might otherwise 
never even be aware of. I'm bobbing on the river right now trying to hold down 
my cranberry sauce -- "mmmmm . . . got milk?" -- at the suggestion of one such 
friend. He was also responsible for my first river trip 18 years ago, where we 
tried to paddle up the lower Grand Canyon to explore an abandoned bat guano 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
 We had to leave that destination to a subsequent trip, as we instead got 
caught in venturi-whipped winds that pushed choppy three-foot waves upriver . 
It was all we could do to paddle all day like desperate toys to avoid crashing 
into the ceaseless canyon walls. Finally, we found an inlet where an expedition 
of University of Colorado students was stranded, their motor launch refusing to 
venture into the storm we'd been battling with paddles. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were analyzing the dung balls of prehistoric sloths and drinking 
odious oodles of Retsina pine resin wine, which a sommelier friend has since 
assured me is the correct wine to serve with prehistoric sloth. Not entirely 
coincidentally, I wound up having to be hospitalized after this trip. 
</P>
<P>
 With friends like this it may not be so surprising that I've never been to a 
traditional bachelor party. You know the kind of party I'm talking about, the 
one where the groom is preparing to join in holy bond with his soul mate for 
life, so in the meantime you get a hooker to do the Heimlich maneuver on him 
while you all stand around hooting and drinking everclear with a funnel. Call 
us strange, but this has never struck any of my friends as quite proper. 
</P>
<P>
 So, instead, we wind up screaming to Catalina in the moonless dark on an 
overpowered Boston whaler, skipping over waves and landing in each trough with 
a knee-aching woomph . On the occasion when we did this, we couldn't find an 
open restaurant at the isthmus, so the only thing we could fill our stomachs 
with was tequila, which may have borne some influence on why we thought it was 
a great idea at 2 a.m. to go skinny-dipping below the stars and above the 
sharks on the way back across the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other bachelor parties in a similar vein, like the Lawrence of 
Arabia-themed one where we had an Arabic feast on sand dunes in the 
southeastern California desert, only to wake up all but buried in sand. Then 
there was the time we canoed below Hoover Dam to celebrate at some natural hot 
springs, which we later found hosted a brain-devouring microbe that causes 
progressive dementia if it gets in your head. Regular readers of this column 
may draw their own conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been privileged to be the best man at several of my friends' weddings. I 
do feel a little haunted by that adage "Always the best man; never the 
minister," but other than that it's been a load of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently my friend Mark got married. He leads an active life -- so active 
that the wedding was probably the first time he and his fiancee had seen each 
other for any length of time in months. Mark once designed a T-shirt emblazoned 
with a steaming cup of coffee and the legend "I'll Sleep When I'm Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 For his bachelor party, he wanted to go to Slab City, a forsaken piece of 
desert east of the southern Salton Sea. It's hard to get people to go to a 
place named Slab -- you can't quite imagine Tony Bennett singing "I left my 
heart in Slab Francisco," can you? -- so it wound up being just the two of us 
heading out in Mark's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first stop, the Wagon Wheel coffee shop (a.k.a. "Hey, stop there! 
Them dinosaurs always know the best places to eat."), the truck was sporting a 
fresh new set of Mexican steer horns jutting from the grille. At desert swap 
meets we loaded up on weathered bar stools, pumpkins and other practical 
household items. We chanced across a great Pioneer's Day parade in Twentynine 
Palms, just as a Christian metal band clanged by on a float. 
</P>
<P>
 We then drove through Joshua Tree and skirted the Salton Sea. When I was a 
kid, it was a sportsman's paradise. Now, thanks to agricultural runoff, it's a 
fetid brown soup of asphyxiating fish. One species beaches itself when dying, 
so the shore is crispy underfoot with dried dead fish, their general expression 
one of extreme pique. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nearly abandoned retirement communities there, with idyllic street 
names like Sea Oasis -- though Mummy's Curse would more befit their gnat-filled 
breezes and sun-baked vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the civilization we left behind for the wild lands of Slab City, so 
named for the concrete slabs that remain from a World War II training base, 
where snow birds, social misfits and derelicts now disport in dusty languor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sleep in RVs, others in junked cars draped with military surplus 
camouflage webbing. It's sort of like a Mad Max movie, except nobody has the 
energy to get angry. Some set up wares for sale, like at a swap meet. One 
couple played Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" on their distorto tape 
deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee, haven't heard that lately," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the long version!" the man exulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the entrance to Slab City is a hill that a very nice gentleman named 
Leonard has spent the last nine years coating in homemade adobe and painting 
with religious scenes and messages. The EPA is horrified, due to lead in the 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
 We set up camp a ways from the other inhabitants, so as not to shoot them. A 
dear friend who works in a china shop had provided us with some otherwise very 
pricey but slightly blemished wares. If you could see the way a $165 butter 
dish virtually atomizes when you bonk it with a .38 slug, you'd agree that fine 
china is worth the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
 A quail-hunting desert rat named Frenchie pulled up in a sandblasted pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gettin' any birds?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naw, just scaring yours away." 
</P>
<P>
 We gave him a beer, and he told us of his adventures with the law. He's 
mellowed these days, he said. "The police, they say, 'Frenchie, he's an outlaw, 
but he's a good outlaw.' " 
</P>
<P>
 We ate Portuguese sausage in tortillas, talked as the stars came out, listened 
to the cries of the coyotes. To have friends is to have whole other worlds.

HISTORY GETS GOOD PRESS AT MUSEUM IN BUENA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The International Printing Museum in Buena Park is a font of information. And 
some of the books on display there -- with almost microscopic fonts -- would 
fit right in at Mott's Miniatures. 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 11:30 a.m.: The International Printing Museum is the largest printing 
museum in the world. It celebrates technological ingenuity as well as books and 
reading, so it's no surprise that docents are full of stories that jump right 
off the pages of history. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour starts with Gutenberg and the invention of movable type. Before you 
know it, you're learning about how the printer's case is organized, how capital 
letters were stored on the top shelf and small letters on the bottom -- thus 
upper and lower case. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Franklin began as an apprentice printer at age 12; using the same 
kind of wooden press Franklin learned on, docent Bradley Miller printed an 
eight-page book of Franklin's writings and gave it to my 7-year-old son, Ryan, 
as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
 When Linotype arrived, printers no longer had to work a letter or a word at a 
time, prompting an Irish printer who saw one of the first machines to observe, 
"Oh, look, it's a line o' type!" Miller insists the story is true. 
</P>
<P>
 In another room is the actual press used by John Boy on "The Waltons," and 
others used in "Cimarron," the first Western to win an Oscar for best picture, 
and Disney's "Newsies." The Queen Mary's press is still set to print the 
breakfast menu from its final voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $6.50, or $4 for students and seniors. Several tours are offered 
for groups of 10 or more ($5, students and seniors, $3), including "Pages of 
Invention," which is capped by a character performance by either Benjamin 
Franklin or Mark Twain; "Pages of Freedom: The Constitution Tour," and "Pages 
of Adventure: The Reading Tour." The Composing Room Cafe is available for 
brown-bag lunches or catered affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 We ended our tour at the glass display cases, where we learned that quoins are 
"wedges used to lock up a form of type in a chase ready for printing." By 
locking in type, they allow you to use groups of words over and over. Hence was 
quoined the phrase "coining a phrase." 
</P>
<P>
 We learned about the origins of other expressions too. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter p , for instance, looks like q backward, and vice versa, so when 
apprentices put type back in the case, those letters often ended up in the 
wrong place. Hence, "Mind your P s and Q s." When printers run out of a 
particular letter, instead of buying an entire alphabet, they buy a group of 
the one letter, called "a sort"; if they forget to buy more, they're out of 
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on display were the bellows used for blowing out "type lice" (printers 
once thought dust was bugs), a volume the size of a child's fingernail 
containing the Lord's Prayer in seven languages -- the museum describes it as 
the smallest book in the world -- and "Gulliver's Travels," which of course 
makes another wonderful miniature. 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 to noon: Nearby Mott Miniatures, once a museum located at Knott's Berry 
Farm, is now a retail shop featuring 1:12 scale merchandise and everything you 
need to complete the dollhouse of your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 And what dollhouse would be complete without a double-barreled shotgun? A 
12-pack of beer, a box of cigars and a terrarium complete with a 1:12 snake 
also send a new message to boys about playing with dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Large" waste bags are almost a half inch. There are no miniature poodles, but 
miniature milk bones come in large, and for those who like to leave money 
casually lying about, little dollars come in big denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkish rugs run $14.99, a grand piano is $12, an Imari plate $3.50. "People 
come in and they want to buy the furniture for their real house -- take it home 
and just add water," said Chris Mott. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things were very little. A beehive comes with two bees ($13.79), and take 
it from me, one-inch-scale bees are hard to see. And of course there's the 
dollhouse that goes in the dollhouse, and the furniture for the dollhouse 
dollhouse; the scale for those pieces is 1:144. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite item was the antique miniature iron maiden, a medieval torture 
device featuring a chamber with inward facing spikes; just put your doll in and 
close ($250). Mott likes the gelatin mold platter with jiggling Jell-O. Playing 
with the Jell-O and seeing tiny chicken drumettes frying in a pan nearby made 
me a wee bit hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: We headed for PoFolks. Ryan ordered Chicken Little ($2.29) -- a 
fried chicken drumstick, french fries and a biscuit. I ordered chicken livers, 
which came fried, with side orders of okra, which came fried, and turnip 
greens, which didn't ($4.29). Tabasco peppers in vinegar were set out on each 
table; those and "Firey" (the letters came flaming) Louisiana hot sauce cut 
right through the batter. It all hit the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the table was the Original I.Q. Tester, a checkers-like peg game for 
one that kept Ryan thoroughly engrossed until the food came, a stroke of genius 
on the part of management. I liked the stuff on the walls, too, like the 
Fearless Fosdick ad saying, "Get Wildroot Cream Oil, Charlie!"

FASTER TREATMENT MAY HAVE SAVED BOY, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The disease that apparently led to the death of 12-year-old Julio Cano is the 
most common form of childhood cancer, sometimes leading to aggressive 
infections and causing death in a matter of months or even weeks, medical 
experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the boy's life might have been saved by a diagnosis of acute leukemia 
just a few days earlier remains uncertain. But childhood leukemia specialists 
say the disease often is treatable, especially if it is caught before 
complications such as infection or internal bleeding set in. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said Wednesday that they would need to know much more about the boy's 
case -- including which type of leukemia he had and what his precise history 
was -- before reaching a conclusion on whether his death was preventable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the latter stages, however, there is generally "some significant 
chance" of effectively treating acute leukemia in children, said Dr. Stuart 
Siegel, head of the division of hematology/oncology at Children's Hospital Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A cancer of the bone marrow and blood, acute leukemia involves the rampant 
growth of abnormal white blood cells, which essentially crowd out other normal 
blood cells and invade other body organs, Siegel said. The cause is uncertain, 
but it is not believed to be hereditary. It might involve some sort of genetic 
mutation, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Julio's case, the disease had affected his spleen, brain, kidney and liver, 
said Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County sheriff-coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known how long the boy had the disease, but one official said it 
could have been weeks to months. His parents said they delayed seeking medical 
treatment because they are illegal immigrants and feared being deported under 
Proposition 187. It also was unknown when he developed the bacterial infection 
that apparently caused his death. More tests are needed to determine how fast 
the disease progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease takes two basic forms. One type, called acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia, has a survival or cure rate of about 70% after five years, if 
treatment is provided, Siegel said. The other type, called non-lymphoblastic 
leukemia, is more difficult to treat and has a 40% to 50% survival rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of successfully treating both forms remain reasonably good even if 
the disease is diagnosed in its late stages, Siegel said. Both forms are 
treated with chemotherapy, although non-lymphoblastic leukemia also may require 
a bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms of acute leukemia may include paleness caused by anemia, fever, 
bruising easily, bone pain, skin rashes and an enlarged liver or spleen. The 
disease might be developing for a period of months, Siegel said, but symptoms 
can "come on very quickly. . . . It could happen within a period of a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Because symptoms often occur late, many patients tend not to seek early 
treatment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent might initially mistake some symptoms for the flu, except the 
condition "doesn't go away, " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alexis Thompson, assistant professor in pediatric hematology and oncology 
at the UCLA School of Medicine, said that an alert general practitioner usually 
will be able to pick up on the signs of the disease. It is diagnosed using 
blood tests and bone marrow biopsies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are children who die under the best of circumstances," she said, even 
with relatively prompt treatment. She said an aggressive infection -- which 
Julio might have suffered -- can overwhelm a child "even before we're able to 
give adequate chemotherapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel said the two most common causes of death are infection and internal 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Acute leukemia affects about 3,200 children a year, accounting for about 40% 
of all new childhood cancer cases, he said.

CHILD CITED AS PROP. 187 CASUALTY HAD LEUKEMIA; IMMIGRATION: ANAHEIM BOY ALSO 
SUFFERED BACTERIAL INFECTION. HIS DEATH GAINS MORE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Julio Cano, the 12-year-old Anaheim boy whose parents said they delayed 
medical treatment because they were afraid of being deported, had acute 
leukemia, coroner's officials revealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary tests also indicated the boy's body, in a weakened state because 
of the leukemia, might have been racked with a bacterial infection that led to 
heart failure, law enforcement sources working the case said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts say that acute leukemia often can be successfully treated, 
even in its latter stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it remained unclear to what degree emergency medical intervention 
might have helped the youngster, his death Saturday took on weighty political 
implications as those on both sides of Proposition 187, including Gov. Pete 
Wilson, reopened pre-election wounds with divisive comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will get all kinds of stories of that sort, I suppose," Wilson said in 
reply to a question about the boy's death during a live television interview 
Wednesday on "Good Morning America." But the governor said the burden that 
illegal immigrants place on medical services has deprived citizens from getting 
care they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino leaders, meanwhile, said they might amend their lawsuit challenging the 
constitutionality of Proposition 187 by citing the boy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good case on which to make a plea that all children be exempt from 
all provisions of Proposition 187, and make a plea directly to state 
government," said Fabian Nunez, an Ontario-based activist who planned to meet 
with the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's parents, illegal immigrants from Mexico, say they were afraid to take 
the Sycamore Junior High School student to the hospital because they feared 
quizzing about their immigrant status. 
</P>
<P>
 If it takes effect -- the initiative faces multiple court challenges -- 
Proposition 187 would bar illegal immigrants from receiving education, health 
care -- except in emergencies -- and most other public services. It also would 
require teachers and administrators to report illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was shocked but responded guardedly after learning the preliminary 
autopsy results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any reaction. We have to wait for more results and see what our 
lawyer says," the father said. "We didn't know it was leukemia. I still don't 
know. I don't know if someone is responsible for this." 
</P>
<P>
 A family friend expressed disbelief at the diagnosis, saying the family had no 
clue the boy had a terminal illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boy looked healthy," said Belinda Castro Palomino, a church member who 
was acting as the family's spokesperson. "His mother doesn't believe that he 
had leukemia. They only took him to one doctor and he didn't diagnose any type 
of cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 While Proposition 187 proponents suggested Wednesday that Julio's death was 
being exploited for political purposes, the account of Julio's days leading up 
to his death Saturday, at a minimum, highlights the difficulty illegal 
immigrant parents face in deciding when to take a child to the hospital, and 
the plight facing the poor who have fewer options when it comes to medical 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 After Julio fell ill Monday, Nov. 13, Julio's father said he and his wife 
considered taking him to a hospital, but had been denied non-emergency care 
before. With the passage of Proposition 187, they believed their immigrant 
status would be challenged, he said. The couple also was unaware that the 
provisions of Proposition 187 pertaining to education and medical care had not 
taken effect yet, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father said he waited until Friday to take his son to the doctor because 
that is payday at the factory where he works and he needed $60 for an 
appointment at a nearby clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, physician N. Radd Radparvar said he treated the boy for 
constipation and rectal pain. 
</P>
<P>
 A general practitioner, Radparvar said he administered a "small enema" and 
gave the boy an antibiotic -- Cephalexin -- and vitamins. He said he instructed 
the family to "rush" him to an emergency room if the youngster's condition did 
not improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to elaborate Wednesday, Radparvar said he took a urine sample, which 
contained "leukocytes and blood," signs that "there is something wrong, 
possibly a kidney infection." 
</P>
<P>
 Leukocytes are the white cells in blood, lymph and tissue that help the body 
fight infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only positive clinical sign and symptom I had was that one," he said of 
the urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor said he told the family that they should seek further tests at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Radparvar said he didn't prescribe the medication, but gave it to the family 
because he knew they had little money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did our best," he said. "I am proud of myself. They have more than $30 in 
vitamins and antibiotics because I knew that the baby was really weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else could I do? We did an enema. . . . I talked with him. When he left 
I asked him, 'How do you feel?' He left in better condition. What do you want? 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother and father, they were grateful," Radparvar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, however, said the doctor never told him what to monitor about his 
son's condition and never mentioned taking him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 After they brought the boy home Friday and gave him an antibiotic, the father 
said Julio was "up all night going to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, when the father phoned home during a work break at 8:30 
a.m., the mother told him their son's condition had worsened. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, the mother left the house to get Julio a drink at the 
store. When she returned, he could not speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother contacted a neighbor, who promptly called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gutierrez, an Anaheim Fire Department captain and paramedic, said Julio 
wasn't breathing and had no heartbeat when firefighters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 After paramedics attempted unsuccessfully to revive him, the youngster was 
taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital where further attempts at resuscitation 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 He never took another breath, but Gutierrez said they tried to revive the boy 
at the hospital until roughly 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Julio's death, Los Amigos of Orange County, a Latino 
activist group, Wednesday urged Latinos throughout California to boycott work, 
school and merchants on Dec. 12 in protest of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Other activist groups began reviewing the case to determine whether it could 
serve as the backbone for a lawsuit asking that all children be excluded from 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, the Orange County representative of the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund, said the organization's attorneys had spoken to 
the family and planned to amend its class-action suit seeking a permanent 
injunction against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a deadline of Monday to amend our class-action lawsuit. We currently 
have received the declaration from the family for inclusion in our lawsuit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And at a meeting Wednesday, members of Los Amigos of Orange County clasped 
hands and bowed their heads in remembrance of Julio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to convey to the family that has lost this little boy that there are 
many people who care," said Galal Kernahan, who led a prayer. "And we ask help 
for us to be open and appreciative of the differences of others." 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, president of Los Amigos, said a diagnosis of acute leukemia 
possibly could have been made if the family had sought medical care earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Could somebody have diagnosed that?' is a question that I ask," he said. 
"We think that hospital tests would have brought it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The disease takes two basic forms. One type, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has 
a survival rate of about 70% after five years, if treatment is provided. The 
other type, non-lymphoblastic leukemia, is more difficult to treat and has a 
40% to 50% survival rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in childhood leukemia offered mixed views on whether the youngster 
could been saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alexis Thompson, an assistant professor in pediatric hematology-oncology 
at the UCLA School of Medicine, said it would have depended on which form of 
acute leukemia the child had. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a child with an aggressive infection could be overwhelmed before 
obtaining adequate chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stuart Siegel, head of the division of hematology-oncology at Childrens 
Hospital Los Angeles, said that even if the disease is diagnosed late, there 
often is a "significant chance" of treating the child successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 proponents denounced efforts to link the controversial 
immigration measure to the boy's death. They inveighed against Latino activists 
for what they say is exploiting a tragic situation for political ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we are sad for the family," said Barbara Coe, a founding member of 
the Proposition 187 movement. "But the anti-187 people will do whatever is 
necessary to get this measure defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly deceitful." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, some leading Proposition 187 supporters reasoned that any 
responsibility lies with Julio's parents or the foes of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are endangering the children by bringing them here illegally,' 
said Ron S. Prince of Tustin, who headed the pro-187 "Save Our State campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the subject during the national television interview, Gov. Wilson 
brushed aside the Orange County case and said the ballot measure will ensure 
more medical services for legal residents of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're also hearing from emergency room physicians is that some felt that 
because of the tremendous burden placed upon them by illegal immigrants able to 
claim under the law certain emergency care, that they were compelled to cut 
back on services to everyone," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to say we are having to put our own needs first," the governor 
continued, " . . . when you cannot provide services, when you're shortchanging 
the education of legal residents, the health care of legal residents, because 
the federal government has failed to do its job and then has compounded that 
failure by sticking the states with the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's parents moved to Orange County from Acapulco four years ago. Julio 
and the couple's other older children, ages 13 and 11, were born in Mexico and 
joined their parents here only three years ago. They are all undocumented, the 
father said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's youngest children, age 1 month and 1 year, were born in the 
United States and are thus citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the passage of Proposition 187, the couple was unsure where to 
seek medical care, they said. The three eldest children carry Medi-Cal cards 
ensuring only emergency and pregnancy-related services. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the autopsy was conducted Sunday, coroner's officials are awaiting 
the results of further tests before issuing an official cause of death. One law 
enforcement source working the case said it usually takes weeks to do the kinds 
of preliminary tests that were done in a matter of days in Julio's case. But 
"this was handled differently," the source said, because of the possible 
political ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Soria Ayuso, the Mexican consul in Santa Ana, said the consulate is 
helping to arrange for Julio's remains to be flown to their native Acapulco, 
where they want to bury him. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Paul Feldman and Julie Marquis contributed to this report. 
Acute Leukemia: A Primer 
</P>
<P>
 Leukemia is a form of cancer involving an abnormal proliferation of white 
blood cells in the bone marrow. About 3,200 children develop acute leukemia 
each year, accounting for about 40% of all new childhood cancer cases, 
according to Dr. Stuart Siegel, head of the division of hematology/oncology at 
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 SYMPTOMS 
</P>
<P>
 Acute leukemia can be difficult to diagnose early because symptoms may develop 
late or may be similar to those of other, less serious conditions. Some 
symptoms: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gum bleeding 
</P>
<P>
 * Frequent bruising 
</P>
<P>
 * Anemia 
</P>
<P>
 * Paleness 
</P>
<P>
 * Weight loss 
</P>
<P>
 POSSIBLE CAUSES 
</P>
<P>
 * Virus 
</P>
<P>
 * Exposure to chemicals, such as benzene; also to cancer-fighting drugs that 
lower resistance 
</P>
<P>
 * Exposure to high doses of radiation 
</P>
<P>
 TREATMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Blood transfusions 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemotherapy, involving a variety of anti-cancer drugs 
</P>
<P>
 * Large doses of antibiotics to defend the body against opportunistic 
infections 
</P>
<P>
 * Bone marrow transplants for advanced cases 
</P>
<P>
 TREATMENT RESULTS 
</P>
<P>
 Left untreated, acute leukemia can be fatal in a few weeks to a few months. Of 
the two types of acute leukemia, lymphoblastic is the most common in children 
and often responds to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * The five-year survival rate for children treated with chemotherapy is about 
70%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most relapses occur within two years of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * For those patients who have another, harder-to-treat form of the disease, 
called non-lymphoblastic leukemia, chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant 
may be needed.

112 TRAMPLED TO DEATH AS POLICE HALT INDIA MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A charge by baton-swinging police on protesters from one of the most destitute 
groups in Indian society sparked a stampede Wednesday in which at least 112 
people were trampled to death, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 500 people were injured in the panic in the city of Nagpur, Deputy 
Police Commissioner Jawahar Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the Government Medical College Hospital told the United News of 
India that the death toll could rise, as some of the injuries were very 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dead were 68 women and 28 children, said Maharashtra Home Minister 
Padamsinh Patil. He said they had been placed in the vanguard of a march that 
tried to break through police barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today, Indian police said they arrested three leaders of the protest to 
prevent an outbreak of violence in the wake of the tragedy. Authorities also 
banned meetings and marches and stepped up security in Nagpur. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadly stampede was directly linked to the campaigns mounted by an 
increasing number of groups in this country's diverse society to demand the 
allocation of what they perceive as their fair share of government jobs, school 
admissions and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislature of Maharashtra state, which normally meets in Bombay, had 
convened for its winter session Monday in Nagpur, 375 miles south of New Delhi. 
An estimated 50,000 adivasis , members of indigent, uneducated tribes that 
dwell in the western state's forests and remote rural areas, had massed under 
the banners of the Adivasi Struggle Society to demand that they be given 
"scheduled tribe" status under Indian law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scheduled tribes" are allocated quotas for government jobs and placement in 
state-run schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the adivasis are classified as "other backward castes" in the 
Byzantine hierarchy of India's many Hindu castes and other social strata. Such 
a designation, which by one estimate embraces four-fifths of India's 900 
million people, entitles the adivasis to far fewer privileges than if they were 
incorporated on the list of "scheduled tribes." 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources said the trouble began when leaders of the protest insisted on 
taking a large delegation to meet with Maharashtra Chief Minister Sharad Pawar. 
When they were blocked, some marchers tried to smash their way through the 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Patil, male demonstrators pushed the women and children forward 
to pull down the heavy police barricades and try to rush the Council Hall where 
the state lawmakers were meeting about a quarter-mile away. They also threw 
stones, Patil claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police charged, armed with long, iron-tipped shafts of bamboo called lathis . 
When the marchers in front tried to fall back to escape the blows, a stampede 
began, with many women and children falling under the feet of the panicked 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting from Nagpur, Reuters news agency quoted officials as saying many 
demonstrators ran into a small lane, which was blocked by a water tanker. It 
appeared many deaths occurred there, Reuters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarter-mile from the site of the tragedy to the police station was 
littered Wednesday night with torn clothes and discarded slippers and sandals. 
The area was cordoned off so the dead and injured could be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, expressing shock and regret, asked Pawar, 
the state's chief minister, to investigate the incident. But Patil defended 
police actions, saying, "Not a single bullet was fired or tear-gas shell used 
on the mob." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the issue of job quotas has inflamed Indian politics from the 
southern state of Tamil Nadu to Uttar Pradesh, the northern state astride the 
Ganges that is the country's most populated. 
</P>
<P>
 India's most downtrodden, including the harijan , or Untouchables, say they 
are only trying to get social justice after centuries of discrimination and 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 But the priestly caste, known as Brahmins, and other higher-caste groups that 
have historically held power and prestige complain that merit is less and less 
a requirement for holding government office or getting into competitive 
government-run schools. 
</P>
<P>
 By making caste a criterion for being hired, they say, members of castes that 
were traditionally regarded as inferior or impure are perpetuating those 
stereotypes.

NATO HITS SERB MISSILE SITES; SIEGE OF BIHAC GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allied warplanes launched another series of bombing raids against Serbian-held 
positions near the Bosnian Muslim enclave of Bihac on Wednesday, but Serbian 
nationalist ground forces intensified their siege of the U.N. "safe area," 
raising fears that it may fall soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Warplanes of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization hit in three separate 
strikes, targeting two Serbian nationalist antiaircraft missile sites that had 
threatened allied fighter jets, as well as a Serbian air-defense battery that 
fired at British jets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration continued to press U.S. allies to widen NATO's 
military involvement in an effort to prevent the fall of Bihac but again met 
resistance from France and Britain, which are fearful that their peacekeeping 
troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina will come under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington also is considering launching a major U.S.-led airdrop to deliver 
humanitarian relief supplies to the Bihac region. The area, which contains 
170,000 people, has been denied support from U.N. aid convoys since last May. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as Bosnian Serb forces set up blockades at key points 
around the capital of Sarajevo, apparently in retaliation for NATO air strikes 
Monday, penning in U.N. peacekeeping forces stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
 The flurry of activity left the situation much as it has been for days -- with 
a diplomatic stalemate in the face of increasing urgency on the military front 
-- as the Serbs press on toward complete control of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that the outcome could be important because Bosnian government 
officials have hinted that if Bihac falls to the Serbian nationalists, the 
Muslim-Croatian confederation will pull out of the Western-led peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Some policy-makers also fear that a Serbian takeover of Bihac might prompt 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to launch a new war in Croatia, which borders 
on the Bihac enclave and has a substantial Serbian nationalist population. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear how quickly the United States and its European 
allies might be able to reach any consensus on what to do about the 
deteriorating situation in Bihac. NATO's policy-setting North Atlantic Council 
met Wednesday but deferred action. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign ministers of the United States, Russia and the European allies plan to 
gather Dec. 2 for a meeting of the so-called Contact Group, which oversees 
negotiations for a Bosnian peace pact, but the outlook for the session is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have been pressing for NATO to declare the Bihac enclave a 
weapons-exclusion zone -- a move that would bar Serbian tanks, artillery and 
other heavy weapons from the area and permit allied warplanes to attack them. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington also has suggested launching direct air strikes against the Serbian 
nationalist forces -- both in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia -- that 
currently are attacking Bihac. And it wants to allow NATO warplanes to pursue 
Serbian aircraft into Croatia to shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's hope in pushing such proposals is to pose a big 
enough military threat to the nationalist Serbs to discourage them from 
completing their takeover of Bihac and possibly even push them into signing a 
peace accord with the Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 But European governments fear that intensifying the fight against the Serbs 
will only provoke them into retaliating by attacking U.N. peacekeeping troops, 
particularly the French, British and Dutch forces now stationed in the Sarajevo 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been under growing pressure from Congress to lift the arms embargo 
against the Muslim-led Bosnian government. The lawmakers contend that the 
Muslims would then be able to force the Serbs to come to some sort of terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a congressional compromise, the Administration last week announced that 
U.S. forces would no longer help to enforce the U.N. embargo, setting off a 
vigorous protest from European allies. 
</P>
<P>
 European officials argue that the Serbs would retaliate by attacking the U.N. 
peacekeeping troops if the arms embargo were lifted, obliging the United States 
to send American troops to help evacuate the U.N. forces, which it has promised 
to do in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's air strikes were the second set of attacks by NATO warplanes 
against Serbian nationalist targets this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Western warplanes launched a limited attack on a Serbian 
nationalist air base and on missile and antiaircraft artillery sites in 
south-central Croatia, destroying the air defenses and making the runways and 
taxiways unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's air assault was carried out by more than two dozen American, 
British, French and Dutch planes against Serbian antiaircraft missile batteries 
at Otoka and Bosanska Krupa in northwestern Bosnia and Dvor in the Serbian-held 
Krajina area of Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Serbian missile sites had fired at British Harrier jets Tuesday. 
Others had "illuminated" NATO planes with radar -- an action that often signals 
that an antiaircraft missile is about to be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied planes also fired several air-to-ground missiles to knock out other 
radar sites in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Yasushi Akashi, who heads the U.N. Protection Force in the former 
Yugoslav federation, claimed to have negotiated a temporary cease-fire with 
Serbian nationalist leaders that would ease tensions in Bihac, but U.S. 
officials were skeptical. Analysts noted that previous deals have fallen 
through soon after Akashi announced them. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Carol J. Williams in Vienna contributed to this article. 
NATO Strikes 
</P>
<P>
 NATO planes attacked three Serbian antiaircraft sites Wednesday, striking at 
one target twice to make sure it ceased threatening allied aircraft.

COLUMN ONE; TINTIN STILL WOWS THE WORLD; GADZOOKS! COMICS READERS FROM HELSINKI 
TO HANOI LOVE BELGIUM'S TEEN-AGE REPORTER. HIS ADVENTURES ARE MINI MORALITY 
PLAYS THAT DELIGHT FANS YOUNG AND OLD YEARS AFTER HIS CREATOR'S DEATH.

<P>
 Like children anywhere with an answer to give, the youngsters playing in a 
suburban park could hardly contain themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tintin! Tintin and Snowy!" several of the small voices exclaimed in chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Captain Haddock!" came another reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I love them all!" shouted a little 8-year-old named Laura, jumping up and 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 The children were reeling off their fictional heroes -- and none were from 
anyplace new. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the latest gimmicks marketed to dazzle their young lives. Forget the 
Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Strawberry 
Shortcake and the Care Bears. Don't even think about Beavis and Butt-head. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this excitement was aimed at the figures in one of Europe's oldest comic 
strips, "Tintin" -- whose title character is a fresh-scrubbed teen-age 
newspaper reporter with a face so open and free of detail that he tickles 
imaginations from Hanoi to Helsinki. Through a series of adventures that are 
really miniature morality plays, enjoyed as much by parents as children, he 
confronts an array of villains ranging from hard-line Stalinists to Chicago 
mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the stories have appeared in 51 languages -- roughly twice as many as 
"Peanuts" -- and are probably the most widely translated features in the world. 
In the process, Tintin has become a Belgian national treasure, a character so 
popular throughout the Francophone world that the late French President Charles 
de Gaulle once quipped, "Tintin is my only international rival." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, De Gaulle's rival is making a new run at the United States. Although 
first translated into English in the late 1950s and widely known today in 
Britain, the series has never really caught on big in America. But its backers 
think now is the time. 
</P>
<P>
 An animated television series of Tintin's adventures, which began on Home Box 
Office in 1991, boosted American sales of Tintin books. And his premiere this 
fall in an after-school time slot on the Nickelodeon cable channel will nearly 
quadruple the potential audience from 16 million to 60 million households, 
according to Louise Desjardins, the American agent for Tintin's Belgian 
publisher, Casterman. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Sony Wonder will begin marketing videocassettes of Tintin's 
adventures, and Desjardins is convinced that this will help the books catch on. 
"The problem (in the United States) has always been a lack of exposure," she 
said in a telephone interview from her office in Mystic, Conn. "This is going 
to help change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the world, Tintin needs little promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 66 years since the young reporter debuted with his little dog, 
Snowy. And nearly two decades have passed since the last of his 23 
globe-trotting adventures was completed. Yet the appeal seems only to get 
stronger with time. Nearly 200 million bound volumes of these adventures have 
been sold around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, the strip's remarkable staying power has already made the 
adventures of Tintin a rare shared experience among generations of comics 
readers. Grandparents, parents -- and now their children -- have tracked the 
same characters moving through the same adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Panichelli, a senior official at the European Parliament here, 
recalled how he devoured the Tintin adventures as a child, then put them aside 
as a teen-ager only to rediscover them as he began reading them to his own son. 
"I hadn't touched them for 20 years, but when I did, I understood them at a 
different level," he said. "They were as interesting for me as for my son." 
</P>
<P>
 Panichelli said that, although his son is nearly 20 and a medical student, 
they still frequently quote bits of Tintin dialogue to each other. "It's a link 
for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, specialty shops peddling Tintin playing cards, mugs, socks, key 
chains and other souvenirs have sprung up in London, Tokyo, Barcelona and 
Montreal. In Japan, Tintin has become the spokesman for the national airline 
and the national railway. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has surprised many followers of comic strips is that interest in the 
adventures seems to have increased rather than dropped off in the decade since 
the death of his creator George Remi, who drew under the pen name "Herge" 
(pronounced Er-jay). 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the medium explain that Tintin's universal appeal stems in part 
from the simplicity of his features. "His face is almost empty, so that almost 
anyone from any culture can associate with him," said Charles Dierick, director 
of the Belgian Center for Comic Strips here. "He's the best vehicle for a 
reader to project his emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also a deceptive, understated quality to the Tintin stories. 
While Tintin may look like he belongs on a level with Archie, his adventures 
contain elements more evocative of Sherlock Holmes, Mark Twain, Jules Verne, 
Alfred Hitchcock and Don Quixote. 
</P>
<P>
 As "Tintin, world reporter No. 1," he escapes a Stalinist-era Soviet Union, 
tackles Chicago mobsters in the early 1930s, battles drug traffickers in China 
in the Sino-Japanese War and fights kidnapers of an Arab sheik in the Middle 
East. It's a string of tales that portray the world between the two wars, yet 
at the same time are timeless adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we ask children today when they think Tintin lived, they always say 
'now,' " said Philippe Goddin, secretary general of the Herge Foundation here, 
which was established to protect the artist's works. 
</P>
<P>
 In Herge's later books, Tintin gets involved in Cold War mysteries, fights 
petty dictators in Latin America, rescues an old friend in Tibet and even 
explores the moon -- always against great odds, always in the name of truth, 
justice and a greater good, always winning out in the end. His supporting cast 
includes an absent-minded professor named Calculus, a crusty sea captain called 
Haddock, twin detectives known as the Thompsons (for comic relief) and Snowy 
the talking dog. 
</P>
<P>
 But aside from the lure of the characters, what really sets "Tintin" apart is 
the depth of the stories. In constructing dialogue, in his story content, and 
in his unusual attention to detail, Herge was simply different from most others 
of his craft. He was fascinated by the things that especially appeal to young 
people, such as uniforms, technology and all forms of transportation; he 
concentrated on each aspect of each cartoon frame. 
</P>
<P>
 When Haddock receives a dressing-down from a Nepalese porter in "Tintin in 
Tibet," the porter's words are written in accurate Nepali script. The uniforms 
of Japanese occupation troops in "The Blue Lotus" are carefully drawn copies of 
originals, as are musical instruments played by Peruvian Indians in "Temple of 
the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 The stories themselves are so carefully constructed and open to interpretation 
that they tend to be enjoyed as much by adults as by children. 
</P>
<P>
 Dierick, for example, claims Tintin's Tibet adventure, which centers on the 
search for an old friend in trouble, is really an exploration of the theme of 
fidelity and, indirectly, of the breakup of Herge's first marriage. "What's 
important about Tintin books is the drive behind the stories," Dierick said. 
"His themes are universal." 
</P>
<P>
 Frederic Soumois, whose doctoral thesis became one of the many books that 
attempt to analyze the "Tintin phenomenon," considers the adventures a mixture 
of history and morality. "Tintin is different from the superhero of American 
comics," Soumois said. "His adventures are really moral lessons on freedom of 
choice, self-determination and the role of the individual in society." 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, teachers often used the colorfully illustrated adventures as 
reading aids. 
</P>
<P>
 "They connect word and image as well as anything going," said Dierick. 
</P>
<P>
 Herge's "Tintin" was a hit virtually from the moment it first appeared in 1929 
as a supplement to the Brussels weekly "Twentieth Century." It was the same 
year that Tarzan and Buck Rogers began life as comic strip characters in the 
United States, and the year after a young American cartoon artist named Walt 
Disney first introduced a character called Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a lead from his American contemporaries, Herge became the first 
European cartoonist to use a balloon for dialogue; his first adventure, "Tintin 
in the Land of the Soviets," generated an immediate, avid following. The 
youthful reporter was traveling to exotic, far-off places -- out of reach to 
normal people. 
</P>
<P>
 When the publisher staged Tintin's mock return at the Brussels North Railroad 
Station in 1930, thousands came out to greet him. Once completed, the serial 
was bound and sold as a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Disney and other cartoonists, Herge never relinquished control of his 
creation to others. "Tintin, that's me," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Herge died in 1983, Tintin's adventures stopped too. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the artist's Brussels office at the Herge Foundation remains as it was, 
with a large, flat drawing table flanked by a model of Tintin's red-and-white 
checked moon rocket, the works of American artists Andy Warhol and Roy 
Lichtenstein on two walls and a bookcase stuffed with volumes of translated 
Tintin adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 And still his creation expands: The fall of communism has enabled Tintin to 
reach Eastern Europe. The adventures have already been translated into Russian, 
Polish, Hungarian, Slovak and Czech, Goddin said, and other Eastern languages 
are likely to follow soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are eager to remain active," he said. "We want people to know about 
Herge's works."

MEXICO INVESTIGATOR QUITS, SAYS PRI THWARTING PROBE; ASSASSINATION: RUIZ 
MASSIEU ACCUSES PARTY OFFICIALS OF COVER-UP IN BROTHER'S SLAYING. THEY DENY 
CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico's second-ranking law enforcement official resigned Wednesday from his 
job, from the ruling party and as chief investigator in the assassination of 
its secretary general, publicly accusing the party's top officials -- including 
his boss, the attorney general -- of covering up a murder he blamed squarely on 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
 To shouts of "No! No! No one else can be trusted!" Deputy Atty. Gen. Mario 
Ruiz Massieu told hundreds of supporters, packed beyond capacity into an 
auditorium in the attorney general's headquarters, that "the resistance and the 
obstacles the party has put in the way of the investigation" made it impossible 
to proceed further. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor announced that his two-month investigation had amassed enough 
evidence to warrant the arrest of several officials for complicity or 
obstruction of justice in the gangland-style slaying of his brother, Francisco, 
who was the Institutional Revolutionary Party's second-ranking official when he 
was gunned down outside a Mexico City hotel in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Sept. 28, a bullet killed two Ruiz Massieus -- one lost his life, and 
the other lost his faith and his hope that a PRI government could bring 
justice," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu said a report he sent to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on 
Wednesday morning contains sufficient proof of wrongdoing to strip away all 
immunity from the woman who succeeded his brother as PRI secretary general, 
Maria de los Angeles Moreno, an elected member of the Mexican Senate who he 
said should be arrested "for various crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the evidence also implicates party president Ignacio 
Pichardo in "shameful" acts, including obstruction of justice and conspiracy, a 
charge he also leveled against his immediate superior, Atty. Gen. Humberto 
Benitez Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
 Pichardo demanded, on behalf of the PRI, details of Ruiz Massieu's evidence -- 
which the prosecutor stopped short of releasing Wednesday. Rather, Ruiz Massieu 
said, he sent the documents to authorities -- particularly Salinas and the 
ruling party's president-elect, Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hastily arranged news conference Wednesday night, Pichardo 
"categorically" denied the accusation, which he called "defamatory and 
slanderous." 
</P>
<P>
 Seated beside Moreno, he accused Ruiz Massieu of investigating the case 
"without strictly adhering to the law," adding that the party leadership is 
consulting with its attorneys to determine what action, if any, to take against 
"the former deputy attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno remained stony-faced and silent throughout the news conference. But on 
Tuesday, in testimony before the Senate, Moreno insisted she had demonstrated a 
clear willingness to aid the investigation into her predecessor's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this reason," she said, "I cannot accept the false and deceitful 
accusations that have been made against my party, against its various members . 
. . and me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu challenged Zedillo to follow up the investigation and formally 
charge the top hierarchy of his own party when he assumes office a week from 
today. "The president-elect must act," Ruiz Massieu declared. "Society insists 
on it, the Ruiz Massieu family demands it and justice obliges it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, who was in Washington to meet President Clinton on Wednesday, reacted 
calmly to the allegations, which touched off a political firestorm in Mexico 
City. He told a news conference in Washington that he had yet to see the 
evidence and would reserve comment, but added that he was committed to 
reforming Mexico's criminal justice system and to solving the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear that Ruiz Massieu had presented the 41-year-old Yale-educated 
Zedillo, an economist who was elected with the smallest majority in 
ruling-party history in August, with an acid test of his vow to continue 
Salinas' democratic reforms. Salinas appointed Ruiz Massieu to investigate his 
brother's slaying as part of those reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unfortunate that some politicians do not understand that the country 
has changed, and that old corrupt and even illegal practices must be put to one 
side," Ruiz Massieu said. "It is unfortunate that in the case of Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu, it has been the PRI - istas themselves who eliminated him. It is 
unfortunate that those same PRI-istas continue in power." 
</P>
<P>
 In thanking Salinas for his support and commitment throughout the 
investigation, the prosecutor underscored what many Mexican political analysts 
say forms the core of Zedillo's challenge in the years ahead: reforming a party 
that, after governing continuously since 1929, has become more powerful than 
the president. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PRI political class had more power than a president . . . more power than 
the justice that a president demanded," Ruiz Massieu said, referring to 
Salinas, who Wednesday afternoon confirmed that he had received the report 
containing the prosecutor's evidence and thanked Ruiz Massieu for his work and 
his courage. 
</P>
<P>
 The justice that Ruiz Massieu did manage to exact before his resignation 
includes the arrest and detention of 14 suspects in his brother's case, among 
them low-ranking PRI officials, legislative aides and the hired gunman who was 
tackled at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A more senior member, former PRI legislator Manuel Munoz Rocha, has been named 
as a co-conspirator and mastermind of the assassination, but he remains at 
large despite an international search. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the series of arrests, Ruiz Massieu released the detailed testimony 
of each suspect, drawing praise from a public unaccustomed to official openness 
and intense political fire from a ruling party unaccustomed to public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Washington Bureau Chief Jack Nelson contributed to this report.

FOOD GIFTS POUR IN FOR HUNGRY SCHOOLCHILDREN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was simple fare at Edgewood Middle School's first free breakfast Wednesday 
morning: a bowl of Cheerios, a carton of milk and another carton of orange 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakfast was organized by West Covina residents after the problem of 
hunger among children at the school, detailed in a Times story Sunday, sparked 
a nationwide outpouring of generosity. Edgewood was cited as an example of the 
thousands of schools nationwide that have not taken advantage of a 
longstanding, federally funded breakfast program for low-income students, 
filling classrooms with hungry children who cannot focus on learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sunday, Edgewood has turned into an emotional meeting ground between the 
haves and the have-nots in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of people, concerned about hungry children at the school, hauled in 
canned foods and frozen turkeys, a bounty of birds that overwhelmed Assistant 
Principal Amelia Esposito's office. Others -- many of whom said they were 
facing a bare-bones Thanksgiving -- came in to take a donated turkey home. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena lawyer Jeannette E. Valdivia and her family drove to the school, 
delivering 10 boxes of groceries. Her 3-year-old son, Jackson, handed one of 
the boxes filled with bread and peanut butter to Lisa Drynan's 3-year-old boy, 
Kevin. Drynan sometimes does not have enough money to feed her boys three meals 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia stood in the assistant principal's office after the exchange, crying, 
and hugging Drynan. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandparents were very poor and didn't have enough to eat," Valdivia said. 
"Now I have enough to give some." The card in the box read simply: "Happy 
Thanksgiving!" 
</P>
<P>
 None of West Covina Unified School District's 11 schools offer a federally 
funded breakfast to their low-income students. The district board's president 
contends that the program is anti-family. But Wednesday, nearly 170 Edgewood 
children ate a privately provided meal before school began. Shoveling spoonfuls 
of cereal into his mouth, Frankie, 11, said there is never enough food at home 
to eat breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night, we didn't have any food or any money. I went to sleep and tried 
to forget about it," said the boy, who arrived early in anticipation of the 
meal. Another boy asked his teacher if he could come today for breakfast, even 
though it is a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very proud moment," said Edgewood Principal Cathy Makin, watching 
as each child walked up to the school's cafeteria window and walked away 
clasping a cereal box. 
</P>
<P>
 Makin said the school had received more than 300 calls from citizens -- many 
of them crying -- offering donations. "The community heard about a problem, and 
moved to do something about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 People in other states had heard, too, calling in pledges of money and food. 
"Every time I look up I see someone else bringing in food," Makin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has received more than $1,800 in hand-delivered donations. More is 
expected to arrive by mail next week, donations that the school hopes to use to 
keep the breakfast program going. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, school officials hope that the district's school board will vote 
Dec. 13 to apply for federal funds to create a permanent breakfast program in 
all of the district's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred turkeys have been donated to the school. A woman from Arcadia 
brought 32 baskets of food in memory of her son and grandson, who were recently 
killed in an accident, saying it was her way of celebrating the holidays 
without them. Another woman brought in an eight-pound brisket of meat. There 
were donations of cases of tuna fish and corn. A man from Norwalk handed Makin 
an envelope containing $1,500 in food gift certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 At midmorning, an elderly woman who lives next to the Vons store in West 
Covina telephoned. She had been able to haul home enough food by hand to make 
up six food baskets, but she didn't drive. Could someone pick up the donation? 
A school secretary was dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at what people brought us," health clerk Deborah Paschal said, beaming 
as she opened the cabinet at the school nurse's station, now packed with graham 
crackers and granola bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers worked the school phones, calling to offer food to families that 
principals in the district had suggested might be needy. One woman, whose 
daughter attends Edgewood, had arrived in a wheelchair. "God bless you! God 
bless you! We weren't going to have Thanksgiving," she told the school's 
receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lawrence, 41, who said two of her seven children attend Edgewood, was 
thankful for the food, which included donated rice, pasta and cans of 
vegetables. She had used her turkey money to move out of a gang-infested area 
last month. "It's great," she said as Assistant Principal Amelia Esposito 
slipped a turkey into a plastic bag for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Cradling a donated turkey in her arms, Nelly Gomez, 34, whose husband's 
$600-a-month pizza delivery job supports them and two children, said she has 
trouble putting three solid meals on the table. "Breakfast here at school would 
be a big help. Especially for parents who work but don't make much," said 
Gomez, whose family spends about $450 a month to rent a house with two other 
families. She had planned to serve her children a piece of chicken for 
Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Drynan, one of the Edgewood parents profiled in the Times story, said 
more than 100 people had tracked her down, offering to help her with food, 
rent, even toys for the holidays. One woman drove from Orange County, filling 
her cupboards with food. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think it's such an ugly world out there. But people have responded in an 
amazing way," she said. "I've said God bless you and thank you hundreds of 
times. I don't know what else to say." 
</P>
<P>
 By the cafeteria, two 12-year-olds, Steven and Ivan, ate breakfast at green 
picnic tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family has problems. There's not that much money. We just get lunch. And 
dinner. There is no breakfast," Steven said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan scraped the bottom of his cereal bowl. "This is good. Now, I don't have 
to think about food in class," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the morning bell rang, the boys moved to their classroom to begin the 
first lesson of the day. How to Help

GOP CAPTURES CONTROL OF STATE ASSEMBLY, 41-39; ELECTION: LONG BEACH RACE TIPS 
THE BALANCE IN LATE VOTE COUNTING. DEMOCRATS KEEP EDGE IN CONGRESS DELEGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With fewer than 23,000 absentee ballots to be tallied, Republicans have 
emerged as winners of 41 California Assembly seats, spelling the end of a 
25-year reign of Democrats in the lower house, election officials reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The late absentee count showed, however, that Democrats did manage to retain 
an edge in the California congressional delegation by a margin of 27 seats to 
25, as Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) eked out a victory over Republican 
Susan Brooks by fewer than 800 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Caren Daniels-Meade, spokeswoman for the secretary of state, said no election 
results will change, although some ballots are still being counted in some 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done as far as we're concerned," Daniels-Meade said. "I can't imagine 
anything changing now." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 8.8 million people cast votes statewide in the Nov. 8 election. 
Turnout was 60.1%, the highest for a non-presidential election since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown still is expected to 
try to hang onto the powerful speakership when the new Assembly returns Dec. 5. 
But with Democrats retaining only 39 seats, Brown appears destined to lose the 
post he has held for 14 years, longer than anyone in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short of an act of God, there will be 41 Republicans in the state Assembly on 
Dec. 5," said Phil Perry, spokesman for Republican Assembly Leader Jim Brulte, 
the front-runner to replace Brown as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the election, Democrats held 47 Assembly seats to the Republicans' 33. 
But spending more than $4 million on Assembly races statewide, Brulte and the 
Republicans swept five incumbent Assembly Democrats out of office and won four 
open seats previously held by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 One Democrat won a seat that was held by a Republican, giving the GOP a net 
gain of eight in the lower house. The Democrats stay in control of the state 
Senate, with 21 seats to 17 for Republicans and two independents. 
</P>
<P>
 The race that tipped the balance was in Long Beach, where incumbent Democrat 
Assemblywoman Betty Karnette lost to Republican Steve Kuykendall, a one-term 
Rancho Palos Verdes mayor. Kuykendall led by 539 votes late Wednesday. Los 
Angeles County election officials say they have 8,000 to 10,000 ballots left to 
tally countywide and were not certain how many came from the Long Beach 
district. Republicans and Democrats alike, however, are convinced that the 
outcome will not change. 
</P>
<P>
 Karnette has refused to concede, but Kuykendall was in Sacramento this week 
meeting with Brulte and sorting through resumes for an office staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring victory "doesn't make much difference," Kuykendall said. "You know 
darn well my opponent won't declare defeat." California Democratic Party 
Chairman Bill Press attempted to add a sour note to Kuykendall's victory, 
announcing this week that Democrats were considering mounting a recall campaign 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, Press said, would be Kuykendall's acceptance of a $125,000 donation 
from Philip Morris USA, the world's largest tobacco company, on the weekend 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the electorate was thrashing the Philip Morris-backed 
Proposition 188, voters were unaware that Kuykendall had taken such a large 
donation from the tobacco giant -- an amount that apparently is a record lump 
sum from a single donor to an Assembly campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Party has complained to the Fair Political Practices Commission 
over the donation, contending that Brulte and Kuykendall failed to report it 
promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris reported the donation to the secretary of state on the day 
before the election. Kuykendall, who also was required to report it, did not 
send word of the contribution until the day after the balloting. But both 
Brulte and Kuykendall scoffed at the complaint, calling it frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously if (a recall) is the course they take, we will fight very 
aggressively. We will not sit back," Kuykendall said. ". . . This is the dying, 
thrashing about that you have before guys say, 'Hey, I'm whipped.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bay congressional district, Harman declared victory in her race 
against Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Brooks, meaning that Democrats will 
return to Washington with an edge of 27 seats to 25 in the California 
congressional delegation -- a net loss of three for the Democrats. She led by 
766 votes late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a national tide, but what is significant is this district resisted 
it," Harman said, referring to the Republican takeover of Congress. "I'm a 
Democrat and I won here. Why did I win? I won because I believe my record, my 
style, my bipartisan support is what this district wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Brooks, who led after election night by 93 votes, was so confident 
of victory that she flew to Washington to be part of incoming House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich's transition team. She appeared at news conferences and was on 
network news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has yet to concede, Brooks has vowed to run again in 1996, and 
plans to maintain contacts with GOP leaders, access she said would be denied to 
Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 "She will be stripped of any power at all," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morain reported from Sacramento and Johnson from Torrance.

INDICTMENT BID IN WHITEWATER EXPECTED SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special counsel Kenneth W. Starr is expected to seek indictments soon against 
a number of key players in the financial scandal linked to President Clinton's 
investment in the Whitewater real estate development, according to sources 
close to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr is said to be preparing wide-ranging indictments for a special grand 
jury in Little Rock, Ark., against some well-known political figures, including 
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas and former U.S. Associate Atty. Gen. Webster L. 
Hubbell, who was once a partner with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 
Rose Law Firm in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Also virtually certain to be named, according to these sources, are Clinton's 
partner in the Whitewater deal, James B. McDougal; McDougal's former wife, 
Susan, and a number of lesser-known employees of the failed Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan, which McDougal once owned. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, sources said, there is no indication that Starr is considering 
bringing indictments against either the President or First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. But coming on the heels of a GOP election sweep, the indictments would 
add to Clinton's political problems by refocusing attention on allegations 
previously made public that he benefited from McDougal's efforts to fund their 
joint real estate venture in the Ozarks with cash from the savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Whitewater and related activities have caused considerable 
embarrassment for the President and Mrs. Clinton and have led to the 
resignation of at least three top Administration officials, including Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, spokesman Barry Toiv said that he was unaware of the 
impending indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictments are expected to be based in part on leads provided to the 
special counsel by David Hale, a former Little Rock municipal judge who claims 
that Clinton and McDougal persuaded him in the mid-1980s to make an illegal, 
federally backed loan of $300,000 to Susan McDougal. One-third of the money was 
then used by the Whitewater Development Corp. for a land purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1979, the Clintons and the McDougals were partners in a resort 
development known as Whitewater Estates in the Ozark Mountains. The partnership 
has attracted attention not only because savings and loan money might have been 
channeled to the firm but because the Clintons invested less than the 
McDougals. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have charged that McDougal, an old friend of the Clintons, saw 
Whitewater as a backdoor way of making payoffs to the President, who at the 
time was serving as governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has said that Whitewater was nothing more than a poor investment 
that produced no income for his family. He has also denied Hale's story that 
Clinton pressured the then-judge to lend money that Susan McDougal later 
funneled, in part, into Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale's version of the story has drawn some support, however, from testimony by 
one of Clinton's former bodyguards, L.D. Brown, an Arkansas state trooper who 
often has been at odds with the former Arkansas governor. Brown has claimed 
that he witnessed a meeting in which the then-governor told Hale: "David, you 
are going to have to help us out. We need to raise some money." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale has been cooperating with the special counsel's office in an effort to 
win a reduced sentence on an unrelated fraud charge to which he pleaded guilty 
last June. In a motion filed in federal court last week seeking to delay Hale's 
scheduled sentencing on Dec. 5, Starr indicated for the first time publicly 
that he has taken Hale's allegations seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr told U.S. District Judge Stephen M. Reasoner in Little Rock that "the 
importance of not sentencing Hale before the completion of this investigation 
cannot be overemphasized" because his "cooperation touches directly on some of 
the most sensitive matters of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 He described Hale's cooperation as "extensive and continuous." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr is known to be finished reviewing evidence pertaining to charges that 
Hubbell billed the Rose Law Firm for personal expenses and that some of those 
expenses were charged to the Resolution Trust Corp. in connection with work 
that the law firm did for the RTC after Madison Guaranty was seized in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A close friend as well as a former law partner of Mrs. Clinton, Hubbell 
resigned from the Justice Department after these allegations became public. 
Similarly, allegations related to Whitewater have been responsible for the 
resignations of White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Roger C. Altman. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker is a Democrat who succeeded Clinton as governor in January, 1993. He 
won reelection on Nov. 8 despite indications that he was on the brink of 
indictment. It is ironic that Tucker has been drawn into the Whitewater 
controversy since he and Clinton have never been close political allies. 
</P>
<P>
 As a private citizen, Tucker obtained a number of loans from Madison Guaranty 
that were never repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 As of earlier this week, none of the suspects on Starr's list of potential 
defendants had been notified of impending indictments, according to their 
lawyers and other sources.

TRADE PACT WINS DOLE'S SUPPORT; CONGRESS: SENATE GOP LEADER'S BACKING GIVES 
GATT AGREEMENT A MAJOR BOOST. HE IS SWAYED BY WHITE HOUSE PLEDGE TO CREATE A 
PANEL TO MONITOR THE ACCORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) on Wednesday threw his support behind 
the proposed new international trade agreement, giving a major and perhaps 
decisive boost to the 124-nation pact as it heads for a congressional vote next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in the White House Rose Garden beside President Clinton, Dole said 
the Administration's pledge to add safeguards to protect U.S. sovereignty had 
helped lay to rest his concerns about the landmark tariff-lowering agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've agreed with the President that we've fixed this about as much as we 
can," said Dole, who has been under tremendous pressure from opponents and 
supporters of the pact. He urged colleagues to give a "big, big vote" in 
support of the accord, which will create a World Trade Organization to replace 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as the regime that governs world 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 After days of tense negotiations with Dole, the Administration agreed to 
support creation of a five-judge panel to review the way trade disputes are 
resolved under the pact. If the panel finds that decisions by the World Trade 
Organization exceed the pact's authority, members of Congress may begin a 
process that could lead to U.S. withdrawal from the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they will push legislation to create the panel 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, including former presidential candidates Ross Perot and Patrick J. 
Buchanan, have charged that the organization could rule arbitrarily that U.S. 
labor, safety or environmental laws represent trade barriers that should be 
dismantled or offset with sanctions against exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years in the making, the agreement is the biggest trade treaty of all 
time. It would institute significant reductions in tariffs and would for the 
first time bring many parts of the economy under international regulation, 
including service industries such as financial firms and entertainment 
products. The White House has said the accord will increase U.S. economic 
output by $100 billion to $200 billion a year and that it would save the 
average American family $1,000 a year by cutting import costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole dropped his insistence that the Administration remove potential obstacles 
to a capital gains tax cut before he would support the trade accord, but he did 
win a promise from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to give a full hearing to 
that and other Republican proposals to increase investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did the best I could," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact's supporters believe that they have the votes to win in the House, 
where a vote is scheduled for Tuesday. But the outcome in the Senate, which 
plans to vote Thursday, is more problematic, in part because 60 votes will be 
needed to waive deficit-reduction rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the reduction of tariffs would cut U.S. government revenues by $40 
billion over 10 years and could cause the federal budget deficit to widen, 
Congress must either approve a waiver or offset the revenue shortfall with 
spending cuts or tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials estimated that Dole's backing could influence an 
additional six to 12 Senate votes. The additional "aye" votes could include 
Democrats who are nervous about voting with the weakened President and want the 
political cover offered by Dole's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big, big plus," said one Administration official. Sen. Bob Packwood 
(R-Ore.), went even further, predicting during the Rose Garden appearance that 
"this is going to pass overwhelmingly because of Bob Dole." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Tuesday, Administration vote-counters said they believed that 
there might be two dozen senators still undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's concern about Perot's supporters was clear in his Rose Garden 
appearance. He noted that he was getting 2,000 phone calls a day on the trade 
issue and that Perot himself led a large rally against the agreement in 
Wichita, Kan., on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plans for a five-judge panel "should satisfy the concerns, I think, of 
Perot and all the others out there," said Dole, who is expected to become 
Senate majority leader in January and may run for President in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade accord was once expected to pass easily. But Clinton's recent 
political weakness and the unexpected strength of the pact's protectionist 
opponents has thrown the outcome into doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 In the negotiations, Dole was also trying to get the Administration to raise 
the federal regulatory fees on three companies that would benefit from the new 
trade regime. Those companies have been licensed by the United States to 
develop the next generation of telephone service, which has the potential for 
worldwide application and profits. But Dole did not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have argued that the trade agreement will give full 
protections to U.S. sovereignty through provisions that allow any country to 
withdraw with six months' notice. But U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
said Wednesday that the judicial panel will be a valuable extra step. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in the Rose Garden, Clinton said the pact would benefit Americans 
disproportionately because U.S. trade barriers are already lower than those of 
most countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement requires all trading nations to play by the same rules and, 
since the United States already has the most productive and competitive 
economy, that is good news for our workers and our future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered "deep thanks" to Dole for joining the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's appearance with Clinton was also a notable political gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders have been firing partisan salvos at the White House since 
the Nov. 8 election. But they have also been under pressure to show 
bipartisanship, in part to blunt criticism that their foremost legislative goal 
is to stop the initiatives of the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they believe that creation of the judicial review panel 
could bring complaints from foreign nations that the United States is not fully 
willing to abide by the decisions of the new trade organization. But White 
House officials insisted that most foreign governments will understand that 
creation of the panel is necessary to build crucial domestic political support 
for the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Dole's support, the White House plans various events next week to 
press for its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the White House will bring together officials from past 
administrations. More on GATT

SECRET OPERATION SAFEGUARDED URANIUM; KAZAKHSTAN: U.S. WORKED FOR MONTHS TO 
ARRANGE TRANSFER. CLINTON CALLS IT A MAJOR NON-PROLIFERATION SUCCESS. 
</P>

 Kazakhstan's decision to transfer half a ton of weapons-grade uranium to the 
United States involved months of top-secret negotiations, assembly of a 
garage-size processing facility in remote Ulba and a clandestine airlift, U.S. 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the operation, which was designed to prevent the uranium from 
falling into the hands of rogue Third World governments, were revealed 
Wednesday, a day after U.S. officials disclosed that they had succeeded in 
bringing the material to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 1,000 pounds of highly enriched fuel, which the officials said 
was enough to manufacture 20 to 36 nuclear bombs or warheads, was left over 
from Kazakhstan's days as a Soviet republic and was poorly stored and 
vulnerable to smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a nine-month period, U.S. technicians tested and dehydrated the uranium, 
packaged it in special containers and flew it to the Energy Department's 
facility at Oak Ridge, Tenn., for reprocessing into commercial-grade fuel that 
no longer will be usable for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton on Wednesday called the operation a major success for the 
Administration's counter-proliferation efforts. "One more threat of nuclear 
terrorism and proliferation has been removed from the world," he said. "Today, 
this is a good day." 
</P>
<P>
 The story, as told by senior U.S. officials at a news conference, began early 
this year, when Kazakh President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev personally brought the 
uranium cache to U.S. attention, asking for help in safeguarding and disposing 
of the unneeded material. 
</P>
<P>
 The uranium had been used by a Soviet metallurgical facility that had used it 
to produce fuel for nuclear warships. Kazakhstan no longer had any need for the 
material and had no way of keeping it properly stored and secure from possible 
pilferage. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several months, U.S. officials entered into detailed 
negotiations with the Kazakhs, bringing in the Russians to make sure they were 
aware of the pending arrangement and had no serious objections. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Russian side of the deal was worked out by a bilateral commission 
headed by Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin. By June, the Russians were fully on board. The United States and 
Kazakhstan finally could go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of the arrangement were simple enough: U.S. technicians would 
extract uranium from the cache and send it to Oak Ridge for reprocessing. The 
entire process would be overseen by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oak Ridge, technicians began preparing for the venture. Scientists built a 
garage-size processing facility in Tennessee, tested it and took it apart again 
for reassembly at the Ulba plant in Kazakhstan. Security drills were conducted 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 In early October, a team of 31 Americans -- from the Pentagon, State 
Department and Martin-Marietta Corp., the prime contractor at Oak Ridge -- 
traveled to Kazakhstan for a six-week operation designed to bring the uranium 
to the United States safely. 
</P>
<P>
 The job was a complex one. The material was scattered in several different 
batches and in different forms. It had to be prepared carefully for removal, 
dried and baked so that it could be packaged in cans. 
</P>
<P>
 The process included opening 1,050 Soviet-era containers of highly enriched 
uranium. The material was repackaged in 456 special U.S.-made containers and 
loaded on U.S. military planes. The radioactive uranium required special 
handling so the technicians would not be contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the technical side was only part of the job. Because of the threat of 
pilferage or smuggling, the team had to operate under top-secret security 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The team worked 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, late Sunday morning, the first section of the uranium deposits was 
loaded aboard a U.S. Air Force C-5A cargo plane and flown to Dover Air Force 
Base in Delaware on the first leg of the mission. Two other planes followed, 
each about 12 hours apart. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dover, the containers were placed on trucks and hauled in convoys to Oak 
Ridge under heavy security. The final shipment arrived early Wednesday morning. 
Television networks, which became aware of the story Tuesday, were asked to 
hold it off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Administration, the transfer of the former Soviet uranium stockpile 
marked something of a diplomatic coup -- precisely what it had been trying to 
accomplish. Iran already has tried to buy Kazakhstan's uranium, and other 
countries had expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence agencies have pointed to a growing number of Third World 
countries -- from Iran to North Korea -- that either have nuclear weapons 
programs or are trying to buy bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has been engaged in a multi-pronged effort to rein 
in nuclear proliferation, both through traditional diplomatic efforts and by 
providing U.S. technical and financial aid to keep nuclear materials under 
closer scrutiny. However, the transfer deal involving Kazakhstan is the first 
of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kazakhstan, the move meant new recognition around the globe and several 
hundred million dollars in compensation from the United States. (U.S. officials 
are refusing to make public the amount for fear of setting a "floor" for other 
negotiations that may come up.) 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, news of the uranium transfer brought protests from some 
conservatives, who argued that former Soviet nuclear stocks should by rights 
belong to Russia and that the Kremlin should control their disposal more 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the weaponry in the Soviet Union was made by Russians," said Valery 
Davydov, an expert on nuclear non-proliferation at the USA-Canada Institute, a 
prestigious Russian think tank. "The Kazakhs could never create nukes by 
themselves -- that's clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Davydov warned that the Kazakhstan deal would "give a very strong card to the 
opposition in Russia. They will yell that Russia's national security is on 
sale, without Russia's control." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Russian government stuck by the agreement Wednesday, and there was 
little doubt that the Clinton Administration considered it a red-letter day. 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry said that the United States did not yet have 
any other takers for such a transfer of nuclear material. But he left the door 
open.

AGENCY'S RIGHT TO SEIZE SOKA LAND IS BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major legal victory for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a judge 
on Wednesday ruled that the agency has the authority to use eminent domain to 
seize Soka University's scenic Calabasas campus for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-hour hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court, Judge Barnet Cooperman 
said it was "only common sense" to interpret state law as giving the 
conservancy the power to condemn private property for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 That question has been at the center of the 2-year-old legal battle between 
the conservancy and Soka over the school's campus at the corner of Las Virgenes 
Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston 
slapped high-fives with jubilant staff members. He called Cooperman's decision 
an "important threshold" in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said: "I think there are a lot of steps to go. It 
would be a good bet that case will not be settled one way or another much 
before 1998." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a considerable step forward for the conservancy, Wednesday's decision 
by no means assures the university will fall into public hands. Although 
Cooperman said the conservancy has the legal power to condemn the land, he has 
yet to rule on whether it may. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, lawyers will return to court Dec. 8 to argue other issues relating to 
the conservancy's right to take Soka's land. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy -- a state agency that acquires parkland -- is trying to seize 
245 of Soka's 662 acres for use as a visitors center for the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, on the other hand, wants to expand its 200-student language school into 
a liberal arts college enrolling 3,500 students at the site, which includes the 
former ranch of razor magnate King Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cooperman, who retires from the bench in December, ultimately rules that 
the conservancy can take Soka's land, then a jury will decide how much the 
school should be compensated for its property. 
</P>
<P>
 That process, too, is fraught with difficulties. If the jury values Soka's 
property at more than the conservancy is prepared to pay -- roughly $20 million 
-- then the school has threatened to sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the conservancy succeeds in condemning the piece of Soka's property it 
wants, the school would retain the right to seek development permits for the 
remainder of its property. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the ultimate price of the property may be so high that the 
conservancy will be forced to sell off other pieces of parkland for development 
or allow ongoing acquisitions -- such as the Canyon Oaks deal in Topanga Canyon 
-- to fall apart in order to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the conservancy can afford the ultimate price of the 245 acres it 
wants, Soka lawyers have threatened to sue to force the agency to purchase the 
entire 662 acres. Doing so would drive the entire parcel out of the 
conservancy's price range. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree it is unlikely that the final outcome of the battle will be 
decided by the trial courts. Both sides acknowledged that the Court of Appeal 
and the California Supreme Court -- possibly even the U.S. Supreme Court -- 
will be the final arbiters of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the case has made one trip through the state Court of Appeal, which 
overturned a Ventura County judge who ruled in 1993 on many of the same issues 
decided Wednesday by Cooperman. In that case, Judge Barbara Lane ruled in favor 
of Soka. 
</P>
<P>
 Her decision was overturned on technical grounds earlier this year by the 
Court of Appeal. When the case comes back before the appellate court, justices 
will be asked to rule on the merits of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Tuesday morning, the conservancy and Soka had hoped to avoid the 
costly legal fight that lies ahead -- a fight that will cost the public 
millions of dollars regardless of which side wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a tentative settlement agreement between the two, Soka would have sold 
to the conservancy much of the land it is seeking to condemn -- including the 
historic Gillette mansion and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, in turn, would have built a scaled-down campus of 2,500 students on the 
eastern part of the property. The deal would have taken effect only after the 
school's plans were approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But faced with intense criticism from a coalition of homeowners, 
environmentalists and elected officials, the conservancy board early Tuesday 
rejected the settlement offer and vowed to press ahead with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 One community activist at the meeting compared the board's action to Adm. 
David Farragut's famous charge through the log booms guarding the Mississippi 
River in which he cried to his hesitating ships: "Damn the torpedoes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials have wanted to obtain Soka's property since the 1970s. The 
school rejected an offer to buy the property in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Soka have argued since the condemnation lawsuit was filed in 
December, 1992, that the conservancy acted improperly when it obtained 
permission from the Ventura County Board of Supervisors to proceed with the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka's land is entirely within Los Angeles County, but approval from the 
Ventura County board was required because the lawsuit is technically being 
pursued by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority -- a joint 
powers arrangement among the conservancy and two Ventura County parks agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyer Hodge Dolle argued that the conservancy should have received 
permission from the state Board of Public Works, which oversees most 
condemnation actions for state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 While conservancy lawyer Robert McMurry conceded that the Board of Public 
Works is one of the avenues the conservancy can use to condemn land, it also 
has the absolute power of eminent domain. Other agencies with such power 
include Caltrans and the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the only common sense construction the court can make," Cooperman 
said in ruling for the conservancy Wednesday. He added that if state lawmakers 
had not intended the conservancy to have the power of condemnation "it would 
have been simple to do so."

BOY WHOSE PARENTS FEARED DEPORTATION HAD LEUKEMIA; HEALTH CARE: MEDICAL 
OFFICIALS SAY IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER EARLIER TREATMENT COULD HAVE SAVED JULIO 
CANO. HIS DEATH IGNITES FURTHER DEBATE ABOUT PROP. 187'S EFFECTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Julio Cano, the 12-year-old boy whose parents said they delayed seeking 
medical treatment because they were afraid of being deported, had acute 
leukemia, Orange County coroner's officials revealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources working on the case said preliminary tests indicated 
that his body, in a weakened state because of the leukemia, may have been 
wracked with a bacterial infection that led to heart failure Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials are awaiting the results of further tests before issuing 
an official cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it remained unclear whether the youngster could have been saved by 
earlier medical intervention, his death unleashed new political charges as 
those on both sides of the Proposition 187 debate reopened pre-election wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's parents, illegal immigrants from Mexico, say they were afraid to take 
the Sycamore Junior High School student to the hospital because they feared 
being asked about their immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 187, which faces multiple court challenges, takes effect, it 
would bar illegal immigrants from receiving publicly funded education, 
non-emergency health care and most other public services. It also would require 
teachers and health care workers to report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 While Proposition 187 proponents suggested Wednesday that Julio's case was 
being exploited for political purposes, the account of events leading up to the 
boy's death highlights the difficulty faced by parents, particularly illegal 
immigrants and the poor, in deciding when to take a child to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio went to school Nov. 15, but early in the day complained of feeling ill 
and had to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to a health clerk (at the school) twice, but he had no fever at all," 
said Pat Savage, the school principal. "He would not tell anybody what was 
wrong because he knew that his parents didn't have the money to take him to the 
doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's father said he and his wife considered taking their son to a hospital, 
but had been denied non-emergency care before and believed that with the 
passage of Proposition 187 they might be reported to authorities as illegal 
immigrants. The couple were unaware that a temporary restraining order has 
blocked implementation of most provisions of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's father said he waited until Friday to take his son to the doctor 
because that is payday at the factory where he works. When he got the $60 he 
needed, he took the day off work. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they have no car, the family walked to the Family Medical Clinic at 4 
p.m. Friday. The tiny clinic is only a block from the family's apartment and 
Julio's mother said she had gone there once before for a pregnancy test. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, physician N. Radd Radparvar said he treated the boy for 
constipation and rectal pain. 
</P>
<P>
 A general practitioner, Radparvar said he administered a "small enema" and 
gave the boy an antibiotic -- Cephalexin -- and vitamins. He said he instructed 
the family to "rush" the youngster to an emergency room if his condition did 
not improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to elaborate Wednesday, Radparvar said he took a urine sample, which 
contained leukocytes and blood, signs that "there is something wrong, possibly 
a kidney infection." Leukocytes are the white cells in blood, lymph and tissue 
that help the body fight infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Radparvar said he did not prescribe the medication, but gave it to the family 
because he knew they had little money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did our best," he said. "I am proud of myself. They have more than $30 in 
vitamins and antibiotics because I knew that the baby was really weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else could I do? We did an enema. . . . When he left I asked him, 'How 
do you feel?' He left in better condition. What do you want? 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother and father, they were grateful," Radparvar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's father said Wednesday the doctor never told him to monitor his son's 
condition and never mentioned taking him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 After the parents brought the boy home Friday and gave him an antibiotic, the 
father said, Julio was "up all night going to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was going to work at 5 a.m. on Saturday, he had just come out of the 
bathroom. I asked him, 'How do you feel?' and he said he felt well," the father 
said. "So I went to work." 
</P>
<P>
 He phoned home during a work break at 8:30 a.m. and his wife told him that 
their son's condition had worsened, said the father, who asked that his name 
not be used because of his immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother left the house shortly thereafter to get the boy a drink from a 
store. When she returned, he could not speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "His jaw was very tight. He couldn't open his mouth," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother contacted a neighbor, who promptly called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters arrived at the home shortly after 9 a.m., Joe Gutierrez, an 
Anaheim Fire Department captain and paramedic, said Julio was not breathing and 
his heart had ceased beating. 
</P>
<P>
 After paramedics attempted unsuccessfully to revive him, the youngster was 
taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital, where further attempts at resuscitation 
continued until roughly 10 a.m., Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said he learned from a friend of the family at the hospital that 
Julio's father was behind on rent payments and had been working weekends to 
make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said he sensed that the father was blaming himself. "He shared with 
me that his son had gotten sick on Tuesday and (the family) did not want to 
take him to a clinic for fear of 187. . . . He waited until Friday to take him 
to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I think you and your wife did everything you could.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the passage of Proposition 187, the parents were unsure where to 
seek medical care, they said. Julio and the couple's other two eldest children 
carried Medi-Cal cards covering only emergency and pregnancy-related services. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother and father said Tuesday that a daughter had been denied care at a 
Garden Grove hospital once because her condition was not deemed an emergency, 
and the mother said she went to UC Irvine Medical Center seeking a free 
pregnancy test once and was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Julio's death, Los Amigos of Orange County, a Latino 
activist group, Wednesday urged Latinos statewide to boycott work, school and 
merchants Dec. 12 in protest of Proposition 187's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Wednesday, members of Los Amigos clasped hands and bowed their 
heads in remembrance of Julio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to convey to the family that has lost this little boy that there are 
many people who care," said Galal Kernahan, who led a prayer. "And we ask help 
for us to be open and appreciative of the differences of others." 
</P>
<P>
 Amin David, leader of Los Amigos , said a diagnosis of acute leukemia possibly 
could have been made if the family had sought medical care earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could somebody have diagnosed that, is a question that I ask," he said. "We 
think that hospital tests would have brought it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in childhood leukemia offered mixed views on whether the youngster 
could have been saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alexis Thompson, an assistant professor in pediatric hematology-oncology 
at the UCLA School of Medicine, said it would depend on what type of acute 
leukemia the child had. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a child with an aggressive infection could be overwhelmed by it 
before adequate chemotherapy could be administered. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stuart Siegel, head of the division of hematology-oncology at Childrens 
Hospital in Los Angeles, said that even if the disease is diagnosed late, there 
often is a "significant chance" of successful treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A family friend expressed disbelief at Julio's diagnosis, saying the family 
had no clue that the boy had a terminal illness. "The boy looked healthy," said 
Belinda Castro Palomino, a church member who was acting as the family's 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 proponents denounced efforts to link the ballot measure to the 
boy's death. They criticized Latino activists for using a tragic situation for 
political ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we are sad for the family," said Barbara Coe, a founding member of 
the Proposition 187 movement. "But the anti-187 people will do whatever is 
necessary to get this measure defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly deceitful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Prince, who headed the pro-187 "Save Our State" campaign, said he did not 
want to comment about the parents in the Cano case specifically, since all the 
details were not available. But he added that, in general, any responsibility 
for illness of children lies with their parents and with the foes of the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are endangering the children by bringing them here illegally," 
Prince said. "That's the primary responsibility of the parent -- they are not 
absolved of their parental responsibility simply because of their other illegal 
acts." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the subject during a national television interview, Gov. Pete 
Wilson brushed aside the Orange County case and said the ballot measure will 
ensure more medical services for legal residents of California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will get all kinds of stories of that sort, I suppose," said Wilson, in 
reply to a question posed on "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
 "But what we're also hearing from emergency room physicians is that some felt 
that because of the tremendous burden placed upon them by illegal immigrants 
able to claim under the law certain emergency care, that they were compelled to 
cut back on services to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to say we are having to put our own needs first," Wilson continued, 
" . . . when you cannot provide services, when you're shortchanging the 
education of legal residents, the health care of legal residents, because the 
federal government has failed to do its job and then has compounded that 
failure by sticking the states with the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's parents moved to Orange County from Acapulco four years ago. Julio and 
the couple's other older children, ages 13 and 11, were born in Mexico and 
joined their parents here only three years ago. They are all undocumented, the 
father said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's youngest children, ages 1 month and 1 year, were born in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As Julio's father this week flipped through a photo album that contained 
awards from teachers commending his son's work, he said, "Julio was the 
brightest one of the whole house. He spoke the best English. He was very 
dedicated to his studies. He wanted a degree so he could be a lawyer."

SMOOTH FLYING; SOUTHLAND AIRPORTS EASILY HANDLE CRUSH OF TRAVELERS ON BUSIEST 
DAY OF YEAR

 On Wednesday, the busiest travel day of the year, the stuff of cold sweats, of 
legendary fear and loathing, of wondering whether a dried-out turkey dinner at 
grandma's is really worth the hassle, skycap Marlon Shotlow stood next to a 
half-empty luggage cart, looking downright bored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought today would be outrageous," he said. "But it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he made the most important of observations, a rarely used phrase in the 
airport lexicon: "Everyone's in a good mood!" 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at airports from John Wayne to Charles Lindbergh, from Los Angeles 
International to Ontario International, the crush of Thanksgiving holiday 
travelers proved more lamb than lion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear the horror stories of traveling through LAX, but when you go out and 
walk around, it's just not there," said airport spokeswoman Diane Scully. "Yes, 
it's busy -- but the traffic is moving." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, John Wayne Airport spokeswoman Pat Ware said, "Everything's 
been going at a very brisk pace, but it's also been very smooth." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few emergencies among the 25,000 travelers passing through occurred 
when three passengers panicked after discovering that they had lost their 
tickets. In each case, airport security officers found the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials said that Wednesday's shipment of families and baggage to 
far-flung destinations was relatively trouble-free because travelers generally 
heeded their advice to leave early and take shuttle vans or public 
transportation to airports. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of time management coupled with good weather nationwide kept 20,000 
airline flights moving smoothly on Thanksgiving eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, parking lots at suburban flyaway shuttle lots filled up early 
Wednesday, leaving parking spaces available at the airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-bound Mary Pasquini called from her Granada Hills home about 5:15 a.m. 
Wednesday to check on parking at a Van Nuys park-and-ride lot so she and her 
family could take the express bus to Los Angeles International. They learned 
that it was full, so they left their car at home and took a cab to catch their 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the nation's third-busiest airport, the 22,000 parking spaces have not 
been filled to capacity in several years, Scully said. And there probably would 
be spaces available all weekend for those daring to drive to the airport via 
gridlocked freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic at Burbank Airport was more manageable than ever, said spokesman 
Victor Gill, thanks to added parking spaces and widened traffic lanes in front 
of the terminal. "If anything, we've gotten our act firmly refined," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the terminals -- including those in Los Angeles, with more than 
125,000 passengers seeking seats on 1,000 planes Wednesday, or at Burbank, with 
about 15,000 passengers boarding 185 departing flights -- the patience of 
passengers did not appear to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Air traffic moved smoothly Wednesday, said FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell. Only 
in Alaska, where snow slowed operations at Anchorage and Fairbanks airports, 
was weather a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What affects operations is weather, and we've got excellent weather virtually 
everywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So appetites were whetted for a good weekend. Eighteen-year-old Anne Graybeal, 
a Pomona College student, was preparing to fly from Ontario to mom and dad in 
Chatham, N.J., for her first home-cooked meal since August. "I'm going to let 
them pamper me for four days," she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away, chomping on a pizza, the college's dean of students, Ann 
Quinley, was looking forward to visiting her 86-year-old father in Knoxville, 
Tenn. -- and enjoying a turkey filled with corn bread pecan stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sid and Mae Shapiro were waiting for their flight to Sacramento, where their 
daughter-in-law was going to prepare her first turkey for them. 
</P>
<P>
 There were occasional annoyances, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul and Maryhelen Fisher left Palm Desert for Ontario International in plenty 
of time to catch their 1 p.m. flight to Reno -- only to discover that their 
flight had been inexplicably changed to 11 a.m. Paul Fisher cooled his heels by 
thumbing through a book titled "Foreign Investments and International Law" and 
promised to call the airline president next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, there's another flight," he said. "But I've got to wonder, why are 
we leaving town? We live on a golf course." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the people leaving town, an equal number were arriving in Southern 
California for the long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Kailukaitis was in Southern California on business, so he beckoned his 
wife and two kids from Dallas to join him for skiing at Big Bear. The family 
figures on eating out tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Carol Hough arrived at Ontario from Santa Cruz, and loaded their 
rental car with sports tools for a tennis weekend in Palm Desert. They too will 
eat out tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gene Bloch and his daughter, Vicki, arrived from San Francisco to join his 
parents for a weekend of boating on Lake Mojave, along the Colorado River north 
of Laughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom's going to cook? Think again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take our 22-footer downriver 25 miles," said Nancy Bloch. "We've 
already got reservations at Katherine's Landing." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport workers who will be at their posts today will still enjoy Thanksgiving 
feasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Taylor, working at a rental car counter at Ontario Airport, has 
assigned her husband, Michael, to do the cooking while she handles today's 
demands for vans and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm going to have to call him every half an hour to remind him to baste 
the turkey," she said. "Otherwise, he'll just sit there and watch football and 
forget."

COURT UPHOLDS BREATH TEST FOR DRUNK DRIVERS; LAWS: STATE JUSTICES REJECT 
CHALLENGES BASED ON THE ARGUMENT THAT THE EXAMS DON'T ACCURATELY REFLECT 
BLOOD-ALCOHOL LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ushering in the holidays with a warning to drunk drivers, the California 
Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that breath tests can be used to establish 
intoxication even though they may not reflect the amount of alcohol in the 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, in a 6-1 decision, held that a 1990 law passed by the Legislature 
makes it illegal to drive with a specified level of alcohol either in the blood 
or in the breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the law, prosecutors had to prove a blood-alcohol concentration of 
0.08%. Suspects who took the breath test could challenge the state formula for 
converting breath measurements to blood levels. Now the conversion process will 
be irrelevant in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Stanley Mosk, who wrote the majority decision, said the court's 
interpretation of the law "promotes the state's interest in reducing the danger 
to the public caused by those who drink and drive." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will increase the likelihood of convicting such a driver," Mosk wrote, 
"because the prosecution need not prove actual impairment." 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers who are suspected of drunk driving are allowed to choose a urine, 
breath or blood test. But the formula used to convert urine and breath readings 
to blood measurements may not be accurate for all individuals. Body 
temperature, gender, medical conditions and other factors can influence the 
measurements. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephan Van Decker, an Imperial County deputy public defender who represented 
two Brawley motorists in the case before the court, said the blood test is the 
most accurate measure, followed by breath and urine measurements. Most suspects 
choose the breath test because it can be administered on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Joyce Kennard, in a dissenting opinion, complained that the majority 
created a new crime of "driving with alcohol in the breath." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, Donald E. Bransford and Ralph Maldonado, were arrested in 
separate incidents in 1991 after breath tests detected excessive amounts of 
alcohol in their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not allowed to challenge the reliability of the conversion formula 
in court because judges interpreted the new state law as requiring only 
evidence of alcohol in the breath, not the blood, for conviction. A Court of 
Appeal upheld their convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Decker, who defended them, said defendants will still be able to challenge 
urine test results. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means people are being treated differently depending on which test they 
take," Van Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Atty. Gen. Patti W. Ranger said the breath test works to the 
suspect's detriment in only 2% of the cases. Most of the time, she said, it 
underestimates the level of alcohol in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially for the holiday season," she said, "I think this decision will 
greatly help our fight against the intoxicated driver."

JUANENOS' FORMER TRIBAL LEADER LOSES EFFORT TO HALT VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A faction of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians that is embroiled in a 
leadership struggle was handed a defeat Wednesday when an Orange County 
Superior Court judge denied an injunction sought by an ousted tribal leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In denying the action brought by David Belardes, the former leader at the 
center of the controversy, Judge James R. Ross said he did not find that 
Belardes' argument "had met the burden to merit any action." 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes had sought the injunction to stop the Juaneno Band from holding 
elections Dec. 17 for new tribal council members. 
</P>
<P>
 The split within the Juaneno Band, one of the Southland's oldest Native 
American groups, has imperiled its longstanding hope of achieving federal 
recognition as a tribe, according to both factions in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos are also under pressure to prepare for a visit early next year by 
representatives of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, one of the steps 
toward tribal recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross' ruling, which set a trial on the leadership dispute for next April, now 
allows the tribal council elections to be held. 
</P>
<P>
 But Belardes said in a telephone interview that he will refuse to participate 
in the elections, even though he was nominated to the tribal council. Belardes 
said he believes he was duly elected as tribal chairman in 1993. The opposing 
faction says that election was void because it was a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the tribal council and we're still in place, and what's going to happen 
is we're going to have two tribal councils," Belardes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Horgan, an attorney for Sonia Johnston, who was named official tribal 
spokeswoman after Belardes' recent ouster, said he and his client hope the 
Juanenos can reach a resolution before there is a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With both sides claiming power, the group's quest for federal recognition from 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs may be in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes, 47, a longtime tribal spokesman, has continued to speak for the 
Juaneno Band, although he was recently ousted in a vote of the band's general 
council. The rift had escalated to the point where Belardes, who had refused to 
step down, hired a security guard to prevent members of Johnston's faction from 
attending a Sept. 17 general council meeting at the San Juan Capistrano 
Mission.

DEATH TOLL FROM STORM IN HAITI NOW AT 829 AND EXPECTED TO RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The official death toll from Tropical Storm Gordon rose Wednesday to 829, but 
the government cautioned that the final count could go much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some regions the dead have not yet been counted," Agriculture Minister 
Francois Severin said as he released the latest government report on the Nov. 
13 destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds more Haitians were hurt and 10,000 to 15,000 left homeless when 
torrential rains created flash floods and landslides, washing away shanties in 
the capital and along Haiti's southern peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon's destruction here far outpaced that in Jamaica, Cuba, Florida or the 
Carolinas. Severin blamed the severity of the destruction on heavy erosion 
along Haiti's hillsides, many of them crammed with shacks built on weak 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning and building codes are not enforced, and there is no river flood 
control. Poor communications prevented most Haitians from hearing storm 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 With crops destroyed, roads and bridges washed away, and unburied bodies 
contaminating the drinking water, the survivors are vulnerable to hunger and 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, in a coordinated effort with non-governmental agencies and 
international donors, provided about $3.2 million in emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The destruction is among the worst here since Hurricane Allen killed at least 
1,000 Haitians in 1980.

AMERICAN ALBUM: CITY USES 'INTERVENERS' TO THWART PANHANDLERS; EVANSTON, ILL., 
HIRES PAIR TO WALK THE STREETS AND REMIND DONORS THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES TO 
HANDOUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Melvin Smith sees someone doling out cash to a beggar on the streets of 
this college town, he dips into his pocket too. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a handout to deliver -- to the donor. It is a little red card, advising 
that next time, "for your safety, security and panhandling-free shopping 
comfort," it would be smarter to keep the coins. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be much better spent, the card suggests, on contributions to 
an established social-service organization. A list of local programs, from 
church meals for the needy to mental health treatment, is included. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're professional con artists," Smith said of the mendicants dotting the 
sidewalks. At 77, wearing thick bifocals and a Senegalese cap, he is an 
Evanston institution. The retired publisher of a community newspaper, actively 
involved in black community issues, he now earns $7 an hour for a job that 
includes getting out this message: "Just say no." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the odometer dangling from his belt, he walks 15 to 20 miles a 
day. He never interferes with a transaction. He never talks to the panhandlers. 
He carries a cellular telephone in case he needs to summon help. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming face to face with a panhandler has become a universal experience in 
many U.S. cities and inner suburbs like Evanston, population 73,000, just north 
of Chicago. So is the crisis of conscience that nearly always results, 
especially in affluent places like this where a gourmet cup of coffee can cost 
more than $2 and galleries sell $50 picture frames. 
</P>
<P>
 People who can afford such luxuries wonder if they should buy them while 
someone in front of them starves; but then they wonder too if their money will 
go for cheap wine or drugs rather than shelter or food. 
</P>
<P>
 In other places, police have swept beggars away from business districts; city 
councils have passed laws against "aggressive" panhandling; storekeepers have 
taken it upon themselves to scream at street people to move away from their 
doors; others have distributed vouchers for food at missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Evanston merchants considered all those options when it became clear 
last year that the panhandler population had grown and was apt to keep growing. 
"It's pretty hard to advertise or market if shoppers feel the environment is 
intimidating," said Terry Jenkins, executive director of EVmark, which manages 
the business district with $250,000 a year in special-assessment money 
collected by the city from property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, he said, investigated about 30 panhandlers and found that nearly all 
had homes, arrest records and substance-abuse problems. The best of them were 
taking in up to $200, tax-free, each day. 
</P>
<P>
 A city task force decided "to try an innovative approach that still maintains 
compassion and dignity," said Adam Rod, manager of business relations for the 
Evanston Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins hired Smith and another "intervener" for a one-year experiment. 
Panhandling in the business district, he said, has been cut in half since 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prince of Peace, as one panhandler identifies himself, is not pleased. In 
a dirty jacket that may have once been tweed, his hair and beard long and 
unkempt, the Prince clutches a shopping bag by its fraying handles and lurks in 
a bookstore doorway, collecting what he can. When he spies Smith, he hurries 
across the street. He will return hours later, once the coast is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner, on a bench, a 31-year-old man with a red knit cap, Army 
jacket and corduroy pants, holds out a paper cup and rattles its contents: 
$1.45 in coins. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he's been trying for two hours to drum up $12 for a room because the 
local shelter has a two-week limit. He's been trying to get a job for two 
years, he adds, having come up from Chicago to get away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 He grunts angrily at mention of Smith. "You mean the guy in the African hat?" 
That's the only work, he says, he would reject. "I would try to help, not turn 
against anybody out here that's trying to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Local social-service agencies report that they have seen no significant 
increase in contributions since the red cards began circulating. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Smith has his doubts. He refused to sit on the task force because he 
didn't like the racial overtones -- many of the panhandlers are black. Besides, 
he added, "panhandlers are the Frankenstein of our society. We created them. We 
had industry here, and those jobs are gone." 
</P>
<P>
 So he keeps on, hurrying up to a Taiwanese mechanical engineer he overhears in 
a vitamin shop. "If I have big change, I give it," said Terence Tay-Jiam Liu. 
"One man I gave money to . . . said: 'Oh, it's not enough.' So I give him 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith digs out a red card. "We encourage you not to give to panhandlers," the 
older man said. "You know the government gives them help. They live in better 
homes than I've got." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," Liu said. "Oh, OK."

KOHL STRESSES 'LEAN STATE,' INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY; GERMANY: HE HOPES TO 
SHRINK THE BUREAUCRACY, GET PEOPLE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR OWN WELL-BEING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first general policy speech to Parliament since winning reelection in 
October, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that his goals for the next four years 
include pruning the German bureaucracy, putting the nation's hard-core 
unemployed back to work and encouraging coddled citizens to take greater 
responsibility for their own well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many in our country expect too much from the state and are not willing enough 
to share the responsibility," Kohl said, adding that he also intends to reduce 
state spending, shrink welfare payments and find ways of cutting the benefits 
given to public-assistance recipients who refuse to take low-paying but 
suitable jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the 'lean state,' " Kohl said, repeating a slogan originally aired 
last week, when the leaders of his three-party coalition unveiled their working 
agenda. "This lean state gives more freedom to the individual, but also 
requires more responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl was reelected only narrowly last month, in balloting that shrank his 
coalition's majority to 10 seats from 134 in the 672-member Bundestag, or lower 
house of Parliament. Although the German business community has been crying out 
for precisely the sort of bureaucratic slimming Kohl described Wednesday, the 
veteran chancellor is likely to run into tough opposition from the center-left 
Social Democratic Party when he tries to implement his goals in specific 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Democrats emerged from the last election strong in the Bundesrat, 
or upper house of Parliament, which has the authority to block legislation on 
fiscal policy and other central matters. Social Democratic Party leader Rudolf 
Scharping was quick to denounce Kohl's program Wednesday as "lacking in 
substance." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will fight these policies with all our strength," pledged Scharping, whose 
complaints were backed up by the left-leaning Greens, who also gained strength 
in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kohl's 'coalition of fear' has no answers to our looming questions," charged 
Greens spokesman Joschka Fischer. The Greens and Social Democrats hope to work 
together in the coming months to crack Kohl's coalition before the chancellor 
can finish his four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, which was designed to show that he still has fresh ideas even 
after 12 years as chancellor, Kohl said he would soon meet with business and 
labor leaders to try to come up with specific ways of addressing the German 
economy's inability to create jobs. His immediate ideas, he said, include 
channeling young people away from academic programs and into professional 
training programs, promoting part-time employment and increasing the 
"flexibility" of the German work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The German labor market is notorious for being overpaid and underworked, 
compared to the countries with which it must now compete. German labor is among 
the most expensive in the world, the workweek is relatively short and firing 
people is costly and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil servants in particular are hard to lay off, but Kohl said he hopes to be 
able to reduce the size of the civil service by 1%, by merging or eliminating 
certain federal agencies. He also said he wants to streamline the legal system 
and simplify German tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reached a point in our land where not enough can be accomplished, but 
almost anything can be prevented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, Kohl said he wants to fight crime, create a special 
citizenship category for certain children of long-term immigrants, and push 
ahead with the speedy integration of Europe, including the countries of the 
former Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 "The German government will work intensively in coming years to see that 
decisive steps are taken finally to overcome the division of Europe and secure 
long-term peace and freedom," said Kohl, one of the dwindling number of 
politicians to be guided by firsthand experience of Nazism and world war. 
Observers who support his foreign policy worry that his European unity goals 
will be sidetracked by the inevitable fighting over his domestic economic 
policy.

138 COUNTRIES SEEK TO COMBAT GLOBAL CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top government officials from 138 countries launched a drive Wednesday against 
cross-border crime with a two-part program to combat the world's organized 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed at the rising power of international gangs, a U.N.-convened conference 
approved the "Naples declaration" in which delegates pledged themselves to 
crack down harder on crime on their own turf and cooperate closely with other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We proclaim our political will and strong determination, as well as our 
unequivocal commitment to ensure full . . . implementation of the present 
declaration and the global action plan against organized transnational crime," 
the declaration said. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's criminal gangs are estimated to turn over $750 billion a year from 
drug smuggling, arms trafficking and prostitution rackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who hosted the conference, said the 
fight against crime is a global war that can be won only if countries unite. 
</P>
<P>
 There are worrying signs that the mobs are overcoming their traditional 
clannishness and joining forces to boost business. The collapse of communism in 
Eastern Europe has brought a new threat from Mafia-style groups there. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime, the 
highest-level gathering convened by the United Nations on crime, urged 
countries to tighten their own laws to prevent criminal organizations from 
benefiting from international loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the countries stopped short of calling for the immediate introduction of 
an international convention on organized crime, advocated by some Third World 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was held in Naples, infamous for its Camorra criminal gangs, to 
underline Italy's and the international community's determination to battle the 
mobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi attended a ceremony here Wednesday at a special U.N. monument 
honoring all victims of organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berlusconi's own legal problems, with Milan magistrates serving him with 
an official warning that he is under investigation for alleged corruption, have 
to some extent overshadowed the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Magistrates suspect him of involvement in bribes paid by his Fininvest media 
company to finance police before he took power in March elections. Berlusconi 
denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to save his political skin, Berlusconi threatened Wednesday to resign 
and seek new elections if his coalition allies fail to back him. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi said he has a "contract with voters" to pursue the program he put 
forward for general elections last March. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference, the billionaire businessman also said he is 
willing to sell his three national television stations, which he has previously 
refused to do.

BUSH WARNS U.S. AGAINST THE RISE OF ISOLATIONISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President George Bush spoke out Wednesday against the rising influence 
of isolationists such as Ross Perot and Sen. Jesse Helms in the United States, 
urging America to resist "that faulted siren's call." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to executives at a leadership forum, Bush took note of his fellow 
Republicans' victory in this month's congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican sweep put Helms -- an outspoken foe of foreign aid and 
perpetual critic of U.S. foreign policy -- in line to be chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is going to be under pressure from some of these 
quasi-isolationists at home," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not mention Helms by name, but did take a swipe at Perot, who may have 
cost him reelection in 1992 by running as an independent and siphoning off 
conservative votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot listen to the Ross Perots of the world and pull back into 
isolation, saying 'Let someone else do it,' " Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former President said the United States should opt for quiet diplomacy 
instead of lecturing other countries on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think sometimes my country makes a mistake by lecturing too loudly," Bush 
said, adding that the United States has its own human rights problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush painted a mixed picture of human rights in Asia, saying economic reforms 
in China have improved human rights since the 1989 Tian An Men Square massacre, 
but that more needs to be done in East Timor and Singapore.

PLO, HAMAS REACH TEMPORARY TRUCE IN GAZA; MIDEAST: GOAL IS TO AVERT VIOLENCE BY 
MILITANTS DURING MEMORIAL. ARAFAT SUPPORTERS STAGE SECOND RALLY TO SHOW 
ALLEGIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Palestinian mediators announced late Wednesday that they achieved a temporary 
truce between Yasser Arafat's fledgling self-rule authority and Islamic 
opponents in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, reached nearly one week after Palestinian police opened fire on 
militant Islamic protesters, called for both sides to refrain from further 
violence until a permanent understanding can be reached. At least 13 people 
were killed and about 130 were wounded in the clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is aimed at ensuring peace and order during a memorial gathering 
Friday for a Hamas guerrilla leader killed last year by undercover Israeli 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sayed abu Musameh, a senior Hamas leader in Gaza, said the rally will be a 
display of support for Hamas, but said those at the rally will abide by the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat on Wednesday staged his second show of strength since last Friday's 
bloody showdown with Islamic militants, assembling thousands of supporters -- 
some armed and firing weapons in the air -- to tout his preeminence as 
Palestinian leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses poured into this drowsy market town, disgorging loyalists from Arafat's 
Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In the West Bank, about 
3,000 demonstrators packed Jericho's rocky soccer field in a hard, cold rain, 
chanting promises to sacrifice "blood and soul" for their leader and his 
embattled self-rule government. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Arafat brought out 10,000 Fatah followers for a rally in Gaza City. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence linked to opposition to the peace accord between Israel and the PLO 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 In the occupied West Bank, Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian guerrilla 
after he and another gunman ambushed the soldiers, witnesses and Israeli 
security sources said. They said the two guerrillas, armed with AK-47 assault 
rifles, opened fire on an Israeli paramilitary border police patrol in the 
center of the town of Janin. The troops shot back, killing one. The other 
guerrilla fled, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, gunmen in a Gaza orange grove wounded Capt. Jamal abu Toma in the 
leg, in the first ambush of a Palestinian police officer. No one claimed 
responsibility, but fundamentalists were widely assumed to have staged the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A new survey said two-thirds of the Palestinians support a dialogue between 
the PLO and the Islamic factions. The survey of 1,076 Palestinians was taken 
Nov. 17-19, with most of the interviews conducted before the Gaza clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was carried out by the Center for Palestine Research and Studies, based in 
Nablus in the West Bank, and had a margin of error of plus or minus three 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin will receive the Spanish 
Prince of Asturias peace prize today in Madrid, before meeting to discuss peace 
in Gaza.

AID WORKERS LEAVE SOMALI PORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The aid agency Doctors Without Borders evacuated its eight foreign staff 
members from a southern Somali port Wednesday after a British staff member was 
briefly kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Briton, Tim Boucher, was freed after two hours, but he and other agency 
workers said they expected all expatriate aid workers to leave Kismayu by the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 They told a news conference in Nairobi it is possible widespread fighting will 
erupt in Kismayu because of the withdrawal of 1,200 Indian U.N. troops by the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have long considered Kismayu a flash point for renewed civil 
war in Somalia that could lead to a famine similar to the 1992 famine that 
prompted U.S. and U.N. forces to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Robays of Doctors Without Borders said security is deteriorating because of 
increased tension between three main clans over who would control the airport 
and seaport when U.N. troops leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Robays said Boucher, 30, was kidnaped by gunmen from a sub-clan of the Marehan 
clan, who believed they did not have enough of their people working for aid 
agencies.

 Mildred Clark, the 86-year-old woman who spent 90 minutes in a morgue cooler 
last week after mistakenly being declared dead, died Wednesday of undisclosed 
ailments, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albany Medical Center Hospital spokesman Richard Puff said Clark's family had 
requested that the cause of death be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, who was found unconscious on the floor of her apartment Nov. 17, was 
declared dead by an Albany County coroner after he failed to find her pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 She was transported to Albany Medical Center, where hospital attendants placed 
her in a morgue cooler for an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 When a hospital employee was given the task of releasing Clark's body to a 
local funeral director, he discovered that her heart was still beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark was examined, found to be in critical condition and placed in intensive 
care, where she remained until her death Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York state's health department said it was investigating the matter.

TWA PILOT AVERTS TAKEOFF DISASTER; 2 DIE IN CESSNA

 The TWA jet was hurtling down the runway at 80 to 100 m.p.h., just short of 
takeoff, when the pilot spotted an errant twin-engine plane ahead of him and 
swerved to avoid a catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 The MD-80 sheared off the roof of the tiny Cessna, killing both people 
aboard.But none of the 132 passengers and five crew members on the Denver-bound 
jetliner was seriously hurt in the accident late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials and others were quick to call the TWA pilot a hero 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picture yourself driving 90 m.p.h. in a car and a guy steps in front of you," 
Lambert Airport Director Leonard Griggs said. "It was extraordinarily lucky. 
Had he hit that airplane head on, we would have had a lot worse than we had." 
</P>
<P>
 TWA officials refused to release the name of the pilot, who is based in St. 
Louis, pending a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight people on board TWA Flight 427 at Lambert St. Louis International 
Airport suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 A team from the National Transportation Safety Board examined the wreckage 
Wednesday, trying to determine why the smaller aircraft had pulled onto the 
wrong runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather was clear at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The TWA jet was slightly damaged on its wing, TWA spokesman John McDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cessna Conquest 441 twin-engine turboprop was bound for Iron Mountain, 
Mich. The plane was registered to Superior Aviation Inc. of Iron Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The two on board were identified as Ralph Petersen, 55, the pilot, and Donald 
Hendrickson, 35. the husband of a Superior employee.

FEDEX PLUTONIUM CARGO BROKE RULES

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Army depot in California shipped plutonium by air via Federal Express in 
violation of federal rules, the Energy Department says. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a pound of the highly radioactive element used in nuclear weapons 
arrived Nov. 7 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for disposal, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army confirmed Wednesday that it had shipped the plutonium by air Nov. 4 
"because of a human error in marking the shipping instructions for the 
carrier." The Army said it had notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab routinely receives plutonium from universities, companies and the 
government. Lab spokesman Jim Danneskiold said this container was marked as 
plutonium and Federal Express should have shipped it only by truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Federal Express does ship nuclear materials and they have hazardous materials 
experts who do know what to do in these cases," he said. "In this case they 
didn't do it right." 
</P>
<P>
 The delivery from Sacramento Army Depot arrived with radiation shielding and 
exposure to workers would have been negligible.

 President Clinton granted a traditional White House Thanksgiving pardon to a 
frisky 50-pound turkey on Wednesday, then joined his wife in serving a turkey 
meal at a soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons, wearing bright green aprons, helped dish out a midday dinner to 
nearly 150 people at the So Others Might Eat kitchen in northeast Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The President put heaping portions of cranberry sauce on the plates; First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added rolls. They both then moved from table to 
table, chatting with diners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this is an important time for all of us to think about the 
larger American community of which we are a part," Clinton said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the President presided over what has been an annual tradition at the 
White House since 1947: a ceremony for a turkey not destined to end up on a 
dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift turkey was a 32-week-old snow white male raised by Shawn Arbogast, 9, 
of Harrisonburg, Va. The President received it on behalf of the U.S. 
government. It was then sent to live at a park.

HELMS CAN STILL CHAIR SENATE PANEL, DOLE SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms' comments about President Clinton should be no barrier to his 
becoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senate Republican leader 
Bob Dole said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms (R-N.C.) was strongly criticized by several Democrats, including 
Clinton, for his remark that the President was so unpopular with the military 
that "he'd better have a bodyguard" if he visited Helms' home state. 
</P>
<P>
 Several critics said such comments raised doubts about Helms' fitness to head 
the Foreign Relations panel when the GOP takes control of Congress in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said Wednesday that Helms had told him the comment was made when he and a 
reporter "were joshing back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said he had assumed that, but "it probably shouldn't have been said, even 
in jest." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Kansas senator said he saw no problem with Helms assuming the 
chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Republicans have steered clear of criticizing Helms. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms said Tuesday that he had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 He had nothing further to say on the subject to reporters outside his home 
Wednesday.

GOP SHOULD BE TOLERANT OF HOMOSEXUALS, GINGRICH SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homosexuality is an orientation "like alcoholism is an orientation," House 
Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich says in an interview to be published in a gay 
newspaper. The Republican Party's position, he says, should be "toleration." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that on most things most days, the vast majority of practicing 
homosexuals are good citizens," the Georgia Republican said in an April 16 
interview to be published in Friday's edition of the Washington Blade. "So why 
would you then say that, of all the different groups you can pick on, this is 
the one group you're going to single out?" 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP's position "should not be promotion, and it should not be 
condemnation," he said. "I don't want to see police in the men's room, which we 
had when I was a child, and I don't want to see trying to educate 
kindergartners in understanding gay couples." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's comments echo what he has said in other forums about homosexuality. 
He also said he has no trouble being friends or working with homosexuals. In 
fact, one of his sisters is a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
 Candace Gingrich, 28, said her sexual orientation is not a secret, but she has 
not previously discussed it publicly. She told the Associated Press that her 
brother's response was that "I have every right to live my life the way I want 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich told the Blade that the Republican Party and society are moving 
toward the position that "consenting adults can have private relations without 
in any way the political system being involved." But he called it "madness" to 
suggest that families are anything other than heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over time, we want to have an explicit bias in favor of heterosexual 
marriage," he said. "If you look at the pathologies and weaknesses of America 
today, re-establishing the centrality of marriage and of the role of a male and 
female in that relationship is a very central issue of the next 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a gay Republican group pointed to Gingrich's "contract with 
America" as evidence that the GOP is moving away from the far-right social 
agenda that has historically repelled gay voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, cited exit polls 
conducted for the New York Times that showed one in three gay, lesbian or 
bisexual voters voted Republican on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Gingrich said that he believes homosexuality is "an 
orientation in the way that alcoholism is an orientation." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're asking me do I believe there are very many people who are compelled 
to that lifestyle, I think the answer is basically no," he said. "I think 
there's a bias in that direction . . . just like there's a bias towards lots of 
behaviors."

COLLEGE BOARD OKS EARLY RETIREMENT PLAN; EDUCATION: COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT 
OFFERS 43% OF FULL-TIME INSTRUCTORS AN INCENTIVE PACKAGE. FINANCIAL STRAINS AND 
A DESIRE TO DIVERSIFY THE FACULTY PROMPT THE MOVE. 
</P>

<P>
 In a move aimed at revitalizing academic programs and saving money, trustees 
of the Los Angeles Community College District have voted to offer faculty 
members an early retirement package that could produce one of the district's 
largest shake-ups in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan adopted this week by a 5-0 vote, 43% of the district's 
full-time 1,683 tenured faculty members -- those 55 or older -- would be 
eligible for early retirement incentives. District officials said up to 300 of 
the 719 eligible teachers, about 18% of the total faculty, might accept the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-campus, 101,000-student district has suffered financially in recent 
years, in part because of declining enrollment. The district also has an 
unusually large proportion of older instructors. Many joined the faculty more 
than 25 years ago during the system's rapid growth in the 1960s and early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials expect to save money with the buyout plan. The cost of 
providing the retirement bonuses to faculty members would be more than offset 
by the savings from replacing veteran instructors at top pay scale with 
younger, lower-paid teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal is to diversify the ethnic makeup of the full-time faculty, which 
is about 70% white, although the district's students are 75% minority. District 
officials hope that the new faculty will allow the district to update and 
reorder its class offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the retirement proposal will not be known for several months. 
District teachers will have one chance to apply this fall and another near the 
end of the spring semester. The district has set a minimum of 150 retirement 
applications in order to put the program into practice. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, a top-scale faculty member without a doctorate earns an annual 
salary of about $50,550. Under the plan, faculty members taking early 
retirement would have an extra 7% of their final basic salary added to their 
retirement pension in a lifetime annuity. For an instructor age 60 with 30 
years of experience, that would add about $3,500 a year to an annual retirement 
pension of about $30,330. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the savings would come from a provision that requires the district to 
replace only 75% of the retiring full-time faculty within an 18-month period. 
The other 25% could remain vacant or be filled with less expensive part-time 
instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 The district could save about $20 million over 10 years -- most of that in 
years five through 10 -- if 165 teachers retired and the district replaced 75% 
of them with full-time instructors, filled 12.5% of the jobs with part-timers 
and left 12.5% vacant, said Robert Standen, vice chancellor for human 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the campuses, according to district records, Harbor College in 
Wilmington has the largest share of faculty -- 49% -- who are 55 or older. 
Close behind are two San Fernando Valley campuses -- Valley College in Van Nuys 
with 48% and Pierce College in Woodland Hills with 46% each.

EX-SEN. CARPENTER TO BE JAILED UNTIL DEC. 19 SENTENCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter, who fled to Costa Rica in February to avoid 
sentencing on corruption charges, was ordered jailed Wednesday pending his Dec. 
19 sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a jail sweat shirt, pants and slip-on tennis shoes, Carpenter, 66, 
appeared before U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia.The bearded, white-haired 
Carpenter was flanked by marshals during the brief proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia ordered a medical evaluation for Carpenter, who has prostate cancer. 
Prosecutors agree with Carpenter's lawyer, Charles Bloodgood, that Carpenter 
has prostate cancer but they are unsure whether the disease is immediately 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia ordered Carpenter to undergo medical tests at UC Davis Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, once the head of the Senate Democratic caucus and chairman of the 
State Board of Equalization, is one of several state legislators who were 
snared by federal agents in an undercover sting of the Capitol. He was found 
guilty last year of participating in an elaborate money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a few days before he was to be sentenced, Carpenter fled to Costa 
Rica, saying that he was seeking non-traditional treatment for his cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter was arrested several months later in a suburb of San Jose, Costa 
Rica, where American officials had tracked him. He was taken into custody by 
Costa Rican authorities and unsuccessfully fought extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Carpenter fled, probation officials had recommended a term of seven 
years, three months.

NEW WHOOPING COUGH VACCINE SAFER, STUDY SAYS; HEALTH: IT IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE 
AT PREVENTING ILLNESS AND CAUSES FAR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS THAN THE CURRENT 
TREATMENT, A MAJOR CLINICAL TRIAL IN SWEDEN FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A new whooping cough vaccine has been shown to be effective and much safer 
than existing vaccines in a major clinical trial in Sweden, the National 
Institutes of Health said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The currently used vaccine for whooping cough, formally known as pertussis, is 
part of the DPT vaccine routinely given to American children beginning at the 
age of 2 months. Although it is effective in preventing pertussis, there have 
been persistent reports that the current vaccine causes neurological damage in 
some children. Some countries, including Great Britain, Japan and Sweden have 
discontinued its use, and many parents refuse to allow their children to 
receive it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the trial, the new vaccine was given to 1,692 Swedish infants in three 
doses, at the ages of 3 months, 5 months and 12 months. The vaccine was about 
71% effective in preventing pertussis, compared to about 80% for the current 
vaccine. Perhaps more important, the incidence of side effects, both mild and 
serious, was far below that reported with the current vaccine, said Dr. John 
Taranger of the University of Goteborg, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need to get a vaccine that has fewer side effects, and this seems 
to be a perfect solution to our problem," said Dr. Lawrence Pickering, a 
pediatrician at the Center for Pediatric Research in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Mates, president of North American Vaccine Inc., which manufactures the 
new vaccine, said the company plans to apply to the Food and Drug 
Administration early next year for marketing approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The pertussis vaccine has been used in the United States since the 1940s, 
commonly as part of the DPT vaccine, which also protects against diphtheria and 
tetanus. Children usually get the vaccine in a five-dose series, beginning at 
age 2 months and continuing at 4, 6 and 18 months, with a final dose between 4 
and 6 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The current pertussis vaccine is called a whole-cell vaccine because it is 
made of killed pertussis bacteria. It contains not only a broad mix of cellular 
components of the bacteria, but also two different toxins that are produced by 
the microorganism. The pertussis endotoxin is thought responsible for the pain 
and fever associated with the vaccine, while the pertussis toxin -- which 
causes most of the symptoms of whooping cough -- is assumed to cause the more 
severe side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions to the vaccine usually occur within 48 hours and may include high 
fever (one out of 100 immunizations), persistent crying (one out of 100), 
seizures (one out of 1,750) and collapse episodes with limpness and lack of 
responsiveness (one out of 1,750). 
</P>
<P>
 Most side effects are reversible, but there have been persistent reports of 
permanent brain damage caused by the vaccine. Since the $80-million National 
Vaccine Injury Compensation program was established in 1988, 4,604 pertussis 
claims have been filed, according to the federal program's records. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their fears, many parents have refused to allow their children to 
receive DPT, leading to an increase in the incidence of the serious, sometimes 
fatal respiratory disorder. About 4,000 cases of pertussis occur each year in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to prevent these side effects, several groups of researchers have 
developed so-called acellular vaccines, which contain a mixture of proteins 
from cell walls of the bacteria. An acellular vaccine has been used 
successfully in Japan for several years and is approved in the United States 
for the fourth and fifth doses in the vaccination series. But the FDA has said 
that not enough evidence of safety and efficacy exists to justify using it in 
younger children, Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaccine tested in Sweden is unique because instead of cell-wall proteins, 
it contains a modified form of the pertussis toxin. It was developed by 
molecular biologists Ron Sekura and John Robbins of the National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development, who reasoned that a single protein would 
produce fewer side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the vaccine, a placebo containing only the tetanus and 
diphtheria vaccines was given to 1,687 other infants in the double-blind 
Swedish study. The children were monitored for an average of 20 months after 
the third shot by a team of public health nurses who evaluated all coughing 
episodes. The use of a placebo was possible because most Swedish children do 
not receive a pertussis vaccine of any sort, despite an epidemic in that 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, 240 of the children receiving the placebo developed 
pertussis, compared to only 72 who received the new vaccine. Although that is 
lower than the 80% efficacy of the current vaccine, said child health institute 
spokeswoman Michaela Richardson, the whole-cell vaccine has never been tested 
during an epidemic. The actual efficacies are probably about the same, she 
added. More on Immunization

DEMOCRATS FILE COMPLAINT ON KUYKENDALL; POLITICS: PARTY SAYS GOP ASSEMBLY 
CANDIDATE DID NOT PROMPTLY REPORT LAST-MINUTE $125,000 CONTRIBUTION. CAMPAIGN 
SAYS IT DID NOTHING WRONG. 
</P>

<P>
 The California Democratic Party, stinging over the loss of the Assembly to 
Republicans, filed a complaint this week with the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission about a late $125,000 donation by tobacco giant Philip 
Morris that may have swung a key Assembly race in Long Beach to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats accused Republican Assembly candidate Steve Kuykendall of 
failing to promptly file a campaign finance report showing that he received the 
$125,000 Philip Morris donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall's campaign said it did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campaign followed the letter of the law. This is just another desperate 
attempt by the Democrats to maintain power in the Assembly," said Lynn Harder 
of the Sacramento firm of McNally-Temple, which ran Kuykendall's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall has unseated Democratic incumbent Betty Karnette in the Long Beach 
district. With almost all absentee ballots counted, Kuykendall's victory has 
helped the GOP seize control of the lower house by a 41-39 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint also named Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte. Brulte, who is 
expected to unseat Willie Brown as Assembly Speaker, called the complaint 
frivolous and a waste of tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuykendall reported to the secretary of state that he received the money the 
weekend before the Nov. 8 election. Because he filed the report so close to 
Election Day, voters were unaware of the donation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complaint, the Democrats, citing a Times story quoting Brulte, charged 
that he knew Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, planned to 
donate the money to Kuykendall a month before the check was sent. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The law) is pretty clear that when you get a commitment, you're supposed to 
report it -- and they didn't," said state Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press. 
"When 'deep pockets' tells you that you'll have $125,000, that's money in the 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Press said Democrats are also considering a drive to recall Kuykendall because 
of the donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kuykendall's lead over Karnette Wednesday was 539 votes, as the Los 
Angeles County registrar of voters continued to tally the final absentee 
ballots.

POLICE KILL SUSPECT IN VALLEY CARJACKING AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles police shot to death one of two carjacking suspects who wounded a 
motorist and fled in his car on a high-speed chase through the streets of 
Pacoima before engaging officers in a gunfight, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacking victim, whom witnesses identified as a man in his early 20s, 
was in good condition at Holy Cross Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent episode began about 3:30 p.m. when one of the two robbers shot the 
car owner in the leg outside an auto parts store at Van Nuys and Laurel Canyon 
boulevards, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police the men laughed when the victim was shot, Lt. John 
Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects then fled in the victim's blue Chevrolet Blazer north on Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard, leaving the man writhing in pain in the store's parking lot, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, police pursued the Blazer until it crashed into a curb in the 
13900 block of Daventry Street, about seven blocks away. The suspect in the 
passenger seat jumped out and began shooting at the pursuing officers, who 
returned fire, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy with the gun unloaded on police and tried to make a break for it," 
said Miguel Zeda, 20, of Pacoima, a bystander who saw the gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers fatally shot the gunman behind a house at Daventry Street and Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other carjacking suspect ran east on Daventry, but was caught about a 
block away, police said. He was arrested on suspicion of murder because of his 
alleged involvement in a crime in which someone was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not release the identities of the carjacking victim, the dead 
man or the suspect in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the auto parts store where the incident began said he called 
police after a woman ran into the store crying about the shooting outside. A 
store worker said he waited by the victim's side until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's incident was the second carjacking in as many days in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hag Mahmoud Tahir, 34, of Los Angeles was being held on suspicion of robbery 
and assault in the beating of an Encino woman Tuesday. He is accused of pushing 
her out of her van, running over her and then leading police on a nearly 
hourlong chase through Valley streets before surrendering, police said.

LEUKEMIA IS MOST COMMON FORM OF CHILDHOOD CANCER; DISEASE: EXPERTS SAY THE 
ILLNESS CAN CAUSE DEATH WITHIN WEEKS. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR IF EARLY DIAGNOSIS 
COULD HAVE SAVED JULIO CANO'S LIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 The disease that apparently led to the death of 12-year-old Julio Cano is the 
most common form of childhood cancer, sometimes leading to aggressive 
infections and causing death in a matter of months or even weeks, medical 
experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether his life might have been saved by a diagnosis of acute leukemia 
just a few days earlier remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Childhood leukemia experts said Wednesday that they would need to know much 
more about the boy's case -- including his precise history and which type of 
leukemia he had -- before reaching a conclusion on whether his death was 
preventable. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, treatment of acute leukemia in children -- even in its 
late stages -- has a significant chance of success, said Dr. Stuart Siegel, 
head of the division of hematology/oncology at Childrens Hospital in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A cancer of the bone marrow and blood, acute leukemia involves the rampant 
growth of abnormal white blood cells, which essentially crowd out normal blood 
cells and invade body organs, Siegel said. The cause is uncertain, but it is 
not believed to be hereditary. It might involve some sort of genetic mutation, 
Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Julio's case, the disease had affected his spleen, brain, kidney and liver, 
said Lt. Dan Martini of the Orange County sheriff-coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known how long he had the disease, but one official said it could 
have been weeks or months. More tests are needed to determine how fast the 
disease progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease takes two basic forms. One type, called acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia, has a survival or cure rate of about 70% after five years if treated, 
Siegel said. The other type, non-lymphoblastic leukemia, is more difficult to 
treat and has a 40% to 50% survival rate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of successfully treating both forms are reasonably good even if 
the disease is diagnosed in its late stages, Siegel said. Both forms are 
treated with chemotherapy, although non-lymphoblastic leukemia also may require 
a bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms of acute leukemia may include paleness caused by anemia, fever, 
bruising easily, bone pain, skin rashes and an enlarged liver or spleen. The 
disease might develop for a period of months, Siegel said, but symptoms can 
"come on very quickly. . . . It could happen within a period of a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Because symptoms often occur late, many patients do not to seek early 
treatment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent might initially mistake some symptoms for the flu, except that the 
condition does not go away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alexis Thompson, assistant professor of pediatric hematology and oncology 
at the UCLA School of Medicine, said an alert general practitioner usually will 
be able to detect signs of the disease. It is diagnosed using blood tests and 
bone marrow biopsies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are children who die under the best of circumstances," she said, even 
with relatively prompt treatment. She said an aggressive infection -- which 
Julio may have suffered -- can overwhelm a child "even before we're able to 
give adequate chemotherapy."

COAST GUARD HUNTS FOR BOAT REPORTED SINKING QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Coast Guard continued searching Thursday night for a boat between Dana 
Point and Catalina Island whose skipper had radioed that he was taking on water 
and had five minutes left before sinking. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coast Guard officer said the patrol overheard a radio broadcast in which the 
unidentified skipper told an unidentified listener that he was going down 
quickly. The skipper never sent out a Mayday call. 
</P>
<P>
 Two helicopters, a jet and several vessels were expected to search throughout 
the night and into today, or until they found something, the Coast Guard 
officer said.

7 HOUSE FIRES USHER IN 'BURNING SEASON'; DANGER: LAGUNA BEACH WOMAN IS KILLED. 
SIX BLAZES OCCUR IN ANAHEIM, WHERE 2 HOMES ARE GUTTED, BUT NO ONE IS INJURED.

<P>
 At least seven house fires broke out in Orange County within 24 hours, marking 
the beginning of what firefighters described Wednesday as the "burning season." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on Blumont Street in Laguna Beach on Wednesday mourned the death of 
a neighbor whose house became engulfed in flames apparently ignited by a dining 
room heater. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose identification was withheld pending dental record 
examination, was described by neighbors as "the kindest person." Around 
Thanksgiving and Christmas, she brought presents such as wreaths or plants to 
every family on the block, said Gay Pivaroff, who has lived across from the 
woman for the last 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She takes care of everybody and their dogs," Pivaroff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's golden retriever also died in the fire, which broke out at 7 p.m. 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, a family of three was left homeless after their house in the 200 
block of Starfire Street was scorched when sparks from a chimney without a 
spark arrester ignited the roof, fire Investigator Mike Doty said.  
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, was among six Anaheim fires this week that 
left two homes gutted and caused more than $250,000 damage. No injuries were 
reported in any of the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of those, a mobile home in the 700 block of Romneya Drive went up in 
flames at 4 a.m. Wednesday after the family left town for Thanksgiving, Doty 
said. The cause of the fire is not definite, but Doty said it apparently was 
caused by a lighted cigarette left in a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will get through the holiday without the shock that they lost 
everything," Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four unrelated fires elsewhere in Anaheim on Tuesday destroyed sections of two 
homes, an apartment complex, a recycling center and a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach fire not only saddened neighbors but rekindled fear in the 
quiet cul-de-sac situated at the fringes of Mystic Hills, one of the hardest 
hit areas during that city's fires last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all a little concerned, since the Santa Ana was blowing last night," 
Battalion Chief Joe McClure said. Firefighters had to raise a "water curtain" 
around the property to protect nearby structures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sabaroff, a Laguna Beach resident who lost his home in last October's 
fire and who has rebuilt, said that Tuesday night, "I was on my way home when I 
saw fire just over the hill. My first thought was, 'God, I hope it's under 
control.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, Sabaroff learned that his neighbor's body had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all heartbroken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said the risk of house fire is greatest from Thanksgiving through 
New Year's Eve for several reasons, including seasonal Santa Ana winds, a dry 
climate and the pursuit of warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cold outside, and people think 'Oh, we'll light a fire and snuggle 
around it,' " Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young said. "Well, that's all 
wonderful, but it's also extremely dangerous. If you're not careful, you can 
spark a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Accidental fires are also common among transients and low-income families who 
use hibachis and portable stoves for warmth, Young said. Not only can they 
start a fire, they can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting next month, Christmas trees will become major fire hazards, Young 
said. An average Christmas tree can "burn in a flash" and ignite a house in 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means a smoke detector isn't going to help very much," Young said. "All 
the rules change around this time of the year, when fires tend to be more 
devastating and result in more injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Rain is helpful to prevent the spread of fire, Young said, but none is 
predicted for the rest of the week.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember at least eight recent Thanksgiving dinners I've had to spend 
at fire camps," Young said. "I can assure you that our Fire Department will be 
much more active" today.

OUSTED JUANENO LEADER FAILS TO WIN INJUNCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A faction of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians that is embroiled in a 
leadership struggle was handed a defeat Wednesday when an Orange County 
Superior Court judge denied an injunction sought by an ousted tribal leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In denying the action brought by David Belardes, the former leader at the 
center of this controversy, Judge James R. Ross said he did not find that 
Belardes' argument "had met the burden to merit any action." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things that were said in these court papers," Ross said, indicating an 
eight-inch-tall stack of case files on his desk, "are vague . . . and do not 
support the relief you seek." 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes, who expressed disappointment after the ruling, had sought the 
injunction to stop the Juanenos from holding elections Dec. 17 for new tribal 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
 The split within the Juaneno band, one of the Southland's oldest Native 
American groups, has imperiled its longstanding hope of achieving federal 
recognition as a tribe, according to both factions in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Juanenos are also under pressure to prepare for a visit early next year by 
representatives of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, one of the steps toward 
tribal recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross' ruling, which set a trial on the leadership dispute for next April, 
allows tribal council elections to go forward next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Belardes said in a telephone interview that he will refuse to participate 
in the elections, even though he was nominated to the tribal council. He said 
he believes he was duly elected as tribal chairman in 1993, an election that 
the opposing faction says was void because it was a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the tribal council and we're still in place and what's going to happen 
is we're going to have two tribal councils," Belardes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Horgan, an attorney for Sonia Johnston, who was named official tribal 
spokeswoman after Belardes' recent ouster, said he and his client hope the 
Juanenos can reach a resolution without a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is hopefully there will be a resolution before then," Horgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But with both sides claiming power, the Juanenos' quest for federal 
recognition from the Bureau of Indian Affairs may be in doubt.  
</P>
<P>
 "What are these people in Washington going to think?" Belardes asked. "If they 
talk to these people on Sonia's side and they hear how she interprets things, 
gosh, we're not going to get recognized. It's a sad state of affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Belardes, 47, a longtime tribal spokesman, was removed from his leadership 
post in a vote of the band's general council, but has refused to step down. The 
rift recently escalated to the point where Belardes has hired a security guard 
to prevent members of the rival faction from attending a Sept. 17 general 
council meeting at the Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 In the legal action, Belardes also sought -- unsuccessfully -- to prevent 
Johnston from using the Juaneno name. Belardes claims that a majority of the 
2,000 members scattered across the country will stand behind him and not 
Johnston.

VALIDITY OF DNA TESTING UPHELD IN ASSAULT CASE; COURTS: IN PRECEDENT SETTING 
DECISION INVOLVING CONVICTION OF WESTMINSTER MAN, JURISTS RULE GENETIC 
FINGERPRINTING IS 'HIGHLY RELIABLE AND RELEVANT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that could have a statewide impact on the admissibility of DNA 
test results in criminal and civil courts, the state's 4th District Court of 
Appeal upheld the attempted rape conviction of a Westminster gardener that was 
based almost entirely on DNA testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled Tuesday genetic fingerprinting had gained sufficient 
credibility in the scientific community that it should now be considered 
"highly reliable and relevant." 
</P>
<P>
 In making their decision, the jurists rejected the arguments of a defense 
attorney for Frank Lee Soto, 34. The attorney had argued that the method that 
was used to calculate the probability of a DNA match in the Soto case is still 
being debated by scientists and so should not have been admitted as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jurists argued in their decision that the method used in Soto's case, 
the one most commonly used by California laboratories, is now accepted by most 
geneticists. 
</P>
<P>
 "To allow a 'minor academic debate . . . to snowball to the point that it 
threatens to undermine the use of it in court' is throwing the baby out with 
the bath water," the jurists wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soto (argues that) the mere existence of 'two sides' in the scientific 
discussion means the whole subject must be excluded. We cannot agree; if that 
were literally true, no scientific evidence could ever be admitted." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto was sentenced to three years in state prison by Orange County Superior 
Court Judge Jean H. Rheinheimer for the attempted rape of a 79-year-old woman 
who lived in a mobile home next to him. The woman told police a masked man with 
a knife forced his way into her home and assaulted her in her bedroom. She 
suffered a stroke after the attack and was unable to testify at the trial. 
There were no other witnesses to the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) taken from semen found on her 
bedspread matched that of Soto, a point that was debated at length during the 
criminal trial and before the appellate court. DNA is found in blood, semen and 
tissue, and it carries a person's unique genetic coding. Genetic fingerprinting 
has also been used to determine paternity. 
</P>
<P>
 During Soto's trial, prosecutors called on experts who testified that the 
chance of anyone else but Soto being the source of the DNA evidence was one in 
189 million. But defense attorneys called three other scientists who gave a 
range from one in 71 to one in 39,000 based on another method of calculating 
the probability of a DNA match.  
</P>
<P>
 Soto's defense attorney Richard Schwartzberg argued that given the lack of 
agreement over the calculations, the DNA evidence should not have been 
admissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartzberg said the ruling is troubling because it means that someone like 
his client, who has always maintained his innocence, can be sent to prison on 
the basis of one disputed piece of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be too powerful for juries," Schwartzberg said. "We as a society 
have become too technology-oriented. It's to the point where if scientists tell 
a jury that black is white, there's a good chance they'll believe them." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervising Deputy Atty. Gen. Frederick R. Millar Jr. challenged the notion 
that the ruling did anything other than give prosecutors a guaranteed 
opportunity to introduce legitimate evidence that up until now could be 
excluded by judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not scary evidence," Millar said. "It provides valid evidence to 
establish guilt. There is not a risk here of an innocent person being falsely 
convicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Before this latest ruling, trial judges around the state have been deciding on 
a case-by-case basis whether to allow DNA test results into evidence and what 
kinds of probability calculations were acceptable. In most cases trial judges 
had accepted DNA evidence, though not in all, Millar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys disagreed about the potential impact of the appeals court ruling 
on California's lower courts.  
</P>
<P>
 Although they acknowledged that the ruling creates a legal precedent, they 
disagreed on whether lower court judges are bound by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Millar said that the recent ruling overrides a 1992 1st District Court of 
Appeal decision that DNA test results should not be admissible in court. That 
ruling had followed a 1991 2nd District Court of Appeal ruling that had said 
the opposite -- that DNA testing was acceptable as evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling in the Soto case is based on the very latest scientific evidence, 
and should have the force of law statewide, Millar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until and unless another appellate court comes along with new scientific 
evidence, the Soto case should be binding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schwartzberg said judges can still choose between the different appellate 
court decisions on DNA that have been handed down since 1991. Only a state 
Supreme Court decision, he said, will settle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney will file a petition with the state Supreme Court to hear the 
case by mid-January.

SOME ATTACH STRINGS TO THE SPIRIT OF GIVING; CHARITIES: DONOR STIPULATIONS THAT 
GIFT RECIPIENTS NOT BE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IS A NEW AND DISTURBING TREND, 
OFFICIALS SAY. ONE VOLUNTEER BLAMES PROP. 187. 
</P>

<P>
 Workers at four charities that operate "adopt-a-family" programs in Orange 
County say some potential donors in the last few weeks have been specifying 
that their holiday gifts go to legal residents or non-Latinos only. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem this year has been there are very strong anti-immigrant feelings 
as a result of Prop. 187," said Shirley Bebereia, a teacher who runs the 
holiday food distribution program at Century High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Doman, program manager for ESA Community Service Center in Anaheim, said 
about seven of the 110 or so people who have called to adopt a family for the 
holiday have stipulated that the recipients not be illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Because ESA has religious roots, like many other nonprofit agencies, Doman 
said, she refuses to investigate the legal status of clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say no, because the Church for the last 2,000 years has been considered a 
sanctuary, a haven for people in need, and we don't require hungry people to 
prove their legality," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said donors then have insisted on being assigned families that are 
English-speaking or non-Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "One elderly woman was going to donate $100 but said I had to make sure the 
people who received it were documented, so I had to find someone white and 
English-speaking, a Bob Cratchit family, because that was her comfort zone," 
said Laurel Williams, an intern from Cal State Fullerton who is helping Doman 
coordinate donors with families. 
</P>
<P>
 Doman said people always have had preferences for the families they want to 
help at Thanksgiving and Christmas. She said benefactors frequently will ask to 
be matched with a single parent or a family of a size that mirrors their own. 
</P>
<P>
 But specifying ethnic backgrounds is a new and disturbing trend, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect their wishes, but my own feeling is that they are basically closing 
their eyes and hearts to people that need help," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Share Our Selves in Costa Mesa said Wednesday they have 
received a few similar donation requests, and workers at Southwest Community 
Center in Santa Ana reported getting about 10 such requests in the last three 
weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Bebereia said she believes anti-illegal immigrant feelings spawned by 
Proposition 187 made it much more difficult this year for her to gather enough 
Thanksgiving dinners for needy families of students at Century High School, 
situated in one of the county's poorest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 potential donors refused to give when she said she could not verify 
that the families receiving their turkeys and trimmings were legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are good-hearted, compassionate people wiling to help other people. But 
they only want to help a person who is here legally," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Coe of Huntington Beach, one of original organizers of Proposition 
187, the initiative passed by California voters that would deny most public 
services to illegal immigrants, said of those donors: "That's their decision, 
not mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's their dollars, and if they want to ensure that only law-abiding people 
receive the benefit of their generosity, then that's their business." 
</P>
<P>
 Connie J. Jones, director of Southwest Community Center in Santa Ana, said it 
distresses her that people from Mexico are being stereotyped as illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undocumented people come in all colors, shapes and sizes," she said. "We have 
undocumented people from Asia, Canada, Latin American countries and Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said she believes only about 10% of the people who received 705 food 
bags last month from Southwest Community Center were in the country illegally, 
an estimate that she said was based on those unable to produce Social Security 
cards or other identification. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she does not chide donors who want to specify who will receive their 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them whatever your restriction when you adopt a family, we will try to 
adhere to it as much as possible. We will try to find a white or black family 
or Spanish family or a family who speaks English," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones said she will not ask about the legal status of anyone seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have time, and it is against my principles because I don't believe we 
should judge people when they are in need," she said. "The only time I judge 
people when they come here is if they are intoxicated or have weapons on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Those unwilling to feed the hungry who are illegal immigrants are still in the 
minority, charity workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say the vast majority of our donors just want to help at Christmas 
time," said Jean Forbath, founder of Share Our Selves.  
</P>
<P>
 This week, she said an employee group wanting to adopt a family for Christmas 
rejected one with a Latino surname, but other employees from the same company 
called to help that family. "They said it troubled them, and that was rather 
heart-warming to me," Forbath said.

 Irvine Unified School board member Hank Adler 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in at least a decade, an incumbent Irvine Unified School 
District board member was defeated for reelection.  
</P>
<P>
 Hank Adler estimates he spent about $33,000 to win a seat on the Irvine school 
board, defeating trustee Steve McArthur, who was hampered by a short record of 
incumbency.  
</P>
<P>
 McArthur was appointed to the board in January, replacing Greg Smith, who was 
appointed to the City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 Adler, 48, has two school-age children and has served on numerous city 
commissions, including the Planning and Finance commissions. He is a certified 
public accountant and a partner in the Santa Ana office of Deloitte & Touche. 
Adler will join the school board Dec. 6. He spoke recently to Times 
correspondent Russ Loar.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you think you were successful in seeking election to the Irvine 
school board? 
</P>
<P>
 A: People are concerned that decisions are being made at their schools and at 
the district, and they haven't been able to participate as fully as they'd like 
to. There is also a big concern about class size. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But doesn't the state largely dictate class size by the way school 
districts are funded? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We're going to find out how much we can do over the next couple of years to 
reduce class size. I'm not convinced that we can't reduce it. But whether we 
can reduce it to the level we want is the unknown. It's my view that the 
district has to take a fresh look at the way it allocates its funds. Hopefully, 
from that fresh look, the school district can redirect more of its funds to the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You were endorsed by the Education Alliance and the California Republican 
Assembly. What does this mean as far as your views on public education are 
concerned? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm a little appalled that nobody mentions that I was also endorsed by 
(Councilwoman) Paula Werner and (liberal UC Irvine political science associate 
professor) Mark Petracca. I'm a 6-foot, 2-inch, 205-pound Jewish person. I was 
endorsed by what I would call both sides of the political spectrum, because of 
the things I've done in the community over the last 20 years. I am as much of a 
fiscal conservative person as you would ever meet, and I think that's what 
makes the conservatives comfortable with me. My social views are pretty 
middle-of-the-road. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The school district has begun the search for a new superintendent. What are 
the qualities you'll be looking for in a new school district leader? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For a district like the Irvine school district, the qualities that are 
necessary in a leader are the same qualities you would look for in the 
president of a small college: a good leader, a good educational base, good 
financial skills and someone who has a demonstrated record of community 
involvement.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; NEW LAW RESTRICTS MOBILE FOOD VENDORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has given preliminary approval for an ordinance regulating 
mobile food vendors and defining dozens of health, traffic and safety 
guidelines vendors must meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the new law at its regular meeting Monday.The ordinance 
will go into effect 30 days after it receives final approval, which is expected 
at the council's Dec. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 New rules forbid food vendors from conducting business within 500 feet of 
school property, playgrounds, parks, recreation facilities or any other vending 
vehicle. Other rules require vendors to ensure that customers approach the 
vehicle from the right-hand side of the street, away from traffic. Further, all 
vendors must have city permits to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance states that violators will be issued citations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rules include requiring vendors to meet sanitation standards, be 
properly insured, and refrain from parking on public property unless they 
obtain a permit or are serving food to employees for 30 minutes or less. JON

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; IMMIGRANT STUDENTS GET TASTE OF AMERICANA

<P>
 Students with limited English skills got a lesson in American traditional 
Thanksgiving food Wednesday during a feast at Niguel Hills Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, from Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador and Taiwan, were busy earlier this 
week under the tutelage of eighth-graders from an advanced home economics 
class.They helped stuff the bird, mash the potatoes and stir the cranberry 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the recent arrivals to the United States, it was the first time 
they had heard of pumpkin pie, let alone tasted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Why would you take a pumpkin and eat it?' " said Laurie Cummings, 
the school's language development teacher, who worked on the project with 
colleagues LaVonne Chesire and Kathryn Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
 "They first thought that pumpkin pie was gross," Cummings added. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project was about more than cooking and eating. 
</P>

 Among other things, the 20 students learned about Native Americans, the 
Pilgrims and that turkey probably wasn't served at the first Thanksgiving.

 "The idea is to open our culture to them," said Schindler, who teaches social

 Words take on more meaning when they belong to an object a student needs to

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY BUYS PLAYGROUNDS OF FORMER SCHOOL FOR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has bought the playgrounds of a former school to convert into its 
22nd park. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members voted 3 to 1 last week to spend $3 million on the 
5.2-acre property, owned by the Lowell Joint School District. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a flat parcel where playing fields can easily be created, said City 
Manager Lee Risner. Other city parks are too hilly for baseball diamonds or 
soccer and other sports' fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The park "will allow us to expand our services that we simply did not have 
space for before for youth athletics and activities," Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Juan M. Garcia, who cast the lone dissenting vote against 
purchasing the land, said the council should postpone a decision until 
considering how the money could best be spent -- whether on the park or 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Steven C. Anderson, David M. Cheverton and James Flora, however, 
agreed a park will benefit the community and be worth the cost. William D. 
Mahoney was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora recommended that the park be named after Michael Osornio, the police 
officer who was killed last month when a drunk-driving suspect crashed into his 
cruiser. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY COUNCIL BALKS AT YARD SALE RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials this week backed away from drafting an ordinance that would 
place restrictions on yard sales throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus, who complained that the sales are blighting parts 
of the city, last month asked the city staff to research possible 
restrictions.But the idea appears to have little support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities that had been involved in adopting an ordinance ran into rather heated 
discussions in the community," City Atty. Jack L. White said during a 
presentation to the council. "We could well expect that we would run into the 
same type of polarization." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldhaus favored either designating certain days during the year for the 
sales, allowing only a certain number of sales per address or requiring people 
to get a low-cost permit to have a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 White said enforcing such an ordinance would also require changes in the 
staffing and operation of the city's code enforcement division because most 
sales occur on weekends, when fewer code enforcement officers are on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members and city staff agreed that something needs to be done 
about the estimated 200 yard sales that occur on an average weekend. City 
officials said many of the sales have become increasingly commercial with new 
merchandise being sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something needs to be done to keep the city cleaned up," Feldhaus said. "I've 
received enough comments and complaints where it's at a point where we need to 
do something." 
</P>
<P>
 The sales are already prohibited under Anaheim's zoning code, but the code is 
rarely enforced, said John Poole, city code enforcement manager. GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; U.S. GRANTS $350,000 FOR CITY PROGRAMS

<P>
 The City Council accepted an unexpected grant of $350,000 from the federal 
government this week and approved spending the money on local employment, youth 
and anti-graffiti programs. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the city's continuing Weed and Seed anti-crime effort, the council 
unanimously earmarked the money for six programs, including gang-prevention 
efforts at Valley High School and Spurgeon Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weed and Seed area is bounded by McFadden Avenue and 1st, Sullivan and 
Raitt streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan approved Monday, the city will spend $98,000 on Valley High's 
Road to Success program, aimed at keeping in school about 70 students who might 
otherwise drop out and join gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $44,000 will go to Spurgeon Intermediate's Adopt-a-Kid program, a 
year-round effort to keep 14-year-old at-risk children away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also spend about $92,000 on its youth education services 
program, which provides job training, education and self-esteem activities for 
residents aged 18 to 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paint It Now Block Challenge," a city program that aims to paint about 50 
homes for low-income families, will receive about $51,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Haven, which offers recreation and counseling for families, will receive 
about $50,000. A program offering youngsters training to become zookeepers at 
the Santa Ana Zoo will receive almost $14,000. JON NALICK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; CITY TO RE-EXAMINE USES OF THE HEADLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will re-examine what to do with the landmark 121-acre Dana 
Point Headlands since city voters rejected a $500-million development plan on 
the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously agreed Tuesday night to begin a new series of public 
hearings that could result in changing the city General Plan's land-use 
designation for the Headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was clear that the community was not satisfied with the plan for 
the property," Councilman William L. Ossenmacher said. "I think it really needs 
to go through a process where people can explore various options -- a committed 
workshop process where everybody gets a chance to present some ideas. It would 
be a good healing process for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The current General Plan allows the landowners to build a hotel, commercial 
centers and more than 500 homes on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The council earlier this year approved a plan allowing a hotel and 370 homes 
on the property, but voters defeated that plan at the polls after a bitter 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Curreri said her primary goal is to end the controversy over the 
Headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Councilman Ossenmacher is correct and this will be a healing process," 
Curreri said. Since the 1940s the Headlands has been owned by the M.H. Sherman 
Co. and Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the 
financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times 
Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan T. Daniels, president of the M.H. Sherman Co., said Wednesday that the 
council's decision to review the land use for the Headlands is "inappropriate" 
because the General Plan is only 2 years old and was written at great expense 
to the city. LEN HALL

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SOME WILL CAMP OUT TO CELEBRATE THE HOLIDAY

 Lee Stevenson had hoped to bag his first wild turkey this week while hunting 
in the Arizona mountains, but he'll have to settle for store-bought turkey 
thighs cooked on a campground barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old retired bartender and security guard is one of a handful of 
people who will spend Thanksgiving at O'Neill Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are there by choice, looking for a break from urban life. Others are 
there because it's inexpensive and they don't have a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the cheapest rent you can get," said Richard Nigh, a 65-year-old former 
clamp operator at an Orange County paper factory, who once lived in a house in 
Anaheim but now resides in a camper shell on the back of pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Nigh's 12th Thanksgiving spent at a county campground, but he is 
hardly one to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Nigh said. "You wouldn't get me back to a house or an apartment 
for all the money in the world. I've learned that the best things in life are 
free. Just look at the scenery." 
</P>
<P>
 Nigh plans to cook a five-pound turkey roast and all the trimmings for himself 
and a nephew, who lives in a camper behind a small shopping center in Trabuco 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, a Venice native who once mixed drinks at the Hilltop Supper Club in 
Long Beach, said he doesn't mind being alone on a day when families 
traditionally gather in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1981, Stevenson has been tooling around Southern California and Arizona 
in search of good campgrounds and gold. He prospects as a hobby, and has never 
been married. He sold his mobile home in Huntington Beach before adopting his 
more nomadic ways. His motor home has 152,000 miles on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever heard of that song, 'On the Road Again'?" Stevenson asked. 
"That's me." 
</P>
<P>
 For Stevenson, memories of past Thanksgivings are much the same as other days 
during the 24 years he toiled as a bartender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked so many holidays, it's just another day for me," he said, 
chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther down the trail on Wednesday afternoon, Sue and Dwight McConnell of 
Anaheim were settling into their temporary spot for their family's 4th annual 
Thanksgiving away from the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple expects to put a 22-pound turkey on the table for about 20 friends 
and family members, including seven grandchildren ranging in age from 6 months 
to 9 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "After doing all the traditional things at home, we said one year, 'Let's go 
camping -- break tradition,' " said Dwight McConnell, a 48-year-old utilities 
supervisor at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's peaceful and quiet," said Sue McConnell, a 51-year-old homemaker. "We 
thought we'd be like the Pilgrims when we first started -- be outside and 
cook." 
</P>
<P>
 But their first venture into the woods near Cajon Pass a few years ago turned 
into more than they anticipated: It snowed the day after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Avalos, a friend who was cooking a steak that day, thought the snowflakes 
were ashes from a nearby campfire. 
</P>
<P>
 On that first trip, the McConnells and their friends also gave food and 
clothing to an elderly couple who were homeless and sleeping in their car, Sue 
McConnell recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were so thankful," she said. "I get goose bumps thinking about it. That 
was a very special Thanksgiving." JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL DROPS PROPOSALS TO INCREASE OIL 
TAX, IMPOSE RENTALS FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week scrapped a proposal to increase the oil barrel tax 
and to impose a business license fee on single-family home and duplex rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the shortfall for this fiscal year's $96.1-million general fund 
budget climbed to about $912,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The two proposals were expected to raise a total of $129,000 to help ease a 
$783,000 budget shortfall.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members Grace Winchell and Ralph Bauer voted in favor of the 
proposals, which drew overwhelming opposition.  
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents, residents and property owners overwhelmingly objected to 
the business license fee. Opponents called it an unfair tax that would have 
placed a financial burden on landlords since many of them own rental property 
as a retirement investment, not as a for-profit business. The council also 
received a number of letters objecting to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee would have raised about $150,000, but start-up costs to process the 
licenses were estimated to be $66,000 the first year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Robert Ballard, who owns rental property, told the council: "If the 
tax goes through, we can't pass on the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Downtown Residents' Assn. supported the business license. 
Residents said the fee would give the city assurance that property owners pay 
their fair share for public safety services. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the proposed 2-cent increase for the tax on each oil barrel 
charged that if the hike was approved, the city would have the highest tax in 
the area. The tax would have generated $45,000 in revenue. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SUPERVISORS' AIRPORT VOTE CONDEMNED 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council has unanimously condemned the county Board of Supervisors for 
voting to withdraw by year's end from the agency planning the development of 
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said Tuesday night the city will join with other South County 
cities, which oppose a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine base, should 
those cities sue to force the supervisors to reverse their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors has to realize there are more people than those who 
live north of the 55 Freeway," said Irvine Mayor Michael Ward. "If they don't 
listen, we will be in line with the South County cities to pursue litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had played a leading role as a member of the planning agency -- the El 
Toro Reuse Planning Authority. The agency was created in a compromise reached 
between airport advocates in the north and opponents in the south. The planning 
agency was considering an airport at El Toro along with other options including 
a university, a theme park and an industrial site. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Nov. 8, county voters narrowly approved Measure A, which calls for the 
building of a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine base. Supervisor Thomas 
F. Riley, who represents South County, said supervisors are responding to the 
will of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "My problem was that when something is approved by the voters, I've been told 
that I'm supposed to say, 'Aye, aye, sir,' and do it," Riley said. "I was 
hopeful that Measure A would not pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, a Newport Beach resident, said he does not want to see the planning 
agency dismantled.RUSS LOAR

<P>
 Nanette Camporeale had hoped her police ride-along would be exciting, but she 
had not expected four "Code 3" emergencies in a row, including one for an 
officer under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard his voice over the radio and it was chilling," she said."These cops 
don't get the credit they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 That reaction is just what Police Department officials had in mind when they 
organized the Citizen Police Academy in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted you to have a window on those hours of boredom and moments of 
terror," said Chief Richard Tefank as he presided over the academy's second 
graduating class of 26 residents last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the 10-week course, he said, is to get officers out of 
their cars and into the neighborhoods so residents can see how police spend 
their $6.4 million budget -- nearly one-quarter the city's income. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that money is devoted to the hours of boredom. Police and others 
lectured on such topics as how assignments are made and which 911 calls get top 
priority. Others impressed the group with demonstrations of crime scene 
investigations, which particularly grabbed resident Cara Brookhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed with the organization," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the participants get a better perspective on police work than 
they have by watching reruns of "Dragnet" and "Adam 12," Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has a continuing program for those who get caught up in the 
excitement -- a new volunteer division at the police station. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; JUDGE CONTESTS VOTE RESULTS, CITING MAILER

<P>
 A Municipal Court judge who lost his seat on the bench to a county prosecutor 
in a bitter and very close election is contesting the results on the grounds 
that his opponent violated state election laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher in Westminster accused his opponent, Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Caryl Lee, of failing to put a return address on more than 2,000 
copies of a letter mailed out criticizing Dutcher. 
</P>
<P>
 State election law requires that campaign mailings of 200 pieces or more have 
a return address to prevent recipients from being misled about the mailing's 
origins, Dutcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've shown everyone that I'm not too good at politics," Dutcher said. "But 
maybe some good lawyering can make up for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee denied the charge, saying her campaign did three mailings and that all 
were properly conducted. She said she never mailed the letter to which Dutcher 
is referring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been any violation of the sort, and I think (Dutcher) should 
check his story out before he jumps the gun like this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five judges, commissioners and court administrators filed a petition Monday on 
Dutcher's behalf contesting the election. County Clerk Gary L. Granville will 
submit the petition to Presiding Superior Court Judge James L. Smith for a 
civil court hearing and ruling on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher lost the Nov. 8 election by 1,149 votes out of 140,889, or 0.8%, of 
the ballots cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter in question was purportedly written by the parents of a 13-year-old 
boy who was killed by a hit-and-run, drunk driver. The parents, Gail and Ed 
Martinez, criticized Dutcher in the letter for being too lenient on the driver, 
a charge Dutcher has strongly contested. Dutcher attributes his loss in the 
election to the widely publicized charge that was taken up by Lee in other 
mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher said the letter was misleading because it was actually prepared and 
mailed out from Lee's campaign headquarters, not the family's home. Voters 
might have taken a different view of the letter had they known that it was sent 
out by the Lee campaign, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee said the Martinezes wrote and mailed the letter, although they did 
contact her ahead of time offering to help with her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are college-educated, very smart people," Lee said. "I don't know why 
he (Dutcher) doesn't think they can read and write. And if they want to speak 
out, it's their right." SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CHANGING OF COUNCIL GUARD GOES SMOOTHLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The changing of the City Hall guard in Newport Beach this week featured 
graceful exits by some longtime council members and no-nonsense entrances by 
the new blood, including incoming Mayor John W. Hedges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedges won his second term on the council on a conservative, anti-regulation, 
anti-tax stance that sometimes put him at odds with his colleagues as the 
council scrambled to find money to maintain services. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote making Hedges mayor was the new council's first act; its 
second was another unanimous vote electing Councilwoman Janice A. DeBay the 
mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Thomas C. Edwards, who wasn't sure until just before the ceremony 
whether he had won the election, held his certified results high above his head 
and grinned when he and new Councilwoman Norma Glover and Councilman Dennis D. 
O'Neil were sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards won a close race against Ron Winship, who appeared to have won by 26 
votes when the polls closed. Absentee and provisional ballots certified Monday 
turned the tide, with Edwards leading by 599 votes with 12,335 to Winship's 
11,736. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits approved two years ago forced three council members out of office. 
Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart retired after 16 years, the longest continuous 
service on the council in city history. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if I don't want to go?" she joked as she gave her seat up for the new 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Outgoing Councilman Phil Sansone received praise for his efforts to maintain 
the noise limits and resolve other issues surrounding John Wayne Airport. HOLLY

SLAIN MAN'S SON, 13, OPENS FIRE ON FLEEING GUNMEN

 A 13-year-old boy opened fire on two fleeing men who had shot his father to 
death Wednesday at the family's home following an argument, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The two men remain at large, but their abandoned car was found covered with 
blood and bullet holes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men had entered the home of Nectali G. Bravo, 43, in the 2000 block of 
South Artesia Street about noon, and "some kind of a confrontation" occurred, 
Lt. Bob Helton said. It is not clear whether Bravo knew the men.  
</P>
<P>
 When they approached his father threateningly, the boy ran to a bedroom closet 
and got a rifle, Helton said. He returned to find his father sprawled on the 
garage floor and the men pulling out of the driveway. The boy fired more than 
10 shots, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was found later at Pacific and Edinger avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blood was all over the vehicle," Helton said. "The passenger window was 
totally blown out, and there were bullet holes in the windshield." 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo's wife and another woman, believed to be his mother, were in the house 
during the shooting but were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo worked in the jewelry business, according to a family friend. 
</P>
<P>
 His 23-year-old daughter, who was at work, "went into total collapse," said 
Michael Del Rey, vice president of Newsmakers, where she is an art director. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are an 'Ozzie and Harriet' kind of a family," Del Rey said. "It couldn't 
come at a worse time -- they were hours away from celebrating Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
 A fund to help the family through the holidays has been established by 
Newsmakers. For more information, call (714) 574-7900.

SCHOOL FOUNDATION WINS FINE ARTS GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School District's Foundation for Educational Excellence has 
won a $25,000 grant to fund fine arts programs, a district spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills-based Wilbur May Foundation awarded the grant, which will 
provide $5,000 annually for the next five years to fund assemblies and 
workshops covering topics including dance, music and visual arts, district 
spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter, the grant will pay for eight artists to visit schools, including 
a Native American storyteller and musician, a trio that performs dances of 
Hawaii, Samoa and New Zealand, and a performer who uses traditional African 
instruments, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1990, the district foundation has raised more than $80,000 for its 
schools to buy classroom materials and pay for annual student recognition 
awards, academic competitions and student activities, Brown said.

SHAW: NO RAM SALE YET; FOOTBALL: TEAM PRESIDENT DENIES REPORT MISSOURI 
BUSINESSMAN WILL BUY MINORITY INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ram President John Shaw Wednesday emphatically denied a report that the Rams 
have agreed to sell a minority interest in the team to Columbia, Mo., 
businessman Stan Kroenke. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, citing an unnamed source, reported today that 
Kroenke could buy up to 40% of the team, a share worth about $60 million, in a 
deal that would apparently pave the way for the Rams to move to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The source told the newspaper that "this is an agreement, not a proposal." The 
deal reportedly has no buyout provision but instead gives Kroenke first option 
to purchase the team from Ram owner Georgia Frontiere if she decides to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 While Shaw has indicated recently that St. Louis is the front-runner in the 
race for the Rams and that a minority share of the team would go to Kroenke, he 
said no deal has been presented to Frontiere for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who also has been negotiating with groups from Orange County and 
Baltimore, said Wednesday night that "there is absolutely no truth" to the St. 
Louis report. 
</P>
<P>
 "No deal has been reached," he said. "Nothing is imminent. We continue to 
negotiate. No deal to sell off any part of the team has been reached." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kroenke nor officials from FANS Inc., the group negotiating to bring 
the Rams to St. Louis, could not be reached Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroenke was in Los Angeles two weeks ago to discuss the possible sale of the 
Rams with Shaw. He also has been in contact with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who 
are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Disneyland President Jack Lindquist, co-chairman of Orange County's 
Save the Rams task force, was skeptical of the report. "This whole thing is so 
bizarre and ridiculous," he said. "Until we here something official from 
Georgia or Shaw, we'll go on the basis that the Rams are staying here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindquist said the local group would do everything it could to prevent the 
Rams from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever recourse we would have, through the courts or whatever, we'll make 
it very unpleasant for them if they try to move," Lindquist said.

 Ram President John Shaw emphatically denied a report out of St. Louis on

Columbia, Mo., businessman Stan Kroenke. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, citing an unnamed source, is reporting in today's

the option to buy up to 40% of the team, a share worth about $60 million.

expansion race but failed to land a team for St. Louis, was in Los Angeles two 
weeks ago to discuss the possible sale of the Rams with Shaw. He has also been 
in contact with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 FANS, headed by former U.S. Sen. Thomas Eagleton, has been negotiating a wish 
list of items the Rams would like to see met before moving to St. Louis, 
including construction of a practice facility, covering about $15 million in 
NFL relocation fees and paying $30 million the Rams owe for Anaheim Stadium 
improvements.

GIVING SEASON LASTS ALL YEAR; BEARS' ZORICH HONORS MOTHER'S MEMORY BY PASSING 
OUT FOOD TO CHICAGO'S NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The heavy sound of Chris Zorich's knuckles on the thin door echoed through the 
fumes from a nearby refinery, a smell that coated the decaying neighborhood 
like paint. 
</P>
<P>
 He knocked once, twice, three times. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny apartment was dark and silent, but he knew somebody was home. Nine 
little girls lived inside. Where was somebody going to go with nine little 
girls? 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't they want to know that Santa Claus was here? 
</P>
<P>
 The freezing wind howled around him as he stood on the stoop. He knocked 
again. And again. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tuesday, 6:30 p.m. He yawned and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dying out here," he had said -- three hours ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He had not slept in nearly two days while putting the finishing touches on the 
crazy idea that one man could feed 197 hungry families. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier at Soldier Field, he had supervised Chicago Bear teammates and other 
volunteers who filled their cars with boxes of food that Zorich had either 
bought, or was given. Those boxes were then taken to needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been television cameras then, and fans, and warm times. He had posed 
for pictures, handed out buttons, hugged anyone who would hug him back. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, somewhere near Indiana, the sky was black, the temperature had dipped 
below 30 degrees, the cameras and teammates were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 One food delivery remained. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the back of Zorich's red truck, five boxes of turkeys and hams and 
canned spaghetti and dozens of other items, even some of Zorich's beloved comic 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 197. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a delivery intended specifically for this apartment. Inside lived a 
mother and her nine children. Their father had gone out one day and never 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorich, getting no answer, was getting frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait," he said. "I've got an idea." 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to his truck, grabbed the cellular phone from the passenger seat 
and punched in some numbers. A young girl from inside the house answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they were there, she said. But no, they had been instructed not to answer 
the door when their mother was at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorich assured them he had spoken to their mother earlier. He made a joke 
about a cut-out turkey in their window. Told them he had a real one for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the girl said. Now she remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Zorich was standing in a small, dimly lit room surrounded by 
tiny faces sticking out of heavy pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Little girls, it seemed like hundreds of them, were giggling and tugging at 
this Santa Claus wearing the Notre Dame jacket, baseball cap and 42-waist 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes of food, enough to feed this family for a week, filled the room. 
Tears filled the eyes of the oldest child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had words to thank you," she said. "I do not." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter. At that moment, Zorich, a giant knot in his throat, did not 
have the words to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During an era when pro football players are noticed more for how they dance 
and fight and talk than for how they play, the NFL should give thanks today for 
one man who is unafraid of presenting a different image. 
</P>
<P>
 When friends think of Chris Zorich, defensive tackle for the Chicago Bears, 
only sometimes do they see one of the vocal leaders of the league's 
eighth-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, they see something a bit more unusual: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They see a man sitting on the floor of a house at the Maryville City of 
Youth, a home for displaced youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The man is surrounded by little girls. They are playing an age-old clapping 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks just as you would imagine an elephant playing patty-cake would 
look," said the executive director, Father John Smyth. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not happen only once. This happens once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They see a man leaving Soldier Field surrounded by 15 displaced children 
and orphans. They are heading for a postgame meal at Planet Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorich not only buys the children dinner, he eats it with them, this large, 
bald celebrity at this very trendy restaurant sitting and laughing and playing 
games with 10-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beautiful women walk past, power brokers wave. And Zorich never leaves the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not happen only once a season. This happens after every home game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They see a man who not only delivers food to needy families at 
Thanksgiving, but at Christmas -- and in March, and in July. 
</P>
<P>
 There usually aren't a lot of people around to watch or cheer in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually just four of five of us, with a bunch of rented vans and food all 
over our house," said roommate Marlon Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They see a man spending this Thanksgiving with 65-70 orphans at a downtown 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should be a blast," said Zorich, so unaffected that he will probably attend 
the dinner wearing the name tag he wore on Tuesday, the one that read, "Hi, My 
Name Is . . . Chris." 
</P>
<P>
 What friends won't see is what will happen after today's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorich will feed the children until they are stuffed, play with them until 
they are weary, and then return to his home, alone as on every holiday in the 
last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will put on a Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire movie, I will think of my mom, 
and I will cry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To understand why a popular 25-year-old athlete would give up his social life 
and possibly jeopardize his career to spend time with the poor and weak, one 
needs only to understand Zora Zorich. 
</P>
<P>
 For 18 years, this white woman raised Chris, her only child, in an all-black 
Chicago neighborhood. Zorich's black father left before he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Zora was strong but could not elude the muggers or burglars who turned their 
home into a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son Chris was big, but not big enough to elude the jeers that accompanied 
his severe stuttering problem, or the jokes about his mixed race. 
</P>
<P>
 They were so poor, Chris spent much of his free time standing in line at 
churches that handed out food. Sometimes, he had to catch two city buses to get 
to those churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet together, perhaps only by being together, they could not be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was an angel on earth," Zorich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the warmth generated by his mother in that drafty old apartment, 
through her hugs and Slavic proverbs, Zorich learned to be proud of his mixed 
heritage, to be unafraid of conquering his speech impediment. 
</P>
<P>
 But his life drastically changed on Jan. 2, 1991, the day after Zorich had 
been voted Notre Dame's most valuable player in its 10-9 Orange Bowl loss to 
eventual national champion Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 In a story that attracted national attention, Zorich returned home from Miami 
and discovered Zora on the floor of their apartment, dead of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is her memory that has driven him to become the NFL's most giving player. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is the Christopher Zorich Foundation that finances many of his 
charitable activities, it is the Zora Zorich Scholarship for aspiring Notre 
Dame students that he is proudest of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when things were bad and we didn't have anything, my mom was 
always there for me," Zorich said. "I want to give other people that same 
feeling. I want to let them know there is hope." 
</P>
<P>
 He has done this at the cost of many hours of rest, something badly needed by 
an undersized -- he's 6 feet 1 and 277 pounds -- NFL tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 He wears No. 97 because his food programs have, traditionally, involved either 
97 or 197 families. 
</P>
<P>
 His mission, basically, has come at the expense of the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a subtle way, this is therapy for him, a way for him to deal with the 
death of his mother," said Kevin Warren, Zorich's attorney "It's something when 
you realize that the death of one person has impacted as many as 50,000 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Markotic had been waiting in the freezing wind for three hours for Chris 
Zorich. It has grown so cold through the narrow streets around the aging brick 
tenement that, at one point, the 12-year-old boy wrapped himself around a water 
meter, thinking it was a heater. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorich was late because he had just left a neighborhood so blighted, it took 
him 15 minutes to find a gas station. He was also late because he had made 
wrong turn at the corner where men were wailing around an open fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the big red truck pulled up. Zorich jumped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly from the edges of the bleak neighborhood emerged faces, of old women 
in robes, of young men in beards and T-shirts, of pale children shaking under 
heavy coats. 
</P>
<P>
 On this street corner in south Chicago, Chris Zorich and his boxes of food 
were suddenly surrounded by the faces of hope, and for an instant, it was as if 
the darkness had disappeared.

<P>
 Things to be thankful for this gladsome day in sports: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Clippers -- That they have played only 11 games so far.  
</P>
<P>
 2. Raiders -- That Tim Brown didn't jump to Denver. Or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 3. George Foreman -- That Michael Moorer modeled his fight plan after a guy 
stepping in front of a freight train going downhill.  
</P>
<P>
 4. Roger Maris and Babe Ruth -- That the lords of baseball -- labor and 
management alike -- canceled a year in which half a dozen guys had a shot at 
60-homer seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Ted Williams -- That he's still the last guy in baseball to have batted 
over .400, now that the strike has robbed Tony Gwynn of anyone's best chance in 
53 years to catch him.

IRISH WAKE; NOTRE DAME STILL HASN'T FORGOTTEN LOSS TO USC 30 YEARS AGO THAT 
ENDED ALMOST-PERFECT SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think the Coliseum took a big hit last Jan. 17? You should have felt the old 
gray lady rockin' & rollin' late on the afternoon of Nov. 28, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershocks even rattled the golden dome in South Bend, Ind.  
</P>
<P>
 On that day, USC registered one of its best remembered football victories, a 
20-17 shocker over a Notre Dame team that was 9-0 . . . and 1 minute 33 seconds 
away from a national championship.  
</P>
<P>
 With that much time remaining and USC trailing, 17-13, Trojan quarterback 
Craig Fertig called a play thousands of Trojan alumni can still call: 
84Z-delay.  
</P>
<P>
 Fertig passed to Rod Sherman, who took the ball away from Notre Dame defensive 
back Tony Carey and scored, triggering one of the greatest Coliseum ovations 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the game recently, Fertig said he didn't see the play for which he 
is best remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have loved to have seen it, but I was laying on my back, seeing 
stars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lying on top of me was the future chief justice of the Minnesota Supreme 
Court. When I heard that roar from the crowd, I figured something good had 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Fertig meant Alan Page, the Notre Dame defensive end and future NFL star who 
in 1993 became Minnesota's top judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Notre Dame quarterback that day, John Huarte, had been awarded the Heisman 
Trophy the week of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 He was asked recently to recall the most vivid memory from his most painful 
loss at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sherman touchdown, I can well remember," he said. "But the play I 
remember most was my touchdown pass to Jack Snow in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sight of Jack stretched out parallel to the ground, making a great catch. 
. . . I ran off the field thinking, 'There's no stopping us now.' I was really 
excited, because we'd practiced that play all week and it worked exactly the 
way we wanted it to. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that play, we played with the momentum on our side. We were playing 
well and we were playing hard. We felt great at the half (leading, 17-0). Then 
it all got away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their unexpected victory, the Trojans tumbled from joy to despair in 
two hours. Thirty years later, many still feel the pain of learning in a South 
Gate restaurant that Oregon State, not USC, was Rose Bowl-bound.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were led to believe if we beat Notre Dame, we'd go to the Rose Bowl," 
Fertig said. "You talk about letting the air out of a victory party, that 
really did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Huarte, an Anaheim athlete who had played high school football at Santa Ana 
Mater Dei, sought solitude to ease the hurt.  
</P>
<P>
 Fertig had been a star at Huntington Park High, had known Huarte, and went 
into the Notre Dame locker room to seek out his old rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found him sitting on a stool, all alone, under a shower," Fertig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew how bad he felt, and I started to say something, but he waved me off 
and said, 'We had a hell of a run, and you spoiled it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, in John McKay's fifth season at USC, the Trojans were 6-3 at the 
start of Notre Dame week, having lost to Michigan State, Ohio State and 
Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Ara Parseghian was in his first year at Notre Dame, and in a season many had 
expected would be dedicated to rebuilding, the Irish streaked to nine 
consecutive victories. In fact, Notre Dame had had only one close game all 
season, a 17-15 victory at Pittsburgh.  
</P>
<P>
 No team had scored more than two touchdowns against a formidable Irish 
defense, which had posted three shutouts. Notre Dame had beaten UCLA at South 
Bend, 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
 And running the offense was a six-foot senior who as recently as spring 
practice had been either the fourth- or fifth-string quarterback, depending on 
who was doping the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
 The film "Rudy" was largely fiction. John Huarte's story is closer to the real 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews recently, Huarte, 51, and Fertig, 52, talked about 
events leading up to their final college game: JOHN HUARTE 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, it looked like I was going to be one of those high school 
stars who disappeared at Notre Dame. There've been a lot of those.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just never got to play under Joe Kuharich. My junior year, under Hugh 
Devore, I started one game. But I'd never even won a letter until my senior 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock, not getting to play. Like a lot of young athletes, I went to 
Notre Dame seeing myself as all-world. I'd never lost faith in my ability, but 
I was afraid I'd never get my chance.  
</P>
<P>
 "So when Ara came in (Parseghian replaced Devore after the 1963 season), 
things started to change in my favor.  
</P>
<P>
 "More and more in spring practice that year, I was running the first-team 
offense. One day in preseason practice, August or early September, I walked off 
the practice field with Ara and he put his arm around my shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'John, you're my quarterback. And I don't want you to worry if 
you make mistakes. I'm still going with you, no matter what.'  
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, I have no idea why he picked me. And I've never asked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an amazing year at Notre Dame.  
</P>
<P>
 "Under Kuharich and Devore (who had replaced Kuharich after the 1962 season), 
we hadn't even had a winning season. In the student newspaper, there was talk 
about de-emphasizing football at Notre Dame. That's how bad things really were. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, we're winning every weekend. We go 9-0. It was terribly 
exciting. That's what made the loss to SC so painful.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were really rolling on SC in the first half. We were mixing in some option 
stuff to our regular offense, and they hadn't expected that.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then they took some of what we were doing offensively away after the half.  
</P>
<P>
 "USC took the momentum away from us with their first drive of the second half, 
and we never got it back. I remember, all of a sudden Mike Garrett was getting 
eight, 10, 12 yards every carry. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the touchdown play that beat us, Tony Carey made a play for the ball, kind 
of a lunge, and he went down. It was a gamble on his part, on the kind of play 
where there's an awful big downside. It's a wide field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another clear memory I have is the look on Ara's face when we walked off the 
field. I still remember the shock on his face, that the national championship 
had slipped away from us. "We all got together for a 30-year reunion earlier 
this season at Notre Dame. All we talked about was that SC game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to a couple of guys, 'Do you realize if we'd won that game, we'd have 
nothing to talk about today?' " CRAIG FERTIG 
</P>
<P>
 "McKay was upset all week. I still don't know how it happened, but Notre Dame 
somehow wound up in our hotel, the Sheraton West. We always stayed there the 
Friday night before the home games, and McKay was really (angry) when he found 
out about it.  
</P>
<P>
 "He made a big thing in the meetings about it. 'They've kicked you out of your 
own hotel!' he said. We stayed at the Olympic hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morning of the game, we had the same thing for breakfast we always had 
under McKay -- steak, peas, dry toast and tea. He talked a little about the 
series and said that no matter what, he wanted us to remember this game the 
rest of our lives.  
</P>
<P>
 "He got that right. We did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyhow, the next thing is, we're in the bus, riding to the Coliseum. The 
starting quarterback always sits in the front row, with McKay, and goes over 
the game plan one last time.  
</P>
<P>
 "As we pulled into the Coliseum, I'll never forget McKay saying to me, 'Craig, 
remember one thing: There's a hell of a difference between being 10-0 and 9-1. 
The odds are with us today.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Notre Dame goes up, 17-0, in the first half, but we're not playing all 
that badly. We go up the tunnel thinking, 'Hey, they're not that great.'  
</P>
<P>
 "McKay comes in and says, 'Gentlemen, if we don't score more than 17 points, 
we're going to lose. We're getting the second-half kickoff. Let's take it down 
and go in for a score on the first drive. And remember, there're no rules 
against blocking.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We scored the first two times we had the ball after halftime, and at that 
point I was confident we were going to win the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "We dodged a bullet when Notre Dame got to our one and apparently scored on a 
run, but an official, Jack Springer, called holding on Notre Dame's Jack 
Meeker. That took them out to the 16 and they didn't get a score. 
</P>
<P>
 "On our films, we couldn't tell if it was a hold (Notre Dame coaches later 
said their films showed no infraction). All I can say is, thank God for Jack 
Springer. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night in 1984, in a Chicago restaurant, a guy comes up from behind me and 
starts shaking my shoulders and yelling, 'Gimme my national championship ring!' 
It was Meeker.  
</P>
<P>
 "We called a timeout before the winning play. We were at the Notre Dame 15, 
fourth and eight. There was 1:33 left.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sherman, who was a sophomore, came over to McKay and said, 'Coach, I can get 
open on 84Z-delay.' And McKay showed his strength as a coach. He listened to 
Rod, and said, 'OK, let's do it.'  
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, think about it! Sophomore receivers will tell you they've never been 
covered in their lives. But McKay listened to him.  
</P>
<P>
 "And Sherman really wanted the ball. He'd coughed up the ball twice in the 
first half on big hits. He deserved to win it for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sherman was in Carey's arms when he caught it on the two, but kind of 
squirmed away, as Carey fell down. We'd run Garrett in motion to the other 
side, helping make sure Sherman got one-on-one with Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got whacked by Page as soon as I threw it, and I really did see stars. I 
saw Page at the SC-Notre Dame game a year ago and he said, 'Watch out, I'm 
still just a half-step from you!'  
</P>
<P>
 "I got to the postgame party that night just before 6 o'clock. It was at 
Enoch's Restaurant in South Gate. I was in charge of the party and we'd chipped 
in to get beer and pop.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then we turn on the TV to hear about us getting the Rose Bowl bid, and 
there's Fred Hessler, the voice of the Bruins, as he's handed a bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says, 'This is a disgrace! Oregon State is going to the Rose Bowl!' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you talk about the air going out of a room, that did it. Some lawyers 
went out and wheeled in some champagne. The party got a little better after 
that.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've thought many times about that game, about how we got the momentum in the 
second half. It's an old coaching maxim that momentum never changes twice in a 
football game.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's chiseled in granite."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY MIGHT PLAY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Henley's injured hip isn't as bad as doctors originally thought, and 
the cornerback wouldn't rule out returning to practice and playing Sunday 
against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm preparing as though I'm playing this week," said Henley, who participated 
in a few drills Wednesday. "My target date to see if I can move around is 
Friday or Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days ago, doctors told Henley he could be out four weeks with a torn hip 
flexor. Coach Chuck Knox said there is a chance Henley, listed as out for the 
game on the injury report, could play Sunday. If not, Robert Bailey would 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley injured his hip late in the second quarter of the game last Sunday, and 
doctors originally thought he broke a bone in his hip and tore a muscle. But 
Henley said he pulled tendons in his hip and tore scar tissue from an injury 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors were looking at the preliminary results and saw a broken bone in 
my hip," he said. "After they looked at it more, they saw it wasn't swollen or 
any of the other things that come with a major hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't sit up on Monday, but Monday night I could. And by Tuesday, I was 
walking around and feeling a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams worked out without pads Wednesday because of a growing injury list 
that has reached 20 players, nearly 40% of their 53-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup quarterback Chris Chandler (sprained left ankle) shared time as the No. 
2 quarterback with Tommy Maddox in practice Wednesday. Chandler is listed as 
probable for Sunday and said his ankle is still bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Bern Brostek, out since Oct. 9 with a broken bone in his leg, returned 
to practice for the first time. Although hopeful he can play Sunday, Brostek 
doesn't figure to be back until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have been without three starting offensive linemen -- Brostek, right 
guard Leo Goeas (abdominal strain) and right tackle Jackie Slater (torn 
triceps). 
</P>
<P>
 Slater has blocked on field goals and extra points the last three weeks, but 
hasn't played on the offensive line since injuring his triceps in Week 6 at 
Green Bay. Slater is expected to play in his 256th NFL game Sunday, which would 
move him past Earl Morrall and into fourth on the league's all-time 
participation chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie is still not 100%," Knox said. "But he's getting better. He's very, 
very close." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said Goeas, out since the New Orleans game, practiced Wednesday and said 
he's ready to play. Knox said Goeas will start. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie James Bostic, a backup tailback, underwent surgery Tuesday on his 
fractured wrist. The Rams placed Bostic, a third-round pick who has been 
inactive all season, on injured reserve last week. Tailback Johnny Bailey 
(abdominal strain) is questionable for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego quarterback Stan Humphries, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on 
his non-throwing left elbow Monday, got limited work in practice Wednesday and 
should be ready to start against the Rams, Charger Coach Bobby Ross said. 
Charger center Courtney Hall (knee), guard Joe Cocozzo (foot) and tight end Al 
Pupunu (knee) are questionable. MIKE REILLEY

 No Troy Aikman. Probably no Reggie White. Which team can adjust? 
</P>
<P>
 The team that operates the best without its star player is the most likely to 
win the Thanksgiving Day game between the Dallas Cowboys (9-2) and the Green 
Bay Packers (6-5) at Irving, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman, the Dallas quarterback, will sit this one out because of a sprained 
left knee ligament. White, the Green Bay defensive end who has played in 148 
consecutive games, has a sprained elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, Packer Coach Mike Holmgren held out hope that White 
will play, changing his status from "out" to "doubtful." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas will also be without backup quarterback Rodney Peete (sprained right 
thumb). Third-stringer Jason Garrett, who started one game for the Cowboys last 
year, will start and Tommy Hodson will be the backup. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There will be a playoff atmosphere in Pontiac, Mich. in the first game of the 
day, because neither team can afford to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills (6-5), up and down all season, are one game behind Miami in 
the AFC East. The Detroit Lions (5-6), two games behind Minnesota in the NFC 
Central, face almost certain elimination from the playoff picture with another 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our playoffs started last week," Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly said. "We've 
talked about it a lot. That's what we've decided."

 Free safety Kevin Ross walked out on the Atlanta Falcons, apparently disturbed 
by the release of cornerback Vinnie Clark on Tuesday. Coach June Jones said he 
wasn't sure why Ross left the team after a morning meeting. . . . Vinny 
Testaverde got his job back, one day after Cleveland Brown owner Art Modell was 
quoted as saying he wouldn't put up with another quarterback controversy. Mark 
Rypien started the last three games after Testaverde sustained two concussions 
last month. "Now he's 100%, ready to go, and he'll start against Houston," 
Coach Bill Belichick said. "Vinny never lost his job because of performance. 
Vinny was hurt. Vinny's the starting quarterback." . . . Houston Oiler 
quarterback Cody Carlson will have surgery on his injured left knee and will be 
sidelined for the rest of the season. . .Redskin rookie quarterback Heath 
Shuler will start Sunday against the New York Giants for the first time since 
spraining his ankle on Oct. 16. Gus Frerotte had started since.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

 John McKay once said, "I tell our kids that if you don't get up for Notre 
Dame, you must be dead." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 John Robinson must be telling his kids the same thing this week. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at the Coliseum, USC will have an opportunity to break an 11-game 
losing streak against the Fighting Irish, upgrade its bowl possibilities and 
make it clear that the program is making Traveler-like strides. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson acknowledges that victories over Notre Dame and UCLA are needed to 
restore the Trojans' prestige, no matter how they perform during the rest of 
the season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play well against UCLA, and that's what bothers me the most," he 
said. "I can't remember many losses that I've taken harder." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson says the game that left him most devastated was a tie -- the 15-15 
draw with California during the Trojans' national championship season of 1974 
when Robinson was an assistant to McKay. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's game, beginning at 5 p.m. to accommodate ABC, has been a sellout 
since Oct. 11. The listed capacity of this Coliseum setup is 94,159. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame gets 15,000 tickets for games in L.A. and USC 5,000 for games at 
59,075-seat Notre Dame Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, the USC allotment is expected to be increased when 20,000 seats are 
added in South Bend, Ind., for the 1997 season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Young, a linebacker born in Dublin, Ireland, played on USC teams that 
were 1-2 against the Irish from 1965-67. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson still scoffs at the significance of the green jerseys the Joe 
Montana-led, national champion Irish wore during their 49-19 victory over the 
Trojans in 1977. "With the talent they had, they could have worn brown jerseys 
and won," Robinson said. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers (8-3) will test the Raiders for class Sunday at the 
Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have won four of their last five, but don't forget that the 
victories have been over New Orleans, the Rams, Houston and Atlanta. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This week's quarterback controversy belongs to the Steelers. Neil O'Donnell, 
who has been plagued by hip and ankle injuries, and Mike Tomczak, who passed 
for 343 yards in the win over Miami, are the participants. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Cowher says O'Donnell is the starter when he is "100% healthy," but 
Cowher may not decide who will start until just before kickoff. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will be playing a regular-season game at San Diego for only the 
second time Sunday. In 1975, they beat the Chargers, 13-10, in overtime. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Honest Abe award for the month goes to Denver running back Reggie Rivers, 
who admitted fumbling after catching a pass from John Elway during a decisive 
drive against Atlanta. The officials ruled that he had hit the ground before 
losing the ball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Football News has named USC tackle Tony Boselli and UCLA wide receiver 
Kevin Jordan to its All-American team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Terry Donahue and Craig Fertig, the former USC quarterback and 
assistant coach, were shown on TV shaking hands at midfield after the game 
Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't have to buy you lunch again," a smiling Donahue told Fertig. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They have an annual wager, the winner picking the restaurant and the loser 
picking up the tab. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Penn State can become the seventh Joe Paterno-coached team to finish a regular 
season unbeaten. That tells you a lot about Paterno's ability, his players' 
talent, and the Nittany Lions' schedules over the years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando, with Gary Stevens aboard, is expected to make his final start in 
the NYRA Mile at Aqueduct on Saturday before retiring to stud. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Four horses based in Southern California -- Sandpit, Raintrap, Grand Flotilla 
and Johann Quatz -- will compete in the world's richest race, the $3.6-million 
Japan Cup, in Tokyo on Saturday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya has taken up near full-time residence in Big Bear, where he 
will train for fights Dec. 10 against John Avila at the Grand Olympic, in early 
February, probably against Azumah Nelson, and May 6 against Rafael Ruelas. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell is well worth his $27.5-million, four-year contract with the 
Houston Astros. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Which Exposition Park tenant do you think will win more games this season, the 
Raiders or the Clippers?

<P>
 It's not easy to get center Don Mosebar off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell tried Sunday when Mosebar twisted his ankle and hurt his ribs 
against the New Orleans Saints at the Coliseum.When Mosebar appeared to be in 
pain, Shell sent in backup Dan Turk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got it," said Mosebar, waving Turk off. 
</P>
<P>
 Having started 85 games in a row, most among active Raiders, and having served 
as the latest iron-man Raider center, following Jim Otto and Dave Dalby, 
Mosebar wasn't about to voluntarily leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat out practice Wednesday, but has promised to be ready for Sunday's game 
at the Coliseum against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's any way he can play, he will," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turk knows better than anyone how tough it is to budge Mosebar. Turk has been 
waiting in the wings for 5 1/2 years as Mosebar's understudy. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Albert Lewis, who sat out the last two games because of a sprained 
right knee, returned to practice and is hoping to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow cornerback Lionel Washington, who sat out Sunday's game because of a 
bruised calf muscle, sat out practice as well and is questionable for Sunday.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY MIGHT BE READY BY SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE REILLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Henley's injured hip isn't as bad as doctors originally thought, and 
the cornerback wouldn't rule out returning to full practice later this week and 
playing in Sunday's game at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm preparing as though I'm playing this week," said Henley, who ran and 
participated in a few drills."My target date to see if I can move around is 
Friday or Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days ago, doctors told Henley he could be out for four weeks because of 
a torn hip muscle. Henley is listed as out for the game on the team's injury 
report, but Coach Chuck Knox said there is a chance Henley could play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has made a tremendous recovery," said Knox, who added that Robert Bailey 
would start in Henley's place if Henley isn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley injured his hip late in the second quarter of Sunday's game against San 
Francisco, and doctors originally thought he broke a bone in his hip and tore a 
muscle. But Henley said that he only pulled some tendons in his hip and tore 
scar tissue from an old hip injury.

 Rookie James Bostic, a backup tailback, underwent surgery Tuesday on his

season, on the injured-reserve list last week. MIKE REILLEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; SORRY, RASHAAN, BUT 2,055 YARDS TOO MUCH 
TO IGNORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time for awards banquets, tuxedos, cummerbunds, speeches and trophy hoisting. 
One hack's season-ending ballot: PLAYER OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 1. Rashaan Salaam, Colorado running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three other Division I-A players -- Mike Rozier, Barry Sanders and Marcus 
Allen -- gained 2,000 or more yards and each won the Heisman Trophy. Salaam 
gained more than half of his 2,055 yards against ranked teams, and his 6.9-yard 
average per carry is fourth best in NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not necessarily the most elusive type of guy, but he has great bursts of 
acceleration and a real home run ability," said John Becker, the director of 
player personnel for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Salaam had 10 games of at least 100 yards and four of at least 200. He 
also scored 24 touchdowns. Salaam may be the first Heisman candidate who ever 
said he didn't want to win the statuette. Too late. It's his. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Steve McNair, Alcorn State quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Put him on any Division I-A team, in any Division I-A conference and McNair 
still would be one of the three best players on the roster. Would he be the 
best player in the country? Uh. . . . Nonetheless, his Division I-AA statistics 
-- 44 touchdowns passing, nine touchdowns rushing, 4,863 yards passing, and 936 
yards rushing -- are mind-numbing and so is his talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of guy, if you were watching a game with your grandma, she 
would say, 'Who is that? ' " Becker said. "This guy dominates a game." 
</P>
<P>
 3. Jay Barker, Alabama quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 If intangibles counted, Barker would be the runaway winner. He is 34-1-1 as a 
starter and is the Crimson Tide's career leader in passing yardage and 
completions. He led undefeated Alabama to seven comeback victories this season, 
is ranked fourth in pass efficiency and has thrown only three interceptions 
among his 207 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the environment that he's in, at the school that he's at and the results 
that he's gotten, then I think you've got to consider him (as player of year)," 
said Tommy Bowden, Auburn's offensive coordinator and a friend of the Barker 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure on a quarterback there with Namath, with Stabler, with Sloan, 
with Scott Hunter, with Rutledge. . .you can go on and on -- 11 national 
championships at Alabama. How he's handled the pressure and the amount of 
criticism he's gotten is amazing. Not one year, not two years, not three years, 
but even at the beginning of this year, they wanted the other guy." 
</P>
<P>
 4. Warren Sapp, Miami defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said earlier this season, "Sapp ought to be 
illegal. He's practically unblockable." You'll get no argument from Miami's 10 
other opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He commands the double team, gets it, gets it a lot, and breaks the double 
team," Becker said. "A dominant defensive lineman." 
</P>
<P>
 5. A tie -- Lawrence Phillips, Nebraska I-back, Ki-Jana Carter, Penn State 
running back 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Phillips is blessed with the best offensive line in the country. Then 
again, the Cornhusker offensive line is blessed with the second-best running 
back in the country. Because of the early-season injury to quarterback Tommie 
Frazier, everyone keyed on Phillips. Even so, he has gained 1,672 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Carter: "He does everything effortlessly," Becker said. "He could have 
225 yards and hardly break a sweat. A complete back." 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: Kerry Collins, Penn State quarterback; Napoleon Kaufman, 
Washington running back; Dan Conley, Syracuse linebacker. COACH OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 1. Rich Brooks, Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the rest of the country knows what Pacific 10 coaches have realized for 
years -- Brooks is one of the best in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Bill Snyder, Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 This was one of the worst programs in America before Snyder's arrival. Thanks 
to no-nonsense, hyper-intense Snyder, the Wildcats are 8-2, ranked No. 11 and 
nearly pulled off upsets of Nebraska and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Fred Goldsmith, Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 An 8-3 record at Duke is like 11-0 anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Tom Osborne, Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so he's duller than a tax-law symposium. But Osborne is the ultimate 
professional, one of the few coaches capable of leading a Frazier-less team to 
the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Terry Bowden, Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
 He persuaded the Tigers to stay interested, despite a crippling two-year stay 
on NCAA probation. Auburn went 20-1-1 during that span and actually challenged 
for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: Gene Stallings, Alabama; Jeff Horton, Nevada Las Vegas; Ron 
McBride, Utah. UN-COACH OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 1. Gary Moeller, Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 He somehow wasted maybe the most talented roster in the country from top to 
bottom. See tape of Ohio State game for proof. 
</P>
<P>
 2. John Mackovic, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The eyes of Texas are burning a hole through Mackovic's 17-14-1 record -- 0-3 
against archrival Texas A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Bill Curry, Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never as dismal as it appears," Curry said after last Saturday's 52-0 
loss at Tennessee. In this case it might be. The likable Curry has endured 
death threats and 10 consecutive losses. This was supposed to be the 
breakthrough season for the Wildcats. Instead, Year No. 5 of the Kentucky 
rebuilding program is worse than Year No. 1. Curry went 4-7 in 1990, 1-10 in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Curley Hallman, Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong coach, wrong place, wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Bill Walsh, Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3-7-1 record? With that team? 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: Lou Holtz, Notre Dame; Larry Smith, Missouri; Steve 
Spurrier, Florida. SURPRISE OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 1. Colorado Coach Bill McCartney's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney has always marched to the beat of his own percussion section. 
Quirky, controversial, but a man of principle and too good a coach to stay 
retired for long. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Oregon and Rose Bowl in the same sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks earned every Rose petal. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Notre Dame fighting for a major bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-year quarterback. Injuries. A soft defense. An inexperienced offensive 
line. Off-the-field distractions. Notre Dame's would-be special season will 
have to wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 4. UCLA falling to pieces when J.J. Stokes got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Washington ending Miami's NCAA-record 58-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes still don't know what hit them. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: Undefeated Alabama defying logic and the law of averages; 
Florida quarterback Terry Dean, a midseason Heisman candidate, demoted to third 
string; Nebraska 24, Colorado 7; Auburn 36, Florida 33. WORST DECISION OF THE 
YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 1. Wisconsin running back Brent Moss and crack cocaine. From Rose Bowl MVP to 
drug arrest. And won't that impress the NFL scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Michigan captain Walter Smith announcing that the Wolverines were out to 
get Ohio State Coach John Cooper fired. Saying it the week of the Michigan-Ohio 
State game. The Wolverines lose, 22-6. Two days later, Cooper and the Ohio 
State administration start negotiating a contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Holtz's decision to approve a pass play in the waning seconds of the rout 
of Navy. The Irish scored on the throw and squeezed past the Midshipmen, 58-21. 
Holtz later wrote a letter of apology to Navy Coach George Chaump. 
</P>
<P>
 4. West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen's preseason grousing about the lack of 
respect given the Mountaineers, who promptly lost four of their first five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Hallman inexplicably calling pass play after pass play in the fourth 
quarter against Auburn, even though LSU led, 23-9. Auburn intercepted three of 
the passes, returned them for touchdowns and eventually won, 30-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorable mention: Sports Illustrated naming Arizona as its preseason No. 1; 
parts of our preseason top 25, in which we had Penn State No. 17 and Notre Dame 
No. 4. We also took fliers on Arizona State (No. 21) and Clemson (No. 24) and 
died a slow, agonizing death; Alabama's Stallings putting the shackles on 
Crimson Tide offensive coordinator Homer Smith. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 LSU Athletic Director Joe Dean returned Tuesday from an interview session with 
Terry Robiskie, the former Raider assistant who now is on Norv Turner's 
Washington Redskin staff. Robiskie was a star tailback for the Tigers in the 
1970s. Dean wants to hire a replacement for Hallman within two weeks. Among the 
other possibilities: New York Giant assistant Pete Mangurian, a former LSU 
offensive line coach; Duke's Goldsmith and Baylor's Chuck Reedy. Texas A&M's 
R.C. Slocum was mentioned as a candidate, but he took himself out of the 
running late last week. . . 
</P>
<P>
 All sorts of rumors are surfacing on the "real" reason why McCartney resigned 
at Colorado. School officials insist that he quit because he truly wanted to 
spend more time with his family. Most hilarious replacement rumor: Former 
Dallas Cowboy coach Jimmy Johnson. Colorado Athletic Director Bill Marolt 
almost burst out laughing at that one. More plausible choices: Vanderbilt's 
Gary DiNardo, Illinois' Lou Tepper, Northwestern's Gary Barnett, Denver Bronco 
assistant Les Steckel. All are former Colorado assistant coaches. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Salaam has said he would definitely return for his senior season if Buffalo 
offensive coordinator Elliot Uzelac or assistant head coach Bob Simmons were 
named as McCartney's successor. If not, Salaam said his chances of returning 
were 50-50. . .If 1-9 Georgia Tech loses to Georgia on Saturday, it will become 
the first Yellow Jacket team since 1904 -- the year John Heisman became coach 
-- to finish a season without a victory against a Division I-A team. Georgia 
Tech beat Division I-AA Western Carolina early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Bowl officials are telling people that the loser of Saturday's USC-Notre 
Dame game could wind up at El Paso for a Dec. 30 matchup against Texas, Baylor, 
Virginia or North Carolina State. Anything is possible in the goofy bowl 
coalition, which keeps changing the rules. Notre Dame supposedly was tied to 
the Cotton, Sugar, Orange or Fiesta if it finished 7-4. If it finished 6-5, the 
bowl and Notre Dame would have to mutually agree to an invitation -- and as 
recently as a week ago, the Irish were talking about staying home with a 6-5 
record. But that was last week. Now it appears Notre Dame would accept a Cotton 
or Sugar bid or possibly play in a non-Big Four bowl. Top 10

 Brad Holland had trouble seeing a light at the end of the tunnel at Cal State 
Fullerton after two seasons as basketball coach. So when the University of San 
Diego job opened in September, Holland grabbed his bags, which some suspect he 
had never unpacked, and was on his way.  
</P>
<P>
 That left the job to his top assistant, Bob Hawking, hired on an interim basis 
by new Athletic Director John Easterbrook, who walked in the same day Holland 
walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Hawking finds himself peering into that same dark tunnel, perhaps 
wondering if there's anything in there other than an onrushing locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess every basketball magazine around has picked us to finish last in the 
Big West Conference, so we know we're going to have a challenge ahead of us," 
Hawking said. The Titans also were picked to finish last by both conference 
coaches and reporters in separate preseason polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge, for certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking was Don MacLean's coach in high school at Simi Valley, but he doesn't 
have anyone of MacLean's ability to build a team around this year at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 And the players who do return are from a team that was 8-19, the school's 
worst record since the Titans won only four games in the 1981-82 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's best player is senior Winston Peterson, a 6-foot-6, 235-pound 
center. He led the team in scoring, rebounding and shooting last season. 
Peterson averaged 15.3 points, 7.5 rebounds and shot 53.7% from the field. Not 
bad, although Hawking says he has high expectations for Peterson this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's third-leading scorer last season, forward Darren Little, stumbled 
academically in the spring and was not readmitted in the fall. He averaged 11.7 
points and was third on the team in rebounding. And forward Josh King, who 
showed promise as a freshman, transferred to Rhode Island.  
</P>
<P>
 Another returning starter, guard James French, a transfer from Washington who 
averaged 9.1 points last season, will be a key player as Hawking tries to speed 
up the offense. French has quickness and his success igniting the fast break 
could be telling. 
</P>
<P>
 More turnovers have followed the faster pace in the preseason.  
</P>
<P>
 "To some degree, that goes with developing more of an up-tempo game," Hawking 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hawking hopes the other returning regular, wiry forward David Frigout, will be 
significantly improved over his first year in American college basketball after 
transferring from Groupe Pigier University in Evreux, France, last year. The 
more physical American game made for a difficult adjustment, and he still has 
problems defensively against forwards who play with power. Frigout has been 
prone to fouling.  
</P>
<P>
 What has pleased Hawking is the greater depth the team has shown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some really intense battles for the starting positions," Hawking 
said. "And I think we're going to be playing eight to 10 guys on a fairly 
regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
 It's likely the Titans will have three guards in the lineup at times as 
Hawking emphasizes the faster pace. Chuck Overton, a first team All-American at 
Salt Lake City Community College last season, already has shown he can help. 
Junior Ali Nayab, sophomore Chris St. Clair and redshirt freshman Chris Dade 
also figure into the mix at guard. So will senior Danny Robinson if he regains 
academic eligibility at the start of the new semester.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior Fred Amos and redshirt freshman DeVaughn Wright are the other inside 
players who will play.  
</P>
<P>
 Hawking has been particularly pleased with the play of Amos, who has been 
challenging Peterson for the center spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking just shrugs off the negative karma that swirls around the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 The dire predictions don't seem to unsettle him as the season opener Tuesday 
against Cal State Northridge, his alma mater, nears.  
</P>
<P>
 By March, however, Hawking could either be riding that train out of the 
tunnel, or just be another Fullerton coach run over by it. Fullerton Facts and

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; LONG BEACH STATE; QUESTION MARKS GREET 
49ERS AND TEMPER EARLY EXCITEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were eager to open their new place in style. Then one cast member got 
some bad advice, and he's still digging his way out. 
</P>
<P>
 And just when it looked as if this production was back on track, a potential 
show-stopper went down and out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Seth Greenberg, men's basketball coach at Long Beach State, envisioned a 
different beginning to his team's first season in the Pyramid, the university's 
5,000-seat on-campus arena scheduled to open Wednesday when the 49ers play host 
to Detroit Mercy. But this is the hand Greenberg has been dealt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still real excited about our team," said Greenberg, starting his fifth 
season as the 49ers' coach. "I think our depth is real solid, and that will 
help us, but we've got some big questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Three starters and six lettermen returning from a 17-10 team -- and the 
positive impact of the Pyramid on recruiting -- had Greenberg feeling 
especially good only a few weeks ago. The 49ers, who tied for second in the Big 
West Conference last season, were picked to finish third behind New Mexico 
State and Nevada Las Vegas in the preseason media poll. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems have mounted -- quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Greenberg had to tinker with the lineup because of the ineligibility of 
senior point guard Tye Mays, an occasional starter last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays is in good academic standing, but school officials mistakenly advised him 
about selecting the proper courses in order to remain eligible. The NCAA 
Eligibility Committee is expected to soon rule on his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 An even bigger blow fell last Friday. Starting shooting guard James Cotton, 
the Big West freshman of the year last season, crashed to the floor in an 
exhibition game and will be sidelined indefinitely because of torn ligaments in 
his left ankle. Cotton, who averaged 11.4 points and 4.2 rebounds, said he 
would consider being redshirted if he is sidelined more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton was to have been the focus of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one person is going to replace James Cotton," Greenberg said. "We're going 
to try to do this by committee and hope that somebody steps up." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton's injury might open the door for junior guard Eric Brown, a skilled 
offensive player with great shooting range. He needs to improve his defense, 
though, and play more within Greenberg's system. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the 49ers' prospects are far from bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forwards Mike Atkinson and Terrance O'Kelley were two of the 
conference's best at their positions last season. Atkinson made 141 of 203 
shots, led Division I players in field-goal percentage at 69.5% and averaged 
15.4 points and 4.3 rebounds. He was selected second-team all-conference. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Kelley, a third-team pick, scored 11.9 points and led the 49ers in 
rebounding, with a 6.8 average, and blocked shots, 2.2. Greenberg has 
challenged him to play stronger near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching staff raves about versatile junior forward Juaquin Hawkins. The 
49ers' sixth man as a sophomore, Hawkins plays standout defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Rebounding was a team weakness last season. Long Beach finished ninth in the 
conference, averaging 35.4 a game. Senior center Joe McNaull, a transfer from 
San Diego State, should help. 
</P>
<P>
 Redshirt freshman forward Akeli Jackson figures to be a key player for the 
49ers in the future, but packs only 220 pounds on his 6-foot-8 frame and must 
add weight and strength to become the force Greenberg foresees. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is battling for minutes with junior forward Brian Yankelvitz, a 
transfer from Garden City Community College in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg is pleased with junior point guard Rasul Salahuddin, who is expected 
to start. A tenacious defender, Salahuddin transferred from Dixie College in 
St. George, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior point guard Jamie Davis, a transfer from Long Beach City College, 
impresses Greenberg with his physical style and might get considerable playing 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Everett Ratleff, nephew of former 49er star Ed Ratleff, is competing 
with Davis. And Long Beach is the fourth college for well-traveled senior Frank 
Harris, who was at Stanford last season. Harris is currently ineligible, but 
he, too, might eventually be in the mix at point guard. Long Beach Facts and

BIG WEST CONFERENCE / THE OTHER TEAMS; AGGIES FAVORED, BUT CONTENDERS EXIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Big West basketball coaches are talking parity again, and this time it might 
be more than empty rhetoric. In their preseason poll, four teams got 
first-place votes, although six coaches picked New Mexico State to repeat as 
conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies, who have won an average of 24 games over the last six seasons and 
made the NCAA tournament six times in a row, might be in for a fight as they 
seek a third consecutive Big West title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a relatively slender team and definitely short," said Aggie Coach Neil 
McCarthy, who has taken over for Jerry Tarkanian as the conference's answer to 
Lou Holtz. "There are seven teams that could win this conference. I'm telling 
you, this league is up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven might be a stretch. But Nevada Las Vegas, where ticket sales are booming 
and new Coach Tim Grgurich is brooding; Long Beach State, with the power of 
it's new Pyramid arena and six returning lettermen, and Utah State, with all 
five starters including seven-foot Nate Wickizer back, all appear to be 
legitimate contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich, who replaced the embattled Rollie Massimino on Oct. 22, says he 
can't tell his players without a program -- "We have four starters returning . 
. . from what I've read in the papers" -- but he undoubtedly likes what he 
sees, especially in NBA-bound center Kebu Stewart, the Big West player of the 
year last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This conference is much stronger than it was last year," San Jose State Coach 
Stan Morrison said. "And I think we'll be sending that message throughout the 
nation during the preseason." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at the Big West, excluding Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State 
and UC Irvine: NEVADA 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 11-7, 6-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference finish: Eighth (tie). 
</P>
<P>
 One publication rated Nevada's recruiting class No. 21 in the nation and Coach 
Pat Foster says he won't consider the season a success unless the Wolf Pack 
wins 17 games. Junior college transfers Faron Hand, a 6-7, 260-pound center, 
and Daniel Watts, a 6-8 forward, will join returning second-team all-conference 
picks Jimmy Moore, a 6-8 forward who averaged 19 points, and point guard Eathan 
O'Bryant, who averaged 12 points and eight assists. NEVADA LAS VEGAS 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 15-15, 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference finish: Fifth (tie).

 The Rebels' starting five is probably the conference's best, but depth, 
especially up front, is a problem. Stewart, who averaged 19 points and 12 
rebounds, will be joined up front by returning senior Patrick Savoy, a 27-game 
starter last season. Shooting guard Reggie Manuel, an all-conference first-team 
selection who averaged 17 points, is also back, as is point guard Jermaine 
Smith. NEW MEXICO STATE

<P>
 1993-94 record: 23-8, 12-6.

<P>
 Conference finish: First. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies will be small up front, sure, but they'll also be quick and will 
probably grab a couple hundred more rebounds than their opponents, as usual. 
Three senior starters return -- center Johnny Selvie and guards Keith Johnson 
and Rodney Walker -- and McCarthy has brought in his usual crop of talented 
community college transfers. PACIFIC 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 17-14, 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference finish: Fifth (tie). 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers have one senior and two juniors, but Coach Bob Thomason says he 
wouldn't trade his two sophomore guards -- Adam Jacobsen and T.J. Walker -- for 
"any other guards in the nation." There is a downside to Pacific's youth 
movement, however. Gone are the top three scorers from last season, who 
accounted for more than half the team's points. And Charles Jones, a 6-5 
forward, is the only returning front-line player who averaged more than 11 
minutes a game. SAN JOSE STATE 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 15-12, 11-7.

 The bad news? The Spartans play seven of eight nonconference games on the 
road. The good news? Morrison figures he will know "who the real competitors in 
this program are" by the time Big West play starts. Last season was Morrison's 
first winning season in five at San Jose State, but only two starters are back. 
And center Mike Brotherton and forward Darren Greene averaged only 14 points 
and nine rebounds, combined. UC SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 13-7, 9-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference finish: Sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara committed almost 100 more turnovers than its opponents last 
year, but the maturation of former walk-on Phillip Turner and Tecon Madden at 
point guard should help remedy that. The Gauchos need to improve their outside 
shooting to make it into the conference's upper echelon and Coach Jerry Pimm 
has recruited Danny Prince, a 6-1 guard who led the nation with 182 
three-pointers last season at Antelope Valley College. UTAH STATE 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94 record: 14-13, 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference finish: Second (tie). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our talent isn't going to overwhelm anybody," Coach Larry Eustachy said. "But 
we have the depth, character and chemistry to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies also have size. Seven-footer Nate Wickizer will be a force at both 
ends of the court if he can stay injury-free. Brother Jon, 6-8, and junior Eric 
Franson, 6-7, a second-team all-conference pick last season, are two 
blue-collar forwards. Also returning are point guard Roddie Anderson and 
off-guard Corwin Woodard, who combined to average 23 points.

 Ryan Roskelly feels slightly cheated -- but he's not looking for pay-back. 
After all, it's kind of hard for him to exact revenge when the culprit is, 
well, himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Roskelly, a not-so-fleet junior receiver, sold himself short after 
transferring from Fullerton College to Memphis in January. Roskelly figured the 
best he could hope for was to contribute a little while attempting to make the 
transition from community college to Division I-A football. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the entire season, made weekly highlight-tape catches, broke 
records and was the Tigers' leading receiver. This from a guy who started 
spring practice third on the depth chart. A smooth, successful transition 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really surprised myself," said Roskelly, who played at Valencia High. "I 
always knew I could play at this level, but no way did I think I could break 
records -- I never dreamed of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Roskelly led Memphis in receptions with 44. The rest of the team caught 73. He 
also topped the Tigers' list in receiving yards (602) and receiving touchdowns 
(three). 
</P>
<P>
 He returned 40 punts for 468 yards and one touchdown, breaking Russell 
Copeland's single-season records of 37 returns and 351 yards set in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In only his second game as a Tiger, Roskelly, 20, set the tone for the season 
with a dazzling all-purpose performance Sept. 10 at Tulsa. He set single-game 
records with 194 yards in 10 punt returns and 368 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
 His 174 receiving yards rank second on that list, and he scored on a 70-yard 
punt return. It seems safe to say Roskelly's performance had something to do 
with the Tigers' 42-18 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis finished 6-5, but blew its chance to play in the Liberty Bowl with a 
30-6 season-ending loss to East Carolina on Saturday. Roskelly did his part, 
though, catching eight passes for 91 yards -- both game-high stats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to end that way," Roskelly said. "We win that game and we go to a 
bowl, and that's what we play the season for." 
</P>
<P>
 On a personal level, however, things went much better than expected. Roskelly 
(5 feet 11 and 175 pounds) seriously wondered if he could keep pace with his 
new competition because of his lack of speed. Roskelly said he covers 40 yards 
in about 4.6 seconds, which does not place him among the nation's fastest 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard all these stories about 250-pound linebackers running 4.3s in 
Division I," he said. "Everyone is a little faster compared to the JC level, 
but the same hitting is going on. It hasn't been bad." 
</P>
<P>
 And next season? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm going to have to set my goals a little higher than I did this 
season," Roskelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, much higher would seem in order. 
</P>

 Cristin Rossman believed the San Jose State women's volleyball team would have 
a great season. And although things didn't turn out exactly the way she 
thought, Rossman can be proud of a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossman, formerly of Marina High, was chosen Big West Conference player of the 
week after leading the Spartans to an upset of Pacific on Saturday. Rossman 
(6-0) had a team-high 17 kills and four aces in San Jose State's 15-11, 15-13, 
17-15 upset of Pacific, which is ranked 10th in the nation by Volleyball 
Monthly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossman also played well in a 15-10, 12-15, 15-4, 15-8 nonconference victory 
over Sacramento State on Friday. She had a triple-double with 21 kills, 10 digs 
and 10 total blocks. Rossman, an all-county soccer player at Marina, is ninth 
in the conference with an average of 1.12 blocks per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited about (the award)," she said. "I knew I had a good week, 
but, honestly, I didn't really think about getting it. It was something I hoped 
I'd achieve in my career." 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State is 17-11, 10-8 in the Big West. Pacific (21-5, 14-4) finished 
tied for third and the Spartans are fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beating (Pacific) in our last conference home game was overwhelming," Rossman 
said. "We were always the team that almost beat the big teams. The seniors were 
totally speechless."

ARE RAMS' BETTIS, CHARGERS' MEANS RUNNING DOWN?; FOOTBALL: THEY STARTED FAST AS 
THE WORKHORSES OF THEIR TEAMS. BUT LATELY THEY'VE BEEN STUMBLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram linebacker Shane Conlan had just finished studying game film of Natrone 
Means on Wednesday when he was asked if the San Diego running back reminds him 
of any other NFL back he has faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that guy Conlan sees in practice every day? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he's a lot like Jerome Bettis," Conlan said. "He can run over you, and 
he can make you miss. When you think he's going to make you miss and you stand 
there and dance with him, he'll run over you." 
</P>
<P>
 Means and Bettis are the new wave of running back in the NFL -- big, powerful, 
quick and speedy. A middle linebacker's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are 22 and were among the top running backs taken in the 1993 draft, 
Bettis second overall and Means fourth. Both have reached 1,000 yards in a 
season as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
 And while both have excelled in their rookie and sophomore seasons in the NFL, 
they have found little running room lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, 5 feet 11 and 243 pounds, gained 1,429 yards as a rookie but has 
ground to a halt in his last six games, failing to reach 100 yards while 
running behind an offensive line missing three starters who are injured.  
</P>
<P>
 He had a goal of reaching 2,000 yards, but through 11 games, he has only 856 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Means, 5-10 and 240 pounds, is fourth in the NFL with 1,006 yards, becoming 
the first Charger back to gain at least 1,000 yards in three years. But Means 
has rushed for only 55 and 59 yards in the last two weeks, and has scored only 
one touchdown in the past five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-time or burnout? Which direction are these running backs headed? 
</P>
<P>
 "Natrone's the one getting pounded," said Ram safety Marquez Pope, Means' 
teammate last season in San Diego. "It used to be Marion Butts, and now it's 
Natrone. And being young, can his body absorb all those lethal hits all the 
time?" 
</P>
<P>
 A good question. Although both backs are capable of wearing down other teams, 
maybe it's the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 After carrying the ball 35 times at Kansas City and 29 times against Atlanta, 
Bettis feared the workload would wear him down and he couldn't maintain the 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't. Between rushing and receiving, Bettis has touched the ball on 279 
of the Rams' 639 plays (43.6%). He has carried the ball only 25 times in the 
last two games, averaging fewer than two yards a carry, as the Rams rely more 
on their passing game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not frustrating because I know the reason for it," Bettis said of his 
decreased workload. "It's a situation where we've been plagued with injuries. 
You have to accept that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a toll on you, but you have to fight through it. It's a game where 
you are going to get hurt at some period in time, and you have to rise above 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Means carried the ball on 274 of San Diego's 704 plays (39%) but has only 36 
carries in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all right," Means said. "I'm not all beat up. I'm holding up well." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he think his current pace will lead to a shorter career? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess that's something I'll have to worry about if it comes," he said. "I 
can't say I don't want the ball, because I do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Oilers kept pounding Earl Campbell into the line and he lasted 
only seven seasons. Butts has lost a step or two with the New England Patriots 
after carrying the workload in San Diego for five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Conlan doesn't think Means shares that destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Means hasn't taken a lot of hard shots," he said. "Jerome has taken some 
shots, but we have some line problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Means is an athletic guy. He's not like a Butts or a Campbell, he has some 
quicks. He's a big guy so you think he's a power guy like Butts was. But he's 
better than Butts because he can make you miss." 
</P>
<P>
 George Dyer, the Rams' defensive coordinator, said Means and Bettis have a 
combination of size and quickness that make them unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has evolved to the point that some of those guys, well, they're almost 
freaks," Dyer said. "The size doesn't bother you as much, but coupled with 
their quick feet, that's the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard went shopping for a back with those 
characteristics in 1993. Butts was wearing down, and Beathard needed a 
workhorse similar to John Riggins, one of the featured backs during his years 
with the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers thought enough of Means to trade a future No. 1 pick to move up 
in the second round to get him. They signed him to a four-year deal worth $1.5 
million and groomed him for a season under Butts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram scouts said they liked Means when he came out of North Carolina, but 
instead drafted Bettis with the 10th-overall pick. Means was the fourth running 
back taken behind Arizona's Garrison Hearst, Bettis and Minnesota's Robert 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Means upset he wasn't taken in the first round? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sit here and say I was . . ., " he said. "I've come out and proven my 
point. Put up my numbers compared to the other first-round guys, and I have 
proven that people should be thinking, 'What if . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 As his rookie season wore on, Means went from backup to the back carrying the 
ball in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, Butts, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, 
stayed on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Means rushed for 645 yards and led the team with eight touchdowns, enough to 
convince Beathard of his potential. Butts was traded on draft day last April, 
and Means became the man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natrone works hard," Pope said. "In the beginning, people questioned his 
weight problem and he was upset about that. But now he has slimmed down and is 
happy with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They needed a fresh start. Butts has been there, and they wanted someone who 
could hit the hole faster. And Natrone can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Means has proved himself as the Chargers' blue-collar back, grinding and 
pounding between the tackles for every inch. But does he deserve to be 
mentioned in the league's upper-crust of running backs -- with players such as 
Detroit's Barry Sanders, Dallas' Emmitt Smith and Buffalo's Thurman Thomas? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can throw my name in there this year," Means said. "But as far as guys who 
have been doing it for years, guys like Emmitt and Thurman, I wouldn't throw my 
name in the same breath as them." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Coach Bobby Ross said Means is among the league's elite now -- and 
will be in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in the same mold as Bettis," Ross said. "They're two of the better young 
backs in the NFL, and they're in a unique situation as far as being complete 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan was asked how a middle linebacker can stop a "complete player" such as 
Means. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to get people up in there and make him run to the outside," 
Conlan said. "If he hits those holes inside, it's tough to stop him. The front 
four or five guys really have to play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Pope agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to key up on him just like they do Jerome," he said. "When 
you have a good back, you have to take him out some way or another. He can hurt 
you, just like Jerome can hurt you. And people know that." Running Uphill

LEE TAKES THE LEAD; STANFORD SCHOLARSHIP SECURED, NORTH HOLLYWOOD GUARD STEPS 
UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BRESNAHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's December 1992, and Arthur Lee is surrounded by the bright lights and 
alluring casinos of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Lee can't gamble, there are glitzy shows, glamorous people and all 
sorts of good times on the neon horizon. Even for a high school kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's why Coach Steve Miller is conducting a bed check during a 
nonleague tournament for his North Hollywood High boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller goes door to door in the hotel, teasing players about their night stand 
mints and turned-up bedsheets before arriving at Lee's room. 
</P>
<P>
 Star guard Fantasia Johnson looks up from his video game and points to his 
roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 There, lying in bed (after all, it is almost lights out) is Lee, a basketball 
under one arm and an SAT prep book nestled in his other. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson rolls his eyes and protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never want to room with this guy again," he says. "He's the most boring 
human being I've ever been around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's nearly two years later, and North Hollywood will soon be going to the 
same annual tournament. Johnson has since graduated, as has three-time all-city 
selection Damon Ollie, leaving Lee, now a senior, as the team leader.  
</P>
<P>
 The team's nucleus isn't the only apparent change: Lee now wears an earring in 
each lobe, sports Shaquille O'Neal sideburns and, at first glance, has become 
living testimony to his nickname, Silk. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the inside, Arthur Monroe Lee III is still Arthur Monroe Lee III. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite non-basketball activities -- brace yourself -- are watching TV 
and catching a movie. Even when Lee socializes on a Saturday night, there are 
other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might go out with us, but he'll study late at night when he goes home," 
says close friend Jimmy Sanders. "Sometimes he's up until 2 or 3 o'clock in the 
morning studying." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that so? 
</P>
<P>
 "My life is a little boring, I guess," Lee says with a smile. "All I do is 
play basketball and study. 
</P>
<P>
 "And hang out with my friends when I get the chance. That's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 His focus is on basketball and academics, a somewhat unusual combination. 
</P>
<P>
 In every school, every neighborhood, there's the whispered story of the kid 
with all the talent in the world. Man, how he could shoot the rock, dribble 
single-handedly through the press and throw passes between his legs in traffic. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 But he couldn't draw iron on his SAT scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee defies the notion of a one-dimensional athlete. The point guard scores in 
the classroom (a near-4.0 grade-point average) and on the court (17.7 points 
and 4.5 assists per game last season).  
</P>
<P>
 He signed early for a full-ride scholarship to Stanford, proving that studying 
textbooks as well as playbooks can translate into more calls from coaches 
during recruiting season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've kind of earmarked him since the ninth grade," says Stanford Coach Mike 
Montgomery, who signed the 6-foot-1, 175-pound Lee on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "Way back when, somebody said to keep an eye on this kid, he's going to be a 
good player. And he's a 4.0 student." 
</P>
<P>
 The type of player who raises the pulse of a coach at a top-notch academic 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we looked around at our needs, there wasn't a better prospect in the 
country," continues Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a perfect fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee might have learned from former teammates Johnson and Ollie, who never 
found that perfect fit and are currently playing at the junior college level. 
</P>
<P>
 When the opportunity with Stanford arose, Lee snared it. Ahead of Arizona, 
Boston College and USC, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those hours of studying and practicing paid off," Lee says. "I've been 
thinking about (a scholarship) since ninth grade and it's all finally worked

 This season, which has yet to unfurl, will be another challenge.  
</P>
<P>
 A complementary player in the past, he now runs the show. The success of North 
Hollywood, a Valley power, hinges greatly on Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to step up for our team to be successful," says Miller. "If he doesn't 
step up, our team won't be successful. We'll go from a good team to an average 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's up for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm cool with it and everybody else has been reacting positively to it," he 
says. "I'm looking to have fun, win games and hopefully get us to the Sports 
Arena for the City championships."

THE COLLEGES / FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ; TIME TO COUNT THEIR BLESSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As they gather around their dinner tables today, some area sports people might 
want to offer these extra thanks under their breaths: 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge offensive guard Jonathan Beauregard for lawyers . . . and 
a timid administration at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge women's basketball Coach Kim Chandler for not having to play 
another team barely out of puberty. Two weeks ago, the Matadors lost an 
exhibition game to the Australian Institute of Sports, 83-53. Four Australian 
players were 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on the Aussies. They ought to pick on someone their own size . . . and 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark wide receiver Isaiah Mustafa for great hands -- 66 receptions, a 
school single-season record -- to go with his blazing speed and nifty name. 
They all make for a Division I work-in-progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran athletic officials for the wisdom to hire James Park as women's 
volleyball coach. This season, Park's second, the Regals won the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with an 11-1 record and advanced 
to the finals of the NCAA Division III West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge women's volleyball players and fans for first-year Coach Lian Kang 
Lu. The former coach of the Chinese Junior Olympic girls' volleyball program 
has the Matadors (17-8) in line for an invitation to the NCAA Division I 
playoffs. The 32-team field will be announced Sunday. Lu got the job done 
without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard men's and women's basketball teams for finally getting their own 
on-campus gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley football Coach Jim Fenwick for quarterback Jim Arellanes. The transfer 
from Northern Arizona set a school single-season passing record with 3,408 
yards and will go for more when the Monarchs (9-1) face Rancho Santiago (9-1) 
in the Orange County Bowl on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes for wide receiver Brian Comer. The former Chatsworth High 
quarterback shattered the Valley career receiving record with 129 catches, 45 
more than Rob Mottram's 84 receptions in 1970-71. With the bowl game remaining, 
Comer has 71 receptions this year for 1,548 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark basketball Coach Al Nordquist for the Twin Towers, Paul and Nick 
Foster. The 6-foot-8 forwards will make the Raiders top contenders for the 
Western State Conference North Division title. Paul is averaging 23.3 points 
and Nick 18.3 for the Raiders (2-1), who last Saturday lost to top-ranked L.A. 
City, 72-71. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge football Coach Bob Burt, who seems perpetually perplexed about 
anything happening with the team, for the end of another unsettling season. 
</P>
<P>
 The whining Northridge football players for being associated with a rinky-dink 
program that tolerated their tantrums instead of bouncing them out. Can't you 
just picture Lou Holtz around this group? 
</P>
<P>
 Area junior college men's basketball coaches for those tall fellows from other 
states -- and countries -- who magically keep showing up at their doorsteps 
even though recruiting is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale men's soccer Coach Joe Agoston for those guys who dribble with their 
feet instead of their hands and who wanted to play for the Vaqueros this 
season. About 80 players tried out for the team. The ones who made it are 
riding an unbeaten season (15-0-5) as they prepare to meet Rancho Santiago on 
Saturday in a Southern California Regional game. The winner will advance to the 
state championships Dec. 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark football Coach Jim Bittner for having a team good enough to give him 
his 100th victory. The Raiders (8-2) won the North Division of the Western 
State Conference for the third consecutive season and will face Cerritos (7-3) 
in the Strawberry Bowl at Cerritos on Dec. 3.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; WALTERS CHASES 1,000 YARDS

<P>
 A 100-yard game by tailback Shawn Walters on Saturday against Notre Dame would 
give him a 1,000-yard season. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters has been slowed the last two games because of a cracked thumb.In his 
absence, backup Leonard Green had 92- and 86-yard games against Arizona and 
UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC is 5-9 against unranked Notre Dame teams. USC hasn't played one since 
1986, when Lou Holtz's first team won, 38-37, on John Carney's field goal at 
the final gun. That was also the last time USC began the game with a better 
record than the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This Notre Dame team is the first under Holtz to have more touchdowns passing 
than running. The Irish have 20 touchdown passes and 17 running touchdowns. . . 
. Saturday's game will be Holtz's 108th as Notre Dame's coach. The only Irish 
coaches with more are Knute Rockne (122) and Ara Parseghian (116). . . . John 
Robinson is the third former NFL coach Notre Dame will meet this season. The 
others: Stanford's Bill Walsh and Boston College's Dan Henning. . . . After 
Saturday, Notre Dame will have played before sellout crowds in 67 of its last 
76 games. . . . Third-string sophomore receiver Scott Sollmann batted .402 for 
the Irish baseball team last spring, then asked Holtz if he could be a walk-on 
football player. He made the team and was awarded a football scholarship. He 
has one catch in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame Stadium hasn't given the Irish much of a home-field advantage 
lately. Of their last 10 losses, seven have come at home. The 59,075-seat 
stadium, virtually unchanged since it opened in 1930, will undergo expansion 
beginning next year. About 20,000 seats will be added. . . . Notre Dame has 
scored on 35 of 43 trips inside the 20-yard line. USC is 38 for 42. EARL

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NATION; MCCARNEY HIRED AT IOWA 
STATE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan McCarney, who helped rebuild sagging football programs at Iowa and 
Wisconsin, accepted the challenge of trying to do the same at Iowa State -- 
this time as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarney, 41, became the 29th football coach at Iowa State, which has had only 
three winning seasons in the last 16 years and was one of only two Division I-A 
teams that didn't win this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first head coaching job for McCarney, who was defensive coordinator 
at Wisconsin the last five years and an assistant at Iowa for 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarney replaces Jim Walden, who resigned under pressure Nov. 3 after eight 
seasons. Iowa State finished 0-10-1 this season and was 28-57-3 under Walden, 
who had only one winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarney got a five-year contract worth $300,000 annually, including a 
$135,000 base salary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA accepted Houston's proposal of minor sanctions as punishment for 
several rules violations during the tenure of football coach John Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA agreed with school findings that Jenkins' staff made improper contact 
with recruits and provided one player a scholarship when he did not meet 
minimum academic standards. There was also an allegation that one player was 
given free furniture. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A Milwaukee judge ruled there was sufficient evidence to try Wisconsin 
defensive lineman John Todryk on a drug charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Todryk, 20, was charged last week with selling nearly an ounce of cocaine to 
an undercover drug agent in March. He has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge carries penalties of three to 20 years in prison and a fine of 
$500,000.

UNEMPLOYMENT CHECK 'HELPS PAY RENT' FOR DUCKS' MCSWEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unemployment claim filed because of the NHL lockout by the Mighty Ducks' 
Don McSween has been approved, and McSween received his first benefits check 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 McSween filed his claim Oct. 2, the Monday after the season was supposed to 
begin, under California law that makes locked-out employees eligible for 
unemployment benefits.This week, he received a check covering three weeks at 
the maximum benefit of $230 a week, payable to workers making the equivalent of 
a little less than $30,000 a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my position, I feel like I've got to make use of everything available to 
me," said McSween, 30, who was a career minor leaguer making $30,000-$50,000 a 
year before he broke in with the Ducks last season, making about $100,000. Last 
summer, he agreed to a contract that was to pay him about $300,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pay into the system and are eligible to make a claim, and obviously they 
feel we are eligible (because the California Employment Development Department 
approved the claim)," he said. (Unemployment benefits are actually paid by 
employer payroll taxes.) "I'd hoped hockey would be going by now, but this 
helps pay the rent. If the season is canceled, then I'll go look for other 
work. But as long as my ability to work in my field is stymied and I'm not 
working, I'm eligible for benefits for 26 weeks."

THEY'RE COUNTING ON MCGRAW; FOOTBALL: LAGUNA HILLS TEAMMATES LEAN HEAVILY ON 
STAR RUNNING BACK, WHO HAS SET RECORDS THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 People are counting, Brendan McGraw. People close to you. 
</P>
<P>
 It's last Friday and Laguna Hills was getting ready for its Southern Section 
Division VIII football playoff game. McGraw, the Hawks' standout running back, 
needs three touchdowns to set an Orange County record. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows this because his linemen tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 It's lunch Tuesday and McGraw has the record after a four-touchdown 
performance. But a legend's work is never done. He needs only a couple hundred 
yards to set the county single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows this because an assistant coach tells him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad people have faith in me," McGraw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith? These are true believers. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to forgive them that wee bit of fanaticism. People have been waiting 
for this. McGraw's ticker-tape season was only a matter of time. Everyone who 
knew him knew that. 
</P>
<P>
 His yards -- 2,324 and counting -- and touchdowns -- 39 and climbing -- were 
pretty much expected. Waiting for it, yeah, that was the hard part. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, himself, wondered when the time would come. He wasn't allowed to play 
varsity as a sophomore, after transferring from Santa Margarita. He wasn't 
permitted in the spotlight as a junior, because of the presence of seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was two years of tapping his cleats. That pent-up energy has been let loose 
on opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, I told our principal Brendan was going to be the best running 
back I've been around since I started coaching," Hawk Coach Steve Bresnahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That pretty much covers half the state -- from Morro Bay to Laguna Hills -- 
and includes a stint as a Long Beach State assistant. But McGraw is that good, 
according to Bresnahan. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who doubted him stopped after the season opener. McGraw gained 277 
yards and tied a county record with six touchdowns. He followed that up with 
four more 200-yard games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was this good," lineman Reza Zadeh said. "I've played with him 
since junior high and he's always been this good. He has more talent than 
anyone I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not just because McGraw showers his line with praise after each of 
his big games -- and every game he's had has been big. Zadeh merely enjoys 
watching quality at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, Brendan is sure fun to watch," he said. "Especially when he scores. He 
has this little high step just before he crosses the goal line." 
</P>
<P>
 But McGraw fawns over his lineman in much the same manner, like any good back 
should. 
</P>
<P>
 "They deserve the credit," he said. "I try to point them out because they do a 
really good job. And you don't want to make your linemen unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone seems to be having a good time around Laguna Hills these days. The 
Hawks were Pacific Coast League champions and play Temple City in the 
quarterfinals Friday. McGraw is a big reason for that success. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk around campus isn't so much the number of records McGraw has or will 
set. It's the number he could have set. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw has been yanked from games early to prevent overkill. Still, those 
nights where he makes little more than a cameo appearance are awfully 
impressive. He had 265 yards and six touchdowns in a game against Laguna Beach. 
He played only the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We prepared for him, but he was quicker and more physical than we thought," 
Laguna Beach Coach Mike Roche said. "He obviously put in some time in the 
weight room during the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw did, because he has a lot of catching up to do. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Zadeh, McGraw was a youth league legend. In a game against 
Inglewood, he gained more than 200 yards and scored four touchdowns. His team 
won, 36-6. The previous year, Inglewood had won, 66-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGraw didn't follow his friends to Laguna Hills. He said his parents 
wanted him to attend Santa Margarita. He was back with his friends the 
following year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to adjust to a school when you don't know a single person," McGraw 
said. "I had never been to a Catholic school and that was a lot different. I 
never did get used to wearing uniforms. It wasn't the school, it was the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 But coming back to Laguna Hills cost McGraw a varsity season. He was not 
permitted to play under Southern Section rules. He was the junior varsity MVP, 
but longed for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating being stuck on JV," he said. "I would talk to the varsity 
guys and it would make it worse. I knew I could play on that level." 
</P>
<P>
 He proved it last season, but not in a big way. The Hawks had senior Fred Kim 
at running back and senior Justin Vedder at quarterback. They were the focal 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim gained more than 1,800 yards rushing. Vedder threw for 5,432 yards in 
three seasons. McGraw bided his time and made the most of what he got. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 95 yards in four carries and caught three passes for 78 yards in a 37-7 
victory over Century. He scored four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I questioned was whether he had the durability to carry the 
ball 40 times a game," Bresnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks' single-back offense leans on one runner. Bresnahan soon learned 
McGraw was that guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes the 41st carry like it was his first," Bresnahan said. "He does most 
of his work between the tackles. That's tough yards." 
</P>
<P>
 But he's gained a lot of them. McGraw's low was a 136-yard game against Costa 
Mesa. His high was a 300-yard performance against Aliso Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 It's made people take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to hear things, but I don't want people to think I have a big ego 
or anything like that," McGraw said. "I'm confident about what I can do, but I 
don't sit around and talk about records a lot. I try not to make a big deal out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have to, there are other people counting.

<P>
 Byars and Western are looking for a fresh start. Byars, who had a record of 
64-163 in 10 years at Anaheim, replaces Matt Cavanaugh, who is now an assistant 
at Cypress High. The Pioneers are trying to rebound from a disastrous season 
that saw them finish tied for last in the league. With Lindemeyer and Mackie, 
who averaged 11 and 13 points, Byars has a foundation to build on. What he 
needs is for Vernon to develop into a point guard. Byars said the guard 
position is the biggest weakness. Bransetter, Burdett and Casillas were 
involved in the Southern Section football playoffs but will be counted on to 
give the Pioneers depth. "I feel we have decent overall ability," Byars said. 
"We could be a pretty good team by the time league rolls around. I am concerned 
about our players' ability to play as a team, and with the overall attitudes 
our players have shown at times during the summer." If Byars' reputation as a 
taskmaster takes hold--his Anaheim teams were always known as cheap-steak 
tough--the attitudes should adjust accordingly. SCHEDULE

PLAY A KEY ROLL IN THE REBIRTH.

 "Things . . . just fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Lindemeyer lets the sentence hang in midair, as if that's the only 
analysis needed to explain how Western could go from Orange League champions 
his freshman season to last place last year, his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't begin to fully reveal the consternation that might be going 
through Lindemeyer's mind, considering he will be playing for his third coach 
in four seasons -- this year's model, Conrad Byars; or that several players who 
left during the 1993-94 season devastated a team that lost 14 of 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The scars are sheathed in optimism for the upcoming season, one in which 
Lindemeyer is expected to assert himself as one of the league's better players. 
</P>
<P>
 His 11-point average is expected to rise. Byars plans to give his center every 
opportunity to be a force. While the Pioneers have only one other returning 
starter -- guard Richard Mackie -- there is a core of juniors and seniors 
who'll serve as the team's foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll use him as a main option," Byars said of Lindemeyer. "At 6-4 in the 
post, he'll be undersized, but he can use quickness and strength to get around 
bigger players. And we can use him on perimeter. He shoots pretty well from 17 
feet in. Mackie will take pressure off him and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 So it indeed could be a breakout year for Lindemeyer, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a challenge, but I've always tried to meet my challenges," 
Lindemeyer said. "We have a lot of scorers, so there will be times when 
different people shine. We may go inside sometimes, but the team is balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a good year, we have to play together as a team. And I think things 
are looking good right now. I think we have the right chemistry. And I think 
we're mature enough to understand we have to be together because for most of us 
this is it -- our last high school year." 
</P>
<P>
 They at least want to get back to the standards set in Lindemeyer's first 
year, when the Pioneers dominated most of the Orange League. It will not be 
simple -- Lindemeyer says the level of play is so balanced there will be a fine 
line between winning and losing. And he would like to go out a winner because 
he has no definite college plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm more concerned with getting my grades up," Lindemeyer said. 
"I've gotten one letter, but I'm not really talking to anyone."  
</P>
<P>
 At least he begins the year healthy. In the summer leagues, Lindemeyer was 
hampered by a separated left shoulder, but says he is fine now. 
</P>
<P>
 Byars, who spent the last 10 years at Anaheim -- and who impressed enough 
people with a 7-17 team last season to be named league coach of the year -- 
will get the chance to rebuild Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindemeyer likes what he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Byars challenges you in a variety of ways to get you going," Lindemeyer 
said. "He won't say, 'If you don't do this, you'll sit.' He'll say, 'I'd like 
to see you try this.' He'll motivate you into doing it yourself. But you still 
know who the boss is." 
</P>
<P>
 Byars, who spent his time devising ways to stop Lindemeyer when he coached at 
Anaheim, also said he has been impressed with what he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He created all kinds of problems because he's big and strong," Byars said. 
"I've also discovered he has a real good work ethic. For a young man with three 
coaches in four years, he is a coachable player. We will do some things 
differently than last year, and he is trying hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as much as Lindemeyer is trying to forget how -- and why -- things "fell 
apart" last season. 1993-94 / IN REVIEW

</P>
<P>
 Magnolia and Valencia tied for the league title. Valencia's performance was a 
surprise under then first-year Coach Dean Yoshimura. Eight of Valencia's 14 
regular-season victories came in league play. The other Orange League playoff 
representative was Savanna, which advanced to the Division III-AA semifinals 
before losing to Santa Margarita, 82-59. Magnolia was stopped in the second 
round by Servite, 66-57, and Valencia dropped a first-round game to Katella, 
44-41. The other surprise was the downward turn taken by Western, winning only 
two of 10 league games to tie Brea-Olinda for last place. Among county 
statistical leaders, Magnolia's Frank Henderson (17.4 points), Magnolia's 
Brandon Hearvey (15.7) Savanna's Todd Wilson (15.7) and Savanna's Jermaine 
Moore (14.1) ranked 13th, a tie for 25th, and 44th in scoring. Hearvey (8.8) 
ranked 17th in rebounding. Moore (5.3) ranked 15th in assists. Hearvey (60.8%) 
ranked seventh and Savanna's Dan Avila (53.8%) 21st in field goal percentage. 
Postseason honors were awarded Henderson, who was a second-team Southern 
Section Division II selection. All-league first team honorees included 
Henderson, Hearvey, Moore, Wilson, Anaheim's Frank Castillo, Valencia's Erik 
Jackley, Max Zamora and Jason Miele, Magnolia's LaShaun Neal and Savanna's 
Conway Nguyen. Henderson was voted player of the year, and Anaheim's Conrad 
Byars coach of the year.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CHAPMAN LEARNS AN EARLY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman men's basketball Coach Mike Bokosky thought his team was ready to 
begin its first full season as an NCAA Division III independent Tuesday. He was 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont-Mudd, a team thatis returning four starters, including former Laguna 
Beach standout Darren Gravley, routed the visiting Panthers, 86-72. Chapman 
trailed by 11 points at the half, but Claremont extended the lead to as many as 
30 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Bokosky, starting his third season at Chapman, blames himself for not 
preparing the Panther defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't playing defense for more than two or three passes," Bokosky said. 
"We sustained our defensive effort for five to 10 seconds maximum." 
</P>
<P>
 Bokosky hopes to solve the problem quickly. Saturday, the Panthers play host 
to Division III Sonoma State in their home opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great learning experience for us," Bokosky said. "It had better be 
a good learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bokosky praised the play of sophomore point guard Adam Dzierzynski, who had 18 
points, six assists and six steals, and Ramin Bastani, a freshman from Corona 
del Mar. Bastani, a first-team All-Sea View League selection, came off the 
bench to score 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he would be good," Bokosky said of Bastani. "But I'm really 
pleasantly surprised that he's better than we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman women's team opened the season with a 66-60 victory over Redlands. 
After trailing by four at the half, the Panthers rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Melody Earle, fourth on the school's career scoring list, had a 
team-high 14 points. Alana Conyers, a transfer from Yavapai College in Arizona, 
had 13 points and 12 rebounds and Faye Cruz, a transfer from Sierra College in 
Northern California, had 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the men's team, the Chapman women have been declared ineligible for the 
NCAA Division III playoffs this season because the Panthers didn't play at 
least half their games against Division II opponents last season. But Coach 
Mary Hegarty said she hopes to successfully appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not ready to give up yet," she said. "But it will all be a moot point 
if we don't win, so that's what we are going to focus on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California College men's cross-country team fell short of its 
goal of a top-20 finish at the NAIA national championships Saturday, but Coach 
Bryan Wilkins was encouraged by some individual performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards, who were seeded 18th in the race, finished 22nd of 35 teams. 
However, junior Jason Schaefer finished 50th, running the eight-kilometer 
course in Kenosha, Wis., in 25 minutes 57 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 He came within 20 places and 22 seconds of being an All-American. Freshman 
John Bischop (105th in 26:37), junior Wes Hinson (115th in 26:43), junior Tim 
Hardin (240th in 27:56), freshman Brian Pratt (266th in 28:23), sophomore Dan 
Palmer (282nd in 28:48) and Jason Goddard (304th in 29:34) rounded out the 
field for SCC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were excited just to be there," Wilkins said. "This gave our team a vision 
of what nationals is all about. They are already talking about next year."

 Today's propensity for overeating might actually seem economical when you 
consider you that can feed 10 people for $28. According to the American Farm 
Bureau Federation, that's the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal of turkey, 
stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls, peas, cranberries and a dessert. But how much 
you pay depends upon where you live. This year, according to the federation's 
annual survey, prices per pound of turkey have ranged from 19 cents to $1.34. 
The national average is 79 cents a pound. While prices may vary, almost all 
supermarkets strategically sell their turkeys below cost -- on average 30 cents 
per pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Average prices for the elements of a Thanksgiving meal for 10 people, for this 
year and last: 03,16,08,08 Menu 1993 1994 Turkey $11.06 $12.01 Stuffing 2.24

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The price for the whole package for 10 people (including dessert and a 
beverage) is less than it was in 1990: 02,06,08 Year Price 1990 $28.85 1991 
25.95 1992 26.39 1993 27.49 1994 28.39

</P>
<P>
 If you're not doing it yourself, prices go way up. Prices for prepared 
Thanksgiving meals cooked to order (most include turkey, stuffing, mashed 
potatoes, gravy, vegetable and cranberry sauce, and feed six to 10 people): 
02,14,08 Name Price Lucky $39.99 Hughes 39.99 Pavilions 38.95 Mrs. Gooch's 
59.99 Gelsons 59.99  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Having someone else cook your meal and set the table is costlier still. Prices 
for Thanksgiving meals at restaurants, per meal: 02,19,08 Name Price Denny's $ 
7.99 Coco's 8.95 Marie Callender's 8.95 Hyatt Hotel 25.95 Drai's 32.00 Patina 
40.00

 While turkey ranchers and cranberry growers used to be very dependent on the 
holiday season, both have become year-round crops. Concerns over fat and 
cholesterol have put turkey meat in everything from burgers to hot dogs.

IDB CONFIRMS PROBE BY FEDERAL GRAND JURY; INVESTIGATION: COMPANY'S 
FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS AND INFORMATION ON RESIGNATION OF ITS AUDITORS HAVE BEEN 
SUBPOENAED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 IDB Communications, a fast-growing telecommunications firm whose controversial 
accounting practices have been under investigation by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, confirmed Wednesday that a federal grand jury is also 
probing its activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Vice President Peter Hartz said the Culver City company is cooperating 
with the investigation, but he did not elaborate. He said he did not know if 
any IDB executives were targets of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a filing with the SEC, however, IDB shed some light on the probe. The 
company said that the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles issued subpoenas in 
October seeking documents on IDB's first-quarter results as well as information 
surrounding the abrupt resignation in May of the accounting firm Deloitte & 
Touche as IDB's auditors. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB is headed by Chairman Jeffrey Sudikoff, best known lately for buying -- 
along with entertainment executive and fellow IDB director Joseph M. Cohen -- 
72% of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team from Bruce McNall last May for $60 
million. In March, Fortune magazine listed Sudikoff among an elite group of 
"America's smart young entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
 The development is yet another twist in what has been a year of turmoil for 
the ownership of the Kings. McNall, who remains a minority partner, himself has 
been entangled in a separate federal criminal probe through much of this year 
and has agreed to plead guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a bank 
fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Kings said the IDB probe does not involve the team or 
Cohen, who is currently chairman of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation by Deloitte & Touche that the grand jury is looking into 
triggered a 50% plunge in IDB's stock, resulting in a flurry of shareholder 
lawsuits and raising questions about the company's aggressive accounting 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, questions have been raised by investors and critics about 
whether IDB overstated its growth, especially in the global long-distance 
business, thereby boosting the company's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, IDB and Mississippi-based LDDS Communications, which is 
planning to buy IDB in a $721-million stock swap, agreed to pay $75 million to 
settle the IDB shareholder lawsuits. Hartz said the merger is going forward 
despite the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB has previously disclosed that the SEC was looking into its practices, but 
characterized the probe as informal. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its latest filing, IDB reveals that on June 9 the SEC issued a formal 
order of investigation looking at a broad range of issues, including IDB's 
finances, records, internal controls and "trading in IDB securities on the 
basis of non-public information."  
</P>
<P>
 The probe into trading in IDB stock had not been disclosed publicly, and the 
company did not elaborate. Previously, investors have criticized IDB President 
Edward Cheramy for being a heavy seller of the stock this spring and reporting 
it late, although it is unknown if that is the subject of the SEC probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also disclosed that the National Assn. of Securities Dealers "and 
other self-regulatory bodies" have also launched inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded 11 years ago with a $15,000 loan, IDB grew to a $311-million company 
by 1993 with a satellite network that transmitted everything from baseball 
games to results of notorious criminal trials for news organizations. The 
company also has been aggressively moving into the long-distance phone market. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB was a Wall Street darling until the feud with Deloitte sent the company's 
stock crashing. In a letter filed in June with the SEC, Deloitte said that its 
auditors founds "weaknesses in internal controls and procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting giant added that it clashed with IDB over the company's 
first-quarter results. IDB disputed Deloitte's claims initially, but later 
restated its result to scrap $6 million in income. 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte in its letter said it challenged millions of dollars in pretax income 
IDB claimed, adding that IDB's response was to keep presenting to Deloitte new, 
previously unrecorded items showing millions of dollars more in income to make 
up for it. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB's stock closed at $8.81 1/2, down 18 3/4 cents.

MATHEMATICIAN FINDS INTEL'S PENTIUM DOESN'T COMPUTE; TECHNOLOGY: A FLAW THAT 
THE COMPANY FAILED TO DISCLOSE IN JUNE CAUSES ERRORS IN COMPLEX CALCULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mathematician in Lynchburg, Va., was the first to get bugged by a flaw in 
Intel Corp.'s popular Pentium chip. 
</P>
<P>
 While doing complex division problems, Thomas R. Nicely, a mathematics 
professor at Lynchburg College, detected a defect that caused his department's 
three Pentium-based computers to spew out faulty numbers in the ninth place to 
the right of the decimal point and beyond. So he called Intel a month ago, and 
now he's garnering a Warholesque modicum of fame as the man who blew the 
whistle on the chink in Intel's famous chip. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Intel's own engineers, doing random calculations, had 
themselves discovered the imperfection in June. Yet the company chose not to 
disclose the problem to customers, a spokesman said Wednesday, because it 
viewed as minuscule the chance that anyone other than an advanced research 
scientist would ever encounter it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average user is not going to see this thing, except maybe once in 27,000 
years," said John Thompson, a spokesman for the Santa Clara-based chip maker, 
the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson added that the bug has been fixed as part of a "scheduled 
improvement" in new Pentium microprocessors that began shipping two months ago. 
(To fix the problem, Intel had to add a small number of transistors to the 
thumbnail-size Pentium, which contains 3.3 million transistors). The company is 
also offering to replace troublesome chips should customers call and demand new 
ones. For purchasers buying in quantity, those high-powered chips run anywhere 
from $383 to $935 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel stock closed up 37 1/2 cents at $65.125 a share Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the industry were not so quick to sweep the silicon dust under the 
rug. Microprocessors, after all, are commonly known as the "brains" of personal 
computers -- in other words, the component that makes them tick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consequences are serious because you can't trust it," said Cleve Moler, 
the co-founder and chief scientist of MathWorks Inc., a software company that 
was touting its solution to the problem Wednesday. "Nobody's gotten a wrong 
answer yet, but everybody's worried." 
</P>
<P>
 MathWorks, based in Natick, Mass., said has begun distributing to its 
customers a modification of its $1,700 MATLAB technical computing program that 
works around the bug. Moler also plans to post a description of the technique 
-- which basically entails having the computer check its own work -- on the 
Internet, where news groups have been churning with complaints and concerns 
about the bug for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was staying nicely under wraps until Prof. Nicely called Intel's 
tech support in late October. As usual in such matters, he said, the folks 
answering the phone had no idea what he was talking about. But eventually the 
problem filtered up to Intel engineers, Nicely said, and "it got everybody's 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicely had first noticed problems with his calculations in June after he had 
been running the math department's three Pentium systems night and day for 
several months trying to check certain properties of prime numbers and all the 
"prime constellations" -- double, triple and quadruple prime numbers, for 
example. (A prime number is an integer that can be evenly divided by no other 
whole number other than 1 and itself, such as 2, 3, 5 or 7.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was in analyzing a property of twin prime numbers (such as 1113) that the 
bug manifested itself, Nicely said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicely, 51, who has been teaching math at his 101-year-old liberal arts 
college since 1968, was out to break the world record in this particular 
exercise in pure math, which previously had been done on supercomputers. The 
idea was to demonstrate that powerful new desktops could do the work even 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, he said, he attributed a discrepancy with past calculations to an 
error in his software program. Then, he figured it had to be the program that 
compiled the numbers. But after four months he finally fingered the least 
likely suspect: the chip itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Having to stop his calculations at the number 6 trillion and sort out the 
trouble "was a nuisance for me," he noted, with perhaps surprising 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Intel has furnished him with three new Pentium chips. After 1 
quadrillion calculations, so far all appears to be correct. Nicely, who 
describes himself as "one of the obscure mathematicians in the herd," said 
Intel has invited him to be a consultant on this type of problem; he also hopes 
to get a few machines donated to the college. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first such trouble for Intel. In the early 1980s, it recalled 
the first runs of its 386 chip, but only a few thousand were in distribution at 
the time. Millions of Pentiums are on the market, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Nicely is pleased that this particular problem seems to be solved, 
although, he wondered, "who knows what other bugs are lurking?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he is warning his students not to treat computers "as 
articles of faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, it was reported that both the Justice Department and the Federal 
Trade Commission plan to investigate anti-competitive practices at Intel.

FIVE SESSIONS.

 Stock prices steadied Wednesday after their drubbing the previous day but 
still ended with their fifth straight loss amid the heaviest trading in eight 
months, as investors continued to shift money from stocks to bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices rallied again, sending the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds below 
8%. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.36 points to 3,674.63. But 
that was a victory of sorts because the blue-chip indicator had opened sharply 
lower after plunging 91.52 points on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Dow over the past five sessions has lost 170.57 points, or 
4.4%. Since reaching its record high of 3,978.36 on Jan. 31, the average has 
plummeted 303.73 points, or 7.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market measures also eased Wednesday, and losers overall finished 
slightly ahead of gainers on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The up-and-down session reflected continued selling by investors seeking safer 
returns in bonds and other fixed-income investments, and buying by investors 
looking for stocks they now consider too cheap to avoid in light of the 
market's recent slide, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a fairly good zinger" in terms of the stock market's drop, and that 
has "attracted some bargain hunting," said Eric Miller, chief investment 
strategist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market also drew some support from money managers who were 
buying shares to adjust their portfolios, and from short-sellers who were 
covering their positions ahead of the Thanksgiving weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was Big Board volume of 430.7 million shares, up from 383.3 million 
Tuesday and the heaviest turnover since 461.9 million shares changed hands 
March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets are closed today in observance of Thanksgiving Day, and 
trading is expected to be light Friday as many traders opt for a four-day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Several big mutual funds, meanwhile, said the market's recent plunge has 
prompted some individuals to move their cash out of stock funds and into bond 
and money market funds, but they said the exodus was by no means a stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 "On balance, it seems to be people switching from equity funds, mainly 
international and aggressive funds, to money market funds," said Steven 
Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates, which manages $37.3 billion 
spread among 60 funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Streeters have been watching the funds closely because the $860 billion 
in equity funds is a major pillar of support for the market. There's concern 
that if the market continues to suffer sharp declines, many individuals might 
redeem their shares in favor of other investments -- knocking stocks even 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, "we haven't seen any discernible trend out of equities," said John 
Woerth, a spokesman for the $130-billion Vanguard Group family of funds. "For 
the most part, our equity fund shareholders are staying the course." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, it was evident that many investors aggressively bought bonds 
Wednesday. The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose nearly 3/4 
point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 in face value, and its yield fell to 7.94% 
from 8.01% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds and other fixed-income securities have caught investors' ardor lately 
because of the recent rise in interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve 
Board, which in turn has boosted the securities' yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders are also worried that the rate increases will crimp corporate earnings 
and slow the economy's growth. On Wednesday, they continued to sell many 
transportation issues and other so-called cyclical stocks that are seen as 
particularly vulnerable to an economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines were hit hard. UAL, United's parent, lost 2 1/2 to 91 1/4; Delta 
Air Lines fell 2 3/4 to 48 5/8; AMR, parent of American, was off 1 5/8 to 50, 
and Federal Express slumped 2 3/8 to 57 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But another economically sensitive sector, the auto industry, posted gains. 
General Motors rose 1 1/8 to 37 3/4, Ford Motor climbed 3/8 to 27 1/4 and 
Chrysler was up 1 3/8 to 47 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * H&R Block recovered 2 to 35 1/2 after plunging 6 7/8 on Tuesday amid 
investor concern that a recent Internal Revenue Service decision could hurt 
part of Block's tax-preparation business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pfizer fell 2 3/8 to 72 1/2 after announcing plans to buy SmithKline 
Beecham's animal health business for $1.45 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE composite index fell 0.14 to 246.18 points, while the Standard & 
Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.16 points to 449.93. The Nasdaq composite index 
dropped 4.51 points to 736.70. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, the London FTSE index fell 51.2 points to 3,027.5, and the 
Frankfurt DAX index of 30 leading stocks dropped 33.24 points to 2,040.04. In 
Mexico City, the Bolsa index fell 34.39 points to 2,416.67. Tokyo markets were 
closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In midafternoon trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5520 German marks, down 
from 1.5535 on Tuesday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar stood at 98.35 
yen, up fractionally from 98.30 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Heating oil futures soared ahead of the holiday weekend, as cold Northeastern 
weather and the Brazilian oil workers strike combined to drive prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
 January crude, helped by a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries to renew its production quota of 24.52 million barrels a day for one 
year, gained 33 cents to $18.15 a barrel.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: AND NOW, A REMAKE OF YOUR LIFE, BROUGHT TO YOU BY 
KODAK

 P icture this : flawless photos, every time, no matter who takes them. 
Perfection on a print. Smiling tots wide-eyed with happiness; family and 
friends gathered around holiday tables; gorgeous sun-dappled ocean views from 
intimate vacations. Memories are made of this, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they should be. But too often our photographs are made of blinks and 
blurs, smirks and shadows: images that betray our best moments rather than 
truly reflect them. Even worse, they're filled with people we don't want there 
and missing ones who really should be in the picture. They cheat the reality we 
explicitly asked the camera to remember. So instead of trying so hard to 
capture and preserve those golden moments, why not make the effort to perfect 
them? 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's not at all unusual for women's magazines today to use computer image 
processing techniques to perform digital rhinoplasties and tummy tucks on their 
models; it's just outrageously expensive. Technology has been transforming 
photographs from finished products into imagery ingredients for years. 
</P>
<P>
 What a Richard Avedon or Bruce Weber can't achieve, a halfway competent art 
director with digital scanners, optical printers and Adobe Photoshop software 
can. But just like everything else processed by computers, all these big-ticket 
technologies are getting faster, cheaper and more accessible. Editing color 
photographs is becoming as easy and inexpensive as editing boring memos. 
Digital image processing is turning into a mass medium. 
</P>
<P>
 So who needs to be an Avedon if the real creativity can take place after the 
picture is taken? Why worry about f-stops and lighting if we have technology 
that forgives us our technical transgressions and gives us the option to polish 
our memories? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the opportunity to give people a second chance to make their pictures 
more perfect," asserts Paul Walrath, Kodak's marketing manager for photo 
impressions. For all the media hype surrounding the Internet and multimedia, 
the next multibillion-dollar consumer market in digital technology is going to 
be making memories just a little more pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Western Pro Imaging Labs in Vancouver as a model for tomorrow's 
photography. In July, the Canadian photo processor launched DivorceX -- a 
service that lets divorced people digitally excise their ex-spouses from 
treasured family photos at $75 a slice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This started out as a joke in my speeches," says company President Ken 
Guelpha. "Now it's becoming a nice little business for us." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, reports Guelpha, there's now just as much call for digital insertions 
as deletions. "The wedding party photographer blew it and grandmother was 
missed," he recalls, "so we spliced her in a few of the pictures. . . . At 
another wedding, there was a great boat shot of the entire family but one of 
the family had turned the wrong way -- so we inserted another shot of her head. 
. . . At a university graduation photo, the girl blinked: For $75, we simply 
put in her eyes. Memories are very powerful; pictures are very powerful," says 
Guelpha. "We're helping people erase those negative aspects." 
</P>
<P>
 Please, no discussion of ethical qualms here: Is it any more unethical to give 
someone her eyes back than to pose people around the table and then ask them to 
say "Cheese!"? This isn't about photojournalism verite; it's about using 
technology to enable people to better design the life images they want to 
preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than 2.3 million weddings in America last year. How much extra 
would most newlyweds pay to assure their cherished images of the event were 
without blemish and that every member of the family looked good? Over the same 
time, there were more than 1.2 million divorces: what percentage of embittered 
ex-spouses would pay a premium to have their now-insignificant others erased 
from a few of the photos? There are more than 17 million high-school students 
in America: how many gawky adolescents and their nervous parents would pay an 
extra $25 or so to digitally smooth down unruly hair, computationally remove 
zits and cut down the horrible glare from the braces in order to prevent the 
child from being photographically enshrined as the geek a tutti geek in the 
high school yearbook? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to the authoritative Wolfman Report, Americans took more 
than 18 billion photos last year -- roughly half of the world's picture-taking. 
If Americans would pay to enhance but 5% of those pictures, we're immediately 
talking about an enormous multibillion-dollar marketplace, comparable in size 
to the video game software and consumer CD-ROM markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget those billions of photos now shuffled in shoe boxes and desk 
drawers that were almost perfect. What happens to the family photo album as 
image enhancement and alteration gets better and cheaper? A "Kodak moment" may 
indeed become the photo one makes as well as the photo one takes. The challenge 
isn't in the technology; it's in packaging the technology in a form that makes 
people want to bring in their photos for enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically -- but appropriately -- the most appealing aspect of these digital 
technologies may be less in how they let us create the future than how they 
enable us to recreate our pasts. Everybody has an "If only. . . ." photograph; 
everyone wants photos that capture the spirit of the moment as well as its 
image. Increasingly, that's what image processing technology empowers us to do. 
Isn't that something to smile about?

 Court Freezes British Executive's Assets: A federal judge, acting on a request 
from the Securities and Exchange Commission, froze the assets of Jeffrey 
Morris, who allegedly made illegal profits from the sale of Hilton Hotels Corp. 
stock. An SEC lawsuit alleged that Morris, 35, of Leeds, England, made an 
illegal profit of more than $400,000 after buying Hilton call options and stock 
three days before the hotel announced it had hired an investment banking firm 
to undertake a study and make recommendations to management to enhance 
shareholder value. The temporary restraining order signed by Judge Robert 
Patterson in Manhattan Federal Court freezes Morris' assets, both in the United 
States and Britain.

 Ikea Unlikely to Place Store in Israel: The home-furnishing chain Ikea, whose 
founder admitted he was once affiliated to Nazi groups, said it probably won't 
offer a franchise in Israel any time soon. Responding to complaints from a U.S. 
Jewish group, an Ikea official said the company probably wouldn't make enough 
money in Israel to justify a franchise, but will keep an eye on prospects.The 
Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center had demanded that Ikea prove it 
wasn't avoiding Israel because of the Arab boycott of the country. The company 
has franchised several stores in Arab countries. The demand followed the 
disclosure that Ikea founder and Chairman Ingvar Kamprad had been affiliated 
with Nazi groups as late as the 1950s.

 Continental Air Says It Doesn't Face Another Bankruptcy: Continental Airlines 
Inc. said it does not face bankruptcy even though a $117-million claim by 
NationsBank Corp. against the carrier could send it into Chapter 11 for a third 
time.Continental said, according to a judge in the case, NationsBank's claim 
could force the airline into bankruptcy. But it said the judge has appeared 
unwilling to grant the bank's claim. Federal Judge Joseph Farnan of Delaware 
decided on Sept. 16 not to reconsider the claim by NationsBank, and Continental 
has asked the judge to deny the bank's appeal. The case was closed Oct. 19 when 
NationsBank failed to meet a deadline for filing its appeal.

 Libel Ruling Upheld Against Philadelphia Inquirer: A state appeals court has 
upheld a libel ruling against The Philadelphia Inquirer while reducing damages 
from a total of $34 million to $24 million.The newspaper plans to appeal. A 
Philadelphia jury in 1990 awarded former prosecutor Richard A. Sprague $2.5 
million in compensatory damages and $31.5 million in punitive damages. At the 
time, the combined award was the largest libel verdict on record involving the 
news media in the United States. The current record is a $58-million judgment 
awarded against a Dallas television station. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of 
state Superior Court let stand the compensatory damages but reduced punitive 
damages to $21.5 million, saying the original award was excessive.

 Court Upholds Five AZT Patents: The disputed patents for the primary drug for 
treating AIDS belong to Burroughs Wellcome Co., a three-judge appeals panel has 
ruled. The decision by the panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington 
rejected claims by two generic drug manufacturers that Burroughs, of Research 
Triangle Park, N.C., was not exclusively entitled to the patents.The other 
companies said some preliminary testing was conducted at the National 
Institutes of Health. The opinion issued Tuesday upholds a 1993 ruling by the 
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina on five of six 
patents that were being contested by Barr Laboratories Inc. and Novopharm Ltd. 
For the sixth patent, the appeals court said Novopharm should be given an 
opportunity to support its claim by presenting evidence at trial.

 Computer Firms Join to Standardize Data Transfer: International Business 
Machines, AT&T, Apple Computer and Siemens said they will announce a plan next 
Wednesday to create a universal communication language for computers and 
computer networks. The agreement will standardize the way computers talk to 
each other and erase the difficulties in communicating between a portable 
notebook computer, for example, and an office network of personal computers. 
Analysts said it is hard to say how significant or successful the four 
companies will be in their endeavor, especially given the absence of Microsoft 
and Intel, which together dominate 80% of the PC market.

FARMERS SOCK AWAY HUGE CORN HARVEST; AGRICULTURE: FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAM ALLOWS A 
PORTION OF THE RECORD CROP TO BE WITHHELD FROM THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government has loaned out almost a billion dollars to corn farmers this 
fall to enable them to sock away massive amounts of corn and avoid selling 
their record crop at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 American corn farmers -- who are finishing up the harvest of a huge 
10-billion-bushel crop -- have put close to half a billion bushels of corn into 
a low-interest government loan program that enables them to keep their crop off 
the market until higher prices come along. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is a good way to get some cash flow at a very reasonable rate, 
and it gives farmers a lot of marketing flexibility later on," a U.S. 
Department of Agriculture specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn prices have been on a downward slide for months as the nation's largest 
crop just kept getting bigger, thanks to perfect weather in the Corn Belt. At 
$2.12 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, prices are now about 20% below 
year-ago levels, and analysts say they could go even lower. 
</P>
<P>
 According to government statistics released this week, farmers have put 448 
million bushels of corn into the department's nine-month loan program, a jump 
of more than 100 million bushels from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers are taking advantage of the loan program at a pace that's more than 
twice the level for this time in 1992, the last big corn crop year. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa farmers -- who are projected to lead the nation with a 2-billion-bushel 
crop -- have already put close to 200 million bushels of corn under loan, well 
above the total 110 million bushels put into the program last year, when Iowa's 
crop was cut by devastating floods.

<P>
 Under the nine-month loan program, farmers can put a certain amount of corn up 
as collateral, then collect a certain price per bushel for that corn. The 
national corn loan rate is $1.89 per bushel, but it varies slightly among 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmer puts the corn in storage and pays back the loan any time during the 
next nine months at about 6% interest, well below the current prime lending 
rate of 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the example of a farmer in Iowa with 500 acres of corn and a 150 
bushel-per-acre average yield, a farmer would give a total crop of 75,000 
bushels.  
</P>
<P>
 If the farmer wanted to get cash now but didn't want to sell the crop in the 
middle of a harvest glut, he or she could take out a loan on half the crop, 
collecting a total of $70,875, assuming the national corn loan rate. If prices 
rise, the crop can be sold and the loan repaid, leaving a profit.

DURABLE GOODS ORDERS UNEXPECTEDLY DECLINE; ECONOMY: THE 1.5% DROP IN OCTOBER IS 
SEEN AS A RESULT OF THE FED'S INTEREST RATE INCREASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orders for durable goods such as cars and airplanes posted a surprise drop in 
October, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday, suggesting that higher 
interest rates may be cooling off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the 1.5% decline in durable goods orders to a seasonally 
adjusted $152.8 billion -- the first decline in three months -- illustrates 
that tighter credit is having the effect policy-makers intended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly this is what we have been expecting," said economist Sung Won Sohn 
of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. "The effect of high interest rates is 
beginning to have an impact on these orders." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board has raised short-term interest rates six times this 
year, including a steep three-quarters of a percentage point rise last week, to 
try to slow economic growth to a non-inflationary rate of about 2.5% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank's strategy may be paying off, bringing demand for goods and 
services down in a gradual decline likely to become more apparent in 1995, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's first five rate hikes, between February and September, "were already 
nibbling away at economic growth in October," said economist Robert Barr of the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the economy already slowing, the Fed's sixth increase . . . may have 
given interest rates the teeth to really bite into economic growth in the 
coming months," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Labor Department said new applications for jobless benefits 
were stable at 326,000 for the week ended Nov. 19, the same as a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But a University of Michigan survey said its index of consumer confidence 
sagged to 91.6 in November from 92.7 in October, an indication that consumers 
were growing worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street economists had forecast a 0.4% gain in October durable goods 
orders, rather than the 1.5% drop reported. But a steep 9.4% plunge in orders 
for transportation goods, mainly cars and airplanes, pulled overall orders 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "The capital spending boom is running its course and so is the auto boom," 
said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto plants are still busy and in many cases scheduling overtime to fill 
existing orders for popular 1995 models. However, the orders report indicates 
waning activity ahead as dealers judge that consumer demand is leveling off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running out of pent-up demand in the auto industry, and businesses are 
up to their ears in new computers and information-processing machinery," Latta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's drop in transportation orders was the largest since July, when 
they fell 14.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because transportation accounts for about a fifth of durable goods made in the 
United States, weaker demand greatly affects manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding transportation, durable orders in October gained 1.1% after a 0.4% 
rise in September. 
</P>
<P>
 In another key category, orders for non-defense capital goods, a measure of 
business investment in new equipment, fell 2.9% after a 3.6% rise in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipments of finished durable goods, an indicator of current demand, fell 1.2% 
in October after a drop of 0.8% in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said a slowdown in orders for durable goods might last for some time, 
but they said it is not likely to be a precipitous one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fourth quarter of 1994 is expected to be pretty strong because of strong 
holiday buying," said economist Gordon Richards of the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers. "But the first quarter of 1995 is likely to be slower as higher 
interest rates begin to have an effect." Durable Goods

 Fox & Carskadon Up For Sale: Fox & Carskadon, Northern California's largest 
residential real estate firm, is up for sale following a long, drawn-out 
dispute among its two partners. Majority partner Frank Luppi has filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and plans to sell his 75% interest in the 
company, Fox & Carskadon Chairman Richard Purvis said.The decision comes after 
a failure to settle a 17-month-old lawsuit filed against Luppi by former Fox & 
Carskadon President Emmet J. Cashin III. Cashin sued after he was removed as 
the managing partner and later fired in July, 1993, during a top-level power 
struggle, Purvis said. Already, at least two investor groups are preparing bids 
for the corporation. They include Jon Douglas Co., Southern California's 
largest residential real estate concern, and a second put together by Purvis.

PHILIP MORRIS PULLS ITS WITNESSES FROM INDOOR AIR QUALITY HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Morris, whose lawyers have grilled witnesses who spoke in favor of 
tough restrictions on workplace smoking, has pulled out of federal hearings on 
indoor air quality before its own experts were to take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision angered Department of Labor officials who had wanted to question 
the cigarette maker's representatives about its internal studies of tobacco 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Labor Department Administrative Law Judge John Vittone on 
Tuesday, Philip Morris questioned the fairness of the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration hearings over which Vittone is presiding. The company 
provided a copy of the letter to The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris said it was concerned that its witnesses would be cross-examined 
by lawyers who are representing plaintiffs in product liability claims against 
the company. It also objected to participation in the hearings by an OSHA staff 
member on loan from the Environmental Protection Agency and a UC San Francisco 
scientist OSHA is calling as an expert witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the OSHA staff member, James Repace, and the scientist, Dr. Stanton 
Glantz, have studied and written about the effects of environmental tobacco 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-page letter said it was "clear that our oral testimony would neither be 
received nor examined by OSHA with the requisite impartiality, and as such will 
not be given."

LAWSUIT OVER DERIVATIVES SETTLED BY BANKERS TRUST; INVESTMENTS: ANALYSTS SAY 
THE ACCORD HELPS END A PR NIGHTMARE. FIRM ADMITS NO WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Bankers Trust New York Corp. settled a $73-million lawsuit over derivatives it 
sold to Gibson Greeting Inc., ridding itself of a lawsuit that cast a pall over 
the bank's reputation for months. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank still faces a $130-million lawsuit by Procter & Gamble Co. that 
continues to taint the bank with claims that it sold complex derivatives 
without explaining the risks. Bankers Trust has denied the claims, saying the 
two companies fully understood the risks of the derivatives they bought. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides could claim victory in the settlement. The Cincinnati greeting card 
company agreed to pay Bankers Trust $6.18 million to cancel two swaps it had 
outstanding with the bank. That covered a third of the money Bankers Trust 
would have been due, since it had paper losses of $20.7 million on Sept. 30 on 
the derivatives contracts. Derivatives are contracts whose value is linked to 
underlying assets such as a stock or bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Bankers Trust is out far less than the $73 million in damages and 
losses Gibson sought. And it is eliminating half a public relations nightmare, 
something worth a lot more than the cost of canceling the swaps, said Raphael 
Soifer, banking analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lifts something of a cloud over Bankers Trust that had been there for a 
long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement "was in the interest of both parties based on the unique facts 
of the case," Bankers Trust said in a statement Wednesday. The bank vowed to 
vigorously fight the P&G lawsuit, adding that "we . . . expect to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers Trust decided it would have had a tougher time winning the Gibson case 
because the company, which earned $25.9 million last year, could have been 
perceived by a jury as small and relatively unsophisticated, Soifer said. 
Procter & Gamble, which had $2.3 billion in profit in fiscal 1994, will find it 
harder to make the case of being duped by Bankers Trust, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gibson filed its lawsuit, Bankers Trust has been dogged by scrutiny of 
its derivatives business, which accounted for $231 million, or 45%, of profit 
in the first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission began investigating allegations made by the two companies, and 
Moody's Investors Service Inc. warned it might lower its rating on the bank's 
deposits, in part because derivatives losses could scare away some clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said in a statement that it will record a gain of $14.5 million in the 
fourth quarter as a result of the settlement because it won't have to carry the 
losses from the two Bankers Trust swaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The $6.18-million payment will, in effect, buy out Gibson's existing contracts 
with Bankers Trust. That includes reimbursing Bankers Trust for $3.4 million in 
payments the bank made to the company on earlier derivatives transactions.

GREYHOUND TURNS BACK THE CLOCK ON FARES; TRANSPORT: STRUGGLING CARRIER TARGETS 
LONG-HAUL PASSENGERS, WHO USUALLY OPT FOR THE AIRLINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Greyhound Lines Inc. will slash long-haul fares as much as 38%, to year-ago 
levels, in the hope of spurring traffic and raising cash before the slow winter 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound will reduce the fares on trips of more than 500 miles -- those on 
which most travelers prefer flying to taking the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Greyhound lowered the one-way, walk-up fare between New York and 
Denver to $99 from $159, a 38% savings. Other new one-way fares include 
Washington to Los Angeles, cut 37% to $119, from $189, and Miami to Dallas, 
reduced 34% to $99, from $149. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Greyhound will also offer a three-day advance-purchase discount 
of 25% off all fares for trips taken before Dec. 15. Greyhound already offers a 
35% discount for seven-day advance purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fares take effect Tuesday. Walk-up fares have no advance-purchase 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound's stock was off 12.5 cents at $1.94 on Wednesday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Volume was 177,200 shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Dec. 8, the company is also promoting a "Buy One, Get Home Free" offer 
on round-trip tickets bought seven days in advance for travel through Dec. 15. 
The return portion of the trip is free, Greyhound said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinched by competition from low-fare airlines, the carrier expects to complete 
a restructuring by the end of the year that will allow it to avoid Bankruptcy 
Court protection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first nine months of 1994, the number of travelers on Greyhound fell 
4.1%, to 11.1 million from 11.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound is the only nationwide bus company. It serves more than 2,600 
destinations with a fleet of 1,898 buses.

'TIS THE SEASON TO SAFEGUARD CREDIT CARDS; CONSUMERS: SHOPPERS ARE ADVISED TO 
STICK TO A SPENDING LIMIT AND KNOW A SELLER'S RETURN POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To help consumers cope during the holiday season, the National Assn. of 
Consumer Agency Administrators and Visa International suggest smart ways to 
manage your personal finances and safeguard your credit cards: 
</P>
<P>
 * Know how much you can spend each month. List your income and expenses to see 
how much discretionary income you have and how much debt you can assume. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create a holiday spending budget and stick to it. Determine your gift list 
and set a spending limit for each recipient. Keep a record of your spending to 
compare with next year's holiday budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't forget to budget for miscellaneous items that can quickly add up and 
ruin your budget, such as last-minute gifts or stocking stuffers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carry only the credit cards you plan to use while shopping. Use your debit 
card if you want the convenience of plastic. That way you're paying for 
merchandise electronically from your checking account and won't face a bill 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out the seller's return policy before you buy and make sure you get all 
promises in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Credit card purchases may give you more protection than paying with cash or 
checks, since you can dispute the charge if the merchandise is not delivered 
properly or is defective. 
</P>
<P>
 * When making holiday purchases with a credit card, always verify that the 
card returned to you is yours. It's easy for a hurried salesperson to make a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the dollar amount on sales receipts for both cash and credit purchases 
before leaving the cash register area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Review your monthly credit card statements to make sure you were charged the 
correct amount and that you actually made the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 * When making purchases by phone, don't give anyone your credit card number or 
expiration date unless you made the call, even if the caller says it's for 
verification or security purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Citibank warned that in one of the latest scams, callers claiming to be from a 
catalogue company take orders from "privileged customers" just to get your 
credit card number. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, you receive no products and your credit card number is used 
illegally by the caller and maybe others. This could cause a temporary loss of 
credit or more serious problems later. 
</P>
<P>
 Citibank said it's unusual for catalogue companies to call customers unless 
they are checking an order. It recommends that consumers verify the legitimacy 
of such offers before placing an order. Take down the caller's name and say 
you'll call back at the 800 number listed in your catalogue. When you call 
back, if either the name given or the offer is unfamiliar to the company, you 
were probably the target of a scam.

THANKSGIVING COMES ON-LINE; CYBERSPACE ABUZZ WITH TURKEY RECIPES, SUPERMARKET 
TIPS, EVEN SUGGESTED PRAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They swapped recipes for "turkey mystery loaf" and turkey tortillas, and gave 
tips on which supermarkets have special deals on frozen fowl and cases of 
Pepsi. They discussed the virtues of instant versus real mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 People even logged on to home computers to compare notes on what to say for 
grace over their holiday meal tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing for Thanksgiving in cyberspace may not quite be what the pilgrims 
had in mind, but people plugged into the Internet and other computer networks, 
such as America Online and CompuServe, to give thanks and chat across Orange 
County and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 America Online's "Attitude of Gratitude" bulletin board, for example, had more 
than 100 postings by late Wednesday, offering practical tips and philosophical 
wanderings from computer users across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet, a public network accessible by almost anyone with a connection, 
computer and modem, also turned into a forum for goodwill. Computer users who 
had "flamed" each other -- or exchanged electronic insults -- in the past used 
their computer connections to apologize or give thanks for friendships 
developed on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Some signed on to complain about how their holiday plans to anyone who would 
listen -- or rather, read. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many out there still have to sit at the 'kids' table'?" asked one America 
Online user. "Me and my cousins are 20 years old and don't think we'll ever 
graduate to the big table." 
</P>
<P>
 And another: "This is the second Thanksgiving I have been sick in bed with 
mono." 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetarians use such services to give their thoughts on the holiday's 
distinctly carnivorous slant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it upsetting that so much is made out of eating turkey rather than 
offering thanks," wrote one America Online vegetarian. The holiday "means more 
to me just eating the harvest that grows from the earth, and not from the 
factory farms where suffering is commonplace." 
</P>
<P>
 From Southern California to the Old South, kitchen-dwellers discussed the 
local turkey bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons, Ralphs or Lucky? Winn Dixie or Safeway? Everybody touted hometown 
bargains, from 27-cents-a-pound turkeys to offers of a free fowl with a $25 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of suggested prayers of Thanksgiving were transmitted along computer 
lines, with brevity a notable feature of many, such as "Good food, good meat, 
good God, let's eat!" and "Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub." 
</P>
<P>
 Many computer users flung messages into cyberspace, hoping they would make it 
to their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the Los Angeles County area have a great deal to be thankful for after 
experiencing the Northridge earthquake," wrote an America Online user. 
</P>
<P>
 Another said her house caught on fire during the Malibu blazes, and then was 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake. She still gives thanks, though, for the 
simplest reason: Family members are healthy and spending Thanksgiving together.

STAY GRANTED IN $8.5-MILLION VERDICT AGAINST MCGAW INC.'S EX-OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge granted a stay Wednesday in a 
$8.5-million civil judgment involving the previous owner of an Irvine-based 
medical company whom a jury this week decided had violated a verbal contract 
with a former colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury ruled that James Sweeney, former chief executive officer of McGaw Inc., 
owed David Holder $8.5 million because the two agreed to buy McGaw.Sweeney and 
Holder met while both worked at Baxter Healthcare.

 In 1990, Sweeney bought McGaw and later raised $24 million in a public 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney's attorney, Michael Rhodes, said the stay prevents Holder from 
enforcing the verdict until the defense has an opportunity to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are displeased with the overall outcome of the events," Rhodes said, "but 
glad we got the stay." Rhodes said an appeal will be filed in the case in the 
next few months.  
</P>
<P>
 Harold Collins, attorney for David Holder, said the actions of the defense 
came as no surprise. "They had indicated that they would file post-trial 
motions and an appeal," he said.

JUDGE LEAVES WINERY UNDER CONTROL OF TMI OPERATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing no findings of "looting," a judge on Wednesday declined to appoint a 
receiver to take over operation of a winery controlled by Teachers Management & 
Investment Corp., a Newport Beach fund marketed to California teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not satisfied that there is looting taking place here," Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Francisco F. Firmat said during a hearing packed with more 
than 50 spectators, mostly elderly people who had invested in real estate 
partnerships marketed by TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 Four investors filed a lawsuit in August alleging that TMI operators 
fraudulently lost $100 million of clients' funds. In October, Firmat appointed 
Dennis B. Schmucker as manager for most of TMI's 38 real estate partnerships. 
Several partnerships, including Parducci Winery Ltd., which owns a winery in 
Mendocino County in Northern California, were left under TMI control. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the judge again left the winery under TMI control, despite a 
report Schmucker prepared for the court last week detailing the removal of 
about $578,000 of investor funds from Parducci by TMI to pay various management 
and other costs, "in apparent violation of the partnership agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, Schmucker, a longtime real estate trouble-shooter, cited an 
examination made by accounting firm Kenneth Leventhal & Co. in Newport Beach. 
His report found a "disturbing pattern of apparent violations or distortion of 
the traditional transactions permitted under the terms of the partnership 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 David Grant, attorney for TMI owners Maurice B. Shuman and James Martin, said 
in court Wednesday that the report's finding were "not supported by fact" and 
"will not hold water." 
</P>
<P>
 In his action, Firmat said he was "not convinced that money is being pulled 
out (of Parducci) for the benefits of individuals." He is scheduled to take the 
matter up again on Jan. 19.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; TRAVELERS SAY THEY FEEL STIFFED BY FLIER PROGRAM CHANGES; 
AIRLINES: SURVEY FINDS THAT MORE THAN 25% ARE ANGRY. MOST GRIPE ABOUT MILEAGE 
REQUIREMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business travelers are finding it easier than ever to pile up frequent-flier 
miles, but they're increasingly unhappy about what they're getting. 
</P>
<P>
 That message comes from a new survey that found that more than one in four 
people was angry enough about changes in the programs to reconsider 
participating in some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent Flyer magazine, which published the results of the poll, said most of 
the complaints involved new requirements that have raised the number of miles 
needed for a free trip and reduced the number of free seats available per 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequent business travelers view their mileage points -- and the associated 
free travel -- as a reward for the hectic daily experiences they face 
continually on the road," said Laurie Berger, editor in chief of Frequent 
Flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though a small amount of travelers surveyed in this year's poll 
considered the changes in frequent-flier program fair business practice, the 
recurring message we heard was 'Stop tinkering with our frequent-flier 
program,' " Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion of non-airline gimmicks for racking up mileage -- using certain 
credit cards, staying at certain hotels or buying certain products -- has 
created a boom in mileage handouts. That, in turn, has made it harder to use 
the miles. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, recent waves of discounted ticket promotions have loaded up 
flights, meaning many planes have fewer seats set aside for freebies. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of free seats varies by airline, from no less than 5% to no more 
than 13% among the Top 10 carriers, according to Frank Dinovo, president of 
Travel & Transport in Omaha, the eighth-largest U.S. travel agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on complaints he hears from his customers, Dinovo said, there's no doubt 
airlines have cut the number of free seats in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if this trend continues, you're going to have a lot of people 
wondering if these programs are worth it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinovo said about 75% of all frequent-flier miles are cashed in for upgrades 
by travelers looking for more comfortable seating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airlines are tinkering with the whole concept," said Michael Brent, 
president of Travel Network Ltd. in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said most carriers have lowered the cap on how many discounted or free 
seats can be justified on each flight. Only a handful may be allotted for 
people using mileage to fly free or upgraded, but if the plane isn't full, a 
carrier will sometimes go beyond the limit and let more free or upgraded 
passengers on board.  
</P>
<P>
 The network of 334 travel agencies affiliated with Brent's company have been 
offering a program in which travelers get mileage credit when they book through 
one of the agents.  
</P>
<P>
 The program is in addition to whatever mileage credit the traveler earns from 
the airline for the same flight, and the free tickets when earned come from the 
network's inventory of bulk-bought tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some catches, however, as a reader in California recently pointed 
out after an earlier report The Los Angeles Times ran on the program. For 
example, a cheap, non-refundable ticket earns only 50% of the air miles 
actually traveled. A full-fare coach ticket is needed to get the actual miles 
traveled credited in the travel agency program. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, full-fare first class earns 150% of miles traveled, while 
full-fare business class gets 125%. Most companies that put business travelers 
in the air, of course, try to avoid paying full fare. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the travel agency program reserves the right to require a 
Saturday night stay on the tickets it hands out, since the tickets come from 
its own inventory and may have such restrictions attached. Information on the 
Travel Network plan can be obtained at (800) 222-2220. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the November issue of Conde Nast Traveler magazine has a lengthy 
report on how some frequent fliers resort to fraud in mileage feeding frenzies 
that have become addictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the illegal gimmicks, the magazine reports, are scavenging airports and 
planes for discarded boarding passes and used tickets, then pasting in their 
own names and submitting them for miles. Another involves buying a refundable 
ticket, checking in to activate the mileage credit, then skipping the flight 
and getting a refund on the ticket, hoping the mileage credit sticks.

INSURANCE SALES CLIMB IN WAKE OF AIR CRASHES; PROTECTION: MUTUAL OF OMAHA 
REPORTS AIRPORT REVENUE IS UP 12% OVER 1993. TRAVELERS' FEARS CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News

<P>
 Before Neal Thompson boarded a USAir flight to Memphis on Thursday, he visited 
a part of the Pittsburgh airport that is becoming more popular: Mutual of 
Omaha's insurance desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal crash of a USAir jetliner near Pittsburgh in September "was an 
unfortunate thing, it was just fate," said Thompson, 71, clutching a $500,000 
policy he purchased for $10. "I don't think anything is going to happen, but 
this is a cheap investment." 
</P>
<P>
 More travelers agree, which boosted Mutual of Omaha's airport life insurance 
sales 12% to $233,000 for September, from the year-earlier $208,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Any increase in life insurance sales will probably come at Pittsburgh and 
other hub airports served by USAir Group Inc., because of perceptions of safety 
problems at the carrier, said Holly Richmond, vice president of marketing at 
Tele-Trip, Mutual of Omaha's travel insurance marketing company. The September 
disaster was USAir's second fatal accident this year. On July 2, a USAir jet 
crashed near Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety concerns among travelers could combine with increased Thanksgiving 
traffic to boost flight insurance sales further at U.S. airports, Richmond 
said. "We typically see a 10% to 15% increase in sales in the two weeks after a 
crash," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A USAir Boeing 737-300 was minutes from landing at Pittsburgh on Sept. 8 when 
it plunged more than 5,000 feet into a hillside, killing all 132 people aboard. 
Seven weeks later, the airline industry had another major accident when an AMR 
Corp. commuter plane crashed outside Chicago on Oct. 31, killing all 68 people 
aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir provided further evidence this week that the September crash lingers in 
the minds of travelers. The airline placed ads in national publications touting 
its recent efforts to improve its safety record, such as hiring a former 
commander in chief of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe to oversee safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance boost that followed the crash came as Mutual of Omaha's airport 
sales were flagging. The company's annual sales of flight insurance in airports 
declined 5% to about $2 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance kiosks, once familiar in most U.S. airports, have largely 
disappeared, done in by credit card companies such as American Express Co. that 
automatically provide free insurance to cardholders who charge plane tickets. 
The flight insurance business has never been all that strong, with many 
travelers simply choosing to rely on existing life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual of Omaha kept kiosks at about 30 major airports and vending machines at 
60 smaller airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use it primarily as a service; people expect to find it there," Richmond 
said. "It's an emotional purchase, often based on superstition." Mutual of 
Omaha's in-flight insurance pays up to $500,000 if a policyholder is killed or 
loses a limb in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has made up for the lost flight insurance sales by diversifying 
its kiosk business to include foreign currency exchange and other financial 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11 million Americans are expected to fly in the nine-day Thanksgiving 
travel period that began Sunday, up about 5% from 1993, according to the Air 
Transport Assn. A fear of accidents isn't likely to keep most Americans off 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Jean and Henry Hughes, who arrived at Pittsburgh from Florida on a 
USAir flight to visit family. Hughes, 63, a retired marine engineer, said he 
flies USAir most of the time and never buys flight insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in predestination," Hughes said as he carried his luggage out of 
the airport. "Whatever will be, will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in flight insurance isn't restricted to airport lobbies. Travel 
agents nationwide said accidents have air travelers asking about crash 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say I'm getting about 10% to 20% more questions about whether it's safe 
to fly or whether they should pay with a credit card to get insurance," said 
Kris Schaefer, a travel agent at Travel 1/Carlson Travel Network in Tucson.

 Swissair, Switzerland's national airline, was voted the world's best airline 
by 34,000 respondents to a reader poll conducted by the travel magazine Conde 
Nast Traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, Swissair was noted for its punctuality, schedules and baggage 
handling. Second place went to Singapore Airlines, a partner of Swissair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conde Nast Traveler award comes on the heels of several other accolades 
for Swissair this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last month, Swissair received an award from Incentive, a U.S.-based 
trade magazine. It was named airline of the year in France and last week 
received an Italian award for best in-flight service on short- and medium-haul 
routes.

 Hilton Hotels Corp. has entered into an agreement with San Diego-based 
KiddieCorp to provide supervised activities for kids, upon request, at select 
Hilton hotels nationwide during conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed for meeting and convention attendees, company parties, trade shows, 
exhibitions and corporate retreats, KiddieCorp contracts with the group to 
provide prearranged, supervised and entertaining care for kids ages 3 months to 
12 years. The arrangement makes it easy for attendees to bring children along. 
</P>
<P>
 "Approximately 15% of all business trips include children," said Robert Dirks, 
senior vice president of marketing for hotel operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost per child is $7 to $10 per hour. KiddieCorp can accommodate a 
dozen to several hundred children.

 Iberia, the Spanish airline, said Wednesday that it is preparing to lay off 
5,000 workers, sell assets and cut costs. The company, struggling to avoid 
imminent bankruptcy, has failed to win union agreement to a 15% pay cut as part 
of a viability plan that would lay the groundwork for an injection of state 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Javier Salas said the job cuts will amount to about 5,000 and could 
come "within days," according to airline sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The news appeared certain to set off a new wave of strikes at Iberia. Unions 
have already called two 24-hour strikes and a number of shorter stoppages this 
month to protest what they see as management's inflexibility.  
</P>
<P>
 About 200 workers marched from Madrid's Barajas airport to the company's 
downtown headquarters in protest Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Iberia has lost more than $1.2 billion in the last four years and expects an 
operating deficit of $258 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The slow post-Christmas season could eat up its remaining resources and tip it 
into bankruptcy early next year, Salas said recently.

 InfoTravel, one of several fast-growing electronic service companies serving 
hotels, is moving ahead with plans to put its newest service in 4,000 Hilton 
and Marriott rooms in the Washington area and at the Ramada Hotel and 
Conference Center at Dunwoody near Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The system allows guests to use a TV remote control to see the inside of local 
restaurants, scan menus and make reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Local advertisers pay to get into the system. The guest calls up a directory 
on the TV screen, listing everything from restaurants and entertainment to the 
nearest doctor or quick-copy shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is capable of producing a map showing how to get from the hotel to 
the location advertised. If the guest wants a copy, punching another number or 
two will produce a printout that can be picked up at the front desk on the way 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 A guest can also call the advertiser from the hotel room by punching in 
another number or two. In the case of a restaurant, that would make a 
reservation possible while the information is still displayed on the screen.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; ANALYSTS FORECAST BETTER TIMES FOR JAPANESE STOCKS -- 
NEXT YEAR; MARKETS: THE NIKKEI HIT A NINE-MONTH LOW THIS WEEK, BUT THE ECONOMY 
IS FINALLY IMPROVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For investors in Japanese stocks, brokers and analysts here are singing a 
familiar tune: Things will stay bad for the next couple of months, but wait for 
better times next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics will remember the tune from earlier this year, last year and the year 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time it's for real, because Japan's economy is finally recovering and 
stock markets overseas look much less appealing than Japan's, brokers and 
analysts say, even though the Nikkei average recently ended at a nine-month 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a terribly good end to the year," said Jason James, strategist at 
James Capel Pacific in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be ending with a whimper rather than a bang," James said after 
the bellwether Nikkei average ended Tuesday at a nine-month low, down 158.73 
points at 18,962.99. 
</P>
<P>
 The market was closed Wednesday because of a public holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Japanese stocks fell largely because of the weakness of markets in 
New York overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 But selling pressure is likely to remain until the end of the year, when big 
foreign investors sell to boost stocks' performance before they calculate how 
they have done over the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next couple of months, there is also likely to be heavy selling from 
investors who bought on credit, or margin, in June and July when the Tokyo 
market boomed. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainly individual investors who bought then are now being asked to pay the 
outstanding balance for their shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But most are closing their positions at a loss because the market is weaker 
now than it was when they bought. 
</P>
<P>
 Before selling by foreigners and individuals subsides at the end of this year 
or the start of next, brokers and analysts say, the Nikkei could fall as low as 
18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only another 900 points to go to 18,000, so we could reach that 
before the end of the year," said longtime bull Yasuo Ueki, general manager at 
Nikko Securities in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Nikkei hits 18,000, it would still be way above its 1993 low of 
16,078.71, reached Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 After the short-term pressures are out of the way, however, share prices in 
Tokyo should start to climb, though few expect anything spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite a lot of foreigners are tipping Japan for next year," and that should 
lift the market out of its current gloom, said Tim Hayashida, strategist at 
Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the medium term, there are some people increasing weightings here 
because they hate the rest of the world," said James of James Capel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayashida and James said foreign investors remain bullish on Japan partly 
because New York, London and many of Southeast Asia's stock markets look 
vulnerable as their growth starts to slow. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Japan's economy is just starting to get going after a 3 
1/2-year recession dubbed by many as Japan's toughest since the end of World 
War II.

 "Looking at interim results, they are higher than I expected, and I think that 
my expectations were higher than average," said James, who believes that these 
earnings reflect a stronger economic recovery than recent statistics suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate earnings are likely to continue recovering in 1995, but James said 
rising bond yields will deter many investors from buying shares aggressively, 
ruling out sharp share price rises until perhaps as late as this time next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that with bond yields where they are now, you have to be pretty 
convinced that there is pretty strong earnings growth for at least two years" 
to buy stocks, James said, because current returns on bonds look attractive to 
many investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikko's Ueki disagreed, saying he expects a big influx of foreign money to 
boost prices as early as January, when the Nikkei is likely to start a rally.

 Distribution Pact: I-Flow Corp. of Irvine said Wednesday that it has entered 
into a three-year exclusive distribution agreement with SoloPak Pharmaceuticals 
Inc. and hopes its revenue from the sale of SoloPak products will help it pull 
out of its long-running financial slump.

<P>
 The contract with the Elk Grove, Ill.-based medical device firm is valued at 
$16.9 million. "It should contribute to improving our bottom line," said James

 Czech Luxury Hospital Sale Falls Through: The $46.4-million sale of the Czech 
Republic's most luxurious hospital to a group partly controlled by South 
Africa's Clinic Holdings Ltd. has collapsed, the Czech news agency CTK said. 
The 230-bed hospital, known as Na Homolce, once served former Czechoslovakia's 
top Communist Party officials and is now receiving up to $3.5 million a year 
from the Czech government to stay in operation.Euro Hospital Group Praha is 
made up of Clinic Holdings, a surgical and medical private hospital group in 
Johannesburg, South Africa; Cape Town, South Africa-based Syfin Holdings, and a 
Czech company formed by Na Homolce's director and three head doctors. The group 
won its bid for the sale in January and signed a contract in August.

 * Mexican stocks plunged after the deputy attorney general resigned and 
accused senior ruling party officials of covering up the investigation into the 
murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Masseiu, the party's secretary general. The Bolsa 
stock market index fell as much as 75 points to 2,376.23 after the official 
said the top two party leaders had hindered his investigation. * The prospect 
that party officials obstructed the inquiry has again put fractious politics in

 Economic reforms encouraged by international lenders have reduced budget 
deficits and led to increased foreign investment. But the economy still suffers 
from a high rate of population growth, high unemployment, the vulnerability of

 Brazil Oil Workers Strike: The Brazil Federation of Oil Workers -- estimated 
to include up to 80% of the nation's 50,000 oil workers -- launched a strike 
that crippled operations at eight of the nation's 10 refineries and threatened 
the country with shortages of cooking gas and diesel fuel.Brazil refines the 
entire 1.2 million barrels of oil it consumes daily. Newspapers reported that 
the strike caught Petrobras, the government oil monopoly, with low stocks. The 
strike -- the second in three months -- began when the government reneged on an 
agreement to give workers raises, job stability and other benefits.

SOUTHWEST'S KEY INDICATOR OF PERFORMANCE DECREASES; AIRLINES: CARRIER'S YIELD 
-- A GAUGE OF PASSENGER REVENUE PER MILE -- IS DOWN. SO TOO ARE GROWTH, 
PERCENTAGE OF SEATS FILLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Competition on the West Coast and scattered fare sales across its routes have 
pushed down a key indicator of financial performance at Southwest Airlines Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest, which has 17 daily flights from Orange County's John Wayne Airport, 
expects its yield -- an expression of revenue per passenger mile -- to decline 
in the fourth quarter. It wouldn't say by how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrywide discounting is the chief reason, said Gary Kelly, chief financial 
officer, as well as a slow start-up of service in the Pacific Northwest and 
Salt Lake City. He expects that latter trend to reverse with the beginning of 
ski season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year-ago quarter, Southwest's yield was 11.93 cents, Kelly said. 
Southwest's yield for the first nine months of the year was 11.70 cents 
compared with 11.72 cents in the 1993 period. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Southwest's traffic hasn't sustained its usual pace of 15% or so 
growth. While last month's traffic was up 9.5%, load factor -- the percentage 
of seats filled -- fell three points to 65%. Kelly said 1993's load factor was 
extraordinarily high, and "to be at 65 this year is nothing to be ashamed 
about." The company has said November's load factor isn't likely to match the 
year-ago 65.9%, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's response to the declining yields and load factor has been its own 
selected fare sales to stimulate traffic, including reinstituting its 21-day 
advance purchase fare; a special half-off promotion from certain cities; and a 
$99 fare in other markets. And last week it sent frequent fliers a special 
offer: Fly three round trips by February and get a free trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pressure on its revenue, Southwest has had success holding back 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the company announced it reached agreement with its pilots for a 
new 10-year contract under which the pilots will get no wage increase for the 
first five years, although they'll get profit sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest has also cut the percentage of tickets sold through travel agents in 
the most recent quarter to 47% from 55%. Major airlines typically sell 80% of 
their tickets through travel agents, who get a 10% commission on the cost of 
the ticket. The drop means Southwest now captures more revenue per ticket, 
although it is paying more than it did to mail out tickets to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net result is an enormous increase in ticket by mail volume," Kelly said. 
"We've captured a lot of direct business we otherwise wouldn't have." 
</P>
<P>
 The airline also is experimenting with a ticketless system on some flights, 
particularly in California where it is competing head-to-head with UAL Corp.'s 
West Coast shuttle. Fewer than 20% of Southwest customers use ticketless 
systems where available, and the airline is putting it in place slowly to avoid 
technical problems.

SHELLSHOCKED; MESSY. NOISY. POPULAR. WHAT IS IT ABOUT SUNFLOWER SEEDS, ANYWAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Did you hear that noise? 
</P>
<P>
 Crack . 
</P>
<P>
 Shhhhhh, listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ptheew . 
</P>
<P>
 Wait, it should be coming around again shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack . . . ptheew . 
</P>
<P>
 Aha! Another sunflower seed has been eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, it seems, is going nuts for the seeds. From the mouths of baseball 
players and truck drivers, the "crack 'n spit" set is spreading throughout the 
land. Even the cubicles of corporate America have not been spared from the 
sound that, over time, can start needle-pointing your nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 The cybernetically bound are suffering from a chronic case of the crunchies as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, of course we eat them -- who doesn't?" says Melissa Mollo, a feature 
production coordinator at 20th Century Fox who seed-shares with her office 
mates and is on a first-name basis with her particular brand of sunflower seed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all pitch in a buck for a big bag of David's and pour it into a communal 
bowl. The seeds are also good busy food when you're in production, although 
sometimes my mouth gets raw by the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 According to major players in the sunflower field, as a nation we consume 
between 75 million and 100 million pounds of in-the-shell seeds a year -- 
enough to make you consider investing in lip balm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market has grown by about 7% to 10% a year in the 1990s," estimates Kelly 
Engelstad, president of Dahlgren & Co., which bills itself as the world's 
leading supplier of sunflower products. "And I'd say it will continue to grow," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the salty little suckers in their jail-stripe uniforms have upped 
and gone gourmet. With the rise of sunflower power, "plain-Jane salted" has 
morphed into barbecue, salsa, curry, Cajun, ranch, low-salt, no-salt, you name 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who sits next to me eats them constantly," says Julio Ramirez, a 
senior systems engineer at Rockwell. "He wears really nice suits and 
occasionally I'll notice a seed that's dribbled out and is dangling from his 
pocket handkerchief." 
</P>
<P>
 Or they will fall to the floor below. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about a janitors' nightmare!" exclaims John Real, operations manager for 
Professional Building Maintenance in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to Real, is that industrial vacuum cleaners tend to 
regurgitate the shells after sucking them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It drives you nuts," he vents. "You think you're done and then you look and 
there are still shells all over the floor. In the end, you have to get down on 
your hands and knees to pick them up." 
</P>
<P>
 Real and his 300-400 member crew find the hellish hulls everywhere. Malls, 
theaters, schools. And office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever you have a seed eater, it's bad. You've got 400 little containers in 
the room and they're all full of seeds. They never seem to end up in the can. I 
recommend pumpkin seeds. You swallow them whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, you can eat sunflower seeds whole, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Mollo does -- "more to love" as she puts it. But that, scoffs Bill Thompson, 
president of the ubiquitous Fresno-based David & Sons, is decidedly "amateur." 
Picking the shell off the seed with your fingers is only half a step up, he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 With the endorsement of Major League Baseball behind David's sunflower seeds, 
Thompson is happy to play Mr. Manners on the etiquette of cracking the snack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real eaters," he says, "put a dozen or more in the mouth, store them in a 
cheek and use their tongue to move one seed at a time into the molar area where 
they crack the shell and separate the meat." 
</P>
<P>
 All this tricky hand-mouth coordination is part of the reason our snacking 
habits are going to seed, according to Beverly Hills nutrition therapist Elyse 
Resch. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are looking for ways to fill up the boredom and anything that takes 
time to eat is appealing. Also this is very oral -- the fingers go in the 
mouth, you play with the seed, you chew on it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if it's not exactly healthy for the mind, at least it's good for the 
body, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the raw deal: If you gnaw and spitball your way through a bag of seeds 
thinking, "Health food . . . happy faces . . . hippies . . . better than 
peanuts . . . I'm eating like a bird," you'd better feather up, my friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, birds don't eat 'em -- not pet birds, anyway. At least, not pet 
birds with responsible owners who say sunflower seeds are way too fatty for 
anything other than an occasional treat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even baseball players are curbing the habit. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning of the season we ate a lot of them," says Gina Satriano of 
the Colorado Silver Bullets, who is also deputy district attorney for Los 
Angeles County in the Compton office. "But midway through, we stopped because 
they're too fattening. We started chewing gum instead." 
</P>
<P>
 If sunflower seeds are too fatty for the caged and batting, imagine what that 
means for desk potatoes trying to survive the office spread. 
</P>
<P>
 The puniest little packet of David's (1 7/8 ounces) is 170 calories, about 70% 
of which come from fat. 
</P>
<P>
 In all fairness, sunflower seeds are high in iron while most of the fat is the 
"good" unsaturated kind. And let's not leave out the fact that David Der 
Hairbedian -- the David of David & Sons -- lived to the ripe old age of 99. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as David goes, however, maintenance man John Real is looking for his 
ghost -- or whoever wrote the copy on the back of the sunflower seed bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you read the instructions for 'How to eat,' " asks Real? "It says, 
'Crack and discard shell.' It doesn't say anything about a garbage pail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually like to eat sunflower seeds myself," he confesses, "but for me the 
whole thing's become a kind of phobia."

'HEARTS AND HANDS'; CONCERN FOR AT-RISK BABIES IS THE COMMON THREAD THAT LINKS

 Quilters are always thinking about the next pattern. More importantly, they 
think about who will get that next pieced-together monument to geometry and 
craftsmanship. They think about who will touch it, who will hold it close. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hands and hearts," said Ellen Ahlgren, sharing the formula of this ancient 
and universal form of textile art. That was what was on Ahlgren's mind in 1988, 
not long after she had retired as a high school teacher and taken up quilting. 
</P>
<P>
 She was finishing up the last of 20 quilts for immediate and extended family 
members. She was also leafing through a newsletter from psychologist Elisabeth 
Kubler-Ross, with whom Ahlgren had studied in another of her retirement 
projects. Kubler-Ross had written about the plight of 3,000 babies abandoned in 
hospitals around the country after being born with HIV, the virus that causes 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I thought, well, why in the world couldn't we just make 3,000 quilts?" A 
hearty woman, Ahlgren had to laugh in retrospect at her own ambitiousness. "I 
thought, 'that's nothing.' " She chuckled again. "You know me, the eternal 
optimist." 
</P>
<P>
 Little did Ahlgren know that she was setting forth on a patchwork path paved 
with love, goodness and the generosity of strangers. Ahlgren's initial 
algorithm -- AIDS babies need love and comfort; quilts are comforting and made 
with love -- became the spark for ABC Quilts, the not-for-profit empire she has 
overseen since 1988 with her friend Ann White. 
</P>
<P>
 From their headquarters in a church basement in this southern New Hampshire 
hamlet, Ahlgren and White have seen to the distribution of 161,000 handmade 
quilts for babies in hospitals across America. In addition, ABC Quilts sent 
almost 2,000 quilts to infants in Romania, as well as 400 quilts bound for 
babies in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Globalizing their project turned Ahlgren, 75, and White, 74, into ad hoc, 
unpaid multinational entrepreneurs -- complete with their own board of 
directors. They have quilters in Japan who supply futon-sized baby coverlets. 
In fact, in Japan at this summer's international conference on AIDS, Ahlgren 
and White gave presentations about their work. Their new international focus 
prompted Bob Keeshan, better known in many homes as Captain Kangaroo, to 
describe ABC Quilts as "love letters to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 As its mission has broadened, so has the group's name. ABC originally stood 
for AIDS-Babies Cribs; now, as the hand-sewn coverlets are offered to children 
born addicted to drugs or alcohol as well as to those exposed to AIDS, the 
acronym has been extended to At-risk Babies Cribs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a lovely example of non-ideological social action, people coming 
together to do what they can for vulnerable children," said Washington, D.C., 
children's advocate Susan Nall Bales, who serves on ABC's board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a piece of Americana," Bales said. "It makes you think of the 
unique relationship of quilting to social action, as in the temperance and 
anti-slavery movements." 
</P>
<P>
 A white-haired mother of five, grandmother of nine, Ahlgren "put a little ad" 
in a quilting publication to get the project off the ground. Among those who 
responded -- with a quilt and a note wondering what else she could do to help 
-- was Eileen Van Fleet of Glendora. Ahlgren promptly wrote back and drafted 
Van Fleet as her West Coast coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Fleet, a retired labor and delivery nurse, was immediately struck by how 
the quilting venture brought together so many disparate segments of society. 
There were the babies, of course -- and often there were the mothers, 
grandmothers or others who would care for them. But there were also thousands 
of quilters -- often, Van Fleet said, "men and women who didn't feel needed or 
loved any more, sitting home in their trailer parks." On some occasions, Van 
Fleet has received quilts from families who have crafted their quilts in memory 
of lost loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Ahlgren and White are mildly astonished at the swath their project has 
cut. So many students -- from elementary school to college -- began making 
quilts for ABC that in 1992 Ahlgren came out with a book, "Kids Making Quilts 
for Kids," published by the Quilt Digest Press. Home economics classes have 
embraced the quilting effort as for-credit philanthropy, and several colleges 
have staged "quilt-a-ramas" to assist ABC. On the wall beside Ahlgren's desk is 
a photograph filled with beaming Southern California children. The caption, 
from Ocean Knoll Elementary School in Encinitas, reads, "650 Students Made 77 
Quilts." 
</P>
<P>
 In Lilburn, Ga., 16-year-old Eagle Scout Travis Armstrong made several quilts 
himself and enlisted local quilting guilds to make others for ABC. Some quilts 
were arduously sewn by hand, detailed efforts that took weeks to complete; 
others were made on sewing machines in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 When his final collection tally was 55 quilts, Travis explained that he had 
been drawn by the notion that for many of these babies, a quilt might be their 
sole possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahlgren and White have found that for many of their young volunteers, the very 
act of working together opens unexpected doors of communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they are making the quilts, it stimulates discussion about AIDS," White 
said. "It's part of the loop of our organization. You'll have these kids, who 
might be too embarrassed to talk about sex or sexually transmitted diseases, 
and in the course of making a quilt, they ask, 'So how does a baby get AIDS?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, maximum security prisoners -- all of them male -- incarcerated 
in Connecticut, California and Colorado also joined the ranks of ABC's 
volunteer quilters. 
</P>
<P>
 To visit some of her quilters at a Youth Authority facility in Whittier, Van 
Fleet had to agree to a strip-search by prison officials. It turned out the 
inmates had made "some of the most artistic quilts I'd ever seen," Van Fleet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilting, as Ahlgren pointed out, was a mainstay of American pioneer 
communities. "It was the original support group," she observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she sees the same sense of connectedness among volunteers she may only 
know by first name, signed on an ABC patch that goes on every quilt the group 
distributes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, she too is pulled into the lives of her quilters -- such as the 
retired couple in Michigan who pledged that together they would make 500 quilts 
for ABC. A dozen or so quilts short of their goal, the wife died. But the 
husband continued, and recently sent in the 500th quilt in memory of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories like that add fuel to their seemingly endless allotment of hope, 
Ahlgren and White agreed. Surveying a small mountain of cardboard-crated 
comfort -- quilts about to be shipped to hospitals in New England -- White 
said: "When you're working on something like this, you just feel good when you 
wake up in the morning, because you know something wonderful will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 To their equation of heart and hand, Ahlgren and White have recently added the 
element of "head," or mind. Even in a rural community that has not seen a 
single case of HIV infection, AIDS is a problem "you have to just keep thinking 
about and thinking about," Ahlgren said.

FIRST PERSON: LEARNING DIGNITY FROM A GENERATION THAT KNOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a hot June day in 1944, my aunt's high school graduation ceremony -- behind 
barbed wire, under an armed-guard tower -- was cut short by a fierce dust 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
 My aunt, who wore a dreary gray cap and gown, fled to her barracks in the U.S. 
government's internment camp in Poston, Ariz. Her graduation gift was a piece 
of chocolate cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, I watched with mixed emotions as my aunt and 12 other 
Japanese Americans finally got the graduation ceremony they should have had in 
Los Angeles. To a standing ovation last month at their Class of '44 reunion, 
Los Angeles school district officials presented the Japanese Americans with 
replicas of the diplomas they would have received in 1944, had they not been 
torn from Theodore Roosevelt High School in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman accepted her diploma with a traditional, waist-deep bow, grateful 
for getting something that was rightfully hers 50 years late. Later, I was 
saddened when my aunt, 68-year-old June Tawa Nakano, told a Japanese-English 
daily paper: "The school did a wonderful deed for us. It brought our spirit 
back like we were good citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 I found their humility moving but also frustrating. It was hard for me, a 
third-generation Japanese American, to understand why my aunt and her peers 
showed no bitterness at lost proms, lost football games, lost freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Four decades after my aunt's internment, my high school graduation ended with 
an all-night party at Disneyland. I count my days at Torrance High School among 
the best in my life. Those are the years that shaped my identity. The loss of 
those years would mean a loss of self. How could you ever make up for that? 
</P>
<P>
 I measured disappointment by a different yardstick than my aunt did in her 
high school years. I thought hardship was being stuck with 20 leftover apple 
pies from a Sadie Hawkins dance I had planned as junior class president. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is it that I am bitter for my aunt and her peers, even if they are not? 
</P>
<P>
 Mine is the self-righteous viewpoint of someone who has the luxury to lament a 
moral outrage, thanks to those who walked before me. I am a product of their 
lives, the tail on their comet. They endured the indignities of the war and 
then moved on, their heads held high, so that my generation could have a better 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 My aunt's generation is also private; she never talked about the war camps to 
her son or daughter. My father, a physician, never talked about it, and I 
regret not asking. It is a burden I'll bear the rest of my life; he died in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 At the diploma ceremony, I pressed my aunt gently to express her feelings but 
then stopped. I wasn't there to be Barbara Walters. This was her night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My aunt's generation was closely tied to the humble values of its immigrant 
parents. When they got their marching orders in May, 1942, they simply went. My 
aunt packed up, along with her mother and two brothers -- one of them my 
father, a fifth-grader at the time. My grandfather, a seed salesman, was 
shipped off to a separate camp in New Mexico for suspected spies. He wasn't a 
spy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shikata ga nai. It can't be helped. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first night of her imprisonment, my aunt, a high school sophomore, 
stuffed a canvas sack full of straw for her mattress. Watch out for scorpions, 
someone told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, later my aunt and her peers remained loyal to a government that had 
robbed them of their high school years, and they worked to rebuild their 
country and their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Giri, ninjo. Duty and obligation, from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war's end in 1945, more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent were 
freed. Scores of them had lost their homes, their businesses, their pride. Some 
of these American citizens came home to boarded-up businesses covered with 
graffiti: Go home, Japs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimbo, gaman. Patience, endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 I am the lucky one for their forbearance. I was born into a world that is 
slowly awakening to the riches of multiculturalism and diversity; their world 
was marred by segregation and intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, my aunt's generation, the Nisei, retained dignity in the face of 
injustice through a collective faith in traditional values -- ones, I'm afraid, 
that will all but disappear with their passing. 
</P>
<P>
 I -- and probably most third-generation Americans -- am more shaped by the 
values of this country than the ones of my ancestors. My generation prizes 
openness and assertiveness, values that allow me to begrudge a historic wrong 
with unrestrained anger. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until I lived in Japan on a one-year fellowship that I began to 
understand the traditions of my heritage, even though my mother was born and 
raised in Japan. Day after day, I saw duty and obligation played out, even in 
the interplay of virtual strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 One day when my American friend, Tyler, bounced a check, a Japanese bank 
teller who realized the error covered for him -- with funds from her personal 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, my aunt's 50th reunion was an eye-opener. "Now, which barrack were you 
in?" the graduates asked each other blithely. That was all they said about the 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, as a 20-piece orchestra played Glenn Miller hits, my aunt hunted 
down classmates she hadn't seen since the war. She hadn't gone to any other 
Roosevelt reunions because she felt she didn't belong without a diploma from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. I thought it was lovely and touching that the class of 
1944 had remembered my aunt and her peers. The diploma ceremony moved many 
observers to tears, including M. Bud Weber, executive chairman of the reunion 
committee that had come up with the idea to remember the Japanese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people had been thinking about this for 50 years," said Weber, a 
Mission Viejo resident. "It was a strange and tragic thing to watch them go. We 
tried as best we could to make up for some of it. They are Roosevelt Rough 
Riders like us, and we wanted to let them know they belong to our family for 
the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 After the diploma ceremony, 68-year-old Bruce Kaji of Gardena gave a short 
speech on behalf of his peers, imploring the audience to remember the 
contributions of Japanese Americans during the war against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't forget us," Kaji told his classmates, "and that is what is deeply 
and sincerely appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
 My aunt and the others said they finally felt complete, with diplomas in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was well worth the wait. It was well worth the pain. It just made me feel 
young again," said 69-year-old Archie Miyatake, of Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was thrilling," my aunt said. "I could talk about it for years and years." 
</P>
<P>
 And I will think about it for years and years. My aunt and her peers made 
their peace; I'm not sure I ever will. Now, in my head, I can understand how 
they feel but not truly in my heart. At the same time, I have a new respect for 
the way they carried on, with a class and grace that I wish I had. 
</P>
<P>
 I have giri and ninjo of my own, a duty and obligation that I tend to forget. 
My struggle is to learn from the wisdom of the generation before and remember 
that we share a proud culture that is in danger of fading away. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, several of the Nisei whom I had just met said they recognized my 
name from reading The Times. One woman said she scanned the paper for bylines 
of the Sansei, with their Japanese surnames and American first names. "We are 
so proud of all of you," she told me. 
</P>
<P>
 They are proud of my generation; I am proud of theirs.

OTHER VIEWS; HE COLLECTS BOOKS; SHE COLLECTS STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL WILLIAMS, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A while back a friend sent my wife and me a Booth cartoon from the New Yorker 
magazine showing an older couple on a very cluttered front porch "just 
a-settin' there." Two people are passing on the sidewalk, and one remarks to 
the other, "He married her for her stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, our friend thought there might be some sort of connection between 
the Booth characters and us. How could that be? I don't collect stuff. I 
collect books. And my wife, well, I guess she does collect stuff. But it is 
interesting stuff, unusual stuff, often stuff extremely hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 She has worked for an airline for many years and has used this position to 
travel and scour foreign flea markets. She has been to Machu Picchu twice. To 
Nepal twice river rafting. And to many, many other places. 
</P>
<P>
 She has picked coins out of potholes at the top of Iguazu Falls while wading 
along in the river. She has a stone figure from rural Colombia, purchased in a 
remote mountain village and lugged home on a journey that began on local buses 
festooned with chickens and pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was in Kenya, her bus had a flat, and she managed to garner a giraffe 
skull nearby -- where she was reconnoitering until the driver reminded her that 
lions might be around. Her cleaning person used to stand on a carved African 
chief's stool to dust until I reminded her that a stepladder from the local 
hardware would work as well as an antique from the ends of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first visited my wife's living room, before we were married, I found 
myself stared at from every wall by masks from all over, some pleasant, some 
grotesque. Much later in London she picked up another mask, apparently from 
Thailand, a long-faced, bearded man with huge ears, under the illusion that it 
would fit into our luggage. Somehow, she got it home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her collections have remained in boxes for many years, awaiting a 
mansion large enough to display them -- collections of boxes, baskets, rabbit 
figurines, glass, old bottles, Oriental rugs, all neatly sorted and stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, under the influence of a button-collecting friend, she has lately 
taken up buttons, which don't require much room. It started innocently enough, 
with her getting buttons for her friend, whom she refers to as Button Bette. 
Now at a flea market, I point out to her booths Button Bette would like, and 
she searches through rifts and piles of buttons, of which Button Bette may 
eventually see a few. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip to England, we also did some hiking on high fells in spring 
and found a few sheep that hadn't made it through the winter. So we came home 
with two very necessary sheep skulls, horns included, that she somehow fit into 
her suitcase. The customs people never batted an eyelash. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bystander, I do a certain amount of chortling about all this, of course. 
I pretend to be innocent. We both collect rocks, so that doesn't count. My 
other collection is books, and I can pretend that all of them relate to my work 
in some way. 
</P>
<P>
 I began that many years ago as a graduate student in Philadelphia with 
absolutely no spare money. So I used to frequent the used-book stores, like the 
famous Leary's, looking for true bargains in first editions. I found many old 
second editions. Once in a great while there was a first. And then there were 
Dutch auctions, in which every book was sold for the same price, and the price 
was lowered daily. The trick for the impecunious was to decline purchase until 
a book was an unbelievable bargain, hoping that no one else would snatch it 
away ahead of you. 
</P>
<P>
 I once bought Volume 2 of the first edition of James Fenimore Cooper's "Red 
Rover" that way. Why, I'm not sure. It was irresistibly cheap. So the fact that 
it was truly useless without Volume 1 didn't bother me. It was, somehow I 
thought, interesting. The paper and binding were fine. The book was in good 
shape. I think I may still have it, a part of the more than two tons of books I 
moved to California eight years ago. Of course many of them are still in boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 I keep assuring myself that there is a point to all this. There must be. I 
mean, other than affording a source of laughter to our friends. After all, I 
once bought a first edition of the poems of Henry Timrod, laureate of the 
Confederacy, in good shape, in a furniture store in Newark, N.J., for a dime. 
And a first edition of Henry Thoreau's "The Maine Woods" for $6. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I could regale readers with many more stories if I didn't have to 
build more shelves in the basement. That way, it will still be a while before 
we have to move to a larger house.

CREATING SENSE OF FAMILY TRADITION; CUSTOMS: FINDING A SPECIAL ACTIVITY THAT 
EVERYONE ENJOYS CAN ADD MEANING TO THE HOLIDAYS -- AND PROVIDE LASTING 
MEMORIES. 
</P>

 It's easy to let the too-hectic holidays turn into one big blur and to forget 
the simple pleasures the whole family could treasure. But the holidays should 
be a means of drawing attention to what counts, said Roderic Gorney, a UCLA 
professor of psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The holidays ought to be re-crafted by a family to ensure the essence doesn't 
get lost in the trappings," Gorney said. Families that discover their own 
holiday traditions are developing a sense of belonging to something special -- 
a personal, family identity, he said. That means rethinking the holiday to come 
up with activities that will be meaningful and can fit everyone's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 One family Gorney knows goes to a redwood grove every Thanksgiving, with a 
picnic dinner in hand, to spend some special time outdoors together. "They've 
been doing it for years and their teen-agers are still eager to make sacrifices 
to keep participating in that trip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even something as simple as picking out the Christmas tree can serve as a 
central tradition for a family. By repeating the routine year after year, 
children develop a sense of continuity, which helps make them feel part of the 
larger world community, Gorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 From families that have tried them, here are 10 ideas -- some old, some new -- 
for creating fun and meaningful traditions: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Buy a special new holiday book every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Go for the books with great, impressive art and mix the classics with the new. 
Keep the tomes on the coffee table and read aloud from the growing collection 
-- by the fire or with the lights low -- a little every night of the season  
</P>
<P>
 2. Do something as a family for a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The activity can vary every year, depending on the children's ages and 
everyone's interests. Sign up to help cook and serve dinner at a homeless 
shelter, buy toys for children who really need them or help clear a trail in 
the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Start an ongoing family holiday journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Buy a nice blank book and have every member of the family write a personal 
message or thought every year. As time goes by, past messages will not only 
document the children's growth, but will be lasting, touching reminders of 
holidays past. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Get tickets for a holiday production. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is "The Nutcracker," "A Christmas Carol" or something completely 
new, go see something colorful and fun -- together. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Organize a neighborhood potluck dessert or dinner and caroling. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not have to be complicated and can involve nothing more than 
photocopied music and a big jug of hot chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Take a day off from the holiday craziness and go somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Find a fun hike in the hills or bring a picnic and sweat shirts for a winter 
solstice beach day. Whatever the escape, it is likely to serve as a recharge 
for the harried -- young or old. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Go light-seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Put the kids in their pajamas, add a few warm blankets and drive through the 
most aggressively decorated neighborhoods to see holiday light displays. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Make a day of decorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Get the tree, find favorite ornaments, assemble the creche, put lights on a 
giant wooden Star of David -- turn up the music and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Bake. 
</P>
<P>
 Opt for gingerbread men, special breads, cookie-cutter sugar cookies or old 
family recipes and turn the project into a family affair, saving at least some 
treats for gifts the children can deliver to friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Catch a parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's the Hollywood Christmas Parade, the Rose Parade or a small 
community event, the bands, floats and horses can add a traditional festive 
note to the holidays, and get everyone -- including any out-of-town relatives 
or friends -- out of the house.

 Ah, those parenting books. Written by psychiatrists and other physicians, 
grabbed by Mom and Dad on the run, consulted the way parents used to consult 
their parents or Mrs. Jones down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into any bookstore and you'll find hundreds of them, their titles 
reflecting the growing number of problems children have been "discovered" to 
have and the legions of professionals who feel qualified to solve them. "Why 
Johnny Can't Concentrate." "Raising Your Spirited Child." "The Misunderstood 
Child." "Children With Asthma," "Children With Epilepsy," even "The Emotional 
Problems of Normal Children." 
</P>
<P>
 "There seem to be more parenting books every year, and I find that alarming," 
says Ann Ruethling, who skims at least five new titles a week for her 
Chinaberry Book Service, a mail-order firm specializing in books for children 
and families. "It says to me that as parents we see problems, and we're 
groping. We don't know ourselves anymore, much less our children." 
</P>
<P>
 The world's most famous baby doctor, Benjamin Spock, who still travels and 
lectures despite his advanced years, says uncertainty is the most prevalent 
difficulty he observes in his audiences today. "American parents are losing 
more and more confidence in themselves," he says. "I don't think that's a 
healthy sign." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to books, there are parenting magazines -- 97, according to the 
National Directory of Magazines. Some, such as Child, Parenting, and Parents -- 
the grandmother of them all -- have a broad circulation, but many more are 
local. The information-hungry parent can also cruise the info-highway and find 
at least a dozen electronic bulletin boards offering advice and conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, when today's parents were smearing oatmeal on their own high 
chairs, there was Spock. Period. "Trust yourself," he began "Baby and Child 
Care," published in 1946. But no one listened, and soon came Brazelton and 
Leach, Ginott and Faber, Eisenberg and hundreds more. 
</P>
<P>
 Parenting by intuition was gradually replaced with parenting by technique, 
says psychologist David Elkind, and responsibility for child-rearing shifted 
subtly from parent to Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
 The early experts, such as Spock and Arnold Gesell, outlined general norms of 
development by age and assured parents they could translate these norms, Elkind 
says in his latest book, "Ties That Stress: The New Family Imbalance." Later 
authors, he says, became more "prescriptive in tone, judgmental in attitude and 
specific in their aims." The new breed appears to want to help parents modify, 
rather than understand, their children's behavior, says Elkind, who doesn't 
altogether approve of this trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Elkind suggests that many of today's parents prefer the quick technique 
because it's just that -- quick. Freddi Greenberg, editor-in-chief of Child, 
agrees that that's one reason. "Sixty percent of our readers work full-time," 
says Greenberg, whose magazine articles combine a developmental approach with 
specific techniques. "They want to be told, 'Here are two or three choices that 
will make sense for your child.' " Greenberg, a mother of five, adds, "We 
(parents) really do try to make every minute count." Previous generations of 
parents spent more time at home, she says, and "they didn't obsess as much." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Lisa West, 37, gave birth to Alex about a year ago, and like many of 
her contemporaries, she has attacked child-rearing with the same degree of 
seriousness with which she pursues her career -- perhaps even more. She's the 
kind of reader that Peter Ginna, senior editor at Crown Books, has in mind when 
he peruses new manuscripts, because she wants to know not only what she is 
supposed to do but why. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Testani, a former psychiatric nurse, sees the same intensity in 
mothers who stay at home. She attributes this to the later age at which parents 
are having children. Older parents are both "more wise to the ways of the 
world" than mothers and fathers in their 20s, and more reflective, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 They're also more likely to have undergone psychological counseling, says 
Testani, and to have thought about the families in which they grew up and to 
want to not repeat past mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet parents can be too reflective, read too much and expect too much. As 
Elkind notes in his book, they can feel pressured to rush their children into 
skills prematurely and to expect certain behaviors the youngsters are not ready 
for, setting up their children for failure and themselves for deep 
disappointment. "Parents may become overly concerned about doing things the 
'right' way and convey this inhibiting and constraining concern to their 
child," he notes.

NO NEED FOR AN ARTISTIC GIFT TO CREATE HANDMADE CARDS; CRAFTS: RUBBER STAMPS, 
EMBOSSING POWDERS AND HIGH-QUALITY INK PADS CAN HELP IN MAKING ATTRACTIVE 
GREETINGS. THE ACTIVITY CAN BE RELAXING. 
</P>

 Cheryl Trostrud-White remembers how fun it was as a young child to get out her 
felt-tipped pens and paper to make holiday cards for her family's friends. Now, 
she gets a similar pleasure using rubber stamps and special papers to create 
handmade cards for her own friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Trostrud-White, of Calabasas, is part of a growing trend: Craft and rubber 
stamp store proprietors and instructors say more and more people are taking the 
time and energy to create cards instead of sending out pre-printed holiday 
greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of what is fueling the newfound interest in card making is the wealth of 
new materials on the market that make even the artistically challenged capable 
of creating something worth appreciating, said Tricie Krim, an Agoura 
card-making instructor. Rubber stamps, for example, combined with embossing 
powders and high-quality ink pads can minimize the talent it takes to turn out 
a good-looking card. 
</P>
<P>
 Geri Laughlin, manager of Rubber Boots, a card and gift store in Toluca Lake, 
said she is seeing a growing number of people gluing their family's holiday 
photos to interesting papers and cards and then decorating them with rubber 
stamps, glitter and stickers. "People want to do their own thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are interesting new papers available, tiny ribbons and hand-folded 
or pleated papers that add depth and texture to a card, Krim said. Some people 
like to create collages, using news clips, postcards, stamps or magazine photos 
to design an interesting and meaningful melange. 
</P>
<P>
 Some card makers use stencils with watercolors, and then add salt, for 
example, on a snowman to create the look of ice or drop tiny bits of rubbing 
alcohol on the watercolor to create the effect of dots. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Safer, who teaches watercolor and stencil techniques at Paper Post, a 
rubber-stamp and card store in Westlake, said she finds that adults and 
children enjoy taking time out to do something creative. "People really relax 
and have fun with this stuff. People in our society are so hung up about not 
being able to draw that when they get a relatively easy way to do something 
artistic, they love it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Making homemade holiday cards does not have to be expensive, Krim said. She 
advocates buying just one or two rubber stamps, then using the colors of the 
holiday to make the card look festive and original. The inside messages can be 
stamped or handwritten, and there are a wide range of colors of ink to choose 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people give handcrafted cards instead of gifts, putting them in Lucite or 
deeper-than-usual frames, Safer said. "They're not expensive, and they are 
very, very appreciated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children can enjoy having a part to play in the holiday card giving. To help 
get them going, Krim suggests displaying a few examples and putting out a wide 
variety of different materials, like rubber stamps, stencils, markers, cotton, 
papers and straw. There are also many classes available in card making for 
children, and some products in toy stores provide ideas, stencils, stickers and 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who send homemade cards say that in today's ultra-fast-paced world, 
taking the time to make something -- anything -- by hand is seen as the 
ultimate gift. "People love to get homemade cards. They put them up on their 
mantels to display," Krim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes in card making for children and adults are available at Paper Post, 
1145 Lindero Canyon Road, Westlake. Call (818) 865-0702 for a class schedule.

DECIDING WHETHER TO GO AHEAD WITH COSMETIC SURGERY NOT EASY; HEALTH: MANY 
PEOPLE FACE OPPOSITION FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS. THERE'S ALSO A FEAR OF THE 
RESULTS AS WELL AS THE PAIN OF RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Is there a woman alive who hasn't considered changing something about her 
body? 
</P>
<P>
 From sweet-16 nose jobs to tummy tucks and final face lifts, women -- and, 
surgeons say, increasingly men -- get the message that if you can make a change 
and feel better about yourself, why not? 
</P>
<P>
 But deciding to have cosmetic surgery is easier said than done. Ask women who 
have considered it, and you'll find many faced complex, even agonizing 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is the normal fear of surgery, including the knowledge that, in 
rare cases, people undergoing cosmetic procedures do die on the operating 
table. And there is the fear of physical pain, not to mention worry about the 
success of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're worried about the pain compounded by the fear you're going to end up 
looking like a laughingstock," says one 40-something woman who for years 
contemplated but decided against changing her nose. "It's got to come out good 
or you're dead. . . . It's a very terrifying thing." 
</P>
<P>
 To make it more painful yet, you cannot expect the same kind of sympathy for 
an elective procedure as for one that is clearly medically necessary -- "real 
surgery" -- as one woman put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody said, 'You're crazy,' " says a petite 39-year-old Manhasset, N.Y., 
woman who had liposuction to remove fatty bulges from her hips, stomach and 
thighs. "I disguised (the problem) well. I wore leggings . . . an oversized 
top. All you saw was stringy arms, stringy legs. . . . Some people said (of the 
liposuction), 'Oh, I've only heard bad things about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A 43-year-old Port Jefferson, N.Y., woman with a "slight bump" on her nose 
wrote to Newsday: "(I) . . . went as far as deciding on the surgeon, the taking 
of pre-op pictures, pretesting and setting up the date of the procedure, then 
backing out at the last minute. The reason was a constant barrage of family and 
friends saying, 'You're so pretty as you are. Why do you want to change? What 
if you don't like it? You can't change it back!' " 
</P>
<P>
 So you look for support and end up feeling sabotaged. Some of the concerns may 
have merit. Some may not. But in the end, as one woman put it, unless you are 
one of the Ladies Who Lunch, where everyone gets face lifts, you are very much 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is probably as it should be, say experts, who will tell you that one of 
several keys to whether a woman is making a healthy decision about cosmetic 
surgery is the extent to which she is making the decision for herself alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very personal decision," says Dr. Thomas Rees, a plastic surgeon 
who retired from his New York City practice in 1992. Rees is a professor of 
plastic surgery at New York University Medical Center and an author of 
textbooks as well as a popular book "More Than Just a Pretty Face" (Little 
Brown, 1987), available in libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees explains that it is a red flag to responsible surgeons when a person's 
reason for having surgery seems to be tied to someone else -- a woman who 
enlarges her breasts because her boyfriend wants it, for example, or who thinks 
a face lift will win back a husband who left for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 As Self magazine pointed out in a list of reasons not to have plastic surgery: 
"If you think higher cheekbones and tighter skin will save a relationship, we 
have two words for you: Ivana Trump." 
</P>
<P>
 Most surgeons are wary indeed of women who come in with unrealistic 
expectations -- for example, the middle-age woman who comes in carrying a 
wedding photo or magazine images of Claudia Schiffer or Christie Brinkley. 
"These patients are expecting things you're never going to be able to deliver," 
says Rees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental-health professionals also caution against a common tendency to organize 
all of one's frustrations around a single flaw. It is too easy to see surgery 
as a magical cure when there may be a number of things people can do to improve 
their lives, from quitting smoking to going back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "You probably can achieve most of what you want in life in other ways," says 
Rita Freedman, a psychologist in Scarsdale, N.Y., and author of "Bodylove: 
Learning to Like Our Looks -- And Ourselves" (Harper & Row, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
 "You can achieve self-esteem, get love, get ahead in a career. You don't need 
to look superlative. . . . Our lives are filled with a number of ordinary 
people who have done a lot with their lives and whom we respect," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman suggests that feelings of inadequacy are easy to come by in a 
consumer economy that feeds on people's feelings of discontent. "A great deal 
of money is being spent to teach us that we are inadequate the way we are, that 
we need some product, some process to complete us, to make us happy, normal, to 
make us acceptable," says Freedman, adding that women are especially vulnerable 
to messages about appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an enormous amount of pressure for women to find out who they are by 
looking in the mirror." 
</P>
<P>
 Another warning flag to surgeons is a decision precipitated by a single event, 
such as a child's college graduation or wedding. It is important to think 
beyond the event. For example, is the wedding or graduation a message to a 
mother that her children are taking their place as adults, and is she perhaps 
reluctant to move on to the next phase of her own life? 
</P>
<P>
 "Making a permanent decision at a time of high stress may not be a wise 
decision," says Freedman. "The most serious question is, why am I doing this? 
What do I want it to achieve? Why now?"

'CAY' AUTHOR WINS RULING ON SEQUEL; BOOKS: A JUDGE SAYS THEODORE TAYLOR OF 
LAGUNA DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE WITH HIS EX-WIFE THE PROCEEDS OF THE LATER NOVEL, 
WRITTEN YEARS AFTER THE DIVORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled that "Timothy of the Cay," the 1993 sequel to 
Laguna Beach author Theodore Taylor's acclaimed young adult novel "The Cay," 
belongs solely to the author. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news to Taylor, whose ex-wife filed an action in Superior Court 
last February seeking an order that she should share half of all proceeds from 
"Timothy of the Cay," which was written and published 16 years after their 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor wrote his 1969 book "The Cay" while he and Gweneth Goodwin Taylor were 
still married. When they were divorced in 1977, they agreed to share proceeds 
and royalties from any works Taylor completed before the divorce, including 
"The Cay." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the sequel uses a character from "The Cay," Gweneth Taylor's attorney, 
Rodney C. Miles of Irvine, said earlier this year that "Timothy of the Cay" is 
considered a "derivative product" under federal copyright laws. Since Gweneth 
Taylor was given half-ownership rights to "The Cay" in the divorce, he said, 
she was entitled to half of the proceeds of the sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's lawyer, Alan I. White of Costa Mesa, contended that copyright laws do 
not apply to this case and that Gweneth Taylor was entitled to nothing from the 
sequel because it was written after the marriage had ended and is her 
ex-husband's separate property. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert B. Hutson ruled last Thursday that Gweneth Taylor 
is not entitled to share any profits from "Timothy of the Cay" and confirmed 
that the book is indeed Theodore Taylor's separate property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm breathing a sigh of relief," says Taylor, 73. But it goes beyond just his 
case, he says. "It sets a precedent, and a lot of musicians, painters and 
writers who happened to have the misfortune to be in my kind of position on 
that can breathe a little easier now." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Malin, Gweneth Taylor's current attorney, did not return phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cay" is about a young white boy who is forced to confront his racial 
prejudices when he is shipwrecked with an old West Indian black seaman during 
World War II. The novel, which is required reading in schools throughout the 
United States, won 11 literary awards and was made into a 1973 TV movie 
starring James Earl Jones as Timothy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cay" has been criticized by some groups and individuals for being 
offensive to blacks and for reinforcing stereotypes. Taylor, however, has said 
he wrote the book, which is dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr., in hopes of 
achieving a subtle plea for better race relations and more understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Timothy of the Cay," published in hardback last fall by Harcourt Brace, is in 
its second printing after selling out the 40,000-copy first printing. The 
paperback edition was published by Avon two months ago and, according to 
Taylor, 250,000 copies are in print. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, just back from Orlando, Fla., where he spoke at the National 
Conference of Teachers of English, has a revised hardback edition of his 1984 
young adult Western, "Walking Up a Rainbow" (Harcourt Brace) due in bookstores 
the first week of December. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about a 14-year-old girl from Council Bluffs, Iowa, who drives a flock of 
3,000 sheep across the country to feed the gold miners in the Sacramento 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming from Taylor next year: "The Bomb," a young-adult novel about "the 
world's first nuclear nomads, the people of Bikini Island" and "Naughty Naughty 
Knife Work," a sequel to his 1989 adult thriller "Monocolo," which features 
West Indian detective Epp Watts, who is an ex-wide receiver for the Oakland 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun book," says Taylor."

TRICKLE-DOWN TRENDS; FORGET THE LAW OF GRAVITY; THIS IS THE LAW OF MELROSE. 
FASHION FLOWS OUTWARD -- AS IN, FROM LOS ANGELES TO ORANGE COUNTY. SO, WHAT'S 
HERE TODAY WAS PROBABLY THERE YESTERDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles lies just across the Orange County line, but when it comes to 
style, some say the two counties are worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Orange County fashion experts agree that people here dress differently 
than they do in L.A. Yet they disagree on just how much of a style gap exists 
between the two areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many characterize Orange County residents as conservative, casual and even a 
little backward compared with their hip neighbors to the north. Others argue 
that, style-wise, the county has caught up and, in some ways, even surpassed 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon O'Neill, a Laguna Beach resident, keeps a close eye on fashion in both 
counties as a clothing buyer for SUO, a contemporary clothing store in 
Westminster Mall and in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there a difference between L.A. and Orange County? Absolutely," O'Neill 
says. "I see the difference between my two stores. In L.A., they'll pay 
anything for anything. They're looking for clothes that are new and trendy, and 
they don't care if the clothes go out of style in two or three months. In 
Orange County, they're looking for more classical pieces that will be around a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 She tailors her merchandise at both stores according to each area's 
idiosyncrasies. She'll put casual clothes such as denim pieces that are proven 
sellers in her Westminster store, while more fashion-forward pieces, such as 
fitted baby T-shirts with satin appliques and satin wrap miniskirts, are 
reserved for L.A. Her Orange County shoppers tend to prefer understated hues 
such as earth tones, while her L.A. customers are more willing to try 
experimental hues such as "young-looking pastels," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is very MTV-motivated. What they see on 'Melrose Place' is what 
they want," O'Neill says. "In Orange County, once they've seen something around 
long enough, then they want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Slip dresses are one example of a style first seen on the streets of L.A. that 
didn't become popular in Orange County until a season later. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw women wearing actual slips on Melrose Avenue," O'Neill says. "Then 
slip dresses came to retail, then to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has a wait-and-see attitude toward fashion, whereas L.A. wants 
to be first with a look, she says. The reason behind the different approaches 
to style: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the people," O'Neill says. "In L.A., every waitress and every gas 
station attendant is an actor. Here every salesperson is a salesperson." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose LeDonne travels to the fashion marts of Los Angeles to buy clothes for 
her Rose LeDonne sportswear boutique for women and children in Laguna Niguel. 
She finds that styles that are hot up north sometimes don't fly south of the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 LeDonne recently visited L.A. designer Marrikka Nakk to see her latest 
collection. Nakk, who counts Hollywood actresses Demi Moore and Cher among her 
clientele, showed LeDonne her latest creation: bloomers as outerwear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said they were really cute, but I could never sell that here," LeDonne 
says. "People would laugh at them. They're too much of a fad." 
</P>
<P>
 LeDonne lived in Hollywood until moving here six years ago, and since then, 
she says, she has "toned down" her wardrobe. She remembers buying a pair of 
equestrian-style riding leggings five years ago at Fred Segal on Melrose, only 
to find that when she wore them in her store, "Most people looked at me like I 
was an alien. Now I sell a ton of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Before a fad will sell here, it has to enter the mainstream -- a process that 
takes about six to eight months from the time it starts in L.A., she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Los Angeles are very quick to get in on a fad. They're not afraid 
to look different and be extreme. A lot of times the fads come and go before 
they reach Orange County," LeDonne says. "Here people tend to want to fit in. 
They have to see other people wearing something and how they're wearing it. But 
we're catching up." 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of hot, nationally recognized designers such as Mossimo has moved 
the two areas closer together, as has the influence of the media, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're more exposed (to trends) than we used to be," LeDonne says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fashion watchers say the style gap between L.A. and Orange County has 
closed completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellie Kervorkian, buyer for Politix men's clothing stores in Fashion Island 
Newport Beach and in Westwood, Century City and Beverly Center, says he sees 
little difference between his customers to the north and the south. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do have more people into high fashion and funky clothes in L.A., but that 
doesn't mean people in Orange County aren't fashionable," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it seems the percentage of cutting-edge clientele is the same in both 
locales, it's just that there are more in L.A. because of the larger 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even Kervorkian refrains from putting some of his more cutting-edge 
looks in the Newport store: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have enough customers who understand the funkier items like some of 
the styles by Jean-Paul Gaultier," he says. "In L.A., they have more exposure 
to these things. There are a lot of crazy boutiques. It's a little more hip in 
L.A., but I'm not saying Orange County isn't hip." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Jones, co-owner of La Tortuga women's clothing stores in Santa Ana and 
Orange, which specializes, in ethnic looks, agrees that there's little if any 
difference between the two counties. He says there are plenty of customers here 
who want his alternative, nonconformist fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no lack of creative types here in Orange County," Jones says. 
"There's just a greater mass in L.A." Fashion Path 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of fashion runs from Los Angeles to Orange County. Here's some of the 
styles that are here, as well as the course of couture to come: 
</P>
<P>
 Six L.A. Trends That Have Crossed Into Orange County 
</P>

VEGETARIANS DO THANKSGIVING ON A HIGH-FAD DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Diamond's family has resigned itself to the fact that she lives an 
"alternative lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 But in spite of certain aberrations, she'll be spending today celebrating 
Thanksgiving with them, dodging the discrimination inevitably forced upon those 
with her particular bent. Diamond is a vegetarian . 
</P>
<P>
 She came out about it two years ago when she began using "live food" like 
fruits and vegetables to nullify the long-term effects of an omnivorous 
upbringing . 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember some pretty gross things I used to eat, at fast-food restaurants," 
says Diamond, of Huntington Beach. "Every once in a while you'd find a bone in 
something. It was gross." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond is like many of her peers who still wonder what constitutes a Cheeto 
and are haunted by macabre images of Ronald McDonald wielding a watering can in 
a hamburger patch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a vegetarian is a whole lifestyle," says Diamond, 20, a clerk at 
Mother's, a health food supermarket in Huntington Beach. And that lifestyle 
includes some pretty sophisticated, if esoteric, ingredients. Aromatherapy, 
iridology, homeopathy, colon therapy, body work -- Diamond says they are all 
part of the holistic lifestyle she and her peers have adopted in retaliation to 
their upbringing, during the age of microwaveable convenience foods and the 
inauguration of the drive-through. 
</P>
<P>
 This Thanksgiving, Diamond will feast on latkes -- Jewish potato pancakes -- 
and vegetable quiche. She'll spend it with her mother and about 23 others, most 
of them feasting on turkey, prime rib and ham, stuffing (is that with or 
without sausage?) and gravy made from pan drippings (that's turkey fat). Pass 
the papaya enzymes, please. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the cavemen found something on the ground -- like a carrot -- they 
picked it up and just ate it. It was right there, and it was perfect," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's youth are more sophisticated about food than their parents, many of 
whom relied on the then newly emerging convenience food market to make sure 
their kids got fed. Such foods were increasingly available in unprecedented 
variety, yet were generally loaded with preservatives and devoid of nutrients 
-- remember Tater Tots, Fish Stix and frozen broccoli that smelled like weeds 
after you nuked it? 
</P>
<P>
 The variety of health foods was once extremely limited, and those who indulged 
were typically thought to be eccentrics who never wore shoes. Yet today, 
vitamins and herbal and natural food supplements are big business. We know more 
now about the diet and its effect on the quality of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 A new wave of hippie individuals is going home this Thanksgiving to meet with 
yuppie parents who were once granola-snuffing hippies themselves, and who will 
greet them at the door wielding trays of baby vegetables to appease their 
squeamish palates. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Costuros, 20, of Huntington Beach, was raised by vegetarian hippies. They 
eventually divorced. He'll be spending Thanksgiving with his mother, who now 
drives a BMW and lives in a house of perfect Southwest design, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he says his parents have "sold out," Paul nonetheless maintains a 
complete vegan diet, which includes the package of non-dairy chocolate chip 
cookies he is purchasing at Mother's, where he just had dinner with his friend 
and fellow Golden West College student, Don Miller, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 While Paul plans on contributing spaghetti and tofu to his mother's menu, Don 
will cope with the holiday in his own rhetorical way. "I'll be feasting on 
stuffing, a dry martini and a cigarette," he says. 
</P>
<P>

 Studies show 12.4 million Americans consider themselves vegetarian, says Lige 
Weill, president of the Vegetarian Awareness Network, a national nonprofit 
organization in Washington, D.C., established in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 An Illinois-based group called Teen-age Resource Unlimited says a quarter of 
all American teen-agers are vegetarian, while the National Restaurant Assn. 
notes that at least 15% of college students lead a vegetarian lifestyle. "And 
it's definitely on the rise," Weill says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 10% of vegetarians say they are completely vegan -- exclusive of 
all animal and dairy products. Others generally consider themselves either 
ovo-lacto , meaning they eat eggs, milk, cheese and other dairy products, or 
lacto -- they eat some dairy, with the exception of eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 250 employees of the two Mother's stores (the other is in Costa Mesa), 
about 65% are vegetarian, most of them in their 20s, says Kelly Henry, who 
manages the Huntington Beach store. "That's usually the reason they come to 
work here." His store sold 150 free-range turkeys this Thanksgiving, as well as 
plenty of meatless turkey substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the rear of the store, clerk Johnnie Renna is pointing out meat and 
dairy substitutes available to lure the omnivore: Rice Dream, Tuno, Wham, 
Soysage, Not Dogs, Sweet Nothings, Nyetnaise, Phoney Bologna, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Renna, 23, of Costa Mesa, calls himself an on-again-off-again ovo-lacto 
vegetarian. He was off again recently during a cross-country backpacking trip 
in Montana, where to rebuff a good porterhouse steak is generally thought to be 
un-American. "There wasn't a health food store for miles," says Renna, who 
attributes his vegetarianism to "health and money reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's on again. "I'm a fruits and vegetables guy," he says. "My parents 
think this stuff is really weird, but to me it's just food -- it's just a 
tamale. " 
</P>
<P>
 Renna remembers as a child the warm and pungent tuna sandwiches dripping with 
mayonnaise, oil and butter that filled his school lunch box. Today, tuna comes 
packed in water and is generally dolphin safe. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, Renna's father has battled one form of cancer or another, a fact 
the younger Renna says has influenced his own eating habits. "You gotta make it 
easy for people or they won't do it," he says, waving his arms in a wide arc 
toward the freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 "By eating animal products you take on certain karma," says lacto-vegetarian 
Mark Drake, 24, of Costa Mesa. "The less karma you accrue in life, the lighter 
your being becomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Texas, Drake says he got caught up in some typical modes of 
rebellion -- alcohol and other destructive behaviors -- as the result of a 
repressive upbringing. Being a vegetarian, he says, offered something 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was utter repression of everyone in my family. It was because of how my 
parents acted with one another. They were always holding things inward, and 
that block of anger was really repressive," says Drake, who is spending the day 
with his wife, Christy's, family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I see someone yelling, I think they should eat less meat."

THE BIG GILT TRIP; IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN -- TO HAUL OUT THE GIFT-MAKING 
TOOLS AND CREATE. WHO ARE WE TURNING TO FOR WORDS OF WISDOM AND MORAL SUPPORT? 
WHY, MARTHA STEWART, ABOVE LEFT, AND ALEENE JACKSON, BUT OF COURSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plunging an arm inside 22 pounds of cold poultry flesh isn't very pleasant, 
but it sure beats an electric glue-gun burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Scary as it seems, for many, these may be the primary sensory options of the 
day. Because after the sacrificial burning of the bird and the orgy of eating, 
the gilt trips will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilt trips, as in driving to Michaels for gold leaf, schlepping to House of 
Fabrics for gold ribbon, descending on HomeBase for gold spray-paint. 
</P>
<P>
 It's loving hands of home time. Time to make decorations, presents, wrapping 
paper, cards and wreaths. Time to fill the coffers of the multibillion-dollar 
crafts industry, which not only supports a slew of magazines, specialty stores 
and celebrity gurus but also nurtures our desire for bigger and more dangerous 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hobby Industry Assn., an Elmwood, N.J.-based trade group, reports that at 
least one person in 90% of all U.S. households dabbles in crafts. And 
three-fourths of them are now busy making holiday gifts. Of course, the 
association uses a rather liberal definition of crafts: "If you can take two 
parts and do something, we're going to call it a craft," spokeswoman Susan 
Brandt says. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you've tied a wedding bow on a pew, made a wreath or sacked up some 
potpourri, you're a craftsperson. And this is your moment. The fourth quarter 
is a big one for the business that has grown 41% since 1988, Brandt says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, the average newsstand had no more than six or eight craft 
magazines. Now there are 40 or 50, and at this time of year the number goes up 
to several hundred," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey conducted by the hobby association, craft enthusiasts said 
that more than half of their project ideas came from magazines with such titles 
as Ceramic Arts & Craft Projects and Folk Art Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, TV has become the place to turn. In growing numbers, the craft 
population is tuning in to how-to television for inspiration. That's where I 
found my two spiritual guides, Martha Stewart and Aleene Jackson, two women on 
opposite ends of a parallel universe. Other than empires built on television 
shows, magazines, books and Type-A personalities, they have virtually nothing 
in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 53, lives her life as if it were a coffee-table book. Hers is a 
hand-wrought, picture-perfect lifestyle known in magazine and television form 
(Sunday mornings at 10 on KCBS, Channel 2) as "Martha Stewart Living." From her 
command post in Westport, Conn., she demonstrates the arts of cooking, 
cleaning, gardening and decorating. She makes topiary Easter baskets out of 
living succulents, Christmas wreaths from prickly-pear pads and gift baskets 
for pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 70, was broadcasting "Aleene's Creative Living With Crafts" from her 
Solvang, Calif., ranch long before Stewart signed the mortgage on her Colonial 
farmhouse. (And when her show got its 9 a.m. weekdays time slot on the 
Nashville Network two years ago, Jackson built her own television studio.) In 
the late '50s, Jackson was arranging flowers on local TV. In the '60s, she took 
her how-to shows on the road, booking her "Caravan of Crafts" into 20,000-seat 
convention centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has made her fortune off her domestic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has made hers off sales of more than 15 million bottles of Aleene's 
Tacky Glue, an adhesive sold in craft stores and via her show and magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart leads me on, Jackson keeps me going. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had the time, the money, the patience, a full-time nanny and bigger, 
faster tools, I'd try more of Stewart's projects. Lacking all of those, I flip 
through her magazine (10 issues a year for $24) and mutter: "Yeah, right, 
Martha." 
</P>
<P>
 (I haven't forgotten her suggestion to put the dishwashing liquid, so 
unsightly in its tacky plastic bottle, in a cut glass wine bottle with a 
special spout. Two hours later, the kitchen floor was the cleanest it had ever 
been, not counting the shards of decorative glass I'm still finding.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's magazine (12 issues for $24.95), on the other hand, moves me to 
utter, "Not on your life, Aleene." 
</P>
<P>
 (I could do her projects with one hand tied behind my back if I wanted to, 
which usually I don't. Even my Brownie troop refused to make angel ornaments 
out of recycled shoulder pads, as Aleene suggested. Judging by a recent issue 
of Aleene's Creative Living, angels are big this year. Always the recycler, she 
also proposes making them out of dried -- thankfully -- manicotti and wallpaper 
scraps.) 
</P>
<P>
 This business of being a domestic goddess may seem glamorous, but Stewart, who 
manages to look good even as she spreads manure around her garden, knows that 
for every disciple there is a detractor. Several years of Martha-bashing peaked 
last year when Oprah Winfrey pitted Stewart and her fan-club president against 
a couple of vociferous Martha-haters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That, thankfully, is in the past," Stewart says in a telephone interview from 
the farm she calls Turkey Hill. "The negative stories and such have lessened 
tremendously. I think people are finally getting it." She says it as if it were 
some New Age religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," she adds pragmatically, "there will always be detractors, and the 
people too lazy to do the projects or ones who don't like to do those kind of 
homey things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's Stewart, an industrious, seemingly humorless homebody who sets a 
gorgeous table. The equally humorless Jackson declines to comment on her 
upstart rival, but her daughter, Tiffany Windsor, sniffs: "Oh, Martha makes 
beautiful stuff, but she doesn't deal with the common folk." 
</P>
<P>
 Common folk are Jackson's best customers, and she makes it very easy for them 
to follow her lead. She mails project instructions for the price of a 
self-addressed, stamped envelope. Among the most requested brochures is one for 
a project involving Tacky Glue and white bread. "We do some very inexpensive 
crafts, junk crafts out of scraps, so people can save money," says Jackson, 
whose children help run the business. 
</P>
<P>
 If any anti-Aleene forces exist, they keep to themselves. Jackson gets adoring 
letters, she says, and fans drop by her factory in Buellton, Calif., a town 
proud of its pea soup. 
</P>
<P>
 What Stewart and Jackson share is a following of casual observers, people who 
think they can occasionally watch the shows or read the magazines and say, "I 
could make that." 
</P>
<P>
 Crafting is an addiction, tools the fix. Even the pros are not exempt. Stewart 
says she yearns for a drill press to make holes in acorns and pine cones. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Carey started with a glue gun about 10 years ago, quickly moved 
through the saw-and-drill phase, acquired specialty tools such as the Dremel 
Moto-Tool (a tiny drill with thousands of specialty bits), dedicated a room to 
her craft projects and has lately commandeered the garage for her welding 
projects.

MORPHIN MADNESS; TOYS: THE POWER RANGERS ARE BATTLING REAL LIVE VILLAINS -- 
COUNTERFEITERS AND MIDDLE-AGED IMPOSTORS IN SPANDEX. BUT THE CREATOR INSISTS 
SUPPLY WILL KEEP UP WITH DEMAND THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA WARRICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've come to know them as the squeaky-clean su per-heroes who routinely 
overcome impossible odds to neutralize monsters from other worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers may be up against one villain even 
they cannot vanquish. And no, it's not sold-out toy stores or cranky parents.  
</P>
<P>
 This holiday season, the Rangers' No. 1 nemesis may well be the mob. 
</P>
<P>
 With demand still outstripping supply of the coveted action figures, the sale 
of unlicensed Mighty Morphin look-alikes is reportedly becoming big business in 
the underworld. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is no secret that organized crime is involved in all high-level 
counterfeiting. And yes, they are here, right here in the world of toys," says 
Angie Small, vice president of legal affairs for Power Rangers' creator Saban 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Using private investigators, armed marshals and undercover operatives, the 
Burbank-based Saban plans to spend more than $1 million by Christmas cracking 
down on real live bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect "the good name and the goodwill" of the Power Rangers, Small says 
her company launched a battle in March to fight the growing unauthorized use of 
the Rangers' image by career criminals and others -- including middle-aged guys 
in Spandex suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she says, about $10 million in counterfeit Rangers merchandise has 
been seized. "And that is just the tip of the iceberg," adds Small. (And 
speaking of tips, boys and girls, call (800) MORPHER to report suspected 
impostors.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now cooperating with the FBI to put together some major stings -- none 
of which I can discuss in detail at this time, of course," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since their television debut in the fall of 1993, the Power Rangers have 
cornered the market on campy, high-kicking after-school entertainment. And as 
the adventures of a multiethnic team of teens with attitude soared into TV 
history by capturing as much as 99% of its 2-to-11-year-old audience, so did 
sales of the matching toys. 
</P>
<P>
 But supply -- which was short last December -- still has not kept pace with 
the sudden and overwhelming demands for all things Morphin. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, even Santa couldn't get his mitts on the bright-colored, 
multijointed full-action figures. Desperate parents were offering bribes, 
threats and four to five times retail price to guarantee there would be a 
Mighty Morphin-something under the tree by Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, there may be no need to stalk delivery trucks or steal from other 
shoppers' baskets. "I'll be really shocked if there's a shortage," says Trish 
Stewart, marketing director for Bandai America, Power Ranger manufacturer. For 
one thing, there is a whole new range of Ranger-based stuff to buy: backpacks, 
flatware, bike helmets, pajamas, underpants, flatware and inflatable TV 
armchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers may not find the exact item they are looking for -- the White Ranger 
Tommy and his new alter ego, White Tiger, may be scarce, for example -- but 
Stewart says she expects about 10 times as many toys to be on the shelves for 
the 1994 holidays. And that's not including unlicensed faux-Ranger items. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still get some reports on fights breaking out over toys and that sort of 
thing," Stewart says, "but it's nothing close to the desperation we witnessed 
last year." Shoppers who need help finding a particular item can call the 
Cerritos-based Bandai's consumer service department for updates on local toy 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While last year's buy-or-die market fueled buying frenzies across the nation, 
few analysts anticipated its spinoff into an underground market that would 
reach beyond U.S. borders. Although enforcement efforts against Ranger 
counterfeiters so far have focused on American violators, the violations 
themselves are occurring worldwide, attorney Small says.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the merchandise is manufactured in one of Bandai's 16 Asian or Mexican 
plants, but by the end of the year, the company will add four more factories -- 
including one in Colorado -- in an effort to match a growing European demand 
for the toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the privately owned Bandai toy maker won't release exact figures, 
some industry analysts estimate that by New Year's Eve, the Rangers will have 
earned $1 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 So why not share? "What we're concerned about with the counterfeits is the 
quality, the integrity of the merchandise. Some of these knockoff toys are 
truly dangerous. Arms and legs, even heads come off," Small says. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the targets of the anti-knockoff campaign are Power Ranger impersonators 
who are showing up more and more at birthday parties, store openings, even car 
dealerships. "Unfortunately, none of these impersonators is trained in the 
martial arts. And even more unfortunately, most of them seem to be middle-aged 
persons who don't look nice at all in Spandex," says a representative for 
Saban. "Parents should be aware that we do not make Power Ranger costumes in 
adult sizes." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the counterfeiting crisis, the biggest troubles facing the Power Rangers 
were charges from some parents and TV critics that the show was inciting its 
littlest imitators to violence.  
</P>
<P>
 A Scandinavian network briefly banned the show after a 5-year-old girl was 
beaten and left to die in the snow by three little boy playmates. As it turned 
out, none of the boys had ever seen the show, although they did mention 
something about Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, a Canadian channel has suspended the show while it decides 
whether complaints about gratuitous violence demand an overhaul of children's 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 While unwelcome, none of the criticism has been unexpected, says Peter Dang, 
president of Saban's Children's Entertainment Network. "We look at ourselves as 
a live action cartoon and fantasy. But we really make an effort to respect how 
much the Rangers have become role models and to examine how we use martial arts 
to advance the action of the show." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good entertainment. We look at it as quite good fun," adds Frank 
Ward, president of Renaissance Atlantic, the developer of the series, which has 
a cast of "silly" characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a 6-year-old in this country who believes that a 
pineapple with a traffic light stuck in his head is a very scary monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is hard to take the show's evil elements very seriously, with 
monsters such as the pineapple guy and Dang's favorite, Pudgy Pig -- who 
managed to devour the world's food supply until the Power Rangers made him 
throw it all up. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to genuine no-good nastiness, who can compete with the mob?  
</P>
<P>
 Will the Power Rangers outdo the inexorable forces of real evil in the world?  
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned.

PUTTING PAWS TO WORK TO HELP PEOPLE WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miss Kitty flies down a hallway, skids around a corner, ricochets off a wall 
and vaults into the men's restroom, eluding the redhead with the Russian-French 
accent who beckons: "My boo-boo, my mooshky, come here, my dahling." 
</P>
<P>
 What Miss Kitty doesn't know is that Nadia Sutton, who is trying to find a 
foster home for the furtive fur ball, has mastered this game of catch the cat. 
Sutton, after all, has two of her own and as executive director of PAWS L.A. -- 
a group that helps people with AIDS keep their pets -- she is as pet-astute as 
Ace Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "You exquisite boo-boo," Sutton says on bent knees after making a beeline for 
the six-pound feline hiding behind a loo. She cradles the cat, and in return, 
Miss Kitty rubs her head on Sutton's chin. 
</P>
<P>
 This dedication has attracted animal-loving Angelenos -- 800 clients and 650 
volunteers -- to Sutton and her PAWS cause, which provides food and veterinary 
care for more than 1,200 pets and peace of mind for their owners. Sutton 
founded PAWS (Pets Are Wonderful Support) five years ago after a friend with 
AIDS told her that his family had given away his cats while he was 
hospitalized. She receives a salary from the nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was devastated. He didn't even want to come home," says Sutton, who 
managed to reunite the cats with their owner. Soon after, Sutton, who had been 
conducting workshops on the quality of life for people with AIDS, was hearing 
from others struggling to keep their pets. The group also helps HIV-positive 
people who do not yet have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could I not do something?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton, 53, says that before PAWS came along, some people with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome went without food so their animals could eat. Some used 
medicine money for veterinary visits. Others chose not to be hospitalized 
because they didn't have the funds to board their pets or no one was available 
to help care for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would rather die at home than get medical attention because their pets 
mean that much to them," Sutton says in her West Hollywood office, Miss Kitty 
brushing against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, walls are covered with photos: a cat in bunny ears, another in a 
firefighter uniform, canines and felines yawning and yowling, stretching and 
scratching -- all loving their ailing owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of people with HIV, it's the animals who have become their chosen 
family," Sutton says. "And if a lot has gone out of your life -- your job, your 
house, some friends, some family -- it's your animal who is there for you. That 
little creature is your lifeline." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton says animals have always been her support too. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born in Brussels -- an only child who was emotionally abused by her 
Russian father, she says. Suffering from dyslexia, she was mislabeled as "slow" 
by teachers; classmates teased her. But imagination was her escape, and stray 
animals became her refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton also found comfort and self-esteem starring in the high school plays 
she wrote and directed. After graduation, she says she studied acting in Paris; 
hitchhiked through France, Spain and Morocco, and then, after getting married 
in London, worked steadily for eight years on the London stage and in 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, after a divorce, she came to Los Angeles to pursue her dream of 
breaking into movies. She worked in a couple of films she prefers not to name. 
Ten years later, inspired by friends who battled AIDS while fighting to keep 
their pets, she founded PAWS with three clients and two volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as acting had been my life, I suddenly realized that wasn't it 
anymore. It was going to be with animals," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with an annual budget of $200,000, Sutton tries to serve her current 
clients while struggling to keep up with growing demand -- about 35 to 40 new 
requests for help each month, she says. For the past three years, Sutton's 
celebrity pals -- including Amanda Bearse, Janis Paige, William Katt and Earl 
Holliman -- have performed at the Pasadena Playhouse in fund-raising musical 
revues called "Aardvarks to Zebras." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen veterinarians work for half their normal fees, which allows the 
organization to buy more pet food, now averaging about $1,000 a week. And this 
holiday season, artists Joe Monroe and Jon Planas have designed greeting cards 
selling for $10 each, with a donation made in the name of the card's recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Wayland, PAWS' other full-time staffer, and part-timer Gary Granger are 
constantly on the phone matching volunteers with clients and arranging 
veterinary visits. Joel Kimmel raises funds part time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes there aren't enough homes for pets. Sutton hates asking for favors 
"because it's really painful." Other times she is under pressure when funds are 
so tight and there are so many people seeking assistance. Often, she says, she 
must defend PAWS against criticism that it provides for animals when people 
need food and medicine. "This is not a cute little organization," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And she allows herself to get sad when a client dies or when an animal that 
has lost its master must be placed in another home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go home and cry," she says about the grief she often takes home to her 
small, bohemian-like apartment, which she shares with her cats, Phoebus and 
Chatnoir. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does PAWS the way she does her personal life: with a lot of caring and 
love," says Sandy Blixton, a client who remembers when Sutton came to his home 
with two guys, delivering cat food and a scratching post for Blixton's calico 
cat, Terra. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Misenhimer, AIDS Project Los Angeles' chief financial officer and former 
executive director of APLA and American Foundation for AIDS Research, says an 
organization like PAWS "provides a great service because research and studies 
have proved that pets can dramatically improve one's quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Harris Sheppard, who owns a public relations firm, says he became 
involved -- and committed to PAWS -- after realizing that wearing an AIDS 
ribbon at AIDS events and fund-raisers just wasn't enough. "Nadia," he says, 
"is magic." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sutton: "What people really need is quality of life and love. You can do 
all the doctors in the world and all the support groups, but if you don't have 
love from the only living creature in your life that hasn't abandoned you, why 
stick around? What we are doing here is the stuff of life, the stuff of love."

LAUGH LINES; TIME FOR THOSE PERSONALIZED CARDS FROM HELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS ERSKINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I had set the trap: the Brady Bunch Christmas album, a national treasure that 
seems to only get better with time. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids were playing in their rooms when I cranked up the volume. In seconds, 
they came running, holding their little ears with their little hands, begging 
me to turn it off. 
</P>
<P>
 I handcuffed them and loaded them in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of this family sting was the taking of the annual Christmas card 
photo. You've probably seen them. Sometimes it's a photo of the whole family, 
sometimes just the kids. It's a holiday tradition as quaint and wholesome as 
Cheez Whiz hors d'oeuvres. But a lot easier to screw up. 
</P>
<P>
 You may remember that it was the pressure of coming up with a good Christmas 
card photo that drove George Bailey to near suicide in "It's a Wonderful Life." 
In fact, I believe the original title was something like, "It's a Wonderful 
Life . . . Until You Try to Come Up With One of Those Goofy and Ridiculous 
Christmas Card Photos." It was later changed for marketing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, I simplified the process by using some children living down 
the street. Not only did they wear nicer clothes, they also had all their 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, friends who knew us well finally noticed and complained to my 
wife, who was unaware of the ploy and threatened violence if it continued. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, I promised to use our kids. I even promised to come up with the 
best-ever Christmas card photo anyone's ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 My first goal was a scenic background. Trees, wildlife, the finest wilderness 
spot in the L.A. Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 We were in the car only a few minutes when I spotted a stand of trees outside 
a 7-Eleven in the Pico District. It was perfect. Kind of green. Not much 
graffiti. And the panhandlers ran when they saw the kids spill out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 As I prepared the camera, the children lined up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, Emily isn't wearing any shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 No big deal, we could crop the photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, look at Jessica's hair." 
</P>
<P>
 I combed it with the car keys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, Christopher isn't wearing a shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't say we needed shirts," Christopher explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, every 7-Eleven carries a fine line of boys clothing, consisting 
mostly of T-shirts with neon pink lettering. The smallest size fit him like a 
wedding dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Back outside we went. The kids lined up again. I aimed the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smile!" 
</P>
<P>
 No smiles.  
</P>
<P>
 "How can we smile when we haven't had lunch?" one asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I said so," I patiently explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Still no smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a wonderful Frank Capra moment, my oldest daughter pulled me aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad, the holidays aren't about silly Christmas cards. Or fancy lights. Or 
even expensive gifts," she said. "The holidays are about the joy of giving." 
</P>
<P>
 So I marched back inside and, in the spirit of Christmas, bought three 
Slurpees, three jumbo hot dogs, two giant orders of nachos and a Tori Spelling 
poster -- all for about the price of a tank of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Back outside we went. Several panhandlers had returned and were milling 
around, giving me tips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your oldest daughter needs to lift her chin," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your F-stop setting is a little low," another added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey kids, got any spare change?" asked a third. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids searched their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I have is a 20," Chris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That'll do," the man replied. 
</P>
<P>
 I grabbed the $20 bill, stuffed it in my pocket and aimed the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smile!" 
</P>
<P>
 Still no smiles. I told an off-color joke. Big yuks, especially from the 
panhandlers, and the kids smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Click. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the finest Christmas card photo anyone's ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 But it'll do.

BY DESIGN; VERY VELVET; THE LUSH, PLUSH FABRIC IS TAKING MANY FORMS, FROM GOWNS 
TO PILLOWS TO PURSES 
</P>

<P>
 The word velvet brings to mind Miss Scarlett's plush green drapery dress, 
lowrider dashboards, Elvis portraits and a song about the fabric in blue. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Kenneth Downing, creative director for Neiman Marcus, thought about 
how to do holiday decor for the Beverly Hills store, he zeroed in on its 
luxurious image, draping displays and covering chair seats in hues from bright 
cherry to deep plum. His inspirations: panne velvet clothes by Dolce & Gabbana 
and the Gothic film "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to follow his lead will find all kinds of stores happy to 
oblige this season with velvets of diverse characters. Neiman Marcus, Barneys 
New York and Laura Ashley are brimming with velvet clothes, and so are the more 
affordable Banana Republic and J. Crew. Accessories run the gamut from a sweet 
little black drawstring bag, $28, at Kenneth Cole in West Hollywood to a brown 
velvet wrap meant to look like a '50s mink stole, $895, at Barneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Richard Tyler mixes velvet with satin and embroidered fabrics. Jil 
Sander pairs it with sheers. Hot new L.A. designer Jane Booke renders cut 
velvet and machine-washable silk velvet into daytime clothes as comfortable as 
sweats. Her clothes are so appealing, enthuses fashion stylist Vivian Turner, 
that celebrities from Joanna Kerns to Sheena Easton have asked to purchase the 
velvets worn on photo shoots. Theodore in Beverly Hills and Comme Des Fous in 
Los Angeles also carry Booke. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designers in Los Angeles have long been stingy with velvet, 
relegating it to the occasional accent pillow. But its reputation as a 
cold-weather fabric may be slipping. Costume designer Barbara Tfank covered 
everything in her West Hollywood apartment with velvet, and sniffs at the 
notion that it's unsuitable for this climate. In its most humble form "it's 
just clipped cotton," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores Modern Living, Dialogica and Blueprint, all in Los Angeles, and the 
Gallery of Functional Art in Santa Monica offer curvy, cartoony chairs, sofas 
and ottomans in velvet and velveteen. Odalisque, the anachronistic interior 
design shop on Beverly Boulevard near Tyler Trafficante, makes one-of-a-kind 
pillows and beddings from its stash of antique velvets. Down the street, Carl's 
Custom Lamps & Shades creates velvet lamp shades to order. 
</P>
<P>
 On the more affordable end, Bed Bath & Beyond in the Beverly Center has 
moderately priced velvet pillows and duvet covers. And the November issue of 
Martha Stewart Living tells readers how to make velvet frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Only decorators can get their hands on the most beautiful and expensive 
velvets from Scalamandre, Clarence House and J. Robert Scott, but 
do-it-yourselfers will find bolts of beautiful velvets at Oriental Silk 
Imports, International Silks & Woolens and Diamond Foam & Fabric, all in Los 
Angeles.

CLOSET RX; DRESSING TO MATCH THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look through the want ads and see how many employers want someone who's 
"detail-oriented." Although you may think of yourself as having fastidious 
qualities, beware. Your interviewer may take one glance at your belt and shoes 
and show you the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, a man's shoes and belt are supposed to coordinate, if not 
match.  
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that if you had alligator shoes, you needed an alligator belt," 
says Tom Fuller of Fuller's for Men & Women in Monarch Bay. "The rules aren't 
as strict now, but you need to be aware of the colors you're wearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Another common question is what color leather goes with your suit or slacks.  
</P>
<P>
 The old rule is that navy or gray goes with black shoes and belts. But what 
about olive and some of those indefinable beige fabrics? 
</P>
<P>
 "With olives and tans, you usually go with brown tones," says Bent Simonsen of 
Burberry's Ltd. in Costa Mesa. "Burgundy or cordovan can work with an Oxford or 
light gray or tan as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Fuller: "Don't get stuck by focusing on just using particular colors. 
It's very in right now to wear black shoes and belts with tan slacks. And grays 
can go with brown tones; using a tan belt with gray flannel trousers is a very 
European look." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Matt Blanchard of Polo Ralph Lauren in Costa Mesa, "Brown tones are very 
versatile. Black is great for some things; it stands out so clearly. But don't 
be afraid to try a brown or cordovan with a blue suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some better men's shoes and belts have a burnished finish, which creates a 
different look that works well when you're trying them with a range of fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a teak-like finish that's achieved through the dying process that adds 
character to the leather," Blanchard says. "The result is a shoe or belt that 
creates more of a distinction than a smoothly finished leather." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're out to leave an impression that your detailing skills are less than 
ideal, try showing up for a job interview with a cloth belt holding up your 
slacks.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those are definitely casual," Simonsen says. "It's the same with braided 
leather belts. You need a dress belt with dress slacks."

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: WOMEN'S WORK IS IN THE BAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julie Wolfe's mini bags resemble elaborate wall hangings that are 
simultaneously antique in handiwork and imagery and contemporary in their 
abundance of color, materials and symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a xerographic heat-transfer process, the Laguna Beach designer 
duplicates images of the Madonna and other feminine icons from centuries-old 
artworks. This fabric portraiture becomes central to her bags. She repeats the 
photo technique with other feminine symbols that might appear less obvious, 
such as a budding rose or a voluptuous pear. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe stitches up a patchwork body of pretty fabrics -- velvets, canvas, silk, 
upholstery and novelty prints. The piece is further decorated with hand and 
machine embroidery and a medley of ornaments: metallic threads, antique 
buttons, milagros pendants, strings of tiny pearls, glass beads, bottle caps, 
coins and broken pieces of mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Each bag is finished by fringe, thick tassels or braided cord, not unlike the 
completing touches of a tapestry.  
</P>
<P>
 If they seem like they'd hang as beautifully on a nail as they would on a 
shoulder, it's because Wolfe created the bags as an extension of her signature 
tapestries that are displayed in galleries and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 Like her tapestries, the purses follow a story, she says, that is mostly open 
to interpretation but always in honor of women. There might be signs of 
feminine strength or illustrations of the balance between motherhood and 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my work is related to women and the history of women," says Wolfe, 
30. "I was brought up aware of how oppressed women artists have been -- how 
oppressed women in general have been. I feel I want to validate their 
contributions through my own work." 
</P>
<P>
 This desire lead Wolfe, who holds a degree in fine arts and art history from 
the University of Texas, to focus on the fiber arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have always worked with fabrics: sewing, embroidery, crochet. But their 
work was not thought of as an art, but a household duty," says Wolfe, a 
graduate of these domestic "duties" under her great grandmother's instruction. 
"I want to continue that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 With this in mind, Wolfe refuses to mass-produce the well-crafted bags that 
sell for $160 to $300. (Tapestries run $800 to $1,500). "I want to keep them 
unique and intricate," she says, "full of as much stitching and beading as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The vibrant palette, use of fancy materials and overall eclectic style of her 
work recall that of couturier Christian Lacroix, whom Wolfe credits with 
influencing her. As for inspiration, Wolfe refers to Mexican artist and 
feminist Frida Kahlo. 
</P>
<P>
 The home she shares with her husband, Thori and their daughter, 2 
1/2-year-old, Hannah, reflects her passion for color and folk art as well as a 
taste for the surreal. It was in part growing up in Texas and the many creative 
jobs she had there that contributed to this sense of style.  
</P>
<P>
 After college, Wolfe designed children's books for an Austin publisher and 
taught art to Latin American students attending a south Texas boarding school. 
During this time, she cultivated an appreciation for Mexican folk art and 
colonial churches over the border. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 20, she stayed at a monastery outside of Florence, Italy, where 
she was exposed to all the possibilities of color through mosaics and stained 
glass, the regal beauty of ceremonial robes in the Catholic Church and rich 
artwork by Italian masters. 
</P>
<P>
 This experience encouraged Wolfe "to give a feeling (to her work) of being in 
a church in a peaceful, meditating sense. Not so much in a Christian sense," 
she says, "but spiritual." 
</P>
<P>
 She started the tapestries four years ago. The purses followed two years later 
as an affordable extension of her art and something she could manage from home 
part time, while being a mother full time. She continues teaching art to 
children through an outreach program at Orange County Center for Contemporary 
Art and after-school classes at the Newport Harbor Art Museum. And she spends 
summers at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, taking graduate courses in 
textile techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually hanging alongside the tapestries, Wolfe's bags are available at the 
Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana, the Newport Harbor Art Museum in 
Newport Beach and the Folk Tree Collection gallery in Pasadena. They are also 
sold at Robinson-Hallenberg in Laguna Beach and Screaming from L.A. in Los 
Angeles.

FASHION; BLOOMINGDALE'S TO GO WEST -- BUT WHERE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the moment, Bloomingdale's is the big retailer that could. 
</P>
<P>
 It could, for example, erect its first West Coast store on a Beverly Hills 
parking lot. Or, it could bestow that honor on Century City. Then again, it 
could take the whole project off to a mall in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game that could end any moment, the stakes are high: about 1,000 jobs and 
more than $1 million in sales-tax revenue -- plus the cachet of having what 
some say will be the grandest Bloomie's outside Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, the store could tie up traffic for miles, take business away 
from existing merchants and disappoint shoppers who were expecting an exact 
replica of the 59th Street and Lexington Avenue establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 While a Beverly Drive location leads the West Coast contenders, Bloomingdale's 
Chairman Michael Gould (former chief executive officer of Robinson's and 
Giorgio of Beverly Hills) insists that all options are open. He is being 
actively pursued by Mayor Richard Riordan's office, he says, despite reports 
that Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky objects to the Century City site because it 
would draw an additional 10,000 cars daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased congestion is also a sore point with Rodeo Drive merchant Herbert 
Fink, owner of Theodore, who says the streets of his "small town . . . are not 
conducive to a large amount of traffic." He calls Bloomingdale's "a great 
organization" but questions "their reason to be." 
</P>
<P>
 "Does Beverly Hills or the surrounding area really need another major 
department store? I certainly don't know what they would have to offer in 
addition to what already exists in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow Rodeo Drive retailer Fred Hayman calls the move "a double-edged sword. 
It's very positive from the point of view that Bloomingdale's is a very big 
name, and it should bring a lot of new customers. But my sense is that the big 
stores -- Saks, I. Magnin's, Neiman Marcus, maybe Barneys -- might be 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
 The big stores, however, are talking nice. Says Neiman General Manager John 
Martens: "I do believe that for every sale they get, it's possibly one we may 
not get. But at the same time, I'm delighted they are coming to town. 
Personally, I'd like them right next to me to bring shoppers here." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting to see how it all plays out are East Coast transplants, and frequent 
commuters, for whom the store's contents will be every bit as important as the 
address. Many are wondering if there will be a facsimile of Manhattan's gourmet 
food section. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we're hoping to have something like that," Gould says, cautiously 
noting that the original Bloomie's "is hard to duplicate. It's like the 
theater. Go to it in New York, then go to it in other cities. It's not quite 
the same. But I think we can replicate a lot: the quality of the merchandise, 
the excitement of the store, the visual impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Etienne Taenaka, manager of the Vidal Sassoon salon on Rodeo Drive, hopes so. 
He recently moved back to California after eight years in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a consummate Bloomingdale's shopper," he says. "They had everything I 
needed and anything I wanted. The bread, the caviar, the coffee, the gift 
items. And definitely the clothes -- just the way they're put together. There 
is so much to see." 
</P>
<P>
 When the store comes to California, Taenaka wants the works: "The amazing 
menswear department, the appliances, the extended home furnishings, the little 
post office, the luggage, the books." 
</P>
<P>
 And the theatrics. "They always had a theme going, something inspiring. If 
they don't have all that," he says, "it will be just like Bullock's -- with 
better clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Lawrence, public relations director for Rampage Clothing Co., moved from 
New York to Los Angeles five months ago and she longs for "the great furniture 
department where you could find everything." She even misses the cosmetics 
floor: "As annoying as it was, it had the biggest range. You could always find 
the perfect lipstick at Bloomingdale's. But you get sprayed to death. It's 
heavy-duty fragrance." 
</P>
<P>
 While Gould isn't giving away too many specifics, he says there will be no 
post office and possibly no furniture department. But he promises that there 
will be plenty of the famous Bloomie's undies, along with familiar designer 
names, private-label merchandise and "some merchandise made just for us." 
</P>
<P>
 All that might not be enough to draw shoppers such as Daphne Elliott. A New 
York transplant who lives in Agoura, she spent nearly every lunch hour in the 
Manhattan store during the '50s and '60s. But the two parted in the '70s, she 
says: "It got out of my range age-wise, money-wise and style-wise. I was 
offended." 
</P>
<P>
 A former fashion copywriter familiar with merchandising concepts, Elliott 
doubts that affluent Southern Californians, born to shop in boutiques and 
specialty stores, will take to "so much mass-produced merchandise under one 
roof." 
</P>
<P>
 But the thought of a Bloomie's in her neighborhood fills Judy Davidson, 
partner in a L.A. public relations firm, with nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Queen Elizabeth came to the United States, that was the place she wanted 
to go," recalls Davidson, who also remembers that the store "had the best 
shopping bags. They were better than a briefcase, better than an attache case. 
All the women wanted to carry them."

GO POG WILD AT UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pogs are the biggest thing since Transformers. POG is an acronym for 
Passion-Orange-Guava, a popular drink in Hawaii. The mostly cardboard bottle 
caps are cheap, easy to collect and store -- and a lot easier to get than most 
toys or games that have exploded into must-have status. 
</P>
<P>
 So what could be a bigger attraction than what's being touted as the "world's 
largest Pog game"? Friday through Sunday, children 3-11 can go Pog wild with 
the game at Universal Studios, Universal City, where PogWorld, an interactive 
play land, has been operating for the past four weekends.  
</P>
<P>
 PogWorld hours are 10:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. The cost is included in regular theme 
park admission: ages 12-60, $31; ages 3-11 and 60 and older, $24.95. For 
information, call (818) 508-9600. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; A STARRING DOUBLE BILL; MOVERS AND SHAKERS GET ROUND OF 
APPLAUSE FOR THEIR ROLE AS PATRONS OF THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A small chain of furniture stores and a food industry giant were among 12 
businesses recognized for their contributions to local arts organizations by 
the Orange County Business Committee for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 guests, including many of Orange County's leading movers and 
shakers, gathered Sunday at the Pacific Mutual building in Newport Beach for 
the OCBCA's 13th annual Business in the Arts Awards ceremony. After the awards, 
guests headed to the nearby Ritz restaurant for a dinner of lobster salad and 
roast beef. Key Notes 
</P>
<P>
 "How did I find myself doing this on a Sunday night?" That was the question 
posed by the keynote speaker, Henry Wendt, retired chairman of the board of 
SmithKline Beecham and owner of the Quivira Vineyard and Winery. 
</P>
<P>
 His reason for being there soon became clear: to tout the mutually beneficial 
relationship between business and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very idea of a partnership between business and the arts is a very 
American concept," he said. "It has no counterpart anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent political events and calls for less government, he noted, 
"investing in intellectual capital" is more important than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can expect to see less support from government for the arts," Wendt said. 
Saluting the Winners 
</P>
<P>
 OCBCA Chairman George Argyros handed out to winners the crystal trophies 
designed by Tiffany & Co.  
</P>
<P>
 The law firm of O'Melveny & Myers (represented by senior litigation partner 
James Selna) and Yamaha Corp. of America (represented by Masahiko Arimoto, 
president) received First Time Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "All art institutions have lots of difficult problems with the declining 
economy. Governments have higher priorities these days," Selna said. He said 
it's up to businesses to support the arts not only with money, but also with 
their time and resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland and Taco Bell Corp. received Return Awards, and Distinguished 
Achievement Awards went to Glabman Furniture, Tiffany & Co., the Fieldstone 
Company, Latham & Watkins, C.J. Segerstrom & Sons, the Orange County Register, 
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. and The Times Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art received the Arts Award, given to a local 
nonprofit organization that has successfully forged innovative partnerships 
with area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get along without them," said Patricia House, director of 
development for the Bowers. "The public can only afford to give so much. It's 
up to the private sector to support art and culture." 
</P>
<P>
 A special Award of Distinction for Development and Production in Arts and 
Education was given to KOCE-TV, Channel 50, Orange County Public Television. 
Key Players 
</P>
<P>
 This year's judges who attended were: Catherine Michaels, executive director 
of the Children's Museum at La Habra; Fred Mickelson, regional vice president 
of Southern California Edison Co.; Albert Nichols, chairman emeritus of Corning 
Nichols Institute and director of the Corning Life Sciences Inc., and Terry Van 
Gorder, president and chief executive officer of Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Business Committee for the Arts is part of a national 
organization started in 1967 by David Rockefeller to foster business support 
for the arts. To date, the committee has presented 148 awards to local 
businesses and honored 19 arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting awards on behalf of their companies were: Jack Lindquist, past 
president of Disneyland, and Norm Doerges, executive vice president; Charlie 
Rogers, senior vice president of Taco Bell; James Glabman, chairman of Glabman 
Furniture; Jo Ellen Qualls, vice president of Tiffany & Co.; Peter Ochs,

Thomas Sutton, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Pacific 
Mutual; Judith Sweeney, president of The Times Orange County; Peter Keller, 
executive director of the Bowers, and Rochelle McReynolds, director of major 
gifts and grants for KOCE-TV.

HE'S GOT THE STARS SWEATIN'; TONY CORTES IS FAST BECOMING HOLLYWOOD'S HOTTEST 
FITNESS EXPERT. HIS LATEST ASSIGNMENT?SHAPE UP VAL KILMER FOR HIS CAPED 
CRUSADER ROLE IN 'BATMAN FOREVER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Linda Hamilton was transformed into a female Arnold for "Terminator 2: 
Judgement Day," an out-of-shape Cher was chiseled into ageless perfection for 
her fitness video and Janet Jackson went from a bit chunky to a sexy video 
vixen. 
</P>
<P>
 All three women, at least in part, have fitness guru Tony Cortes to thank for 
their stunning definition, if not their talent. But does anybody actually care 
about yet another personal trainer to the stars? 
</P>
<P>
 Someone must. Cortes, 32, is fast becoming Hollywood's hottest -- if one of 
the unlikeliest -- fitness guru. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortes, whose Specialized Exercise Training Systems is based in the 
un-Hollywood locale of Claremont, has also worked out with Priscilla Presley, 
John Malkovich, Johnny Depp, Valerie Bertinelli and Eddie Van Halen, Ray 
Liotta, John Cusack, Sugar Ray Leonard, Chris O'Donnell, Ron Perlman and Daphne 
Zuniga. But he is currently sweating it on the job for his most high-profile 
challenge to date: pumping Val Kilmer for his upcoming duties as the Caped 
Crusader in "Batman Forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "With Val, we're working on an endurance and a hypertrophy base," Cortes says. 
"We're trying to build mass. I hope to be there all the way through filming 
because it's very important to Val, and to the production company, to keep him 
in good shape and from being injured." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Cortes has been working for and with the actor daily for the past 
couple of months. Filming began in September. Along with the intense workouts, 
Cortes is also monitoring the actor's eating habits. "We're trying to fill him 
on a lot of complex carbohydrates and lean protein like cooked egg whites and 
chicken breasts, beans, rice, fish, raw and steamed vegetables. Nothing fried." 
 
</P>
<P>
 On Kilmer's forbidden list: pizza, red meat, cheese, processed bread, desserts 
and junk food. "He only gets a limited amount of coffee, and he can't have milk 
in it," he says, then relents. "OK, occasionally, maybe a little milk, but it 
has to be nonfat." 
</P>
<P>
 Cortes prides himself on running a full-service fitness outfit. "If a movie 
company needs one of my clients to be trained for a fight on screen, I have 
someone who works for me that can do that," he says. "If another client needs a 
bike made for his training, I can have it done for them. My job is to make it 
as easy for them as possible. But they have to be ready to work." Dressed in 
loose-fitting sweats, Cortes is 5-foot-4 and an ironclad 145 pounds. He 
commutes to L.A.'s Westside from Claremont, where he also serves non-celebrity 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortes started in 1981 as a trainer in a small gym in Pasadena. His celebrity 
clientele built quickly after Hamilton selected him to prep her for "Terminator 
2."  
</P>
<P>
 "What we did with Linda was done in 13 weeks from scratch," he says proudly. 
"We were looking at someone who really never exercised . . . who had just had a 
baby and, all of a sudden, she was in great shape. People were astonished." 
</P>
<P>
 One way he achieves results is by tailoring the conditioning to the client's 
needs. Music stars Janet Jackson and Eddie Van Halen, for instance, need a 
different type of program because of the intense workouts they already get on 
stage and in rehearsal.  
</P>
<P>
 "You look at exactly what they do and analyze it and say: 'OK, this performer 
has to do a lot of heavy interval work with periods of high exertion, ups and 
down. They need strength and endurance.' So we put a heart rate monitor on 
Janet, so that I (could read) her heart rate for every five seconds of her 
dance session. 
</P>
<P>
 "(With a film) we read the script and then meet with the director to determine 
just exactly what is going to be required. If you make an actor look great for 
a movie but then they have to do take after take of running and jumping and 
climbing, they're gonna be dead. They'll look sloppy because those demands 
require a different sort of training beyond just pumping up." 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, Zuniga of "Melrose Place" has been working on aerobics, free 
weights and cardiovascular workouts with Cortes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just like anything else in our lives, we're moved by pleasure and deterred by 
pain," Zuniga says. "Tony just understood that, and I was shockingly surprised. 
He wasn't like a drill sergeant. I thought to myself, 'How can this guy train 
Olympic athletes, and all these people I see look so great, and be so gentle?' 
But with Tony, he helps you find your own strength; you work harder without 
beating yourself up. And I started to get results." 
</P>
<P>
 Pumping up the stars has definitely kept things hopping at home. "One time, I 
was in the bathroom and my wife came in and said, 'Honey. It's Cher on the 
phone.' I said, 'Yeah, right.' Then I realized she was serious and I came 
running out of the bathroom and grabbed the phone."  
</P>
<P>
 All this attention doesn't come cheap. "Usually, the celebrities make me a 
perk as a part of their contract," he says. "But sometimes, it's so important 
to the client that they have to pay it out of their own pockets" -- pockets 
that can afford $400 to $600 a day, if Cortes goes on location with them for an 
extended period. That's not including the per diem of $50 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 For those regular Janes or Joes looking for a workout, the hourly rate is $90 
per hour -- a bit more if Cortes goes to your home, a bit less if you work with 
one of his associates. "We're really affordable," Cortes says. "Because what I 
think happens to people is that they go with a trainer who isn't that good and 
they'll blow 25, 30, 40, 50 dollars-an-hour, month after month, and never get 
anywhere. I have this attitude that you're gonna pay me now -- or you're gonna 
pay me later!" 
</P>
<P>
 'If you make an actor look great for a movie but then they have to do take 
after take of running and jumping and climbing, they're gonna be dead. They'll 
look sloppy because those demands require a different training beyond just 
pumping up.' Tony Cortes

PROVING MUSIC KNOWS NO BORDERS; L.A. PHILHARMONIC AND YOUTH ORCHESTRA OF 
TEPOZTLAN BUILD A CULTURAL BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 His eyes riveted on the young people tuning up in the historic courtyard 
below, Esa-Pekka Salonen was like a statue out of time -- black Levi's, Reeboks 
and golf shirt, his conductor's baton wedged under arm. He leaned, transfixed, 
through the arch of Tepoztlan's 16th-Century Convent of the Nativity and 
surveyed the scene before him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing!" the 36-year-old Finnish conductor of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic finally said after watching silently for almost 10 minutes, as the 
children and teen-agers of Mexican farmers, teachers, peasants and craftsmen -- 
boys and girls who couldn't play a note just three years ago -- took their 
places in the Tepoztlan Youth Symphony Orchestra below. "It's like a fairy 
tale. It's like I'm inside a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was real. 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour, the Philharmonic's music director would stand, rigid, proud 
and beaming in the twilight in the courtyard as he led almost 300 Mexican 
youngsters in a rehearsal of Jean Sibelius' "Finlandia," a piece the conductor 
said embodies the desire of a nation -- be it Finland or Mexico -- for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the beginning of the Philharmonic's six-city tour and -- more 
important -- a permanent relationship that Salonen and his Mexican counterpart 
say they hope will change Los Angeles as much as his presence has the small 
Mexican town of Tepoztlan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monday rehearsal and a final dress performance in Mexico City on Tuesday 
evening "proves that music is the universal language with which you can 
communicate between people, between cultures, between languages and between 
countries -- and these kids understand this," a flushed Salonen declared 
moments after he and the young musicians reached the final cadence. 
</P>
<P>
 For Salonen -- who is making his first Latin American visit this week with the 
L.A. Philharmonic, conducting a three-day concert stop in Mexico City with two 
evening performances in the Mexican capital -- the daylong session with the 
youngsters and five members of the Philharmonic at the Convent of the Nativity 
was the culmination of eight months of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 He and several Mexican and Los Angeles-based classical music patrons have 
labored to create special ties between the Philharmonic and the Tepoztlan Youth 
Orchestra; Salonen describes it simply as an "adoption" of the youth group in 
this town of 13,000, an hour's drive south of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's creating a link -- us helping them, and them helping us -- and showing a 
living example to Los Angeles and to Mexico of what can be done for so little 
money," Salonen explained of the coaching done by him, trombonist Jeffrey 
Reynolds, bassoonist Patricia Kindel Heimerl, violinist Barry Socher, 
percussionist Raynor Carroll and bassist Oscar Meza Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, he said, "we could use this young orchestra in various communities in 
Los Angeles to show this is, indeed, possible. It changes the lives of the kids 
and the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 For the conductor, the motivation is personal, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about the future because I have to be," Salonen said, noting 
that he lives in a time in which "Madonna is mainstream and classical music has 
gone underground and counterculture." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be the last generation of conductors," he added, "and this is 
the best way to guarantee continuity of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen has championed the program with the Mexican youngsters ever since he 
lunched at a Westwood coffeehouse eight months ago with Tepoztlan Youth 
Orchestra president Julio Solorzano Foppa and Solorzano's American partner 
Arthur Gorson. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men own the Los Angeles-based Ventana Films production company. They 
used their friendships to reach Salonen to pitch to him the idea of the 
Philharmonic hooking up somehow with the youth orchestra, which Solorzano 
helped launch almost three years ago in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 To appreciate the magnitude of this proposal -- and the young orchestra's 
opening by playing "Finlandia" with Salonen conducting prior to the 
Philharmonic concert on Tuesday night at Mexico City's most prestigious venue, 
the Palacio de Bellas Artes -- is to understand that not one of the Tepozteco 
musicians, ages 5 to 18, had even seen sheet music 30 months ago. None of them 
owned instruments -- all of which were donated by their community. The 
youngsters' orchestral work quickly became as much a crash course in 
social-development skills as one of musical training. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen and the backers of the youth orchestra also see critical cultural and 
political issues playing themselves out in the tie between the Philharmonic and 
the Mexican children. 
</P>
<P>
 They said it could help bridge cultural chasms between California and Mexico, 
at a time of furious reaction to the recent passage of Proposition 187, the 
ballot measure aimed at deterring illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 As an indicator of the anger here about Prop. 187, Solorzano found himself on 
the defensive at a Mexico City news conference called to announce the new 
relationship between the Philharmonic and the youth orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 He answered angry questions about Prop. 187, saying that he believed the 
ballot measure "is a profound violation of human rights . . . and an attack on 
our culture." But it was just for that very reason, he said, that cultural 
links -- especially like those between the Los Angeles and Mexican musicians -- 
are now so vital. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen agreed. In an interview in Tepoztlan on Monday, he said that he 
considers Prop. 187 to be "based on a lack of knowledge and a lack of rational 
thought." There is a clear link, he said, between its short-term thinking and 
the ebb of American interest in classical music in a society conditioned to 
fast-edit music videos and cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you only see a few feet in front of your face, you don't see the value of 
the classical arts. You must take a long-term view," he said. "And that applies 
to Prop. 187, as well. There might be things that seem like an easy fix right 
now, and in five years you find yourself in the middle of a nightmare. I think 
Prop. 187 is a lot like that. And so is popular interest in the classical 
arts." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, at another news conference at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, Ernest 
Fleischmann, the Philharmonic's executive director, put punctuation on the 
message. After the questions had ended, he asked for the microphone to make a 
final comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prop. 187 or no, there are bigger issues," he said, stressing that the ties 
between the Philharmonic and the Tepozteco youth "mean greatly more than what 
the political politicians are trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not despair; (Prop.) 187 is a temporary thing. We are here to make 
something permanent. And I think the impact 300 young people can have in a 
community like Tepoztlan, we can all learn from that. We can certainly learn in 
Los Angeles."

LATEST AMAZING DISCOVERY: THE UN-INFOMERCIAL; TELEVISION: STORYMERCIALS COST 
MORE TO SHOOT AND DON'T LOOK LIKE INFOMERCIALS -- THEY LOOK LIKE REAL SHOWS. 
THE SOFT-SELL APPROACH IS MORE APPEALING TO CORPORATE AMERICA.

 Meet the Martinettis. 
</P>
<P>
 They're television's newest family, and there probably hasn't been a more 
likable, middle-American bunch on the tube since the Nelsons. The large clan -- 
including opera-fan Gramps, loving Mom and Dad, three kids and a dog -- live 
together in a spacious home, and things couldn't be more rosy. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until the Martinettis bring home a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the premiere of the show that hits most of the country Friday, the rest of 
the Martinettis butt heads with old-fashioned Dad, who didn't want the computer 
-- specifically, the Apple Macintosh Performa -- in the first place and doubts 
whether the family will really use it. A friendly wager is made, and the battle 
is on to convince Dad that the computer is invaluable. Even the dog gets into 
the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to give anything away, but the episode has a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 But those wishing to catch the premiere of the comedy will not find it listed 
in their TV guide. And viewers who become instant Martinetti fans and can't 
wait to see their next adventure will probably have to wait a long time for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Martinettis Bring Home a Computer," you see, is an infomercial -- a 
program-length commercial for which the advertiser buys time from a local TV 
station -- usually late at night or on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the traditional infomercial that uses demonstrations or a 
talk-show-like setting to hawk products, the Martinetti infomercial, 
co-produced by Apple Computer Inc., is a new breed -- using fictional 
characters to point out the benefits of the product while also involving 
viewers in an entertaining plot. The industry has dubbed it a storymercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The storymercial will be one of the fundamental formats of infomercials in 
the future," said Katie Williams, chief executive officer of Williams 
Television Time, an advertising agency specializing in producing and selling 
infomercials to television stations. "But it's a very expensive format. It 
costs $150,000 to $200,000 more to produce than the average infomercial." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical infomercial costs $100,000 or under to produce. But storymercials 
look like regular television programs, with slick production values, original 
music, tight editing and professional actors. Only a laugh track and opening 
and closing credits are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Storymercials that are currently airing or are planned include: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Motel Time Warp," from Magnavox. Set in the 1950s and done in the style of 
a "Twilight Zone," it opens when a family stops at a mysterious hotel overseen 
by a desk clerk with an Inspector Clouseau-type accent (Michael Shapiro). The 
clerk places the family in a room with a 27-inch Magnavox stereo color 
television with "exclusive Smart Sound and remote locater." The family is 
alternately bewildered and intrigued by the set as a cast of eccentric 
characters (all played by Shapiro) burst into the room and rave about its great 
features. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Reunion," from Weight Watchers International, centers around a "Big 
Chill"-type reunion of four female friends. When they gather at a log cabin, 
the women talk about their longstanding weight problems, then notice that one 
of them is noticeably thinner and much more glamorous. The newly slim woman 
persuades her friends that Weight Watchers is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Exertainment," from LifeFitness, in which a teen-age boy who bears no small 
resemblance to Fred Savage in "The Wonder Years" persuades his family to 
purchase an exercise machine that allows the user to interact with large-screen 
video games while burning calories. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Martinetti effort, Apple executives have become believers in the 
storymercial. Although they declined to release exact sales figures, they said 
the spot has already proved to be a success in its limited run in cities such 
as Boston and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting significantly higher inquiries about the computer than we had 
ever expected from retailers and consumers," said Yvonne Nava, Apple's direct 
marketing manager. "The storymercial really communicated the message that a 
computer is good for the whole family." 
</P>
<P>
 As larger corporations venture into the $4-billion-a-year infomercial and 
home-shopping business, some in the industry see them embracing the 
storymercial format because it distances them from infomercial staples such as 
psychic hot lines, floor mops and food dehydrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a form that is perceived at the opposite end of most infomercials," said 
Tim O'Leary, president of TV Tyee, the marketing division of Tyee Productions, 
which pioneered the storymercial genre, producing Apple's "Martinettis" spot 
and numerous other storymercials. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said, "For the Fortune 500 companies who are getting into the 
business, they feel that storymercials keep them from being associated with the 
bad end of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Spiegel, president of Kent & Spiegel Inc., a direct marketing firm, 
said, "The storymercial is perfect for companies that not only want to sell a 
product but also want to create an image. They want the company to be 
associated with something beyond the product. They can camouflage the sales 
pitch in a nice wrapper." 
</P>
<P>
 There is still uncertainty in the industry about the effectiveness of the 
storymercials, however, as opposed to direct response or direct sell 
infomercials. Some say viewers may become confused about whether they're 
watching a real show, and that they may become so involved with the characters 
and the plot that the product is overshadowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The storymercial is clever when it's done well, but I don't know if there is 
going to be a whole proliferation of them," said Helene Blake, executive 
director of the National Infomercial Marketing Assn., a trade association 
representing the electronic retail industry. "Direct sell is still the best way 
to go when it comes to infomercials. Viewers may get confused with a 
storymercial, even if it's labeled as paid advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 Association regulations stipulate that any infomercial, including a 
storymercial, must be labeled as a paid advertisement at the beginning and at 
the end of each show, as well as before every commercial or ordering 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter such skepticism, O'Leary and others point to several storymercial 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from a storymercial by Tyee and ProForm Fitness about the Crosswalk, 
a sophisticated treadmill, sales of the machine ranged between $150 
million-$200 million. Another exercise machine, the Gravity Edge by SLM Inc., 
sold about 80,000 units; its storymercial, also co-produced by Tyee, revolved 
around the love-hate relationship between a motocross driver and a personal 
trainer who made the driver use the Gravity Edge to build up his muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another storymercial on Philips' CD-i, an interactive compact disc system, won 
the advertising industry's coveted Clio Award for excellence and resulted in a 
huge surge in sales for a product that previously was drawing little consumer 
interest, O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyee hopes a future storymercial series with weekly or monthly episodes might 
be developed with recurring characters. John Ripper, president of Tyee 
Productions, added that the firm is hoping to attract "recognizable actors or 
character actors" to the storymercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep on doing these kinds of infomercials, that's for sure," 
Ripper said. 
</P>
<P>
 So there may still be hope for viewers waiting for the further adventures of 
the Martinettis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple's "The Martinettis Bring Home a Computer" will air Friday and on Dec. 
11 at 7:30 a.m. on KABC-TV Channel 7; on Dec. 3 at 8:30 p.m. on KDOC-TV Channel 
56, and on Dec. 9 and Dec. 12 at 5:30 a.m. on KTLA Channel 5. Magnavox's "Motel 
Time Warp" will air Saturday at 8:30 a.m. on KTLA and at 9:30 a.m. on KCOP-TV 
Channel 13; and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. on KNBC-TV Channel 4.

EX-KLOS DEEJAYS SAY GOODBY -- ON KLSX; RADIO: FANS AND VETERAN PERSONALITY JIM 
LADD AIR THEIR SUPPORT FOR DISMISSED JOE BENSON AND BOB COBURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1987, when the entire staff of rebel rocker KMET-FM was summarily 
dismissed, Joe Benson, a colleague at rival rock station KLOS-FM, extended the 
fired deejays a sentimental -- and unusual -- offer: to appear on his show and 
say goodby to their audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, KLSX-FM's Jim Ladd, one of those fired KMET deejays, returned 
the favor: He played host during his KLSX-FM (97.1) show to fired KLOS deejays 
Benson and Bob Coburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Coburn and Benson were dismissed last week after 14 years on the air at 
KLOS (95.5). The station, which has been steadily slipping in the ratings, is 
making a greater effort to reach a younger audience by bringing in new deejays 
(some from hard rocker KNAC-FM) and playing more current rock music. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell, they wanted to take the station in a different direction and 
we were not part of that direction," Coburn said. "We were perceived as part of 
the past, part of the old." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson used hyperbole to make his point more simply: "The audience we've come 
to know over the past 712 years is an audience they weren't looking for 
anymore."  
</P>
<P>
 Amid the strains of the Who's "My Generation" and a new Tom Petty song titled 
"A Higher Place," Coburn and Benson took the high road, choosing not to knock 
their former employer but rather to focus on the good times. 
</P>
<P>
 That made for an unusual talkfest -- one filled with reminiscences, laughter 
and no shortage of appreciative words from listeners over the course of several 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been listening to you guys forever," said one caller. "And all of a 
sudden there was no B.C. and no Uncle Joe. A big part of me, it seemed like it 
died." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to say thank you for all the time we spent together, all the 
wonderful years," another caller offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "In radio there have never been two better deejays or two better people or two 
better friends," gushed another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little ashamed of what they've done to you," lamented still another. 
</P>
<P>
 The fired deejays were philosophical about their fate but stressed that what 
they would miss most is "connecting with the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 "In any form of business, these things happen," Benson said. "But I really 
enjoyed getting to know people and getting to be a part of people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Ladd, on the other hand, took some shots at the new KLOS strategy -- calling 
it "lamebrained" -- and at station management for "grinding up two human 
beings." 
</P>
<P>
 KLOS program director Carey Curelop explained in an interview Wednesday that 
the decision to drop Coburn and Benson -- along with 10-year KLOS veteran Gino 
Michelini a few weeks earlier -- was the toughest he has had to make in his 
radio career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have great respect for Joe, Gino and Bob, but if we're going to present a 
more up-tempo, more current approach, we need talent that at least comes up to 
the level of the music in terms of energy," Curelop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coburn, who had been on the air from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., was replaced by 
another KLOS deejay, Randy Maranz, while Benson's 6-10 p.m. slot was filled by 
former KNAC deejay Remy Maxwell. Michelini's 2-6 p.m. job went to former KNAC 
deejay Long Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 Coburn and Benson acknowledged that KLOS needed a musical change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a problem with the music sometimes," Coburn said Tuesday night. "I 
could tell at the beginning of the decade that we needed to update our music. I 
could tell we were going to die playing 'Layla,' that we had to cultivate 
young, new artists we could grow with. I knew this was coming. . . . But I've 
stayed current over the years and I do think I could have played that music." 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Coburn told the KLSX audience, KLOS will now play less of "the 
Who and the Beatles and more Pearl Jam and Soundgarden." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Ladd's descriptions to the contrary, Curelop insisted that KLOS has 
not changed format. 
</P>
<P>
 "KLOS has always had a balance of new rock and classic rock, and the pendulum 
has swung slightly in favor of new material because the quality of the music 
demands that we expose more of it," he said. "Format-wise, that's all we've 
done. We've just instituted a policy of playing a few more new records." 
</P>
<P>
 Coburn and Benson said they have spoken with radio stations in Los Angeles and 
other cities but do not yet have new jobs lined up. Coburn told listeners: "I'd 
like people to know we're not dead and buried. We are going to be around. After 
all, it's the only thing we know how to do. I'm completely unqualified for 
anything else."

ENSEMBLE THEATRE TRANSLATES 'CEREMONIES' FOR YOUNG EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ensemble Theatre director Roosevelt Blankenship Jr. generally doesn't shy away 
from plays with strong language. Last summer, for instance, he brought 
playwright David Mamet's foul-mouthed real estate salesmen to the stage with 
"Glengarry Glen Ross." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Ensemble production opening Friday , the African American classic 
"Ceremonies in Dark Old Men," Blankenship decided to turn the profanity down a 
few notches. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, he said before a rehearsal at the 45-seat theater this week, is to 
bring in as many students as possible -- especially black students -- so they 
can hear playwright Lonne Elder III's message about racial oppression and the 
dangers of quick-fix solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for young people to get to see it, I felt it was best to take (the 
four-letter words) out," Blankenship said, noting that he didn't excise all 
gritty words. "If you can use them on TV, they're here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Ceremonies" is set in the Harlem ghetto of 1969, Blankenship said 
this hard-hitting play "definitely parallels the present time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, like back in 1969, you have a lot of young people who want to take the 
short route," Blankenship said. In the play, the eldest son illegally sells 
corn liquor to make some fast money. And in 1994, many youths try to get ahead, 
he pointed out, "by selling drugs and joining gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 "They want the flashy things in life," Blankenship said of the play's 
characters, "but they don't think about the risks. Or that maybe it could tear 
the family apart." 
</P>
<P>
 The father in "Ceremonies" is Russell Parker (played by Mellow Martin), a 
former vaudeville dancer who dreams of making his barbershop a success. 
Customers are a rarity, however, so he idles away the time making up stories 
and trying to beat his friend, William Jenkins (Ray Jones), at checkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's daughter, Adele (Meta King), had quit college and moved back home in 
an attempt to get her family back on course. But frustrated at being the sole 
breadwinner, Adele issues an ultimatum to her brothers: "Get jobs or get out." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest son, Bobby (Michael Harris), tries to make money by shoplifting, 
which he believes to be his only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldest son Theo (E.J. Gage) turns to moonshining and becomes dangerously 
involved with a local gangster, Blue Haven (Lee White), who plans to drive all 
the white business owners out of Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Ryan portrays a seductive young hustler who works for one of Blue 
Haven's adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 There are comical moments in "Ceremonies," such as when the father "tells all 
sorts of lies" about working on a chain gang. But tragedy is the inevitable 
result as the family's misguided attempts to achieve a better life go horribly 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a preachy play," Blankenship said. "It's very realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 He also characterizes "Ceremonies" as being "very similar in tone" to a 
better-known African American play, "A Raisin in the Sun." Lorraine Hansberry's 
drama will open the Ensemble Theatre's 1995 season in late January. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old director will be among the cast members in "Raisin," along 
with his 6-year-old son, Roosevelt Blankenship III. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Blankenship has been active in Orange County performing arts since 
1987, when he helped form Eastern Boys Productions and rented theater space for 
the productions. Since opening the Ensemble Theatre in 1992, Blankenship has 
produced a diverse range of about 15 plays, including "Master Harold and the 
Boys," "My Sweet Charlie" and "A Hatful of Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 When selecting plays, the goal is "to give audiences something they can think 
about later," he said, "something they're not going to forget the minute they 
walk out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want quality, well-written plays," Blankenship said as his cast 
members began arriving for rehearsal. "And actors who can meet the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 * Lonne Elder III's "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men" opens Friday at 8 p.m. at the 
Ensemble Theatre, 844 E. Lincoln Ave., Suite E, Orange. Through Dec. 17. $10 to 
$15. (714) 998-2670.

POP BEAT: A NIGHT OF SPLENDID 'DREAMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ratings range from * (poor) to **** (excellent). Three stars denote a solid 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 **** 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gaffney 
</P>
<P>
 "Man of Somebody's Dreams" 
</P>
<P>
 Red Moon  
</P>
<P>
 The bad news about this splendid live album is that it's on a Swiss label, 
which means getting a copy will take some doing. The good news is that while 
the Europeans only get to see Gaffney once or twice a year, you can see him for 
free any Wednesday night at the Canyon Inn in Yorba Linda (where the maestro 
may have a few copies to sell, for a limited time only). 
</P>
<P>
 This performance, recorded in April in Zurich, was special -- Gaffney's first 
concert for an overseas audience, on a festival bill far removed from the 
constant round of barroom gigs on the Southern California country and 
roots-music circuit that has been his lot since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffney -- a Costa Mesa resident who is all too well-acquainted with the life 
of the musical small-timer he plays in the song "Six Nights a Week" -- made the 
most of his sudden transformation into an international figure: Backed by his 
regular guitar sidekick Danny Ott and by touring partner Jann Browne's band the 
Dangerous Neighbors, he delivered a show worthy of any true country hero, and 
beyond what we're apt to hear from the new wave of slick, shallow pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
 A concert of that caliber has to be founded on great material, and as one of 
the best songwriters in Southern California, Gaffney entered his big night 
well-equipped. The 13-song set mines gems from his two unerring albums, "Chris 
Gaffney & the Cold Hard Facts" (good luck finding this 1990 outing for ROM 
Records) and "Mi Vida Loca" (a 1992 Hightone release that should be obtainable, 
if not readily so). 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffney tosses in two previously unrecorded originals, a Tex-Mex instrumental 
polka and a honky-tonk waltz; he also covers a Buddy Guy slow blues (with Ott 
taking over as singer and bandleader) and a whimsical Mel Tillis oldie, "Honky 
Tonk." 
</P>
<P>
 Tackling their stylistically omnivorous program, Gaffney and band are almost 
never less than vibrant, and the performances are captured in a recording of 
the highest clarity and presence. Ott, a marvelous player, has more delicious 
tones and shadings at his disposal than a gambling cheat has face cards; on " 
'68," his sizzling, Chuck Berry-based soloing simultaneously rings like a bell 
and tears like a saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Barnes is nominally the second guitarist, but he makes every turn in the 
spotlight sound like an argument for a promotion. Dennis Caplinger's fiddling 
is a sweet, invigorating breeze; like Barnes, this brilliant 
jack-of-all-strings was a major force on Jann Browne's extraordinary Red Moon 
album, "Count Me In." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffney lays on a zesty Tex-Mex button accordion (his squeeze box doubles as a 
substitute blues organ on the Buddy Guy number), and the rhythm section is 
keyed by a hot yet disciplined drummer, Arturo Gonzales Perez. Remarkably, this 
was the first concert this assemblage of musicians ever had played together. 
Gaffney's burry, laconic voice is in fine form; he sings with characteristic 
understatement, yet with savvy turns and intensities that do justice to the 
carnival of experience acted out in his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some small flaws. " '68," the hard-rocking Vietnam war-buddies epic 
that may be Gaffney's finest song (Dave Alvin was the co-writer), doesn't have 
quite as much heat and heft as the studio version on "Mi Vida Loca." And the 
previously unheard lovelorn waltz "Man of Somebody's Dreams" is quite catchy, 
but by Gaffney's standards it's of middlin' quality, lacking the sense of 
surprise and the captured-moment distillation of emotional life that marks his 
top stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Some highlights? It's hard to think of a song more exuberant than "Psychotic 
Girlfriend," a delicious, whirling blend of '50s doo-wop and Chicano rock that 
musically embodies the refrain "All I can say is it's such a wild weekend / All 
I can say is it's such a wild world." And when Gaffney wants to ache, as he 
does on the luminous "Waltz for Minnie," he aches with the best. Without 
peeking at the credits, one easily might wonder which old-line country hero it 
was who first did the fetching, classic-sounding honky-tonk tune "If I Had a 
Dream." Ray Price? George Jones? The old Buckaroo? Nope: It's yet another 
winsome one from the Gaffer.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; FEES FOR FALSE ALARMS AT BUSINESSES ARE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to reduce the maximum charge for false burglary 
alarms at local businesses during a six-month trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was charging $300 for each false alarm after the fourth one in a 
year, but the council agreed to review the ordinance in September after 
business operators complained that the penalty was too high.Surveys showed that 
Long Beach's false-alarm fees have been higher than those of most other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new fee schedule, businesses will be charged $50 for the third false 
alarm, $75 for the fourth alarm, and $125 for every false alarm after that 
during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg said the new schedule is designed to encourage 
merchants to fix faulty burglar alarm systems as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fees will be reviewed in June. STEVE EAMES

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LAKEWOOD; NEW LAW FIRM HIRED IN NAVY HOSPITAL FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EAMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has hired a new law firm to help fight Long Beach's plan to 
turn the vacant Navy hospital into a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison & Foerster will replace Nossaman, Gunther, Knox & Elliot, which 
resigned in August, citing a conflict of interest with one of its business 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nossaman firm has not identified the client or the potential conflict. "We 
think they're obligated to tell us, but they haven't," Lakewood spokesman Don 
Waldie said. Attorney William Gunther, a partner in the firm, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison & Foerster was selected because it has considerable experience in 
dealing with potential uses for military bases that are either closed or facing 
closure, Waldie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm helped the city of Adelanto block a proposal for George Air Force 
Base and is advising Orange County on a plan to convert the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood, Hawaiian Gardens and several other nearby cities oppose Long Beach's 
plan to tear down the Navy hospital on Carson Street and build a 
1-million-square-foot "power center." These centers typically consist of 
high-volume retailers such as Costco, Price Club, Home Depot, Toys R Us, Office 
Depot and Staples. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach would reap all the benefits of a shopping center while neighboring 
cities would suffer from clogged streets, dirtier air and lost jobs, Lakewood 
officials say. Long Beach Councilman Alan S.Lowenthal said it is "the height of 
hypocrisy" for Lakewood to try to block a shopping center after luring Long 
Beach shoppers to the Lakewood Center mall for many years. STEVE EAMES

NEGOTIATING A NEW PLAYING FIELD; REPS. TORRES AND HORN SEE FORTUNES REVERSED AS 
GOP GRASPS POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 12 years, Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) climbed the ladder in the 
House of Representatives, capturing seats on plum committees and securing 
millions in funding for his working-class district. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach), on the other hand, is a newcomer who faced 
uphill battles during his first term, seeing some pet proposals die in a House 
dominated by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the GOP winning control of both sides of Congress for the first time 
in four decades, the tables are about to turn for these two representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Both lawmakers are waiting to see exactly how they will fare in the new 
political landscape that emerges when Congress reconvenes in January. For now, 
Torres and Horn are taking time to reflect on how their lives will change as 
Republicans grasp power, saddling Democrats with a new, weaker role as the 
minority party. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres readily acknowledges his imminent loss of power and says he will have a 
harder time bringing home funds for programs in his district. For his part, 
Horn plans to take advantage of the new GOP House majority and reintroduce 
proposed spending cuts rejected by Democrats last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition of liberal Democrats that helped bring Torres to power is 
crumbling. Although the veteran lawmaker should remain a powerful voice among 
his party in the House, his ability to craft legislation will be marginal, 
political observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres is expected to retain his seat on the coveted Appropriations Committee, 
which controls billions of dollars in spending, but his clout there is expected 
to diminish as Republicans assert control and set the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers, meanwhile, predict that one of Torres' beloved projects 
-- a multimillion-dollar consortium designed to help fund environmental cleanup 
-- could be in jeopardy at the hands of Republicans seeking to cut domestic 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres recognizes the coming changes and speaks of a more activist role, 
taking to the House floor to argue for votes that in years past he counted on 
without flexing a political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be an underdog," said Torres, 64, who was reelected to a seventh term 
this fall. "I will probably be more vociferous." 
</P>
<P>
 The highly regarded Torres is known in the House for his willingness to 
cooperate with colleagues of both parties, political experts say. Torres also 
enjoys the role of elder statesman among Latino representatives. To his staff, 
he is a sort of grandfather figure, and aides often refer to their boss by his 
initials, E.T. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres was elected to the House in 1982 in a heavily Latino and Democratic 
district newly drawn after the 1980 Census. He has not faced a serious 
challenge since then. The former assembly-line worker had spent most of the 
previous three decades involved in the United Auto Workers union, where he rose 
from a rank-and-file member to become a top official crafting the union's 
foreign-affairs program.  
</P>
<P>
 While in the House, Torres spent a decade on the Small Business and Banking 
committees. On Banking, the more powerful of the two, he wrote legislation to 
change credit reporting practices to protect a consumer's privacy and pushed 
another bill requiring banks to disclose information, such as interest rates 
for deposit accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Torres won a seat on the powerful Appropriations Committee and 
was named one of 14 deputy majority whips, a position he has used to deliver 
Democratic votes on key issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres has succeeded in bringing home millions of dollars for projects to his 
34th Congressional District, which stretches from East Los Angeles to Hacienda 
Heights, and includes Pico Rivera and Norwalk. The funds have paid for waste 
water treatment programs, financial counseling for low-income home buyers and 
job-training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a very good streak of delivering for my community because of the 
position I was in," Torres said. "It's going to be different (now). I'll be in 
a minority position. You don't have the benefit of dealing with a (committee) 
chairman from your own party." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Democrats across the board may find themselves fighting to retain 
their gains, as Republicans make good on campaign pledges to slash domestic 
spending. Political observers already have identified one of Torres' pet 
projects -- the North American Development Bank -- as an item that could wind 
up on the Republican chopping block. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank was established this year to help finance environmental cleanup 
projects -- such as sewage treatment -- along the U.S.-Mexico border and job 
programs for communities affected by the North American Free Trade Agreement 
with Mexico. The two countries each have pledged $225 million for the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres won the Clinton Administration's backing for the bank in exchange for 
his support of NAFTA, which was widely condemned by labor unions in this 
country. Torres, as a House whip, is credited with delivering key Democratic 
votes -- including several Latino representatives -- for NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "NADBank is on tenuous ground," said Fernando Guerra, an associate professor 
of political science at Loyola Marymount University. "They (Republicans) don't 
see any of their constituents benefiting by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' NAFTA vote hurt his relationship with labor leaders, but he says the 
development bank will provide funding for programs to retrain U.S. workers who 
lose their jobs as a result of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said he believes the bank enjoys support among Republicans who voted 
for NAFTA. "I think it would be ludicrous for business-minded Republicans to 
break it up because they say Esteban Torres is the father of NADBank," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Torres stands to suffer under the new House makeup, but Horn expects to 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 He will remain on two House committees -- Government Operations, and Public 
Works and Transportation -- and he plans to take a more active role now that 
the panels will be run by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to use his seat on Government Operations, for example, to launch 
investigations into the efficiency of public agencies, such as federal customs 
operations charged with intercepting drugs at border sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn also plans to reintroduce proposals to cut domestic spending and to 
reform campaign financing that he says were blocked by unyielding Democrats in 
the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a long list of priorities," said Horn, 63. "Democrats ran a very 
rigid system. It was a dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn displays a vast knowledge of national politics, the result of service in 
Washington since the late 1950s. He served first as a staffer to the secretary 
of labor in the Eisenhower Administration and later as a Senate aide. He has 
has written books on the Senate Appropriations Committee and on congressional 
ethics, and his conversations are peppered with detailed references to obscure 
government officials and laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The former political science professor, who spent 17 1/2 years as president of 
Cal State Long Beach, said he was not surprised by the recent GOP landslide. 
Democratic leaders, he said, had grown "arrogant" as the dominant party. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope if (Democrats) are ever in the majority again, they will be a little 
more humble," said Horn, whose 38th Congressional District stretches from Long 
Beach to Downey. "They treated Republicans like dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 During his first term, Horn experienced the frustrations that scores of House 
Republicans faced over the decades. He said that proposals he offered last year 
to cut federal spending were killed by the Democratic-controlled House Rules 
Committee, denying the measures a fair hearing on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Horn, a moderate who was recently reelected to a second term from a 
district dominated by Democratic voters, also sounded a note of conciliation. 
He said he looks forward to mounting the types of bipartisan coalitions that 
helped keep the Long Beach Naval shipyard off a federal closure list last year. 
The coalition brought together liberal and conservative members of California's 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'll have any problems with our colleagues from California," 
Horn said of relations in the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The shipyard could be a major issue in Horn's second term. The facility is 
once again being considered by Navy officials for closure. The Navy will make 
its recommendations in January to a federal base closure commission, which will 
make a decision later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers say Horn's district, home to defense contractors hit hard 
by military cutbacks, could benefit from the Republican shift in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be more money in the military pipeline," said Paul Schmidt, a 
political science professor at Cal State Long Beach. "The shipyard is in better 
hands now that Republicans control the Congress and now that a Republican is in 
the district. It can only help." 
</P>
<P>
 Although GOP congressional leaders are vowing to pursue a conservative agenda, 
Horn said he does not plan to follow the party line exclusively. Horn, who 
calls himself a "realist Republican," has in the past stressed his support for 
abortion rights and his disapproval of the military's ban on homosexuals. Steve

NEW SITE TO STORE TOXIC JET FUEL SOUGHT; MILITARY: LEGISLATOR AND NORWALK 
NEIGHBORS HAVE URGED THE PENTAGON TO CLOSE THE TANK FARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Defense Department is investigating alternatives to storing toxic jet fuel 
at a military supply depot near a residential neighborhood in Norwalk, a 
department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Adm. Edward M. Straw said defense representatives will ask operators of 
Los Angeles-area refineries if they would be willing to produce, store and 
transfer fuel. Straw revealed the inquiry in a letter to Rep. Esteban E. Torres 
(D-La Puente), who has urged the Pentagon to close the tank farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite pleas from neighbors, the Pentagon has resisted shutting down the 
Norwalk supply center, which is accessible to the Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline, a 
key delivery route to several military bases throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding oil companies to bid on the contract, however, could be difficult. 
"Our problem has been that refiners with access to the Santa Fe Pacific 
Pipeline have not offered to sell us enough jet fuel to meet our requirements 
without the use of Norwalk," Straw's letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Charles Gross, commander of a defense fuel supply facility in San 
Pedro, said the companies have been uninterested in the contract because it may 
not be as lucrative as other orders. Another official said crowded Los Angeles 
pumping stations would slow fuel shipments to the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Straw's correspondence came in response to a Torres letter in September asking 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry to replace the 50-acre facility at Norwalk 
Boulevard and Excelsior Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and city officials have argued for years that the fuel stored at the 
facility, which was built in the 1920s, poses health risks and has decreased 
nearby property values. The depot can store 36 million gallons of fuel.  
</P>
<P>
 The military has stated repeatedly that health risks are minimal to 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the negotiations with the refiners, defense officials said in a 
recent meeting with Torres, Norwalk city officials and residents that the 
department is stepping up efforts to decontaminate soil and ground water 
tainted by fuel leaks from the depot. 
</P>
<P>
 New soil-treatment systems will be in place by January and more advanced 
ground water treatment equipment will be installed in July, 1995.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WHITTIER; FACULTY HOME RENAMED AFTER GARRETT FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whittier College officials renamed a campus faculty home after the parents of 
a trustee who pledged a $1 million endowment to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony, the two-story Spanish-style home was named Garrett House after 
Orval and Mary Garrett , parents of trustee Roberta Garrett Veloz.The home, 
formerly known as Stauffer House, is next to Stauffer residence hall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in education and Whittier College is where I'm putting my money," 
said Veloz. "One of my dreams was to go there and get a college degree. My 
parents, through their love and encouragement, helped me get that degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Veloz, 58, is the president of the Valencia-based Aquafine Corp., which 
manufactures equipment for commercial water purification. She graduated from 
the college in 1957 with a degree in biology. Her parents owned an auto repair 
shop in Whittier and lived in the city from 1944-77. 
</P>
<P>
 The college hopes to use interest from the endowment to pay expenses for 
visiting government officials, artists and professors to stay at Garrett House 
and speak with students in the house and on campus. JOHN D. WAGNER

 The choir, which consists mostly of children from Long Beach public schools, 
was invited to the White House after coordinator Marcia Reed sent a letter to 
President Clinton offering to have the children perform. 
</P>
<P>
 A Long Beach institution for 37 years, the choir has toured nationally and 
throughout the world, but this will be its first appearance in Washington, Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's families will pay for the trip. To help defray expenses, the 
choir is holding fund-raisers and accepting donations. Contributions can be 
sent to the International Children's Choir of Long Beach, P.O. Box 13098, Long 
Beach, Calif. 90803. EMELYN CRUZ LAT

COMMUNITY NEWS: SIGNAL HILL; OIL CHANGE NO BARGAIN, COSTS CITY $15,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An oil change usually costs less than $30, but Signal Hill taxpayers recently 
shelled out $15,345 for one. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how much it cost the city to clean up after a man changed the oil in a 
friend's car while it was parked at the northeast corner of Hill Street and 
Walnut Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil flowed into a storm drain inlet at the intersection and spread to a 
rainwater detention basin at the northeast corner of Walnut and Pacific Coast 
Highway. It also got into another storm drain beyond that holding pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We caught him in the act," said Public Works Director Richard Lundahl. "His 
five quarts of oil caused a $15,000 problem." Police declined to identify the 
man, saying the incident is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city called in its hazardous waste cleanup contractor, Advanced Cleanup 
Technologies Inc. Workers flushed the storm drains and detention basin with 
water, pumped out the contaminated water and hauled it away for proper 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundahl said it's unlikely that the city will get any money out of the 
suspect, who is indigent. But the city is going after deeper pockets. It has 
billed the county government, arguing that the county's Flood Control District 
owns and is responsible for maintaining storm drains.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really fair for our taxpayers to bear this cost," Lundahl said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local high school and college students can earn a $750 scholarship by working 
at city businesses or at municipal offices under a new program called Whittier 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed recently to provide $25,000 to fund about 30 
scholarships to students who work at least 160 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Failla, city community services director, said students will work in a 
city department or local business that matches their interests. Students will 
also receive coaching on how to handle a job interview and how to prepare a 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing students, officials will consider teacher recommendations, but 
will not necessarily select those with the highest grades. City officials are 
encouraging applications from students in trade and vocational schools as well 
as those studying at junior colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Whittier residents are eligible. Forms are available at Whittier High 
School and at City Hall. For information: (310) 945-8210. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COVERS STORY; 'CRISIS SITUATION'; LONG BEACH GRAPPLES WITH A HOMELESS DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Placing the blame is pointless. Developing solutions is urgent."  
</P>
<P>
 Chairwoman's introduction, Long Beach task force on the homeless, November, 
1987 
</P>
<P>
 No one said it would be easy. But even today, after many years of struggling 
to get Long Beach to help its homeless, Elizabeth Moore can't believe the 
state's fifth-largest city offers so little to those whose address is the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am shocked. I thought by now we would be running, and sometimes I feel we 
are still crawling," says Moore, head of the mayor's advisory committee on 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Moore says, this isn't an issue that cropped up overnight. Seven 
years ago, city officials saw enough of a problem to convene a citizens' task 
force to assess the extent of homelessness in Long Beach and recommend 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the problem of people without shelter insignificant -- by many 
accounts, on any given day there are about 3,000 homeless in Long Beach, and 
the number could be 5,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with such numbers, many contend that Long Beach has done little to 
reduce the ranks of its homeless or -- at minimum -- make them as comfortable 
as possible with temporary shelters, meals and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Long Beach) treats its homeless residents poorly because we tend to respond 
to crisis situations," says City Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal. "And although 
there is a kind of chronic homeless problem in the city, it is not boiling over 
to the point where people are feeling compelled to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Moore put it: "We have a problem, but our city doesn't recognize it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials, of course, dispute that charge. "I don't believe any city in 
America can take care of the problem of the homeless. The best they can do is 
put a Band-Aid on it," says City Manager James C. Hankla. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other Long Beach officials, Hankla says dealing with homelessness is 
primarily the duty of federal, state and county governments. "I think the city 
is doing everything it is charged with under the law," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if that is true, it is not enough, Moore and others contend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they (city officials) could do far more if they wanted to, far more 
than what they're doing," Moore says. "They talk about it. They may come to 
(community) meetings, make some promises. But as far as really doing something 
. . . they are not doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Edwards' body, like his clothing, is crunched together as he panhandles 
-- cup in hand -- outside Long Beach City Hall. The Civic Center is where he 
spends his days. The nearby parks, his nights. Those nights when he isn't in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sleeping outside the courthouse and they ran me off. They said I 
couldn't sleep there," he says. "But if you're homeless you gotta sleep 
somewhere. . . . I can't walk all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither can Jerry Adams, who says Long Beach authorities routinely sweep the 
homeless from parks to the streets. "They let you get comfortable in a spot for 
a couple weeks. Then as soon as everybody is (comfortable), they sweep you 
out," Adams says. "They tell you they have a curfew . . ., (but) I think I have 
rights, don't I? I'm 40 years old. They don't have curfews for 40-year-olds, do 
they?" 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' remark is typical of the banter in and outside the Christian Outreach 
Appeal hall, a nonprofit downtown way station for the homeless. It is, those at 
the hall say, the only place in town where they can get a shower. And it is one 
of the few locations -- another is the nonprofit ALPHA Project -- that do what 
they can to help homeless people find food, shelter, employment and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of cities, a lot of them smaller than Long Beach, have a lot better 
programs," says Donald Sims, a homeless activist who over the years has 
repeatedly challenged the city's policies in council sessions and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach has a history, as well as a current policy, of hostility toward 
the homeless," charges Dennis Rockway, an attorney with the Legal Aid 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of Long Beach's efforts, of course, is not universal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 report for the Los Angeles Homelessness Project, based in the 
geography department at the University of Southern California, professors Robin 
M. Law and Jennifer R. Wolch credited Long Beach with being one of only three 
cities in Southern California to develop specific "Homelessness Policy" 
statements and one of only four to spend any significant amount on programs and 
services for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sheila Pagnani, the widely praised former director of Long Beach's 
homeless program, insists that criticism of the city's commitment is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud of . . . the city of Long Beach," said Pagnani, who is 
credited even by the city's critics with pushing Long Beach to at least 
acknowledge its homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Pagnani says, the city's department heads deserve credit for 
trying to reconcile the needs of the homeless with the realities of City Hall, 
including its budget. "They understand very clearly the need to provide 
programs for the homeless and at the same time understand the problems the city 
has (financially). . . . You just can't turn things around that quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Rockway and others who have monitored homeless programs statewide 
say Long Beach has provided lip service rather than real programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockway notes that San Jose and Long Beach both appointed citizen task forces 
in January, 1987, to study the problem of homelessness. Since then, he says, 
Long Beach has hired a homeless coordinator and discussed various steps but has 
yet to set aside local funds for a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, San Jose has spent more than $7 million to assist five new 
shelters, its Redevelopment Agency has contributed another $11.6 million to 
relocate a rescue mission, and a $1.9-million fund has been established for 
various housing and homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach officials say they do not know how much they spend annually on 
services for the homeless. The USC report estimated $288,000 in 1992 but said 
most of it was federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 Says San Jose Housing Director Alex Sanchez: "We've been able to manage our 
problem. We don't have the resources to solve homelessness . . . (but) we have 
accepted our responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In its defense, Long Beach does not have as large a problem as San Jose, where 
estimates of the homeless population have reached as high as 18,000. Nor does 
it have the tax base of San Jose, which is part of Santa Clara County, the 
nation's second highest in median household income. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, critics of Long Beach say it is not just a matter of numbers. It is, 
they say, a matter of tackling a problem with far-reaching consequences, many 
of them economic. 
</P>
<P>
 As the homeless move along the city's streets, clustering in parks or older 
neighborhoods just outside the central business district, they are a constant 
reminder of the problem, activists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost a disgrace. We don't even know the number on the streets," Moore 
says. "Before, it used to be a handful (of homeless) here and handful there. 
Now it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without specifically commenting on the approach of Long Beach or other cities, 
San Jose's Sanchez says his city confronted the homeless problem because there 
was no way to escape it. "The homeless problem was concentrated downtown and 
was a very visible situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he said, the city's business leaders joined with local agencies 
when it became clear that the homeless problem would not disappear. "They 
wanted to secure their buildings. They had fires. They had human waste. So they 
wanted to do something, and they knew it was more than just calling the 
police," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a coordinated approach is something that has been discussed countless 
times over the years in Long Beach. But, to date, little has been done, 
according to the city's own figures and those of people who have monitored the 
problem. Consider the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Worried about attracting clusters of homeless to the civic center, Long 
Beach officials have blocked proposals to allow new single-room occupancy 
hotels, particularly downtown, despite the success of such hotels in providing 
at least temporary housing in San Diego, Los Angeles and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than five years of discussion over building a multi-service center have 
yet to produce a facility where homeless people can receive food and housing 
vouchers, job counseling and other services. And although pending federal 
Housing and Urban Development funds may finally result in such a facility, city 
officials intend to locate it on Terminal Island -- a remote, industrial site 
-- because council members want it far from residential and commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * After city officials reportedly tried to block the transfer of 208 units of 
former Navy housing for temporary shelter, the plan is now up in the air for a 
different reason: internal bickering among nonprofit agencies negotiating for 
the site with the federal government. "Our fear is that one of the keystone 
pieces of service to the homeless may become lost," says the Rev. Kit Wilkie, 
associate pastor of the First Congregational Church and chairman of the Long 
Beach Area Homeless Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city was very reluctant to admit the homeless even had a right to apply 
for that . . . housing," adds Joanne O'Byrne, president of Long Beach Area 
Citizens Involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the city's reluctance to act has been apparent to many, 
including its own homeless task force. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is clear is that other large cities, including Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, spend many more times the funds than does Long Beach for the 
provision of direct emergency services to the homeless. Even Santa Monica, with 
a population of approximately one-quarter the size of Long Beach, currently 
spends over four times as much for direct, emergency services to the homeless 
as does Long Beach," the homeless committee wrote back in 1987, a finding that 
many say is still accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most significantly, critics say, Long Beach has lacked an agenda, progressive 
or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials "walk a fine line between doing something and doing nothing," 
says Bob Erlenbusch,director of the Los Angeles Coalition to End Homelessness, 
a nonprofit public education and advocacy coalition. The city "doesn't have a 
reputation . . . of being a community aggressively trying to find solutions to 
homeless problems. But they also haven't gone down the road of punitive and 
vindictive measures as other communities have." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. Santa Monica may once have been dubbed "the home of the 
homeless," but today it has taken as hard a view on homelessness as any city 
around. Closing public parks at night is only one of several get-tough measures 
enacted by its council. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, by contrast, has never been as tough as some other cities, though 
some critics say that is only because officials have been blocked from enacting 
punitive measures. "I think they would have liked to, but the (homeless 
advocacy) agencies have probably kept the city from overreacting," says Jack 
Jinsen, a longtime homeless advocate and former director of Christian Outreach 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jinsen is one of many homeless advocates in Long Beach who have seen programs 
with support suddenly wither, the victims of political forces as relentless as 
trade winds in this seaside city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it is residents who don't want programs or shelters in their midst. 
Other times it is business leaders who remind the city that companies -- and 
tourists -- aren't likely to come to a city where the homeless roam the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the forces at any given time, they have combined over the years to 
quash many a program and frustrate activists inside and outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And that was to be expected, said Pam Briley, a local real estate broker who 
has sought to bring a reality check to discussions of the homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two groups we need to have here are the business groups and community 
organizations," Briley said during a recent meeting of homeless advocates. The 
homeowner groups, she said, must be shown that providing certain programs will 
help get some of the homeless off the streets. And businesses, Briley said, 
cannot be expected to take it on faith that their contributions of time and 
money will help commerce as well as the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business people have to have a reason to do anything," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new mayor, Beverly O'Neill, some advocates for the homeless think Long 
Beach may finally move toward more assistance, if not significant new programs. 
"I do feel we have the ear of our newly elected mayor," said Moore, the 
homeless advisory committee chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials continue to point out that the time and money spent 
tackling the problem of homelessness could divert attention from other programs 
and services that are more directly a city's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe any city in America can take care of the problem of the 
homeless," says City Manager Hankla. "And from my perspective, we are doing 
more and more and more of the work of other government (entities)," such as the 
state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem of the homeless is a problem of the economy, and I believe the 
federal government needs to be more responsible," Hankla says. "I also believe 
the problem of homeless (with) mental illness is a state problem, and the 
decision by the state to close mental hospitals has been a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Former homeless director Pagnani says that attacking the city's problem will 
take more money, but that funding alone is not the answer. "This is not a 
problem that is going to be solved with money, because there has been a lot of 
money poured into it (nationally)," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And although emergency shelters and cold-weather shelters do save lives, 
Pagnani says: "They are Band-Aids. They just keep human misery from being more 
miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, homeless advocates say, a commitment to reduce misery -- rather 
than just hoping it will go away -- would be progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeless people have to go somewhere," Rockway says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Van Lofton, 31, has spent the past year moving from New York to Chicago 
and now to Long Beach. This town is friendlier than Chicago, he says, but it 
doesn't offer the food, shelter or other services -- such as public transit -- 
that New York does. "There's a whole lot more to eat there. . . . All the 
leftovers from restaurants are found in separate bins," for the homeless, Van 
Lofton says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, he says, you never find those sorts of acknowledgments that the 
homeless are part of the landscape. And if you venture outside the poorer areas 
of town, as Van Lofton and others without shelter sometimes do, you are sure to 
get stopped, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police here will follow you. You walk around Belmont Shore or some place 
like that and you will get dogged. They will sweat you," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As if doing so, he says, will somehow erase the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more they want to hide from it, it just seems there are more homeless," 
Van Lofton says. "I don't know what causes that, but I think the more that 
people don't want to deal with a problem, the worse it gets."

 La Mirada High cruised to a 24-0 victory over University High of Irvine in the 
first round of the Southern Section Division VIII football playoffs to improve 
to 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadores' bid for an undefeated season, however, was in jeopardy off the 
field when the Southern Section was notified of a possible ineligible transfer 
player hours before Friday's kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner's office allowed the game to be played because of the short 
notice. On Saturday, La Mirada was forced to forfeit 10 victories and the 
Suburban League title after a vote of league principals but was allowed to 
continue in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 University administrators challenged the decision to allow La Mirada to remain 
in the playoffs. But at an appeal hearing Tuesday, Commissioner Dean Crowley 
said the section determined that the player in question was eligible and La 
Mirada would not have to forfeit its victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't sleep much over those three days," La Mirada Coach John Mele said. 
"The kids took it well. The bottom line is we won on the field. We built a good 
case and found out we were OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadores will play host to Duarte (6-4-1) in a quarterfinal game Friday. 
La Mirada defeated the Falcons, 49-8, in the third week of the season. FAMILY 
AFFAIR 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier's 36-35 double-overtime victory over Walnut advanced the Cardinals 
(6-5) to the Division VI quarterfinals against Rancho Cucamonga Friday at 
California High. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Maldonado connected with Alex Muro for a two-point conversion on a fake 
extra-point to give Whittier the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 After Walnut had taken a 35-28 lead in the second overtime, Maldonado, who 
caught a four-yard touchdown pass in the first overtime, scored on a one-yard 
run to bring Whittier to within, 35-34. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Coach Walter Scott, not wanting to allow Walnut's offense another 
opportunity, elected to go for the fake extra-point even though the Cardinals 
had not run the play this season. The teams were tied, 21-21, at the end of 
regulation. Each team had four plays to score from the 10-yard line in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want to go back out on defense again," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also gave Michael Jones bragging rights over brother, Richard. 
Michael, 23, coaches the linemen at Whittier. Richard, 18, is the line coach at 
Walnut. PLAYOFF PAIRINGS 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada and Whittier were among 17 Southeast-Long Beach high school football 
teams that began playoff competition last week. Eleven advanced to this week's 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly (10-1) and South Gate (10-1) have the toughest draws. Poly 
faces Los Alamitos (11-0) in a Division I game at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins defeated St. John Bosco, 37-22, to tie the Southern Section 
record of 46 games without a loss held by Temple City (1963-71) and Canyon 
Country Canyon (1983-86). 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate played host to defending City 4-A champion Carson (3-8), which 
forfeited three games because of an ineligible player.

 The Millikan High girls' volleyball team battled adversity to reach the 
Division II final. Bishop Montgomery did the same in a 10-15, 9-15, 15-13, 
15-9, 15-10 victory over Millikan Saturday at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 Millikan was a point away from elimination in a quarterfinal victory against 
La Habra but rallied for a five-game win. The Rams came back to defeat 
Harvard-Westlake in four games after losing the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the first two games Saturday, Millikan was on the verge of a 
sweep, leading, 13-12, in the third game. Bishop Montgomery (22-3), though, 
rallied for three consecutive points and went on to win its second Southern 
Section title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played better but we weren't making the adjustments," Millikan middle 
blocker Hilary Gunsaulus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunsaulus had 27 kills and Kristian Wintrich had 21 kills and 22 digs. Dana 
Crutchfield added 20 kills for top-seeded Millikan, which had defeated Bishop 
Montgomery in the Torrey Pines tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played much better teams than that," said Millikan setter Melissa 
Haugen, who had 66 assists. "La Habra was 10 times better. I think the fact 
that they lost the first two games, we took the third lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat did little to help the Rams' placement in the Southern California 
Regional Division I playoffs. Millikan (16-4) drew top-seeded Newport Harbor 
(30-1) in the first round and lost, 10-15, 15-5, 15-4, 15-8, Tuesday despite 19 
kills by Gunsaulus. COMMUNITY COLLEGES

</P>
<P>
 Jaime Ramirez had three goals and Todd Putren had 10 saves for Long Beach 
(25-5-1), which defeated Modesto, 24-9, and Citrus, 12-11, to reach the final.

 Putren, Stalin Reyes and Juan Carlos Martinez of Long Beach were selected to 
the All-Southern California first team. Ramirez was named to the second team.

CHINESE FEAST ON HOLIDAY DINNER; THANKSGIVING: EXCHANGE STUDENTS ARE PUZZLED BY 
CRANBERRIES, BUT ENJOY SPECIAL MEAL SERVED AT A CHURCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The woks sizzled as cooks stir-fried corn and carrots in the parish kitchen 
Friday night. Volunteers scooped the vegetables onto paper plates with a 
generous serving of pork-fried rice and a steaming bowl of winter melon soup to 
round out the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there were turkey and cranberries. After all, this was a 
traditional Thanksgiving dinner, even if it came a day late. 
</P>
<P>
 For their first Thanksgiving meal, 74 Chinese exchange students and their 
eight teachers feasted on almost-typical holiday fare. Though many of them had 
never eaten turkey before, and the cranberries seemed to mystify them, there 
were few leftovers. Hungry junior high schoolers don't leave many scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, part of the first large-scale exchange program between mainland 
China and the Los Angeles Unified School District, were the guests of the 
Chinese Christian Alliance Church in Northridge, whose members hoped the dinner 
would help the children understand the importance of Thanksgiving in the Unites 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to tell them the meaning of Thanksgiving," said pastor Fred D. Khong. 
"We come together once a year to give thanks to God. Everything we have we owe 
to the creator." 
</P>
<P>
 The meal came only four days after one of the students, Bin-Feng Zheng, 12, 
was killed after being struck by a car while crossing a street outside his 
Woodland Hills apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Khong saw the dinner as an opportunity to reach out to the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy has happened and we'll try to help them," said Khong. "They're 
all asking about life and death. We will gather in groups after dinner to help 
them see the meaning of life. But we will not focus on the tragedy. The focus 
tonight is on the meaning of Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
 After a dessert of raspberry-swirl ice cream and an Oreo cookie, the children 
watched as Khong, Esther Wong and the Rev. Andy Ching acted in a brief skit 
that explained the history of Thanksgiving celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Khong played the part of a journalist interviewing two pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did you come to this country?" Khong asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in search of religious freedom," replied Ching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did you get your food?" Khong queried. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Indians offered us roast turkey and corn," answered Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very interesting holiday," said Sun Yi Qian, who also goes by the 
nickname Marty. "There is no such holiday in China. This is the first time I've 
tasted turkey and it's quite tasty." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is a similar but more boisterous celebration during the Chinese 
New Year, when family members come together for feasts and parties. "It's an 
opportunity for family reunion and to share the happiness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the spirit of the American holiday, Yi Qian said he, too, had many 
things to be thankful for, including his parents, whom he hoped to make proud, 
and the opportunity to learn about American traditions while studying in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousins Chu Ching Bing and Chu Jer Bing, who have adopted the names John and 
Fred, respectively, were busy trying to translate the names of the Thanksgiving 
dishes into Chinese on their pocket-sized electronic translator. On either side 
of the tiny device's screen, Chinese and English characters spelled out 
"cranberries." 
</P>
<P>
 At the press of a button, the computer burped out the English pronunciation, 
which the boys quickly and adroitly mimicked. 
</P>
<P>
 After games of Simon Says and Pictionary, the students gathered in the church 
to sing "A Turkey Song:" 
</P>
<P>
 "If God can love a turkey, God can love you," they sang. "You are a turkey, 
but I am one, too."

 A look at the array of problems for Jeffrey Sudikoff since he and partner 
Joseph Cohen bought a 72% stake in the Kings for $60 million in May. 
</P>
<P>
 - Team president Bruce McNall is going to plead guilty to federal charges that 
he defrauded banks for more than $236 million. 
</P>
<P>
 - In June, the stock in Sudikoff's company, IDB, plummeted 51% after its 
longtime auditors abruptly resigned in a dispute over a first-quarter earnings 
report. Then Cohen noted that the Kings' fortunes "don't rise and fall with IDB 
stock." 
</P>
<P>
 - Finally, Sudikoff has yet to see a regular-season game since he purchased 
the team because of the NHL owners' lockout, now in its 55th day. LISA DILLMAN

OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time league champions, (who tied Valencia for the title last year) 
were depleted by graduation. But a 19-8 summer league record has Walin thinking 
he might not have to rebuild after all. "I didn't know what to think before we 
started," Walin said, "but we played extremely well defensively. It showed we 
had 10 kids we could play." A couple of those are McKinney, a transfer from 
Savanna whom Walin described as "a good athlete," and Todd Jones, who missed 
the summer with a broken wrist but is ready. Like other teams in the Orange 
League, the Sentinels are not overly tall so they will depend on quickness. 
Magnolia will find out early how good it is, playing in three tournaments 
during December. But Walin is optimistic about the prospects. "Our athletic 
ability has gone from way down to the top. We may struggle shooting now and 
then, and may not beat the top teams, but I think we can beat everybody else. I 
still think we have a shot to win three times." SCHEDULE
