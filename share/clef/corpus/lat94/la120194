 NO CHAINS: Some residents of the Ojai Valley, wedded to the community's 
quaintness, would prefer not to see any chain franchises move in. The latest 
skirmish in the war against the big guys: a citizen-led effort to keep out a 
Pay Less drugstore (B1). . . . Other communities that initially opposed 
fast-food chains have decided they could stomach them -- if they were disguised 
to blend with the town's architecture. 
</P>

 BEASTS OF BURDEN: Llama, peafowl, pygmy goat -- which ranks higher in the 
animal kingdom? Looking to simplify zoning laws, county officials are 
considering revising a system that rates domestic and other animals. . . . Cows 
and horses would each be one whole "animal unit factor." Dogs and cats would 
account for a quarter-unit, a hog a half-unit, and a gerbil just one 
one-hundredth of a unit. Based on noise, roosters are higher in the pecking 
order than hens. "You can bet we get a lot more complaints about roosters," 
said county senior planner Carl Morehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 KEEPING IT WILD: The Sespe Wilderness -- rugged, unspoiled, stunningly 
beautiful -- looks for the most part today as it did thousands of years ago 
when the Chumash lived there (Ventura County Life, Page 10). . . . Now, the 
220,500-acre expanse of Los Padres National Forest is federally protected from 
development. For trekkers making the tough sojourn into the interior, the 
panoramic vistas are ample reward. "It's like riding into a dream," said Tony 
Alvis, who leads horseback tours of Los Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 SIMI HOOPS -- When it comes to basketball, Simi Valley High School has its 
share of stars -- past and present. . . . This year, forward Tawnee Cooper is 
working toward a college scholarship (C10). Talent helps -- as does a 3.4 
grade-point average. . . . And former Simi basketball Coach Bob Hawking now 
heads Cal State Fullerton's NCAA Division I program (C10). "I decided I wanted 
to do something different," said the Simi Valley resident, who commutes to 
Fullerton.

 "The 12 Ears of Christmas"Local outlets of The Museum Company are offering a 
variation on the pin-the-tail-on-the donkey game -- a self-portrait of a famous 
painter, minus his ear. Yes, you pin an ear on Vincent Van Gogh. Cost is $14.95 
-- "complete with 12 reusable ears."

 Have a Nixon Christmas!We hope you haven't already sat on Santa's knee, 
because the Nixon Christmas Gift Catalogue is being unveiled on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the goodies available at the Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda 
will be the book "The Day Elvis Met Nixon," by former aide Egil (Bud) Krogh, 
which recounts the historic Dec. 21, 1970, summit between the President and the 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 Krogh reveals that the singer showed up at the White House with what he 
described as a "personal gift" for Nixon. He was asked to surrender the gift at 
the door. It was a gun, a chrome-plated Colt .45. The Presley piece is now on 
display -- but not for sale -- at the Nixon library. 
</P>
<P>
 A never-say-die attitude: Incidentally, more than seven months after Nixon's 
death, the library gift shop still has plenty of those T-shirts that proclaim, 
"Nixon in '96 -- Tan, Rested & Ready." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A gift suggestion for Queen Elizabeth: "We were pleased when the American 
Diabetes Assn. awarded certification to Cigna Health Care's educational 
program, 'Successful Living With Diabetes,' " writes Cigna's Dr. David Lewis 
Geffner of L.A. But, he adds, "we did not know that we would also be required 
to educate Prince Charles until we received this recent mailing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was addressed to: 
</P>
<P>
 "Successful Living with Di."

 List of the day: Some more sharp observations about L.A. from "ANGLAFILE -- A 
Guide to the Best of British in Los Angeles," by Arnold and Isolde Schwartzman. 
</P>
<P>
 * "This den of thieves is situated . . . in one of the loveliest and most 
fertile districts of California." (Sir George Simpson, on a visit in 1842.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "I stopped there on my way to India, and because of inertia and apathy 
remained." (Author Aldous Huxley) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Darling, there seems to be an American on your lawn." (Actor Robert Coote 
to his hostess, Gladys Cooper, at a gathering of Brits in Hollywood.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "The railway have offered me a special train and private car to go down the 
coast to Los Angeles, a sort of Naples here." (Author Oscar Wilde) 
</P>
<P>
 Wilde actually uttered his most memorable line upon his arrival in this 
country. He told a U.S. Customs officer: "I have nothing to declare except my 
genius." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, but how well would he have played pin-the-ear-on-Van Gogh? miscelLAny 
David Shepard figures the gendarmes would have to arm themselves with radar 
guns if they ever tried to monitor the vehicular traffic on one stretch of 
192nd Street in Carson (see photo). We wonder how often the skid marks in the 
area have to be cleaned up.

SCOTT HARRIS: A JAILED DAD STILL LEARNING THE HARD WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The call came from jail. It was Hank again, explaining how he'd been screwed 
by the system. How often, he asks, does a guy get a year for forgetting to 
buckle his child's seat belt? 
</P>
<P>
 "Child endangerment" wasn't the only charge, but it was the heaviest. 
"Hit-and-run driving" sounds serious, but this was a technical matter. You see, 
on that June day when Hank rammed his '77 Chevy Caprice into the other guy's 
rear bumper, the parties dutifully exchanged the usual information, with one 
exception: Hank showed the other guy a bogus driver's license. Hank, 43, is 
quick to point out the only inaccuracy on this I.D. is the first name. It says 
Mark, which is the name of Hank's 6-year-old son, the boy who was hurt in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact propelled Mark face first into either the windshield (the D.A.'s 
version) or the dashboard (Hank's). Fortunately, his injuries were limited to 
the premature loss of two baby teeth and minor cuts to his mouth. All told, it 
could have been much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hank is serving time more commonly reserved for thugs and thieves, and 
it raises obvious questions. Can the criminal justice system make people better 
parents? By punishing their dad, are courts also punishing Mark and his 
12-year-old sister, Anna? Hank may be far from a perfect dad, but he has had 
legal custody the past year. Now the kids are with their imperfect mom, Julie. 
She's done jail time too -- for drunk driving with Anna and Mark in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Full disclosure: Hank is an acquaintance -- a softball teammate. Built like a 
beer keg, he swings a mean bat but isn't too swift on the base paths. I should 
also point out that pseudonyms are being used here, in deference to Julie's 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank and Julie have been together, on and off, for 15 rocky years. Both kids 
were born before the parents married, and Julie's drinking was a factor in 
their divorce last year. Julie is blunt about her problem, but the last time we 
talked, she assured me she's sober now: "I'm being the good mom for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 Hank is one of those guys who tries to cover up his mistakes by making two or 
three more. Oh, what a tangled web he weaves. In Hank's world, a phony driver's 
license is the kind of little white lie that demonstrates fatherly devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 How he conned the DMV is easy to explain: Hank simply took Mark's birth 
certificate and folded it repeatedly to make it look old. Then he removed the 
corner that showed the date of birth. The clerk let it slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Hank got the license is a more convoluted tale. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, Hank is a handyman who hasn't had steady work in years. To save 
money, he didn't pay for auto insurance. An earlier accident resulted in his 
license being suspended. Hank says he obtained the fake license not so much to 
drive, but to establish a new line of credit. He needed credit to rent a new 
place for him and the kids. And why did he need a new home? Because in March, a 
fire destroyed their apartment and all their belongings. It's been a rough year 
-- and, in case you're wondering, nobody's been arrested for arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Corum was the deputy public defender who was assigned the case 
concerning the accident that injured Mark. Hank, he says, proved to be his own 
worst enemy. "If I live to be 150," Corum says, "I will never forget this case. 
I wanted to grab him by the lapels and shake him. He just wouldn't listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, Hank could have settled matters by paying a $100 fine plus penalty 
assessments. Overloaded with serious offenders, authorities regarded Hank's 
sins as a minor matter. Hank ignored Corum's advice, figuring that at worst he 
might do a few days in jail. He told me he couldn't afford the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In trial court, a new prosecutor reviewed the police report and added the 
child endangerment and hit-and-run charges. To Corum's dismay, Hank turned down 
a plea bargain of 60 days -- or about 30 with time off for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Hank thought he could con the court, because he told Judge Gregg Marcus 
the driver's license wasn't a fraud; he borrowed his brother's legitimate 
license. Only when the judge suggested he'd like to meet Hank's brother did 
Hank admit the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also noted that, in addition to everything else, Hank was on 
probation for vandalism when he obtained the bogus license. (Hank, in a dispute 
over a parking space with his landlord, broke a gate at the apartment complex.) 
In the end, it was the judge, not the prosecutor, who decided that a guilty 
plea would earn Hank a year's sentence, versus a potential three-year sentence 
if convicted on all counts. Finally, Hank accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days ago, Corum asked Judge Marcus to grant Hank a hardship 
release because Julie is drinking again. The judge refused. 
</P>
<P>
 My sincere hope is that this was just another of Hank's deceptions. On 
Wednesday, I called Julie to ask her directly if she was still sober. I called 
four times, but nobody answered.

INTELLIGENCE AND SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The debate over "The Bell Curve" continues on your editorial pages, but I have 
yet to hear or read of anyone challenging some unstated premises: Intelligence 
equals success and success equals wealth. How many intelligent people would be 
successful if "cunning" were filtered out of their personalities? Is 
intelligence at the top of the list of most admired virtues? Why, because it 
creates wealth? If the goal were to develop a happier and wiser society, would 
intelligence be vying for the top spot with wisdom, honesty and compassion?

NATO: CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED?; THE U.S. ROLE SEEMS MORE UNCERTAIN AS BOSNIA 
TOTTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why has the apparently imminent collapse of Bosnia-Herzegovina precipitated a 
crisis in the life of NATO? NATO was not brought into existence to settle 
disputes in the Balkans. Poorly as NATO may have functioned in attempting to 
restore peace there, any question about the continuing utility of the alliance 
would seem to require a broader frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet local events do sometimes force more-than-local questions. When the Soviet 
Union began the Berlin blockade in 1948, many in the United States did not 
believe that rescuing a recent enemy's ruined capital was in the American 
interest. But the blockade and the ensuing Berlin Airlift helped force a larger 
question: NATO was founded in the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 THE NEW 'BERLIN': The Balkans war is the Berlin blockade of the post-Cold War 
era. It has been clear since the failed Russian coup of 1991 that with the 
Soviet threat gone, NATO would need a new rationale. But what should it be? 
</P>
<P>
 A security insurance policy? Russia and Ukraine could conceivably reunite and, 
if an expansionistic faction came to power, threaten Western Europe. Were that 
to happen, American assistance might again be required. A Soviet Union redux 
would, however, almost certainly turn its aggressive sights first to its lost 
empire in Central Asia rather than to Eastern, much less Western, Europe. The 
likelihood of any sudden march to the Atlantic is so remote that even if NATO 
were completely dismantled, a semblance of it could be mustered in time to meet 
a worst-case return of Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
 European security will be threatened in the years ahead far less by 
neo-Stalinism than by smaller disputes across state borders and among national 
groups within states. Hungary is angry about the treatment of Hungarians in 
Romania and Serbia. Slovakia has quarrels with Hungary. Ethnic Germans in 
Poland are not as submissive as they once were. And the threat of illegal 
immigration has created new concerns everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 How will the Western European leadership respond to this set of threats, and 
as it responds will it require or wish any American assistance? If collective 
security in Western Europe is defined to the virtual exclusion of Eastern 
Europe, if only the internal security problems of Western Europe are on the 
table, there would seem to be no call whatever for American participation. If, 
however, Western Europe intends to assume a measure of responsibility for 
security in Eastern Europe, then a role for the United States is more easily 
imagined. But what kind of role? When the question of NATO is posed in this 
way, the legitimacy of the Balkans war as a forcing of the question is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 American isolationists cry that Western Europe can do whatever must be done in 
Eastern Europe without American help. American internationalists maintain that, 
given the burdens that the United States must bear alone in Korea and the 
Middle East, Western Europe should at least pay most of the cost of Eastern 
European security. Most important, perhaps, Americans of every political view 
have begun to wonder what Western Europe really wants. 
</P>
<P>
 A SCATTERED EUROPE: France has seemed eager to create a purely European 
alternative to NATO. Germany lies low but may believe that it will emerge 
strongest should NATO be phased out. Britain, strengthened hitherto by its 
special relationship with the United States, would seem to have most to lose, 
but even London has lately seemed irritably ambivalent about the proper role of 
the United States in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 As NATO meets in Brussels this week and as the Conference for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe meets in Budapest starting today, these are questions 
that can no longer be avoided. Whether and how they are addressed may well 
determine whether the breakup of Bosnia will prove to be the prelude to a 
larger transatlantic divorce.

A SLEDGEHAMMER TO SWAT A FLY; COURT SHOULD REJECT RULE CURBING LAWYERS' 
COMMENTS ABOUT PENDING TRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Bar, at the direction of the Legislature, is trying to fix a problem 
that occurs so infrequently that it may be best left unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Motivated by what he considers "the staggering excesses of lawyers and 
witnesses in the O. J. Simpson criminal case," state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp 
(I-San Francisco) authored a bill last summer requiring the State Bar to draft 
a trial publicity regulation governing lawyers in criminal and civil cases. The 
bill passed the Legislature without a dissenting vote and was signed by Gov. 
Pete Wilson in September. 
</P>
<P>
 In its current draft form, the rule severely limits what lawyers may say 
outside the courtroom about a pending case without running afoul of the bar's 
code of professional conduct. It would forbid statements that have a 
"substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing" a case. The proposed rule is 
similar to one adopted by the American Bar Assn. in 1983 and implemented in 32 
states so far -- though not in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Kopp's legislation requires the bar to submit its rule to the California 
Supreme Court, the final authority on lawyer disciplinary rules in the state, 
by March 1. The justices can approve the draft regulation, modify it or reject 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 We urge rejection. Have there been excesses in the Simpson case? Absolutely. 
We agree with Kopp that some lawyers have not covered themselves or their 
profession with glory in this case. But even so, is this rule the answer? We 
think not. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 1 million cases filed in California's trial courts during the 
last fiscal year, a mere handful attracted public notice. And only a 
microscopic fraction of those generated the sort of attorney grandstanding over 
which Kopp is righteously angry.  
</P>
<P>
 The heated nature of high-publicity cases means there is little reason to 
think that gagging lawyers would eliminate risk to Sixth Amendment guarantees 
of a fair trial. If adopted by the Supreme Court, the rule would indeed temper 
public statements by attorneys. But what about comments by the litigants 
themselves? By family members, friends or enemies? The proposed rule does not 
restrain these individuals, nor could it without infringing on their First 
Amendment rights. And such a prohibition is unlikely to curb leaks to the press 
by lawyers or their surrogates. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, after the first of two public hearings, State Bar officials 
appeared to be moving away from the strict language of the draft rule and 
toward a more flexible standard. But no rule at all makes even more sense.

FORWARD STRIDE FOR CAMPAIGN INTEGRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout American history, election politicking often has proved to be more 
like mud wrestling than civics class. The foul aftertaste seems especially 
strong this year. Now a timely California Supreme Court decision involving a 
Santa Ana municipal election in 1988 arrives to encourage efforts to hold 
candidates and campaign committees accountable in an increasingly nasty 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Joyce Luther Kennard upheld the 
constitutionality of a state political reform law requiring candidates' 
campaign organizations to identify themselves in mailers. She found that voters 
reading literature mailed on behalf of a City Council candidate (who went on to 
win the race) could have been misled because at least one mailing was issued 
under the name of a neighborhood association, not under his name or the name of 
his campaign organization. 
</P>
<P>
 That the true sources of political mailings might not be what they appear to 
be is itself a commentary on the topsy-turvy state of politicking. Foul is fair 
and fair is foul. Perhaps the most dramatic example of confusion in 
California's 1994 election cycle was the "anti-smoking" ballot measure. In 
backing Proposition 188 the tobacco lobby argued its case by seeming to support 
restrictions on smoking, and many Californians did not realize at first that 
tobacco companies were sponsoring the initiative and many of the ads 
disseminated on its behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping voters discern what they are being sold is precisely what the court 
zeroed in on in the case of the municipal candidate. Daniel Griset, a former 
mayor, had been fined along with two campaign committees a total of $10,000 
after five separate mailers against his opponent for the City Council were sent 
out. His lawyer says there was no intentional misrepresentation. Now, for all 
such cases, the court lends important support to the policing of what 
candidates say in hit pieces. Kennard wrote that the law requiring such 
disclosure will "tend to prevent smear attacks" and "will enable the voting 
public to appraise the source of the attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision effectively bolsters efforts by the Fair Political Practices 
Commission to serve as a watchdog over the ubiquitous flow of negative 
literature, especially those pieces that arrive too late in a campaign for the 
public to identify or for opponents to reply. Having more accountability can 
help Californians to know who's who and what's what.

ISRAEL'S TREATY WITH JORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Kamal Naffa's article, "A Treaty Must Be More Than Words" (Commentary, Nov. 
23), speaks eloquently of the ambivalent Jordanian response to the recent 
Israel-Jordan treaty. It's difficult for most Americans and Israelis to 
appreciate the reign of skepticism and suspicion and the reluctance of many 
Arabs and Arab Americans (Islamic fundamentalists aside) to fully accept the 
peace accords. We must understand why this remains so. 
</P>
<P>
 We also agree, strongly, that the peace process must work quickly to work at 
all. The Mideast partners in growing dialogue must move forward or assuredly 
they will be moved backward. Naffa certainly is right in saying that Israelis 
and Arabs everywhere must also come to grips with mutual, destructive 
stereotypes and mythologies of war. But he falls prey, himself, to stereotypes 
of all-powerful Israel (and American Jewry) holding all of the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis must, indeed, understand the necessity to maintain a Palestinian 
sense of moving forward to better, more secure days in which they can determine 
their own future in their own homeland. For Israelis to be able to do that, 
however, more Arabs still must come to recognize the absolute necessity for 
Israelis to feel physically secure in their homeland. Having the most powerful 
military in the region has little to do with an individual's security. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us Jews and Arabs are engaged in exactly the kind of dialogue and 
advocacy with our respective communities for which Naffa pleads. A Los 
Angeles-based Arab-Jewish Speakers Bureau has been dispatching teams of us to 
Arab and Jewish (and other) venues to discuss issues and mutual perceptions. 
Americans can and must play a role -- with our government and with our own 
communities.

 * Naffa's comments about the Israel-Jordan peace treaty are misleading and 
historically inaccurate. As a "Jordanian-American" he worries about the fate of 
the Palestinians. The professor should be reminded that from 1948-1967, Jordan 
never partitioned off a piece of land for the Palestinians. It was only in 1967 
(after the Six-Day War) that Israel acquired the West Bank. This occurred 
thanks to King Hussein, who was asked by Israel not to enter the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Naffa is also concerned about restitution. What about restitution for more 
than 800,000 Jews who have been forced to flee Arab countries since 1948? 
</P>
<P>
 And Jerusalem. Always Jerusalem. Does Naffa, as a Jordanian, recall that Jews 
were forbidden to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem when Hussein was in 
control? Do readers know that Hussein built a palace on a Jewish cemetery 
overlooking the old city? 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that Jordan will be better off with Israel as a friend than 
most if not all of its Arab neighbors. Why wait for Syria?

JULIO CANO'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Boy Whose Parents Feared Deportation Had Leukemia," Nov. 24: 
</P>
<P>
 As a legal, naturalized citizen and Hispanic mother of two children, I find it 
appalling that opponents of Proposition 187 would use Julio Cano's tragic death 
to accentuate the racial tensions associated with the ongoing debate on the 
issue's fairness and legality. 
</P>
<P>
 The real tragedy of Julio Cano's death is not his family's fear of being 
deported.Rather, it seems his parents were willing to compromise their child's 
health and safety in order to remain illegally in the United States. Julio Cano 
appears to have died because of his family's blatant neglect and/or ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 When does blaming circumstances end, and taking proper parental responsibility 
begin?  
</P>
<P>
 KARINA EAST

<P>
 * The death of Julio Cano shows the plight of all people who have limited 
access to health care. Of course, anyone can be treated for emergencies. The 
problem that goes over the heads of (proponents of Proposition 187) is one that 
all poor parents face. How do you tell when a real emergency exists? 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, I had two children and no health insurance. I can still feel 
the tension. A trip to the family physician or the emergency room took food off 
the table. At a time when some of us think we need health care for everyone, 
our "leaders" are willing to let children die and blame it on their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Such thinking will not improve the health of California. It is rather a 
symptom of sickness of our collective soul.

CAMPAIGN SPENDING

<TEXT>
<P>
 * State Sen. Tom Hayden ("The Special Interests Still Rule," Column Left, Nov. 
22) correctly states that "democracy is being killed by advertising." The 
politicians with the most means to pollute the media with trite cliches and 
uncontested claims most often win out.This loads our government with lackeys 
beholden to the few who contribute the most. 
</P>
<P>
 A common-sense solution is to limit the amount of money that can be spent on a 
campaign. Every politician, depending on the office they are running for, 
should be allowed to spend only so much money. That way, it'll be a fair 
contest, and the ones who manage their resources best will most likely win, and 
in effect put the best money managers in office. 
</P>
<P>
 This simple idea makes so much sense that there should be a groundswell of 
support. But don't expect Republican money to grease the public's ire on this 
one. No, this common-sense solution is one for the Democrats to run with.

WE SPEAK ENGLISH IN L.A.; DON'T APOLOGIZE; MULTILINGUALISM: PRINTING CITY 
NOTICES IN HALF A DOZEN LANGUAGES IS A WASTE OF MONEY.

 The Los Angeles City Council has voted to obtain proposals from newspapers to 
publish official city notices, including ordinances, in Spanish, Chinese, 
Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese and Korean. Current law only requires that 
official city notices be published in an English-language newspaper, but, as 
council members Mike Hernandez and Jackie Goldberg said, the city should reach 
out to residents for whom English is not their first language. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, who wouldn't agree? Of course city government should reach out 
to everyone. Except -- at what point do we stop apologizing for the fact 
English is the national language? At what point do we hold non-English-speaking 
persons accountable for their disinterest in learning the language of this 
country -- as opposed to acting as if their shortcoming is somehow our civic 
failure? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who truly wants to become part of the American mainstream will make 
every attempt to learn English in order to realize greater financial and social 
opportunities. The same is true for those of us who venture to other countries 
for fame or fortune. I remember countless examples of colleagues who went to 
work for Japanese companies and were expected to demonstrate some level of 
proficiency in Japanese if they wanted the respect of their employers. In some 
cases, they were required to demonstrate progress in learning the language just 
to keep their jobs. So why do we so easily create alternatives for 
non-English-speaking people here when those alternatives bear such a high 
financial and social cost to all of us in the end? 
</P>
<P>
 The route to mutual understanding among people is communication, and in 
America, English is the official language we use to communicate and transact 
business. Community leaders who constantly apologize for that, either through 
words or deeds, are foolish. They promote divisiveness, unnecessary dependence 
and a false sense of security in non-English-speaking people, who perceive the 
apologies as a reinforcement of the notion that speaking English isn't critical 
or even necessary to their survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council currently spends $500,000 a year on publishing its official 
notices. The tab for the multi-language proposal will easily double that. You 
can also be sure that there are other ethnic groups who will want to know why 
just Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese and Korean? Why not 
Armenian? Russian? Hebrew? While we're at it, why not include Cambodian? 
</P>
<P>
 The council shouldn't stop at just six languages and $1 million if the goal is 
to be totally embracing and totally accommodating. 
</P>
<P>
 If council members are sincerely committed to bringing non-English-speaking 
residents into the loop, then maybe they should consider putting the extra 
$500,000 into community-based English as a Second Language classes. Acquiring 
English speaking and reading skills would have a measurable effect on the lives 
of the participants and of all in the community. The expenditure of such a sum 
of money would then have lasting benefits. But if the real goal is to quickly 
create an image of cultural sensitivity in a polarized city, then spending 
$500,000 during tough economic times is a high price to pay for being 
politically correct.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROGER BOESCHE: HOMELESS? HUNGRY? IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT; THE GINGRICH 
ERA MEANS CLASS-BASED POLITICS, 'US' VS. 'THEM' IN A WAR ON THE POOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER BOESCHE REPLACEMENT , Roger Boesche is professor of politics at 
Occidental College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly three decades ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a War on 
Poverty, a strong majority of Americans believed that poverty was neither 
necessary nor inevitable. Nearly everyone had a program to end poverty.  
</P>
<P>
 Now we have discarded the War on Poverty for a war against the poor. We assume 
-- with virtually no public discussion -- that the poor and the homeless will 
always be with us. As the 19th- Century social Darwinist William Graham Sumner 
put it, survival of the fittest and poverty for the least fit are simply laws 
of nature. "Let it be understood that we cannot go outside of this alternative: 
liberty, inequality, survival of the fittest; not liberty, equality, survival 
of the unfittest." 
</P>
<P>
 Newt Gingrich and many conservatives in Congress illustrate perfectly this 
social Darwinism. They announce that able-bodied adults who do not find a job 
in two years will be cut off from welfare, food stamps and health care. 
(President Clinton would stop welfare payments only if the recipient refused an 
available job.) No matter if this would massively increase homelessness (even 
Dickens' England had dreadful workhouses for the poor). Poverty is nature's 
penalty for laziness, and poverty is always the fault of the individual. Said 
an exasperated Sumner, the foolish poor "insist on remaining in the slums." 
</P>
<P>
 Most dramatically, the state will take their children. "Ultimately if they 
cannot support their children," said Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.), "the children 
will be taken care of through loving families, through foster care and 
adoption." Forget foster care and adoption. With 9.5 million children on 
welfare, we are heading toward the bleak orphanages -- eliminated decades ago 
because they were too expensive -- of an earlier time when, as columnist Ellen 
Goodman points out, "more than half the children in orphanages were not in fact 
orphans," but indeed had mothers who could not support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Darwinism has three key characteristics. First, by twisting Darwin's 
writings, social Darwinism poses as "science." Sumner boasted that his new 
sociology could discover laws of society just as Newton uncovered the law of 
gravity. Nowadays experts speak of the "law" of economics and declare a 
"natural" unemployment rate of 6%; "science" again tells us that poverty is 
unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
 All this science soothes the conscience. The turn-of-the-century robber baron 
Andrew Carnegie, who came from a family of union organizers, slept better after 
social Darwinism told him that both great wealth and great misery were part of 
God's design. "Light came in as a flood and all was clear . . . I had found the 
truth of evolution." 
</P>
<P>
 The second characteristic of social Darwinism is this upper-class bias. Is it 
any wonder that just about the first thing Gingrich announced after the 
November elections was his determination to reduce the capital-gains tax? 
</P>
<P>
 From 1929 to 1969, economic inequality in this country narrowed, but then 
widened. "The poorest 10% of American families suffered an 11% drop in real 
income between 1973 and 1992; the richest 10% enjoyed an 18% increase in real 
income," the Economist magazine reported. Welfare payments have been cut 47% in 
real terms since 1970. In the last 25 years, notes columnist Murray Kempton, 
"the share of the national income assigned to the middle class has fallen 
48.2%, a 9-point drop." Social Darwinism is merely an ideology masking a cruel 
class rule. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, behind both the old and new social Darwinism is the element of 
race. Sumner used his science of society to suggest that racial antagonism was 
unchangeably rooted in human nature. Gingrich's "Contract With America" is 
really a contract of Us against Them. From California's Proposition 187 to 
Gingrich's welfare reform, the message is simple: The real enemies of your 
individual prosperity are not powerful and wealthy elites, but rather African 
Americans too lazy to work hard and stubborn Latinos who refuse to learn 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 The same political and intellectual climate that produced the new Republican 
congressional majority has made a bestseller of the book "The Bell Curve" by 
Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein. Posing once more as "science" but 
founded on bogus studies, "The Bell Curve" comforts Americans and erases guilt 
by telling us that poverty is inevitable. Most important, the book claims that 
African Americans and Latinos are poor largely because God and nature doomed 
them to a lower IQ. Like Andrew Carnegie, we can all sleep more restfully, 
relieved of responsibility.

PERSPECTIVE ON SUICIDE; DEATH EMERGES AS A CIVIL LIBERTY; THE BATTLE FOR THE 
RIGHT OF THE TERMINALLY ILL TO CHOOSE HOW AND WHEN TO DIE TAKES A MAJOR STEP 
FORWARD IN OREGON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEREK HUMPHRY, Derek Humphry, who lives in Oregon, founded the Hemlock 
Society in 1980 and is president of the Euthanasia Research and Guidance 
Organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Choice over whether to live longer while suffering or to die sooner with 
dignity has finally arrived. For some, this signals the beginning of the end of 
a 1,600-year-old Judeo-Christian tradition against voluntary death; for others, 
it is the ultimate civil liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Two recent, but very different, events heralded this new era: 
</P>
<P>
 First, Oregon voters passed a law permitting limited physician-assisted 
suicide for the terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 And then in Massachusetts, Billy Best, a 16-year-old with cancer, declined 
medical treatment that might save his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakthrough on choice in dying has been 20 years in gestation. High-tech 
medicine became widely available in the 1970s, spawning the significant Karen 
Ann Quinlan case in New Jersey in 1976. Through her ordeal -- and that of her 
parents -- the public learned that people previously considered as good as dead 
could be kept alive in a twilight world almost indefinitely by machines. 
</P>
<P>
 In the immediate wake of that case, California passed the world's first 
living-will legislation, which has been copied and improved upon throughout 
America and elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Best's story brought attention to a little discussed aspect of the 
double-edged sword that is modern medicine: Do some treatments aimed at curing 
or slowing a disease have such unbearable side effects that a patient is right 
to refuse them, even if death is thereby hastened? 
</P>
<P>
 This was Billy's case. After he began chemotherapy last August to treat 
Hodgkin's disease, a form of lymphatic cancer, his hair fell out, his jaw ached 
and he was often left with a metallic taste in his mouth. He complained of 
severe nausea, aches and pains. When he protested against the chemotherapy, his 
parents insisted that he stay with it because there is a high cure rate when 
this disease is caught early and treated promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 So Billy packed his things and ran away from home. "I felt like the medicine 
was killing me instead of helping me," he said upon his return home weeks 
later. His chastened parents then promised that there would be no more 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only 16, Billy seems intelligent enough to make his own decisions. 
Probably there was poor communication between him, his health professionals and 
his parents. I hope he changes his mind and tries again for a cure, perhaps a 
different one. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost simultaneously, on the other side of the nation, Oregon voters 
initiated a world first by passing a ballot measure that, as of Dec. 8, permits 
doctors to fill terminally ill patients' requests for prescriptions for lethal 
overdoses of drugs. There is a thicket of safeguards, such as two waiting 
periods, second opinions, documentation, family notification and mandatory 
counseling by the doctor on pain control, depression and hospice alternatives, 
that must be gotten through before the cup of hemlock is dispensed. Injections 
are forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 This law does not oblige anybody to do anything. Health professionals, 
hospitals, patients with different ethical values can ignore it. But those who 
want to escape their suffering by an accelerated death now have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 All that has happened is that a procedure that was illegal and covert is 
decriminalized in Oregon. It will bring great comfort to thousands of dying 
people just to know this escape route is there. 
</P>
<P>
 But a firestorm of controversy is building over the new Oregon law. The 
religious right and hospice community have already vowed to repeal it, either 
through the courts, the Legislature or another initiative. The National Right 
to Life Committee has filed a lawsuit trying to block implementation. Staggered 
that the measure passed, the medical profession is nursing feelings hurt by the 
voters' implicit criticism of their care of the dying. From now on, the dying 
in Oregon will receive the best terminal care known to world medicine because 
no doctor wants to be labeled as "the first" to assist a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon public believes life to be sacred, but we deny its sacral quality 
when it degenerates to the point of being unbearable and meaningless to the 
individual. Organized religion is offended by this attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The bruising, 25-year battle over the rights of the unborn is about to be 
replaced by a much bigger nationwide struggle for the right to choose to die.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES P. PINKERTON: CAPTAIN KIRK, WE HARDLY KNEW YE; 
ENTERTAINMENT WITH A MORAL CORE ATTRACTS US BECAUSE WE HAVE SO FEW UNDEBUNKED 
HEROES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES P. PINKERTON, James P. Pinkerton is a lecturer at the Graduate School 
of Political Management at George Washington University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capt. James T. Kirk dies in "Star Trek: Generations." That revelation 
shouldn't spoil the movie for anyone. Trekkers already know and have mourned 
appropriately. But let the word go forth to the rest of America that a great 
allegory of the Cold War has come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 The original TV show was always a parable of the long twilight struggle 
against the Soviet Union. Kirk's narrated prologue, including the most famous 
split infinitive in TV history ("to boldly go where no man has gone before") 
echoed John Kennedy's soaring bear-any-burden rhetoric. "Star Trek's" vision 
was idealistic, not warmongering; Kennedy's New Frontier foreign policy sought 
self-determination for peoples of the developing world. But the Klingons were 
an Evil Empire all right, worse than Khrushchev's. After watching them destroy 
entire planets and all their life forms, every red- and green-blooded member of 
the Federation resolved to roll back Klingonism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Star Trek" premiered in 1966, just three years after J.F.K.'s assassination. 
William Shatner, playing a leader with the initials J.T.K., was a Kennedy-esque 
quester, a fearless he-man with a wandering eye. His smooch with Lt. Uhura was 
not only in keeping with his testosteronal character, but was also an advance 
for tolerance -- network TV's first interracial kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 The new movie's message is true to the spirit of the original show. Kirk has a 
chance to stay in "the Nexus," an ion-bathed "place of happiness" where all 
dreams are fulfilled. But they are only dreams. So Kirk leaves Nirvana to right 
one more wrong -- and thus comes to his final rendezvous with destiny. Is the 
Nexus a metaphor for the U.S.S.R., that phony "workers' paradise," or does it 
symbolize the fatal delusions of crack cocaine? Perhaps Nexus is merely a 
stand-in for the plump, purposeless existence that Kennedy commanded young 
Americans to forsake so they could join the Peace Corps -- or the Special 
Forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk dies a hero. His last words ask not what others can do for him, but what 
he can do for others: "Did we do it? Did we make a difference?" Our popular 
culture produces a dearth of undebunked heroes. So when we find entertainment 
with a moral core, such as "Star Trek," we gravitate toward its sustaining 
warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's best that Kirk goes to cine-Valhalla in "Generations." Shatner 
was born in 1931, just 14 years after Kennedy. He's stiff and puffy now, no 
longer the bonny prince of rerun memory. The torch has been passed to a new 
generation. In the words of Kirk's successor, Capt. Picard, "time is a 
companion that goes with us, giving us memories to cherish, but never comes 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 It has always been this way. The poet Homer intended his epic verse for 
popular consumption, to be repeated around campfires for the recreation of the 
old and the instruction of the young. Time has painted a coat of forbidding 
bookishness on Homer's tales that blurs his direct link to the mass amusements 
of today. So is "Star Trek" the "Odyssey" for the New Age? We'll know whether 
the voyages of the starship Enterprise meet the Homeric test of time in about 
3,000 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Civilization makes an eternal compact among the living, the dead and the yet 
to be born. The best of conservatism is about keeping track of and treasuring 
the permanent things. Sometimes collective recollection involves controversy, 
as with the design of the Vietnam veterans' wall a decade ago or the flap over 
the B-29 "Enola Gay" at the Smithsonian Institution today. But we all have a 
duty to carry our share of this monumental weight. Fortunately, as with any 
sinew, our moral muscle gets stronger as we exercise it. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories of heroes are the stars in the darkness by which we navigate our 
journey through life. One such light, the anniversary of President Kennedy's 
death, came and went Nov. 22 without much notice. But as J.F.K. aides Kenny 
O'Donnell and Dave Powers wrote in their tribute, "Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye," 
"the memories will always keep coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Some day, when the Cold War is remembered as a victorious struggle fought on 
windy plains across the planet, Kennedy, his foibles long forgotten, will 
endure as one of the greats. Not like the wily Odysseus perhaps or the mighty 
Ajax, but rather as the doomed, flawed warrior Achilles. Even so, when we look 
up into the night, we will see him in the heavens.

<P>
 Irwin Kostal, a Hollywood orchestrator and conductor who won Academy Awards 
for his work in "West Side Story" and "The Sound of Music," has died. He was 
83. 
</P>
<P>
 Kostal, who also won a Grammy for "The Sound of Music" album and a television 
Emmy as arranger and conductor on "The Garry Moore Show," died Nov. 23 of a 
heart attack at his Studio City home. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Chicago, Kostal began his musical career playing the piano when he was 
11. He taught himself musical arranging by studying the symphonic scores of 
composers such as Beethoven and Debussy at his local public library. Eventually 
he worked his way into a position as staff arranger for "Design for Listening," 
a Chicago-based NBC radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving to New York, Kostal landed a job as arranger for Sid Caesar's 
"Your Show of Shows," a post he held from 1950 to 1955. He next worked on 
Moore's variety show for five years and won acclaim for his work on such 1960s 
television specials as "Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall" and the Hallmark Hall 
of Fame adaptation of "Brigadoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Kostal earned two more Emmy nominations, as conductor on "The Julie Andrews 
Show" in 1966 and for his musical direction on the Kirk Douglas musical, "Dr. 
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, he began to orchestrate for Broadway. He worked with Leonard 
Bernstein on the original stage version of "West Side Story" and with Sid Ramin 
on "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." 
</P>
<P>
 He earned a recommendation to Walt Disney, who brought him to Hollywood to 
score films. Kostal earned three more Oscar nominations for his musical 
adaptation of Disney's "Mary Poppins" in 1964, "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" in 
1971 and "Pete's Dragon" in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 He also handled the music for the 1982 revision of the Disney classic 
"Fantasia," originally released in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not just wearing (original conductor Leopold) Stokowski's straitjacket," 
he told The Times at that time. "I'm also wearing Mickey Mouse's." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Kostal warmed to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe it or not," he said, "we do have the liberty of changing details, 
even orchestration, here and there. We also can play a little with the beat, 
making stresses coincide even more accurately with what we see on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, we approach this with no delusions. We are dubbing the sound track for 
an actor on the screen. It isn't all that different from what Lalo Schifrin did 
for Sam Wanamaker when the actor played the conductor in 'The Competition.' I 
don't claim to be impersonating Stokowski, God forbid. I'm not replacing him. 
I'm just doing a difficult job, and I'm doing my best." 
</P>
<P>
 At his death, Kostal was president of the American Society of Music Arrangers 
and Composers. In 1992 he received the organization's Golden Score Award for 
his lifetime work. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by three children, five grandchildren and two 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Young 
Musician's Foundation, 195 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90212.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; LOREENA MCKENNITT: ETHEREAL GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Loreena McKennitt ended her concert Tuesday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre by 
singing the closing speech from "The Tempest," delivered in the play by 
Shakespeare's alter-ego, the master artificer Prospero. 
</P>
<P>
 This mystically inclined folk singer from Canada isn't quite ready to move in 
that company. She is more like Prospero's daughter, the enchanting naif, 
Miranda. McKennitt's sparkling soprano voice was as lovely and strong as you 
could wish, but she was severely limited by a lack of fire, assertiveness and 
clear-eyed vision in her music. 
</P>
<P>
 It led to a narrow emotional range and occasionally flimsy thinking, taking 
some of the luster off an evening that offered much attractive, expertly 
rendered singing and playing. Those qualities were enough to win a closing 
ovation from an audience of about 700 people who had listened with hushed 
attentiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McKennitt's style is a hybrid she has been cultivating on record since 1985: 
Call it traditional Celtic New Age world music for six-piece chamber-rock 
ensemble -- the chamber in this case being a dimly lit stage decorated with 
five large candelabra and three medieval tapestries as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing two sets totaling more than two hours, McKennitt and her five-man band 
struck moods plaintive, mystical and fervent. They drew primarily on the Celtic 
tradition, but with Middle Eastern and Spanish hues thrown in for variety and 
for the sake of a cross-cultural overlay that McKennitt, 37, took stilted pains 
to emphasize. 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of rhythmic tension and urgency in the Mediterranean stuff and a firm 
grounding in Celtic balladry kept McKennitt from drifting into New Agey 
slumber. 
</P>
<P>
 But her singing never conveyed the ferocity and sense of aching confrontation 
with a heartbreaking world that is essential to good traditional folk singing 
-- not least the Celtic tradition, where the best singers will wring your 
heart. By temperament, it seems, McKennitt prefers to retreat to softer 
regions, leaping into mystery or escaping into a safe, mythic past. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious mysticism is a reaction to -- actually, a rejection of -- the worldly; 
sick of the corrupt earthly realm, the mystic seeks solace and enlightenment 
through contact with the divine. Had McKennitt shown both sides of that 
equation, her mystical journeys might have been earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they seemed like mere mood-setting, as inconsequential as the bland 
travelogues she strewed between songs. McKennitt talked of her sojourns in 
Morocco, Ireland and Spain, adopting the earnest, lecture-like and somewhat 
uncertain tone of a graduate student who hasn't yet learned to conduct a class 
with full confidence and ease. 
</P>
<P>
 At her worst, she babbled banality -- as when, in her cross-cultural zeal, she 
commented that the Celts resembled the North American Indians -- both were 
divided into tribes, each with its own folkways and arts. Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
 McKennitt topped that when, marshaling more evidence in favor of her theory of 
cross-cultural sharing and commonality, she referred to the period when 
Muslims, Jews and Christians were "cohabiting" medieval Spain. She did not add 
the obvious: that this cohabitation ended with a little unpleasantness called 
the Spanish Inquisition, a horrific outcome that established an 
all-too-relevant precedent for failed multiculturalism, one that is being 
replayed today among the Croats, Serbs and Muslims who cohabited Bosnia until 
some of them fell to disinhabiting large swaths of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, McKennitt wants to enjoy her visions of a world that works, 
without confronting the reality of a world that doesn't. Idealistic visions can 
be poignant and artistically compelling, but they lose their emotional and 
intellectual force if they fail to reckon first with reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest McKennitt came to addressing harsher realities was her song 
"Dickens' Dublin," a plaintive but innocuous lament of poverty and 
homelessness. Soon she was off into safe regions of myth. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished with her adaptation of "The Bonny Swans," an old Celtic tale of 
death and enchantment, and "The Lady of Shalott," her setting of a Tennyson 
poem based on the legends of Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every myth requires a feminist reinterpretation, but "The Lady of 
Shalott," with its account of a woman fated to die if she follows her heart's 
desire, surely does. There was not a whiff of an ironic or bitter edge in 
McKennitt's conventionally fervent and bittersweet rendition, which treated the 
poem as a quaintly romantic relic of olde England. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Setting aside its key weakness of unsubstantiated profundity, McKennitt's 
concert had its charms. Within its slender emotional range, her voice was 
marvelous (a greater emotional range might have helped make the singer more 
compelling as a stage personality; one tended not to be riveted by a performer 
who, it swiftly became clear, would produce no surprises). 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Marsh, on electric violin, was the ace of the band, spinning off solos 
that combined high lyricism with a sharp tonal edge. Toward the end, when 
Marsh's swift, swirling sallies had begun to sound repetitious, guitarist Brian 
Hughes stepped forward, switching from the unobtrusive acoustic guitars and oud 
he had been playing in favor of a full-toned electric guitar that dominated the 
homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' lightly distorted fret work reinvigorated the fiddle, Marsh at last 
having something to play off of in sparring sequences. McKennitt plucked 
capably at a Celtic harp taller than herself or contributed piano, synthesizer 
and accordion. 
</P>
<P>
 An evening with McKennitt was a cloistered interlude in a carefully pruned 
garden of tonal delights, with a touch of mystery-as-delicacy. Just the sort of 
place Prospero's island was at the start of "The Tempest," before the real 
world intruded and things started to get interesting.

ENERGY OF SALONEN, L.A. PHILHARMONIC WINS OVER N.Y.; MUSIC: THE ORCHESTRA 
RECEIVES CHEERING AUDIENCES AND FAVORABLE REVIEWS ON ITS FIRST VISIT SINCE 
ESA-PEKKA SALONEN BECAME MUSIC DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SWED, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm here to see what all the fuss is about," a member of the New York 
Philharmonic staff said Monday night as she entered Avery Fisher Hall to hear 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic perform under Esa-Pekka Salonen. She was not 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, New York made a genuine fuss over the Los Angeles Philharmonic's first 
tour here since Salonen became music director two seasons ago. Its programs 
Sunday afternoon and Monday at Lincoln Center had large, exuberantly cheering 
audiences. The power-mongers of New York's musical community were there, a 
couple from competing institutions looking fairly unhappy. Salonen was feted by 
the Finnish consulate, and his record company, Sony, introduced him to the 
local press at a lavish sushi lunch in a glamorous setting high atop its 
landmark building. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at all of these events, the same remark was heard over and over: "Do you 
believe the New York Times piece?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday Salonen and the Philharmonic won cultural New York's most 
desirable piece of journalistic real estate -- the front-page lead feature in 
the Arts & Leisure section of the New York Times. But, more than that, the 
headline read "Becoming the Next Bernstein? (Or Boulez?)," and above it was a 
large color picture of Leonard Bernstein conducting, late in his life, with a 
smaller insert of Salonen rehearsing in his Izod polo shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 As any streetwise New York music lover will insist, it is simply not possible 
to combine the charisma that Bernstein exerted over audiences here with the 
audience-discouraging contemporary music advocacy Pierre Boulez displayed when 
he succeeded Bernstein as music director of the New York Philharmonic. Alex 
Ross' rosy feature article, however, implied that just such an unbelievable 
miracle is taking place in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comparisons always have their dangerous side here, where one writer's 
acclaim will prompt others to counteract perceived puffery. But, while none of 
the first reviews to appear has gone so far as to concede that Bernstein has 
been reborn as a Boulez, the critical response has been glowing, nonetheless, 
with energy and energized being the operative words. Reviewing both programs 
(which, except for one Beethoven overture, remained in the 20th Century) for 
the Times, Allan Kozinn wrote that the orchestra "responded with a level of 
energy and excitement that one hears too rarely at orchestral performances." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozinn found that Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra concluding Sunday's program 
(which also included Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra and Ravel's Piano 
Concerto in G, with Olli Mustonen as soloist) "the most breathtaking of the 
orchestra's performances" but thought that its playing of Lutoslawski's Fourth 
Symphony, a New York premiere, came close. "Both works were given taut, 
suitably virtuosic readings, but more interestingly, the performances had a 
transparency that illuminated subsidiary musical lines and clarified structural 
details," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar praise came from Anthony Tommasini in New York Newsday who contended 
that "energized by Salonen's arresting conception of the (Lutoslawski), the 
orchestra played with purposefulness and communicative power." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Fleming in the New York Post summed up the Lutoslawski as a work whose 
"prevailing spirit is one of almost unremitting intensity," and she found that 
"Salonen and his orchestra consumed it, massive outbursts and all." 
</P>
<P>
 More controversial was Salonen's performance of Sibelius' Second Symphony, 
which closed Monday's program, although certainly not with the audience, which 
gave what surely must be the most ecstatic ovation to an orchestral concert 
here all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommasini found the Sibelius "clearheaded and illuminating," for him the 
passion and sweep was always at the service of structure. Kozinn, on the other 
hand, thought that, on this occasion, "in his quest for expansive tempos and a 
big, thrilling sound, Mr. Salonen sacrificed some of the drama that should 
enliven the work's first and last movements." 
</P>
<P>
 In the minority, dissenting camp, was Sedgwick Clark, the influential editor 
of the annual directory Musical America and one of the more outspoken and 
passionate longtime observers of the New York music scene. He left the concert 
calling Salonen's interpretation of Sibelius "stodgy and shapeless, the way I 
find all of the symphonic conducting I've heard him do. He has no vision of the 
final page." But even Clark said he was "very, very impressed with the 
Lutoslawski," and in it, as well as in an encore from Sibelius' "Lemminkainen" 
Suite, he thought the orchestra played "smashingly, with everything under 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Philharmonic has played beautifully in New York before, under 
both Carlo Maria Giulini and Andre Previn, as Kozinn reminded readers in his 
review. But clearly the orchestra has achieved a swift and remarkable image 
change with this tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that may be due to lucky timing -- the New York season has been 
somewhat lackluster thus far. And there are still the reviews in the weekly 
publications to weigh in. Moreover, it remains to be seen how well the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic will be remembered at season's end, since such great 
orchestras as Cleveland, the Concert-gebouw, the London Symphony and the Vienna 
Philharmonic are on their way with significant offerings. But, for the moment, 
Los Angeles and Salonen are the musical talk of a town that probably respects 
energy more than any other quality, and their return next year to Lincoln 
Center is already eagerly anticipated.

THEATER REVIEW; DAZZLE WITH A DIFFERENCE IN 'JELLY'; MAURICE HINES STEPS INTO 
THE ROLE ORIGINATED BY HIS BROTHER GREGORY ON BROADWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 To tell the story of Jelly Roll Morton in the musical "Jelly's Last Jam," 
director George C. Wolfe cleared the stage of traditional furniture and of much 
of its equally traditional emotional touchstones. In his 1992 Broadway debut, 
Wolfe (and his colleagues) created a place between heaven and hell where a 
newly dead antihero could examine his self-hatred and tell the real story of 
the pain he'd been too arrogant to allow for in life, except when writing music 
to help quiet it.  
</P>
<P>
 When Wolfe cleared the stage for the story of Jelly Roll Morton, he also 
brushed aside a lot of cobwebs from an often creaky art form. He brought an 
extremely frank and unsentimental examination of racism to the musical while 
brilliantly exploiting its power to rivet, seduce and fill up a theater, even 
one as big as Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
where the show runs only through Sunday (it will come to Pasadena and Palm 
Desert in January). 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe's groundbreaking Broadway production is intact and still breaking ground 
in Orange County. Some of the original cast remain, most importantly Savion 
Glover, the tap-dance kid who plays young Jelly, electrifying as he learns to 
shake off the etched-in-stone perfection of the Massenet his Creole family made 
him practice daily. Playing classical music is "like wakin' up in the mornin' 
and knowin' you gonna be alive at night," Jelly is advised by a trumpeter named 
Buddy Bolden, danced with surly grace and sinuousness by Ted L. Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fabulous act-one scene in which Jelly gets an education, black flats go 
flying up and sideways, and the stage literally opens up to take Jelly from his 
cloistered life of privilege to the streets of New Orleans. Glover slinks his 
way through the barkers, sexy women and street musicians until he meets Miss 
Mamie (Cleo King), a blues queen with a powerhouse voice, warm and rich and 
funky, that contains all the joy and the pain that Jelly will seek to put in 
his music. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon Jelly's death, a mysterious emissary named Chimney Man (Mel Johnson) 
offers him a Dickensian deal: If Jelly can tell his tale honestly, he can save 
his soul. In this place between life and death, the young and mature Jelly 
exist simultaneously, learning from each other in a continuum of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Hines is the grown Jelly, as full of bile and pride as he is of genius 
and longing. Hines replaces his brother Gregory, who originated the role on 
Broadway. (Obba Babatunde played the role in an earlier, 1991 production at the 
Mark Taper Forum also directed by Wolfe.) Comparisons must be extremely tedious 
to both brothers, but in this case there is no avoiding them. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with the good news, Maurice does not imitate Gregory, and his Jelly 
has different strengths and vulnerabilities. As an actor, he is especially good 
when Jelly is old enough to know he is destroying his life but still can't stop 
himself from repelling the people who love him. While Maurice's voice isn't 
terribly strong, it is flexible and mournful and his phrasing is piquant.  
</P>
<P>
 His dancing is, of course, very good, but here's where the comparison works 
against him. Gregory is simply the more charismatic performer, and no matter 
how many terrific spins Maurice delivers he can never capture the breathtaking 
quality that seems to come effortlessly to his brother. In the scene where 
Jelly dances with his younger self, Maurice appears winded next to the 
incredibly concentrated energy coming from the coltish Glover. The balance of 
the exchange is thrown off. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory was also better at being hateful, but Maurice is better at being hurt. 
Jelly's adopted mother Gran Mimi (Freda Payne) turns him out for consorting 
with riffraff, and Jelly never, ever gets over that rejection, inflicting that 
same terror on those who love him most. Payne plays the matriarch as a vain ice 
goddess who shows no remorse for turning her back on the boy. The performance 
is too unbending; Payne makes you feel that Jelly is infinitely better in the 
street, where he can be near the earth mother Miss Mamie. 
</P>
<P>
 The score seamlessly blends Morton's own songs with more theater-oriented ones 
by Luther Henderson and lyrics by Susan Birkenhead. It is a very smart 
blending, which manages to sound authentic and also add an extra layer of 
meaning appropriate to the vantage point of a man reviewing his life. It is a 
score so intoxicated with Jelly's idea of music that even Gran Mimi, the lover 
of Massenet, delivers her banishment song (by Henderson) in the form of a 
scorned-woman blues ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 Three women called the Hunnies serve as Greek chorus to the story, and, as 
vamped by Tracy Nicole Chapman, Rosa Curry and Kena Tangi Dorsey, they are 
sexiness personified. They stand behind Jelly at the pool table in black 
teddies, rolling their shoulders and offering a smoldering "Eight ball -- in 
the pocket" as if shooting pool were the hottest act imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jack, the loyal friend who nevertheless gets caught in the trap of Jelly's 
self-hatred, Stanley Wayne Mathis repeats his excellent performance, 
over-compensating for the humility that Jelly lacks. As Anita, Nora Cole's 
seductive ways are too choreographed, but she is salty and sweet in the show's 
second half, when she is no longer defined by her sexiness.  
</P>
<P>
 Jules Fisher's lights and Robin Wagner's minimalist sets are both 
extraordinary, flexible and evocative, serving Wolfe's fluid storytelling. Hope 
Clarke's choreography (Maurice Hines did his own tap numbers) and Toni-Leslie 
James' costumes add color and variety to a story already rich in both. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its dazzle, "Jelly's Last Jam" never seizes the emotions entirely, the 
fault perhaps of the intellectual brilliance of its director. No matter. Its 
treasures are many, and it is essential viewing for anyone who loves the 
theater and who loves music. But not necessarily Massenet.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; IRELAND'S CRANBERRIES: GREEN IN CONCERT BUT ROOM TO GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the Cranberries' concert at the Wiltern Theatre on Tuesday, singer 
Dolores O'Riordan frequently turned her microphone toward the audience, 
acknowledging and encouraging the overwhelming enthusiasm of her very vocal 
following. 
</P>
<P>
 It was appropriate -- this was a concert in which the fans' performance was 
more intriguing than the band's. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Irish group isn't pretty good. O'Riordan and her three bandmates 
are a distinctive, promising young act, and the frontwoman's songs are often 
hypnotic in their imagery and aura, carried by her frequently stunning array of 
vocal skips, trills and purrs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the roars of devotion that greeted the group seemed appropriate for an act 
that had been around for decades, the emotion with which fans sang along on 
almost every song was suited to certified anthems, and the worship that 
accompanied O'Riordan's every move should have been reserved for a true force 
of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 C'mon, folks! 
</P>
<P>
 For all its qualities, this band -- with just two albums under its belt -- has 
a lot of growing to do before achieving iconhood, especially as a live act. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no denying the catchy, romantic attraction of last year's big hits 
"Linger" and "Dreams." And Tuesday, the first of two sold-out nights at the 
Wiltern, several songs from the new "No Need to Argue" album emerged as strong 
additions.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ode to My Family" offers warm, winning memories of familial strength -- a 
nice counterpoint to today's many songs about childhood neglect and abuse 
(e.g., Sinead O'Connor, the most natural comparison for O'Riordan). "Zombie," 
performed with the stage bathed in bright red light, makes a forceful plea to 
end Ireland's history of violence.  
</P>
<P>
 But otherwise there was little sense of drama in the show, nothing to 
illuminate or expand upon the lyrical imagery. O'Riordan is a charmingly 
awkward presence, but much of the time she just looked as if she didn't know 
what to do with herself, either standing stiffly with a guitar almost as big as 
she, or moving uncertainly about the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was all the fuss about?  
</P>
<P>
 Like, say, Counting Crows, the Cranberries' mix of restless romanticism and 
sophisticated melodiousness has spanned generations, striking a chord with 
young alternative fans and more sedate Boomers. O'Riordan also fills a valuable 
slot as a strong female presence in the still male-dominated world of pop 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget the Irish factor -- Celtophiles are a notoriously rabid bunch 
that will glom on to anything that emerges from the Emerald Isle. 
</P>
<P>
 Passion is to be encouraged, but hey, Cranberries fans -- give the group some 
time to develop before you overwhelm it with adoration.

<P>
 Larry Kirwan, lead singer of Black 47, must have felt at least a bit out of 
place when his group first took the stage Tuesday night at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
 Black 47's fiery, politically charged vision is borne of Kirwan's eloquently 
pointed rage, full of historical references to famous and obscure heroes from 
his native Ireland plus more contemporary allusions to the teeming streets of 
New York City, where Kirwan has spent his adult years. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd this night was embarrassingly sparse, and affluent, conservative 
Orange County is a far cry from the steaming Irish pubs of Hell's Kitchen, 
whence came Black 47 (named for the worst year of Ireland's Great Potato 
Famine). 
</P>
<P>
 The diminutive, fragile-looking singer was subdued, perhaps ill-at-ease for 
the first few songs. But before long, he seemed to realize that the small but 
devoted gathering was on his side, and then Kirwan and company came alive, 
delivering a blistering set of Celtic rock that was by turns raucous and 
tender, venomous and full of rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing Euro-punk sensibility with traditional Irish melody and 
instrumentation, East Coast rock Populism and even flourishes of reggae and 
hip-hop, the group's sound draws from many and diverse sources.  
</P>
<P>
 This was a refreshing night of music by real people for real people, harking 
back to a time not so long ago when rock 'n' roll was something more than 
commerce, fashion statements and self-serving whining. 
</P>
<P>
 Raunched-out guitars and drum machines met bagpipes, saxophones, tin whistles 
and a variety of percussion instruments in a head-on collision of joyful noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly thrusting his fist into the air in a "Power to the People" sign, 
jumping up and down, dancing a jig and grinning from ear to ear, Kirwan was an 
animated, immensely appealing front man. He sang of heroes as diverse as 
American civil rights activist and performer Paul Robeson, rock 'n' roll singer 
Bobby Fuller and Irish political figure Michael Collins. His voice was eerily 
reminiscent of Dexy's Kevin Rowland, and he looked something like a hung-over 
Bryan Adams. All in all, he was a reedy, rumpled delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirwan's fans cheered his every word and needling references to Newt Gingrich 
and Republicans in general, danced around the room with wanton glee, sang along 
to the many songs they knew by heart, joined him onstage and generally had one 
helluva good time. At times, the Coach House seemed transformed into an Irish 
camp meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Joe Strummer, Ellen Barkin and Robin Williams 
numbering among its fans, Black 47 has become something of a cause celebre 
among the entertainment-world cognoscenti. 
</P>
<P>
 If the group seems like a visitor from another world in mellow Southern 
California, it is a world that more locals would do well to visit next time.

 Unveiled: The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday introduced its 
latest fund-raising tool -- a lithograph by Los Angeles artist Robbie Conal. 
The black-and-white image, depicting four past ACLU cases and the words "Sooner 
or Later, Everyone Needs the ACLU," will also be plastered on dozens of Los 
Angeles Gannett Outdoor bus shelters in early 1995, with plans in the works to 
add shelters in other cities at a later date. The lithograph -- 50 of which 
will be for sale at $1,000 each -- depicts a monkey, representing the Scopes 
"monkey trial" over the teaching of evolution in schools; Lt. Col. Oliver 
North, for whom the ACLU argued to protect his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination; a stoic Japanese American woman and her child, representing 
those interned in their own country during World War II, and Pulitzer 
Prize-winning author Alice Walker, whom the ACLU supported against efforts to 
remove her work from a California student test.

 Bolshoi Protest: Dancers, singers and musicians of Moscow's famed Bolshoi 
Theater threatened Wednesday to stage their first strike to block major 
artistic and business changes ordered by President Boris Yeltsin. About 500 
Bolshoi members attended a meeting to protest the reforms, which would 
introduce a contract system for hiring artists and set up a 15-member board to 
run Russia's premier theater. Unless their demands are met, Bolshoi performers 
will delay a Dec. 8 ballet performance by 20 minutes, and are prepared to go on 
strike afterward, a Bolshoi spokesman said. A culture ministry spokeswoman said 
Wednesday that the government intends to stand firm in its bid for reform.

 Short of Time: The scheduled return this month of NBC's "The Martin Short 
Show," which was yanked off the air in September after only two airings, has 
come up short. NBC executives said Short, who was the comedy's executive 
producer as well as its star, is currently making a film and will not be 
available until next year. They added that the comedian will then do six more 
episodes that will air before the end of the season.

 Billboard Chart: Kenny G's holiday album, "Miracle," was the top performer in 
a Thanksgiving week that saw record sales approach 15 million copies -- 19% 
more than the previous week and 7% more than during the same period last year. 
The pop saxophonist's album sold about 240,000 copies, kicking off what 
retailers predict will be a lucrative holiday shopping season. In second place 
was Boyz II Men's "II," which sold 217,000 copies. And the group's single "I'll 
Make Love to You" remains in the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 Chart for 
the 14th consecutive week, tying Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" as 
the longest-reigning single in pop history. Another notable Top 10 album entry 
was Frank Sinatra's "Duets II," which sold 103,000 units and will rank No. 9 
during its second week in the stores. QUICK TAKES

ART REVIEWS; NARRATIVES ARE HIGHLIGHT OF 'BLACK MARIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Krieger's sprawling, four-gallery installation at the Santa Monica 
Museum of Art begins with cogent ideas about film technology but loses its 
focus and energy well before you finish listening to its soundtracks, watching 
its projections, bending over its vitrines, wandering around its sets and 
reading its long, explanatory wall labels. 
</P>
<P>
 These compact narratives are the best part of Krieger's ambitious, unresolved 
work, titled "Black Maria" after the first motion picture studio, invented by 
Thomas Edison. They convey interesting anecdotes about Edison's claustrophobic, 
poorly ventilated chamber, which sat on curved tracks that allowed it to follow 
the sun's path. The labels also hint at Krieger's ideas about the intoxicating, 
sometimes nefarious, uses to which Disney and Warhol put Edison's supremely 
deceitful invention. 
</P>
<P>
 The other objects and props the artist employs don't work as well. His tables 
of fake scientific equipment, home-movie screens, steel chains, reels of film 
and rolls of tin foil make it clear that Warhol's Factory or Disney's fantasies 
are being referred to, but the props don't communicate anything more specific 
or original. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem with Krieger's installation is that it doesn't seem to know what 
it wants to say. Another is that the argument it struggles to articulate might 
be better suited to a different medium, such as an essay or a book -- formats 
that resemble greatly expanded wall labels.

 Minimal Collages: Sarah Seager's exhibition at 1301 Gallery combines some of 
the worst aspects of public art with a style of Conceptualism that was once 
prominent in local art schools but now might best be called "L.A. Laziness." 
</P>
<P>
 Her show consists of nine nicely framed sheets of vellum, on each of which she 
has pasted a phrase or two clipped from clothing catalogues and museum 
brochures. A few hastily cut rectangles of colored paper almost always decorate 
Seager's slight, minimally oriented collages, giving them the appearance of 
low-budget graphic designs that lack inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 As is common to third- or fourth-generation Conceptualism, the exhibition 
checklist is an essential component of the show. It conveys more information 
than all the works combined, letting viewers know that they're not looking at 
real works of art, but proposals for works of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is all that is needed for Seager to complete her pieces. When a 
collector selects a proposal he or she would like to see realized, the artist 
enters into a discussion to determine the details of the work's final form. 
</P>
<P>
 Three involve additional shopping, for a dragon-print scarf, a leather jacket 
or a pair of sarong pants. Two proposals promise posters. One collage is to be 
accompanied by an as-yet-unpublished book. Another is a crude contract 
stipulating that a band play a record's worth of songs from a defunct punk 
group's repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 By purchasing Seager's proposals, collectors finance her projects. As instant 
benefactors, they are entitled to some input into relevant decisions. In 
consultation with the artist, they negotiate the logistics of whatever deals 
they cut, deciding, for example, on the sizes and styles of the clothing, 
whether these items are to be worn or hung on the wall like paintings, or 
mounted on pedestals like sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist and collector thus mimic the activities of city committees and boards 
of directors who approve cultural projects intended for public consumption. 
Like much publicly funded art -- which, these days, must legitimize itself as 
community-building, educational outreach or social welfare -- Seager's collages 
never claim to be autonomous, self-sustaining works. They're merely tokens of 
social services performed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 This brand of art-as-promissory-note is the result of an undying sense of 
entitlement, combined with a lack of faith in the institutions meant to deliver 
these privileges. Seager's willingness to give up on art-making in favor of 
proposal-writing and compromise replays, in the privacy of the artist's studio, 
what has already happened in the public sector. Tragedy returns as farce. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MCKENNITT'S VOICE SPARKLES BUT LACKS FIRE, ASSERTIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Loreena McKennitt ended her concert Tuesday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre by 
singing the closing speech from Shakespeare's "The Tempest," delivered in the 
play by the master artificer Prospero. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, this mystically inclined folk singer from Canada was more like 
Prospero's daughter, the enchanting naif Miranda.McKennitt's sparkling soprano 
voice was as lovely and strong as you could wish, but she was severely limited 
by a lack of fire, assertiveness and clear-eyed vision in her music. The 
narrowness of emotional range and the occasionally flimsy thinking took some of 
the luster away from an evening that offered much attractive singing and 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 McKennitt's hybrid might be called traditional Celtic New Age world music for 
six-piece chamber-rock ensemble. She and her five-man band struck moods 
plaintive, mystical and fervent, drawing primarily on the Celtic tradition but 
with Middle Eastern and Spanish hues thrown in for variety and rhythmic snap. 
</P>
<P>
 It added up to a cloistered interlude in a carefully pruned garden of tonal 
delights, spiced with a touch of mystery-as-delicacy. Just the sort of place 
Prospero's island was at the start of "The Tempest," before the real world 
intruded and things started to get interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 * McKennitt performs Friday at the Wadsworth Theater, Veterans Administration 
grounds, Brentwood, 8 p.m. $22.50. (310) 825-2101. Also Saturday at the Ventura 
Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut Ave., Ventura, 8 p.m. $18.50. (805) 648-1936. MIKE

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; POP WILL EAT ITSELF JUMPS TO AGGRESSIVE BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE APPLEFORD

<TEXT>
<P>
 O h, you lucky people!  
</P>
<P>
 That was Clint Mansell of the band Pop Will Eat Itself, greeting the Whisky 
crowd Tuesday with the same jokey show-biz spin that's kept this British act a 
worthwhile amusement since the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps, too, that the quintet has developed a flair for weaving fine, 
melodramatic tunes into its aggressive, industrial-noise pop. That Pop Will Eat 
Itself didn't invent this brand of music (mixing jagged guitar rock with 
elements of hip-hop and techno) seemed irrelevant at the Whisky, where fans 
hopped and moshed happily to the relentless beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing material from its new "Dos Dedos Mis Amigos" album (released on 
Trent Reznor's Nothing label), the band was most powerful when the synth 
effects gave way to the occasional dual-guitar pop assault. The harsh rock core 
beneath it all was never oppressive -- PWEI isn't serious enough for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell and co-singer Graham Charles Crabb shouted raps and bounced around 
with more spring in their step than most hip-hop vocalists. Too bad the band 
still sometimes leans on recorded keyboard fills, which seem completely 
unnecessary and even off-putting, given the group's energy elsewhere. STEVE

JAZZ REVIEW; AHMAD JAMAL OPENS WEEK WITH PROVOCATIVE PRECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To pianist Ahmad Jamal, music is as much silence as it is sound -- as much 
soft understatement as roaring crescendo. He made that instantly clear when he 
stepped on stage Tuesday night for the opening set of a weeklong run before an 
enthusiastic full house at Catalina Bar & Grill. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking off a medium tempo tune with some brisk chording, Jamal's sensitive 
musical antennae immediately surveyed the club's ambient acoustics. Playing 
with one hand, and conducting with the other, he led bassist James Cammack and 
drummer Dave Bowler through a series of minute changes of volume and intensity, 
pushing here, pulling there, until he was fully assured that the trio had found 
a way to express its characteristically delicate balance of crashing chords, 
quietly laid-back melodies and surging rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of concern for detail has been an implicit aspect of Jamal's music 
for nearly 40 years. The result is a creative idiom that is both musically 
precise and emotionally provocative. Perhaps equally important, it is an 
approach to improvising that appears to continually stimulate Jamal's own 
playing. Performing songs such as "Skylark," "All the Things You Are" and 
"Poinciana" -- songs he has done hundreds of times -- he still seemed to retain 
the joy of discovery, occasionally smiling, tilting his head to one side, 
nodding an affirmative grunt or muttering a satisfied "yeah!" 
</P>
<P>
 There were times, especially on the less familiar numbers, when style tended 
to suppress substance, when musical content was on the verge of being buried 
beneath too many layers of shifting rhythm and dynamics. But Jamal is too wise 
to allow himself to be imprisoned in his own style. Typically, when his stormy 
bursts of chording threatened to overshadow the music, he would suddenly allow 
bright, sunny beams of melody to break through the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an impressive performance by an artist who too often has been 
overlooked as a "cocktail jazz" player. But the labeling is misguided and 
inaccurate. Jamal's work at Catalina this week is providing an object lesson in 
the way jazz can be simultaneously detailed and spontaneous, thoughtful and 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ahmad Jamal Trio at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., 
Hollywood. (213) 466-2210. Jamal plays two sets each night, 8:30 and 10:30, 
through Sunday. $12 cover tonight and Sunday; $15 cover Friday and Saturday, 
with two-drink minimum.

CLUB REVIEW; SWINGING THE NIGHT AWAY AT THE REVAMPED DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many ambitious proprietors attempt to invoke old Hollywood visions when 
restoring one of the city's venues, but few succeed with such style and grace 
as the owners of the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in the Los Feliz district, the Art Deco club was revamped by 
ex-husband-and-wife team Tammi and Tony Gower last year with such detail that 
the clientele is inspired to dress in '30s and '40s styles as they swing the 
night away. 
</P>
<P>
 With its historic origins -- the facility was built by Cecil B. DeMille in 
1929 and has been Willard's Chicken Inn, a Brown Derby and Michael's Los Feliz 
Restaurant in previous lifetimes -- the lush-looking venue already had a 
lovely, genteel feel about it. But the Gowers unveiled the building's amazing 
domed ceiling, which had been covered up for decades, refinished period chairs 
they discovered in the basement and decorated the two-room club with a mix of 
amber, burgundy and cobalt blue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the music is the Derby's gem. Although the club features a rotating lineup 
of live jazz, swing and rockabilly, Wednesdays continue to be the biggest 
night. The seven-piece house band, the Royal Crown Revue, performs a blend of 
swing-era classics and early R&B to an adoring crowd sporting zootsuits and 
classic attire. Newcomers take heart: Free dance lessons are offered at 8 p.m. 
Wednesdays and Thursdays to add pep to your step to keep up with regulars. 
</P>
<P>

TV REVIEW; 'BUBBE': FAMILY TALES WITH YIDDISH ACCENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bubbe Meises, Bubbe Stories," writer-performer Ellen Gould's one-woman 
musical journey, has a certain Yiddish appeal, steeped as it is in an Old World 
grandmother (the "Bubbe") whose anecdotal wisdom illuminates life for her 
modern, floundering granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the subject is universal -- about family and tradition -- but its 
Yiddish accent certainly enriches what appears to be an autobiographical 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubbe Meises , a noun of Yiddish derivation meaning old wives' tales or 
stories of superstition, follows a lonely, contemporary Jewish woman who 
travels emotional bridges through time and memory, thanks to her Bubbe, who 
sets her life on the right path. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, in a 75-minute production adapted from her 1992 Off Broadway musical, 
plays three women: herself as the granddaughter at a crossroads and her two 
long-dead, immigrant Russian grandmothers, whom Gould re-enacts through amusing 
stories, body language and vocal accents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould sings a good deal of the material in a stylized production fluidly 
directed by Craig McKay (a top motion picture editor). Supported by off-stage 
musical accompaniment, a little of the show's music, however, goes a long way; 
in fact, the script goes a long way and would carry more impact if it were 
seriously trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those old tales about Russian socialism, Bubbe's mythical jeweled necklace and 
her ocean crossing do get a tad redundant. This is the kind of solo production 
that would seem to work better on a live stage, although, to be fair, one of 
the camera's warmest achievements is telling close-ups of the live studio 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the courage to leave families behind and face an unknown life in America 
has recently become frowned upon and at the very least suspect, "Bubbe Stories" 
is a sweet reminder of two of the best screen experiences about Bubbes 
everywhere: writer-director Joan Macklin Silver's ode to turn-of-the century 
Eastside New York, "Hester Street" (1974), and Elia Kazan's immigrant odyssey 
"America, America" (1963). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bubbe Meises, Bubbe Stories" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15.

 Season's Biscuits 
</P>
<P>
 Nabisco is bringing back some of its seasonal specialties for the holidays, 
such as White Fudge Covered Oreos, Chocolate Dipped Ritz Crackers and Chips 
Ahoy with red, green and white sprinkles. Another colorful return: the holiday 
edition of Milk-Bone Flavor Snacks in red and green. Science Crunches On 
</P>
<P>
 Two scientists at the Agricultural Research Service in Albany, Calif., have 
identified 30 chemicals critical to the taste of corn tortillas and tortilla 
chips. The main one turns out to be 2-aminoacetophenome; knowing this, the 
scientists, say, tortilla chip makers will be able to enhance flavor. The 
researchers' names, by the way, are Louisa Ling and (we wouldn't make this up) 
Ronald Buttery. Youth Will Be Served 
</P>
<P>
 Budweiser is one of the top 10 beer brands in the U.K., and the second most 
popular beer in Ireland. It's popular mostly with younger drinkers, who prefer 
a milder flavor than their elders do. On Line With the Green One 
</P>
<P>
 The Jolly Green Giant is entering the information age. You can reach its 
interactive recipe service, Green Giant Mealtime Recipe Helpline, by calling 
(800) GREENGIANT (that's 473-3644) and choose recipes, which will be customized 
to the number of people in your party, from an on-line database. (In some 
markets, including Los Angeles, the service is available in Spanish as well as 
English.) You can ask for the recipes to be FAXed to you if you want, and in 
February the service will be available -- complete with color illustrations -- 
on the Prodigy computer service's food bulletin board. Those Fightin' Squids 
</P>
<P>
 Squid are ferocious predators, consuming their body weight every week in fish, 
small crustaceans and -- what the heck, why not? -- other squid. This may be 
why the Houma Indians of Lousiana had the squid as their battle symbol. Slow 
Soup 
</P>
<P>
 So you say you have the time to cook but don't want to cook from scratch. 
Lipton has you dead in its sights with its Kettle Creations Homemade Style soup 
mixes. These cello-pack mixes cook in 30 minutes (which required some careful 
calculation -- the pasta shapes had to be thick enough that they won't turn 
mushy, but not so thick that they won't stay in your spoon). Flavors include 
minestrone and chicken flavor with long grain and wild rice. In supermarkets.

 Leafy green vegetables and fruits of all descriptions got a new boost 
recently.The Harvard Heart Letter reports that new medical studies suggest the 
vitamins folate and B6 found in these comon foods play a part in reducing the 
risk of heart attack. They'd always been thought good for plenty of other 
reasons, but a role in reducing risk from heart disease is an additional reason 
for eating them. Natch, the Letter reports, studies also point out that most 
Americans -- about 80% -- don't bother getting the recommended amount of these 
vitamins. BRUCE HENSTELL

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: GOATSCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best Mexican dish I have ever eaten in Los Angeles may be the birria at 
the Pico-Union restaurant El Parian, a big plate of crisply roasted goat in a 
rich tomato broth. They make tortillas to order at El Parian, thick, chewy 
things that pretty much serve as edible eating utensils, and the smoky chile 
salsa is intense enough to strip the enamel off your teeth. The beer is cold. 
The jukebox is good. The chips come straight out of a bag. 
</P>
<P>
 El Parian may be the best birrieria in town, but it is by no means the only 
place to get your goat: In any neighborhood where you find more than half a 
dozen Mexican bars, there will be at least one birrieria ready to soak up the 
beer. Birria , the famous goat dish from the area around Guadalajara -- banners 
for the soccer team Guadalajara Chivos are common at birria joints -- may not 
normally be the first food you think of at breakfast time, but it can be as 
palliative as it is delicious, especially on a queasy stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 As you drive narrow Maple Avenue south from the freeway, warehouses give way 
to soaring Eastlake mansions long ago segmented into triplexes, gabled 
apartment houses with grocery stores on the ground floor, neat, low Victorian 
houses with intricate jigsawed filigree. This could be the neighborhood in 
central Los Angeles least marred by mini-malls or postwar dingbat apartment 
buildings; this is probably how Los Angeles looked at the turn of the century, 
when the city was still famed for its public transit and people walked to the 
local market. 
</P>
<P>
 On a street corner down past Adams, Birrieria Baldomero No. 2, impossibly 
large, looks almost like what you'd imagine a Depression-era restaurant to be 
if Depression-era restaurants also featured orange Formica benches and 
soccer-blaring TV. The vast, high-ceilinged dining hall is the size of your 
high-school cafeteria, with steam tables at one end and a picture of 
Guadalajara's central square toward the other, acres of wood-grain Formica, 
dozens of empty beer bottles crowding the tables. Payment is on something like 
the honor system.  
</P>
<P>
 There may be more than birria or weekend menudo here, but it would be hard to 
tell by looking at the plates of the men around you, at the signboards above 
the steam table or at the menu, which doesn't exist. Here it comes, even if you 
didn't bother to order, a plastic bowl of goat meat in a rich pan-dripping 
broth, accompanied by a dish of cilantro and another of finely chopped onion, a 
half lime, a bowl of searingly hot chile salsa to mix in to taste. Some 
restaurants serve birria in plates so brimming with soup you wonder how the 
waiter makes it from the kitchen without spilling; other places roast the meat 
to a frizzly crunchiness or season the stew with strong doses of mint. This is 
plain-wrap birria , good and strong, tasting mostly of goat, the meat itself 
stewy and soft as a long-cooked lamb shank, generous in bones and cartilage and 
secret bits of flesh.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're thirsty, grab your own Bohemia or apple-flavored Sidral soda from 
one of the wooden glass-front iceboxes that look as if they have been around 
since Repeal. If you want your birria to go, go down the block to Birrieria 
Baldomero No. 1, which is a little goat-centered takeout stand on the corner. 
And if you're, you know, in need of birria on Saturdays and Sundays, the 
hangover-friendly restaurant opens at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Birrieria Baldomero No. 2

 3104 S. Maple Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 231-1682. Open Monday-Friday, 8 a.m. to

GOOD COOKING: HOLIDAY ON THE HALF-SHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are three hot shellfish appetizers that require little last-minute 
attention. In the Chicago-style shrimp de Jonghe, garlic and herb-loaded bread 
crumbs cloak the shrimp and flavor it in an unmistakably robust way. Oysters 
Midas in-the-shell take a remote cue from oysters Rockefeller. The oysters are 
served sizzling hot and come off with great elan in spite of their easy 
preparation.  
</P>
<P>
 The Thai-style warm scallop salad takes a few minutes to get together but it's 
well worth it. The salad's flavor is bright and fresh-tasting, and the 
presentation is as festive as the season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's said that shrimp de Jonghe was created at the turn of the century in 
Chicago by two Belgians named de Jonghe . It makes a great entree or starter 
for a festive meal.  
</P>
<P>
 SHRIMP DE JONGHE 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 large cloves garlic, minced, about 1 scant tablespoon

</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup minced parsley

minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer mixture to food processor fitted with metal blade. Add bread crumbs, 
parsley, paprika, salt and cayenne. Pulse to process. Taste crumb mixture. It 
should be very spicy. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange 3 shrimp, overlapping, in each of 6 buttered individual souffle 
dishes. Combine broth and remaining vermouth and pour about 2 teaspoons of 
mixture into each dish. Tuck 1 tablespoon crumbs down around shrimp in each 
dish. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons crumbs over each dish. Dribble 1/4 teaspoon oil on 
each dish. Place dishes on baking sheet. Shrimp can be prepared to this point 
several hours ahead and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake shrimp on lower oven rack at 450 degrees until browned and sizzling, 
about 12 to 14 minutes. Serve hot with lemon wedges. Makes 3 entree or 6 
appetizer servings.

 The ring of mesclun greens around the wilted scallop salad makes a festive 
presentation. The tangy Thai ingredients give the salad tremendous flavor. The

 1 1/2 tablespoons minced cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse salad greens. Gently spin dry. Set aside edible flowers and about 1 cup 
salad greens to arrange on salad plates. Refrigerate. Put remaining greens in 
large bowl. Chill until ready to use.  
</P>
<P>
 Just before serving, divide flowers and reserved 1 cup leaves evenly among 4 
salad plates, arranging in wreath-like design. Set aside.  
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in non-stick wok or 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. 
When hot, add lemon zest, garlic, jalapeno, sweet red pepper and 1/4 cup sliced 
green onions. Cook, uncovered, until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Add rice vinegar, fish sauce and lemon juice. Heat about 10 seconds. Add 
scallops and remaining 1/4 cup green onions. Cook until scallops are opaque, 
about 40 to 60 seconds, shaking pan several times. Do not overcook. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, drain hot pan juices into small dish. Pour hot pan juices on greens 
in bowl. Toss until greens are well coated. Adjust seasonings to taste. Divide 
greens among plates, mounding in center of wreaths. Divide scallop mixture

 There's nothing better than a great new low-fat appetizer to serve at holiday 
parties. And these grilled shrimp appetizers are among the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick and easy to make, the sauce may be prepared the morning of, or a day 
ahead of, the party, then covered and refrigerated until almost serving time, 
when it can be reheated in the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
 The appetizers themselves can be put together several hours ahead of time, 
covered and refrigerated until guests arrive and you put them on the grill for 
just a few minutes. BASIL AND PROSCIUTTO WRAPPED SHRIMP 
</P>
<P>
 5 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons minced ginger root 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons minced plum tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup clam juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
 12 peeled and deveined shrimp 
</P>
<P>
 12 large basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
 4 very thin slices prosciutto, cut lengthwise into 3 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 Combine 4 cloves minced garlic, soy sauce, lemon juice, minced ginger root, 
tomatoes, sugar and clam juice. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine oil and remaining 1 tablespoon minced garlic. Add shrimp, tossing to 
coat. Wrap 1 basil leaf around middle of each shrimp, then 1 strip prosciutto, 
pressing end to seal. Heat heavy stove-top iron grill until very hot, spraying 
with non-stick olive oil-flavored cooking spray.  
</P>
<P>
 Grill shrimp until pink and done through, about 3 minutes, turning once. Spray 
shrimp with olive oil-flavored non-stick cooking spray while grilling. Serve 
with dipping sauce. Makes 12 shrimp appetizers.

DUCK BREAST SEASON BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From now through the Christmas season, you're most likely to find boneless 
duck breast in the supermarket or butcher shop. The duck breast is the meatiest 
part of the bird. And unlike a whole duck, which is messy and time-consuming to 
prepare, the breast is fast-cooking and relatively effortless. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a newcomer to duck, you'll notice that the skin is very thick. Don't 
remove it; the fat will add flavor and prevent the meat from drying out as it 
roasts. However, you can render out the excess fat, then roast the breast. 
Discard the skin before serving the meat, if you like. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many traditional duck recipes use a fruit-based sauce, the meat is 
already sweet enough for my taste. I prefer duck with sharp flavorings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this recipe the duck is marinated in a robust garlic - soy sauce - vinegar 
blend, then cooked with the marinade. Pan juices are cooked down for a 
full-bodied sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 ROAST DUCK BREAST WITH WILD RICE AND CURRANT PILAF 
</P>
<P>
 2 boneless duck breast halves 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, halved 
</P>
<P>
 1 sprig fresh rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon raspberry vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons red wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Rice and Currant Pilaf 
</P>
<P>
 Rub duck breast all over with garlic and fresh rosemary. Score skin, but do 
not cut through flesh. Place duck in heavy-bottomed skillet, skin-side down, 
and cook over medium heat to render fat, about 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine vinegars, wine, soy sauce, garlic and dried rosemary in shallow 
oven-proof glass or non-reactive metal roasting pan. Add duck. Set aside 30 
minutes to marinate. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare Wild Rice and Currant Pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Place pan with duck and marinade in oven and bake at 400 degrees (425 degrees, 
if pan is metal) until duck breast is browned on outside and rare inside, about 
15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, spoon pilaf onto 2 plates. Remove duck from pan and thinly slice. 
Remove and discard skin, if desired. Arrange on plate with pilaf. Pour pan 
liquids into small pan and cook over high heat until reduced by 1/4 and 
slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour pan liquids over duck and rice. Serve 
immediately. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Instead of raspberry and balsamic vinegars, substitute total of 2 
tablespoons red wine vinegar plus 1 teaspoon sugar, if desired. Wild Rice and 
Currant Pilaf 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup wild rice 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup long-grain or converted white rice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons currants 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in medium pan. Add onion and saute 5 minutes. Add wild rice and 
chicken broth. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, 20 
minutes. Add white rice and currants.  
</P>
<P>
 Cover again and simmer until rice is tender, but not mushy, 20 minutes. Season 
to taste with salt and white pepper. Makes 2 servings.

THIGH CUISINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With boneless chicken thighs now available in many markets, try substituting 
them in recipes that are usually made with chicken breasts. Though thighs take 
a little longer to cook, you'll be impressed with the results.  
</P>
<P>
 Thighs are tender, succulent dark meat. Unlike breasts, they do not dry out 
quickly in the pan. If you happen to overcook them or keep them warm longer 
than you had planned, you'll notice that they remain moist and their texture 
does not turn cottony. For the same reason, dishes made with this cut reheat 
well. Another good thing, they cost much less than breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're versatile -- you can grill, stir-fry or saute them, or use them in 
stews and casseroles. Cut boneless thighs into cubes or strips and cook them 
gently in tomato, curry or peanut sauces. Or create new dishes by replacing 
beef in stews with chicken thighs to make lighter, fast-cooking dishes. 
Boneless chicken needs only 10 to 15 minutes of braising, compared with the 45 
minutes required for chicken pieces with bones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To make satisfying pasta suppers, mix any of these speedy chicken stews or 
sautes with linguine, fettuccine, vermicelli or Chinese rice noodles. Other 
good accompaniments are brown or white rice, couscous, steamed potatoes, or 
baked or microwaved yams.  
</P>
<P>
 While the chicken is cooking, toss packaged lettuce or shredded cabbage or 
carrots with a little oil and vinegar to make a quick salad, and you'll have a 
tasty, hearty meal with a minimum of time and effort. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A friend of mine from Taipei taught me to make this light, easy, meal-in-one 
dish of chicken and vegetables seasoned with curry powder and soy sauce. A 
cross between a stir-fry and a quick braise, it would typically be served at 
home when a fast dinner is needed. For best flavor, use imported curry powder.  
</P>
<P>
 TAIPEI CHICKEN CURRY 
</P>
<P>
 3 medium carrots 
</P>
<P>
 3 medium boiling potatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound boneless and skinless chicken thighs 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, diced small 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons curry powder 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Hot cooked rice 
</P>
<P>
 Quarter carrots, then slice 1/4-inch thick. Peel potatoes and cut into 
1/2-inch cubes. Cut chicken into cubes of about 1x1/2x1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in wok, medium saute pan or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add 
onion and stir-fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add chicken and stir-fry 1 
1/2 minutes. Stir in curry powder. Add water, soy sauce, carrots and potatoes. 
Simmer, covered, 10 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Uncover and simmer until chicken and vegetables are tender, 5 to 10 minutes 
longer. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve with hot cooked rice. Makes 3 to 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For this quick dish, sauteed chicken and peppers are flavored with garlic, hot 
peppers and green onions, then tossed with tri-colored noodles. Use the three 
kinds of peppers to make the dish colorful.  
</P>
<P>
 PASTA-PEPPER MEDLEY WITH CHICKEN 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound boneless and skinless chicken thighs 
</P>
<P>
 3 sweet peppers, preferably 1 green, 1 red and 1 yellow 
</P>
<P>
 3 green onions 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 jalapeno chiles, seeded and ribs removed 
</P>
<P>
 4 medium cloves garlic  
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound tri-colored noodles 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon dried leaf thyme, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
 Trim chicken of fat. Cut meat into 1 1/2x1/2x1/4-inch strips. Halve sweet 
peppers lengthwise and remove seeds and ribs. Cut into 1/4-inch strips. Quarter 
white and light-green parts of green onions lengthwise, then cut into 1 
1/2-inch lengths. Chop jalapenos and garlic in food processor. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in large heavy skillet. Add chicken. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Saute over medium-high heat, stirring often, until 
tender, about 4 minutes. Transfer to plate with slotted spoon. Heat remaining 
oil in skillet over low heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Add jalapeno-garlic mixture, sweet peppers and dash salt. Cook, stirring 
often, 6 minutes. Add green onions. Cook until vegetables are tender but not 
brown, 4 minutes. Add chicken and juices from plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook pasta, uncovered, in large pan of boiling, salted water over high heat 
until tender but firm to bite, 2 to 5 minutes. Drain and transfer to large 
heated bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Reheat chicken mixture and stir in thyme. Add to pasta and toss. Adjust 
seasonings to taste. Makes 3 to 4 servings.

HARMAN TAKES A DEFENSIVE STANCE, STARTS BUILDING BRIDGES WITH GOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the GOP takes over Congress in January, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling 
Hills) will probably retain her committee assignments, her office space, even 
much of her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, with so many Democrats ousted or retired from office, she will make a 
leap in seniority in her second term. And with Republicans poised to increase 
defense spending, it could bode well for her South Bay district, where the 
aerospace business still looms large. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changeover still will mean a whole new world -- and a tougher time -- 
for Harman, who represents a district stretching from San Pedro to Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Clinton Administration contacts might not mean much if the President finds 
himself at an impasse with the Republican leadership. She was a strong 
supporter of the Family Medical Leave Act and the assault weapons ban, two 
measures the new GOP leaders have hinted they would try to repeal. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to increasing defense funding, she could be caught in a 
bind. She could get pressure from contractors to vote for defense budgets, even 
if President Clinton argues that more money for the military will hinder 
efforts to reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a hypocrite about this," Harman said last week. "We can't infinitely 
expand spending and reduce the deficit at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, political analysts, supporters and even Harman say that it will 
be more critical than ever for her to pursue a middle-of-the-road, if not 
conservative, approach in her second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moderate Republicans are going to forge alliances with the moderate 
Democrats, of which I am one," she said. "The potential for us as a center 
coalition to have an effect on issues is as large, or larger, than in the last 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman declared victory against Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks 
only last week, after final absentee ballots put Harman over the top by a thin 
margin of 812 votes. Brooks has not conceded, and may seek a recount or contest 
the election by trying to prove voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, everyone was saying 'Harman's going to win, she'll spend a lot of 
money,' " said Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican consultant. "Now she'll be 
spending much of her term wondering who's going to run against her. She's a 
sophomore in a minority party, and she's not going to have much influence." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in her first term, Harman cut through red tape to speed up the 
awards for defense conversion grants. But this term Republicans could comb 
through those grants for spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 And California's congressional delegation may no longer have as much influence 
since it could be virtually shut out of committee chairmanships, Republican or 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be more important than ever for them to work together," said Jan 
Denton, executive director of the Washington-based California Institute, a 
public interest group.  
</P>
<P>
 But with the delegation split -- 27 Democrats to 25 Republicans -- Harman 
could play a greater role in uniting its members. 
</P>
<P>
 She teamed with Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) earlier this year to help save 
the C-17 cargo plane, made by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Long Beach. And 
they plan to work together to keep the Long Beach Naval Shipyard off the base 
closure list in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to give a damn (about ideological clashes)," Horn said of the 
center coalition. "What we have to be responsive to is our constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn and Harman made appeals for bipartisanship on the House floor Tuesday. 
Harman also has toned down her rhetoric on the GOP's Contract With America, 
which she called the "Contract on America" during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman says she will spend time taking a look at some of its proposals, such 
as a middle-class tax cut. She already is on record in favor of a balanced 
budget amendment, expected to be a GOP priority in the first 100 days.  
</P>
<P>
 "I pledge to stay in the center and build the bipartisan coalitions we built 
the last time," Harman said. "I will be clear to voters. I want a strong 
defense, and I will also vote for deficit reduction at the same time." 
</P>

CITY THREATENS TO REVOKE CENTURY'S CABLE FRANCHISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disturbed by a deluge of complaints about Century Cable Television, Los 
Angeles city officials are threatening to begin proceedings to revoke the 
company's operating franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Telecommunications reports that 57% of the 
complaints the department receives about cable carriers concern Century, even 
though the company serves only 23% of the city's cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Telecommunications, which oversees cable 
providers in the city, has notified Century that the number of complaints about 
the company is higher than at any time in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Century has a grace period of roughly 45 days to rectify the situation before 
the department recommends to the Board of Telecommunications Commissioners, an 
appointed body, that the city begin revocation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're only as good as they deliver, and they're not delivering," said Susan 
Herman, general manager of the Department of Telecommunications. "They are the 
most complained-about company that we deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Century, which serves nearly 100,000 subscribers in West Los Angeles, 
Brentwood, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, among other areas, 
acknowledges that it has received the city's warning. But company officials 
attribute the current problems to growing pains in the cable industry, and they 
say they are taking steps that have already improved customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been conducting focus groups with our customers, and they have said 
they think it is becoming a new and better system," said Pennie Contos, general 
manager of Century's Santa Monica office, which handles much of the service for 
the Westside.  
</P>
<P>
 Customer satisfaction, to be sure, is not the only hurdle Century must 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all cable operators, Century faces new competition, primarily from direct 
satellite television broadcast services, which beam to satellite dishes secured 
on rooftops and offer programming nearly identical to cable. And telephone 
companies, which boast strong customer loyalty, are gearing up to offer video 
dial tone services. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Century's reputation in other Westside cities, though not 
sterling, seems better than it is in Los Angeles. In Beverly Hills and West 
Hollywood, for example, the company has actually improved its services, 
according to officials from both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our enforcement efforts," said John Risk, president of Communications 
Support Group, a consulting firm that has contracted with the City of Beverly 
Hills to oversee its cable franchise. "We call Century five times a day to see 
how long it takes them to answer the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Los Angeles it's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Telecommunications has determined that Century, based on the 
number of complaints it receives, is guilty of a material breach of its 
franchise, Herman says. Among the problems: responding too slowly to customer 
service calls, poor TV reception, distributing inaccurate information and 
billing customers for services they do not want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Century's customers are paying the highest rates in the city, but the service 
is the worst and the customers know it," Herman said. "It adds insult to 
injury." 
</P>
<P>
 To begin revocation proceedings, the city's Board of Telecommunications and, 
ultimately, the Los Angeles City Council, must first agree to revoke the 
company's franchise.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Century came close to losing its license to operate in Los Angeles 
over similar issues, Herman said. However, the company improved its customer 
service record and the city took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest attempt at a turnaround, the cable operator started hiring new 
staff this summer and has developed a strategy to improve its reputation.  
</P>
<P>
 The changes at Century start at the top, with new managers both on Century's 
regional level and in the Santa Monica office. Contos herself has been with the 
company only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the new managers oversee what the company terms "customer care 
etiquette." The cable company has also hired 20 new employees to make follow-up 
phone calls to Century customers who have received repair or installation 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, Century is experimenting with a new three-person customer 
service team that can solve simple technical problems over the telephone. The 
Santa Monica office plans to hire 10 additional customer service operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also developing a new program to train its customer service 
employees in telephone etiquette, cable technology, the details of the 
company's billing system and new programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair and installation services are on the increase at Century, the company 
says. The company will add Sundays to its current six-days-a-week schedule for 
house calls, and it will provide repair, installation and other types of 
technical services until 9 p.m., Contos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the business in a new way," Contos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, remain unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sylvia Siegel, president of Consumer Cable Cop, a consumer group based in 
San Francisco: "It's just a PR ploy."

TOPICS; FIELDS ADDS 'VANITIES' TO HER CROP OF PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Fields is busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days a week, she's on a TV sound stage, playing Regine in the Fox comedy 
series "Living Single," now in its second season. A couple of nights each week 
she teaches acting at the Harvest School of Performing Arts in West Hollywood, 
where she's also the executive director. During her summer hiatus from the TV 
show, she shot a short film, "Silent Bomb" -- which she co-wrote, executive 
produced and directed -- that recently had a screening at the Black Filmmakers 
Foundation. And in her off-moments, she's directing a play. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, make that re-directing. This past summer, Fields, 25, made her stage 
directorial debut with a revival of Jack Heifner's relationship comedy 
"Vanities" at The Complex in Hollywood. Last month, the production was the 
recipient of four NAACP Awards for local theater -- for best costumes (Fontella 
Boone), choreography (Wendy Robinson and Diann McCanon), supporting actress 
(Teresa Truesdale) and director (Fields). Tonight, the show reopens at the The 
Complex, with all but one member of the original cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the play tracks the lives of three best friends, from seniors in 
high school, to college, to their late 20s," explained Fields, who played 
Tootie on the TV series "Facts of Life" (1979-88). "I think of the title as a 
double-entendre -- referring to them being very vain, concerned with their 
appearance -- and also in terms of what they're interested in: boyfriends, 
sororities, wedding colors. As adults, they realize the shallowness of their 
lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the bare-bones staging, she says, "Jack (Heifner) specified that in his 
notes. The blocking and sets are minimal because it's a character study. 
Audiences are used to looking at elaborate props, . . . but here you're forced 
to focus on the characters. " 
</P>
<P>
 They include Joanne, whom Fields describes as "the shallowest one, walking the 
fine line between naivete and prissiness."  
</P>
<P>
 The director dubs Mary as "the sarcastic one, the experimenter of the group. 
She thinks everything should change." Kathy is "the organizer, the planner -- 
but scared of the reality of growing up, dealing with life." 
</P>
<P>
 In most of its past incarnations, "Vanities" (which had its local premiere at 
the Mark Taper Forum in 1976 and is often revived in college and community 
theater productions) has been performed by three white actresses. In this 
staging, nine black actresses play the three roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "How that happened was, I was sitting around my living room and there were 
nine of us," said Julie Ann Lucas, whose No Divaz Allow'd Productions (so named 
because she insists on actors "who can come without ego, be sincere about their 
talent and their ability to create lives off of a page") is producing the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were actress-friends I admire and wanted to work with," said Lucas, who 
is playing the high school-aged Kathy in "Vanities" and also co-starring and 
producing Crystal V. Rhodes' four-character "The Trip" at The Complex.  
</P>
<P>
 Fields says it was the piece's novel staging concept that initially drew her 
to the project. "By the grace of God, it works," she said. "The different 
actresses make it very clear which character is which." As for the text, she 
says: "You can hear in the dialogue -- these are not black girls in the South 
in 1963. This was not written with black people in mind. So the rhythms, the 
wording, are different." 
</P>
<P>
 Juggling that many bodies also has its problems. "There are a lot of 
challenges in making nine into three," acknowledges the Harlem-born Fields, who 
notes that rehearsals this time have been limited to "a couple of cleanup 
sessions in my trailer" at Fox.  
</P>
<P>
 "Vanities" opens tonight and plays Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. 
through Dec. 17. "The Trip" opens Sunday and plays Sundays at 8 p.m. through 
Dec. 18. The Complex is located at 6476 Santa Monica Blvd. in Hollywood. 
Tickets for each show are $12. For reservations, call (213) 466-1767.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; MUSEUM'S NEW STATUE HONORS WWII PILOT GEN. 
DOOLITTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General James B. Doolittle, the World War II fighter pilot who led a 
successful bombing raid on Tokyo, was honored with a bronze statue at the Santa 
Monica Airport's Museum of Flying at a ceremony on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bust, a larger-than-life bronze replica of the four-star general, with 
medals and ribbons decorating his lapels, was donated to the museum by the 
Santa Monica Bay Chapter 97 Royal Arch Masons, a nonprofit organization of 
which Doolittle was a member. 
</P>
<P>
 Doolittle, who died last year at 97, was perhaps best known for voluntarily 
leading 16 B-25 bombers on April 18, 1942, from the U.S. aircraft carrier 
Hornet in the Pacific to Tokyo, in one of the first successful raids on the 
Japanese mainland.  
</P>
<P>
 The bronze bust is the first statue of an aviation figure donated to the 
museum.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is a great addition to our collection," said Bob Convey, director of 
operations for the Museum.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; OIL SPILL FORCES FIRM TO PAY $50,000 TO HEAL THE 
BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An oil spill in Los Angeles Harbor has brought a $50,000 windfall to Heal the 
Bay, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese shipping firm Shinko Maritime Co. Ltd. was ordered to make the 
contribution and pay another $50,000 in fines when it pleaded no contest on 
Monday to a charge of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 About 630 gallons of heavy oil spilled into the harbor on Aug. 9, 1993, when 
the freighter Tropical Dawn, chartered by Shinko, was refueling, said Los 
Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Booms that were placed around the Tropical Dawn contained most of the spill, 
but the pilings and seawall beneath about 1,600 feet of pier had to be 
steam-cleaned, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heal the Bay spokesman Roger Gorke said he hoped the fine, ordered by Los 
Angeles Municipal Court Judge Barry Taylor, would be a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these companies think that environmental pollution is just another 
cost of doing business," Gorke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heal the Bay, which has an annual operating budget of $500,000 to $750,000, 
focuses on problems including the flow of debris that washes into the ocean 
from area streets, Gorke said. SUSAN WOODWARD

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Malibu will employ Pepperdine University students under a 
federally subsidized work-study program coordinated through the university. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will hire three to five students who are eligible to participate in 
the special program as part-time community service aides. They will perform a 
variety of tasks, including general clerical, telecommunications, light 
administrative, research and recreation work. Under the program, the university 
pays 25% of the student employees' hourly wage, while the federal government 
covers the balance. The program, which will continue through June, 1995, is 
aimed at giving students community service experience while offering free 
services to municipalities and nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The work-study program promotes community service activity among students. It 
is part of new provisions that were amended in 1992 and last year of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965. Some of the participating nonprofit Malibu agencies are 
the Streisand Center of Conservancy Studies, Camp David Gonzalez, a juvenile 
work camp, Project Drug Free and Children's Creative Workshop.

 The Culver City council voted Monday to permit the city of Beverly Hills to 
place two radio receivers and an antenna on the Continental Cablevision Tower 
in Baldwin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The remote radio equipment will allow Beverly Hills to complete its emergency 
radio system. The antenna and receivers are also expected to improve 
communications between Culver City and Beverly Hills during emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the radio equipment will only be used for public safety, Beverly Hills 
will just be charged for installation costs and the use of Continental's 
facility.  
</P>

<P>
 Santa Monica's controversial Sunset Park traffic plan stalled this week when 
the City Council failed to reach an agreement on how to best mitigate commuter 
traffic in the city's southeast neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to oppose a plan that would have placed 24-hour turn 
restrictions along Pico and Ocean boulevards, but it failed to come up with an 
alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a public hearing last week, more than 50 people addressed the council, 
appearing to be evenly split between endorsing the plan or sending it back to 
city staff for more study. The speakers were primarily from two rival 
neighborhood groups who for years have been unable to come to an agreement on 
the best traffic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's own lack of consensus Tuesday leaves the matter open for staff 
or the neighborhood associations to return with any of several proposed traffic 
plans after two newly elected Santa Monica council members are seated next 
month.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; RISING FROM THE ASHES; THE BLAZE THAT DEVASTATED MALIBU 
LAST YEAR ALSO HELPED BRING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Disaster tests any community. But for fledgling Malibu, incorporated in 1991, 
last year's firestorm ranks as perhaps the city's defining event. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year has passed since flames destroyed 270 houses, stripped the 
rugged hillsides of vegetation and changed the face of this seaside community 
of 11,730 residents, many of whom came to Malibu for privacy and scenic beauty. 
The city government, which was still in the process of getting its municipal 
legs when the disaster hit, also was altered by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some proclaim the fire as the city's coming of age. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a chemical change in this community," said Karen York, who along 
with her husband, Arnold, owns the weekly newspaper Malibu Times and founded 
Operation Recovery, a support group for fire victims. "There was outreach and 
support from the whole community. There is a bond. We are like a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of the disaster, Operation Recovery was formed, holding weekly 
meetings that became a lifeline for some residents, who called themselves 
"burn-outs." Out of mutual sorrow, many fire survivors who had known each other 
only superficially became close friends. Political foes set aside differences 
to work toward common interests. And the community, often a dichotomy of 
heavily developed east Malibu versus largely rural west Malibu, worked 
seamlessly to aid survivors of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city grew up," said California Coastal Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, 
whose house burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing about 500 east Malibu residents who had lost their homes, 
Operation Recovery quickly became a political force. Its members persuaded city 
leaders to alter building regulations and begin replacing the La Costa 
neighborhood's water system, which was inadequate for fighting fires. (La Costa 
is a hillside neighborhood in east Malibu, just off Pacific Coast Highway 
between Rambla Pacifico and Carbon Canyon.) 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall, where some residents had accused the City Council of 
micro-managing the staff, city employees were given broader latitude to handle 
the crisis. Among other changes, seven additional employees were hired, time 
was set aside on the council's weekly agenda for fire survivors to speak, and 
building permit fees and planning review requirements were waived. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fire victims have complained that city's inevitable red tape slowed 
rebuilding efforts, but they and others say that, despite the delays, the 
ordeal of the fire helped local government mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council has had to evolve from a being a homeowners association to 
being a professional body," said Ron Goldman, a local architect. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David N. Carmany agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most big cities develop their personalities in the first decade 
(after incorporation), and this has helped the city of Malibu," Carmany said. 
"Before the fire, it felt like 'Mayberry RFD'; now we have voice mail. . . . 
There is definitely a resiliency, a can-do spirit here. People are going to 
find solutions to their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jean Craig, a 10-year resident of Malibu whose home in La Costa burned, 
the majority of fire survivors say they knew their neighbors by face but not by 
name. After their homes were destroyed, shell-shocked residents gathered at 
Operation Recovery meetings to confront what seemed an endless parade of 
insurmountable problems -- inadequate insurance, burned foundations not covered 
in policies or tough, expensive geological conundrums. The group grew close 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the fire, I used to see this kindly man I would say hello to as I was 
walking my dog by his house," said Craig, who is writing a first-person account 
of the fire and its aftermath for a book she plans to self-publish. "We worked 
together to rebuild our homes. . . . If I had a crisis, I could go two doors 
down and knock on the door and Zane (Meckler) would be there. There are six 
people I could do that with now whom I could not do that with before." 
</P>
<P>
 Meckler, a 21-year resident of Malibu and a former president of the Malibu 
Democratic Club, says that in the six months after the fire, Operation Recovery 
meetings were like religious gatherings. He says the sessions were both painful 
and therapeutic. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors would see each other at the Operation Recovery meetings and "the 
more harried they would become, the more (they) would huddle together and say, 
'Whaddya think,' " Meckler said. "Our friends are now people all over the hill. 
. . . These are live human beings now, not just names on a list. . . . We check 
on each other. . . . A lot of things in common were unearthed by the fire. 
Jean's now not only a neighbor but a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Although largely untouched by the fire, west Malibu residents held a 
fund-raiser for Operation Recovery. Churches, a synagogue and other groups 
helped residents get basics such as clothing and shoes, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire did create a sensitivity in the people of west Malibu who thought, 
'There but for the grace of God go I,' " said Jody Stump, who lost her La Costa 
home. "Before, there was this strange schism. It still exists, but there is a 
sensitivity and tolerance that we're all Malibu-ites." 
</P>
<P>
 Support from Malibu's business community also forged new bonds. Dry cleaners 
offered free cleaning of smoke-damaged clothes, restaurants served meals 
gratis, and nurseries gave away plants. And residents responded in kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I threw a bar mitzvah for our son and normally we would buy at a 
discount store," said Michael Rubin, who lost his home in the fire. "But I 
said, 'Let's give the business to Pete,' (the owner of Country Liquor). We had 
about a $500 bill. All these people lost the bulk of their business last year. 
We wanted to give it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was residents' newfound cooperation demonstrated more tangibly than 
through Operation Recovery. The idea for the group came when a bereft Arnold 
York, whose La Costa home burned to the ground, called an Oakland survivors 
group created after the 1991 fire there, looking for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us, 'If you are going to rebuild, you're going to have to get 
organized, because it was a crisis a week,' " said York. Craig says York in 
many ways became a visible symbol of recovery efforts, much as actor Edward 
James Olmos did by sweeping up broken glass in the days immediately after the 
Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 With a brain trust of talent -- including lawyers, architects, writers, 
artists and entrepreneurs -- the fire survivors had the makings of a small but 
potent lobbying force. Subgroups were created to haggle with insurance 
companies and address such fire prevention questions as the creation of a 
volunteer fire department and a new water system. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, it was almost a 12-step program, I'm not kidding," Arnold 
York said as he sat in his Malibu Times office at the bottom of Las Flores 
Canyon Road. "It was solace, but we also had an agenda to rebuild. We told our 
insurance companies that if they didn't behave themselves we would issue them a 
report card. We focused political energy on them and told them we were going to 
make what they said public so they could be held accountable. We wanted to hold 
their feet to the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure also was applied to both the city and the Fire Department. Malibu 
Times reporters doggedly covered all rebuild issues, supplemented by editorials 
on the subject, mostly written by York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Malibu Times became a mouthpiece for all of us in the sense that it had 
anything you needed to know in it, from information about the Red Cross (to) 
recovery groups or how to reach the state Insurance Department," Meckler said. 
</P>
<P>
 York, a lawyer who bought the newspaper in 1987, had been seen as a vitriolic 
critic of the city government. But he and other critics set aside most of their 
differences with the city to work toward fire relief, according to members of 
Operation Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire brought together strange bedfellows," said Art London, a retired 
attorney whose Carbon Mesa home burned and who has mostly disagreed with York 
about local politics. "People who are hostile to the city and people who are 
supportive of it worked together for a common cause. Differences were not 
relevant. It made some of these people sound like apologists." 
</P>
<P>
 Counted among the accomplishments of Operation Recovery is a set of new 
"custom development criteria" for the La Costa neighborhood. Established in the 
late 1920s, the area was one of the first developments in Malibu. About 110 of 
La Costa's 250 houses burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by fire survivors in the neighborhood, La Costa residents organized into a 
homeowners association. After getting signatures from a majority of residents, 
the association successfully lobbied the city to increase the neighborhood's 
allowable house size from 1,885 square feet to 3,400 square feet for the area's 
typical 50-by-100-foot lot. The new standard was more generous than the 10% 
house-size increase that the city initially granted to fire victims because 
house sizes in La Costa had remained largely unchanged since the community was 
first developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get 60% of Malibu residents to agree to anything is nothing short of 
extraordinary," York said. "We had to move houses, change views. It wasn't 
easy. People had to set aside their own private desires to do what was best for 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu's political complexion also changed, according to some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fire, the City Council was loathe to relax its strict building 
restrictions, responding largely to pressure from west Malibu residents 
concerned about protecting open space. But after the blaze, the council was 
forced to moderate its restrictive stance somewhat to meet the reconstruction 
needs of east Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the change was the pressure from La Costa residents' to 
increase house sizes -- and the election to the council last April of Jeffrey 
Jennings, described as a moderate on home-building restrictions compared with 
some other council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "A political bloc formed in east Malibu," said Sara Wan, whose husband, Larry 
Wan, is a former mayor of Malibu. "East Malibu impacted the election and 
Jennings got elected because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most important, Operation Recovery negotiated with the 
Metropolitan Water District and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
replace La Costa's water system, the only one in the city being upgraded in the 
fire's aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told by the Fire Department that we couldn't have put out a grease 
fire in the kitchen," Karen York said. "We are getting a new water system. The 
city didn't get in our way, but (it) they didn't lead either." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the tragedy clearly affected city government. There was doubt 
that the young city, with just 12 full-time employees, could handle the demands 
of cleanup and rebuilding. To "staff up," Carmany hired seven more full-time 
employees, mostly in the building, planning and public works departments. To do 
so, Carmany said, the city cut its spending on outside consultants and used the 
savings to pay for the new hires. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no fire survivors are pleased with the prolonged process of 
rebuilding, no one interviewed for this article seemed to regret casting their 
vote for cityhood years back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire demonstrated to people the real advantage of having a local 
government because the city was able to respond to the fire victims the way the 
county never could," said Mayor Jeffrey W. Kramer. "We were able to waive fees, 
rewrite the building codes so they could build bigger and . . . extend the time 
to apply for rebuild permits. We provided a local sounding board where people 
could let off steam." 
</P>
<P>
 And, inside City Hall, the disaster changed the way city staff members did 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council wasn't confident in their own staff," said Bob Benard, 
Malibu's former planning director who recently left to take a job with the city 
of Long Beach. "The council had to be in charge of everything. . . . After the 
fire, we couldn't wait for the council to review everything. Between us, we had 
hundreds of years of municipal experience. We made code and policy changes 
without sacrificing their principles." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire also gave Malibu the opportunity to correct a decades-old problem in 
lower Las Flores Canyon, which is now slated to undergo a $21-million landslide 
and flood-control project. The ambitious project was negotiated by Carmany and 
other city staff, who successfully brokered a deal under which the federal and 
state governments will, respectively, absorb 75% and 25% of the project's cost. 
 
</P>
<P>
 More generally, residents' real-life struggles with rebuilding may be 
prompting the city to take a less restrictive approach to land-use planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the city moved into the role of advocacy for residents' development 
interests," Carmany said. "There has been a healthy skepticism regarding 
development in Malibu. (With the fire) we had a large percentage of residents 
wanting to rebuild their homes who had to sit on the other side of the 
(building department) counter."  
</P>
<P>
 So far, only two of the residents who lost their homes have rebuilt. Arnold 
York speculates that it will be another year before there are many houses back 
on the hillsides ravaged by fire. York says he is looking forward to retiring 
from his post as impresario of Operation Recovery, but the group won't dissolve 
until the majority of burn-outs have rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 But as painful as it has been, he said, the consensus is that the community 
and city came together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government around here was a hobby," York said. "It has become a necessity."

OUT AND ABOUT / 'A JIVEBOMBER'S CHRISTMAS': ADVERSITY AND HOPE IN INTERNMENT 
CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was something she had wanted to do for years. So, when the Japanese 
American National Museum approached Saachiko Magwili to write about the 
Japanese American experience during World War II, it was a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 An accomplished performer and writer, Magwili had always wanted to write about 
her childhood experiences at Heart Mountain, Wyo., a Japanese American 
internment camp where she spent two years imprisoned with her mother and sister 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Magwili -- with the help of her husband, Dom, who is an actor, writer and 
director -- began work earlier this year on the project. Building on the 
concept of celebrating Christmas in a camp, the pair set out to create a 
performance piece that not only presented an important historical perspective, 
but also provided a sense of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strange things come out in the writing," Saachiko Magwili said. "The camp 
material resonates certain things for me. It isn't just about myself as an 
adult but also what my feelings were as a child and what I experienced even 
though I didn't understand a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The performance, "A Jivebomber's Christmas," is set in a desert camp. A young 
woman's brother goes off to join the United States' armed forces. His earnest 
sister promises to do what she can to keep up the spirits of the family and 
other internees during the upcoming holidays. She faces resistance until she 
meets a slick, zoot-suited internee, nicknamed "the Jivebomber," who suggests 
having a holiday dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a combination of songs, dances and dialogue, the cast of five delivers a 
powerful message about life during this painful era in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese Americans were essentially fighting on two fronts -- bigotry at home 
and fascism abroad," said Dom Magwili, who studied at the American Conservancy 
Theater in San Francisco and is directing the performance. "The story tries to 
bridge the gap between the choices people made on both sides (while) trying to 
do their best through it all." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is presented in conjunction with the exhibition "America's 
Concentration Camps: Remembering the Japanese American Experience," which is 
being held at the Japanese American National Museum in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (subject) has been a source of deep division in our community because it 
was a patriotic war," said Darrell Kunitomi, a Los Angeles resident who 
performs in the production and whose parents were also imprisoned at Heart 
Mountain. "Our show and the exhibit tries to provide some healing perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Performances will be held Dec. 9 at 7:30 p.m., Dec. 10 and 11 at 4 p.m. 
Japanese American National Museum, 369 E. 1st St., Los Angeles. Reservations 
required. Tickets are $4. Information: (213) 625-0414. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

 RISING SONS 
</P>
<P>
 When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Lucious Allen and Walt Hazzard played basketball at 
UCLA, they were part of the Bruins' record 10 NCAA championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Jr., Bakir Allen and Rasheed Hazzard sought their fortunes 
outside Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to their respective coaches, the three players are doing well 
despite carrying the burden of being the sons of well-known basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar Jr., the former Brentwood High standout, is a redshirt freshman 
at Valparaiso in basketball-crazed Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We truly like Kareem," Valparaiso Coach Homer Drew said. "He is his own 
person and is being judged not by his name, but his personality. No one here 
cares if Kareem is the son of a famous basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakir Allen, the former Crossroads standout, is a sophomore reserve guard at 
UC Santa Barbara. Rasheed Hazzard, the former Venice standout, is a backup 
point guard at George Washington in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Abdul-Jabbar recently turned 18 and has grown an inch since high 
school. The 6-foot-6 Abdul-Jabbar had a 3.4 grade-point average during the 
midterm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a quick learner on the floor," Drew said. "He's also really improved his 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 In Indiana, standout prep basketball players can gain as much notoriety as 
their professional kin. Drew knows the pressures placed on promising collegiate 
basketball players. His son, Bryce, was named "Mr. Basketball," a honor 
bestowed to the best high school player in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had his choice of 50 schools," Drew said. Indiana, Kansas, Notre Dame, 
Clemson, Syracuse, Stanford to name just a few. "But he chose to play for his 
dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really have two celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen struggled as a freshman at Santa Barbara after averaging 20.4 points, 
6.4 rebounds, and 5.3 assists as a senior at Crossroads. He averaged 2.7 
points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.2 assists as a freshman and shot 29.8% from the 
field and 43.6% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the bottom line is that his freshman-year statistics did not blow 
anyone out of the water," Santa Barbara Coach Jerry Pimm said. "It's not 
unusual for a freshman to shoot poorly. They don't know a good shot from a bad 
one and spend too much time thinking about what they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Bakir is progressing well. He'll see a lot more playing time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard averaged 17.4 points, four rebounds and eight assists at Venice. He's 
backing up senior point guard Omo Moses and junior Vaughn Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rasheed comes from a great basketball background -- he's been in a gym since 
infancy," George Washington Coach Mike Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been exposed to enough good basketball and basketball players to know 
what it takes (to be successful)." QUICK EXIT 
</P>
<P>
 Former Westchester High standout Jason Sanders has quit the San Diego State 
basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt my future was in jeopardy. I was unhappy with my situation," Sanders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was a sophomore backup to point guard Chad Nelson. He scored 37 points 
in 20 games under former Coach Tony Fuller, who is now at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztec's new coach is Fred Trenkle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders watched from the stands Monday night as the Aztecs defeated Southern 
California College, 76-54, at San Diego State's Peterson Gym. TOURNAMENT TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads, Palisades, Santa Monica, University, Venice and St. Monica began 
competition Wednesday in the St. Monica tournament as the high school boys' 
basketball season began this week. Beverly Hills started its season Wednesday 
at the Loyola tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best games of the season will take place today at Washington High 
when Westchester, one of the favorites to win the City 4-A Division title, 
plays perennial power Washington at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets feature one of the City's best backcourts in 6-foot-4 senior Ben 
Sanders and 5-10 junior Danny Walker. Washington is led by 6-6 forward Robert 
Gordon-Lamar and 6-2 guard Patrick Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53rd annual Beverly Hills Invitational begins its 16-team tournament 
Monday. Newhall Hart, Loyola, Palisades and Santa Monica are among the teams 
entered in the field. FOOTBALL FAREWELL 
</P>
<P>
 Venice was the last of the area's top 10 football teams to be eliminated from 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell beat the Gondoliers, 29-3, Nov. 23 in the City Section quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles outgained the Gondoliers, 343-39, and had four sacks. Cornerbacks 
Omar Guerrero and Dulio Orellana each intercepted passes to help the Eagles 
advance to the semifinals for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell didn't need help -- thanks to the play of Venice's special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Punting deep in their own territory, the Gondoliers snapped the ball out of 
the end zone to give Bell a 2-0 lead midway through the first quarter. After 
the free-kick, the Eagles drove 56 yards to increase their lead to 9-0 after an 
11-yard pass from Gus Valenzuela to Dicky Purcell. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-yard punt in the third quarter gave the Eagles possession at the 
Gondolier 20-yard line. Bell needed only three plays to increase its lead to 
29-0 on a two-yard run by Vern Benard. STREAK STOPPER 
</P>
<P>
 Faith Baptist defeated Brentwood, 60-26, to claim the Southern Section 
Eight-Man Large Schools Division championship Saturday at Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Contenders' victory ended the Eagles' 34-game winning streak and handed 
Brentwood a home loss for the first time since a 1990 playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Judd Granzow paced Faith Baptist (10-1), rushing for 127 yards in 
16 carries and scoring on runs of 30, eight and two yards. Granzow completed 
three of six passes for 96 yards, including two for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood finished 10-1. NCAA WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's water polo team finished fourth and Pepperdine fifth at the NCAA 
championships last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams squared off Friday in the first round of the eight-team tournament 
at Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach and the fifth-seeded Bruins beat the 
fourth-seeded Waves, 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty big win for our guys," UCLA Coach Guy Baker said. "I thought we 
did a really good job of containing (Pepperdine's Alan) Herrmann, who might be 
the best two-meter man in the nation. Only one of our guys has been to this 
tournament before -- Scott Turner -- and he told me that I barely was able to 
get him in for garbage time." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Turner's time was quality time. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, a senior, was named to the all-tournament first team and scored four 
goals in three games.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (17-14) lost in the semifinals, 9-5, to eventual champion Stanford, and 
lost the third-place game to California, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' Luther Weidner, a freshman, was named to the all-tournament second 
team, and Jeremy-Braxton Brown, a sophomore, received honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine had an easier time after losing to UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 The Waves (17-9), beat eighth-seeded Air Force, 10-5, in the fifth-place 
semifinal and sunk Navy, 13-10, to garner fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrmann, a sophomore, was named to the all-tournament second team and scored 
eight goals in three games. SEAN WATERS and ARA NAJARIAN

SPOTLIGHT; CARRYING THE DAY; AIDS IN THE ARTS AND THE ABSENCE IT CREATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Zan Dubin covers the arts for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Family and friends wept audibly at the memorial held earlier this year in 
Newport Beach for Orange County native Gregory Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Laughter broke through the tears, however, as some reminisced about the warm, 
witty world-renowned ballet dancer. Lois Osborne wished that her son would be 
remembered, above all, for his radiant smile, for the way "he lit up a room." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way choreographer David Allen remembers Osborne, and it's the 
upbeat quality he hoped to convey in his ballet inspired by the late dancer to 
be performed tonight at Irvine Barclay Theatre as 10 county arts groups join 
for one of many local observances of the sixth annual Day Without Art. 
</P>
<P>
 "The piece is really a celebration of life," said Molly Lynch, whose troupe, 
Ballet Pacifica, will dance "Capriole Suite." "It was inspired by Greg's 
infectious enthusiasm and love of life." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-minute ballet is part of a free evening of live music, theater and 
dance organized for the international commemoration, which aims to remind the 
public that AIDS has cut disproportionately deep into the arts community, the 
figurative heart and soul of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8 p.m. performance, staged entirely by volunteers, is among the most 
ambitious Day Without Art undertakings ever staged here. Other events around 
the county include about a half-dozen activities at UC Irvine and a dance 
lecture-demonstration at Newport Harbor Art Museum, which will include 
information about AIDS. Collectively, the events amount to one of the county's 
busiest Day Without Art observances. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Barclay performance, organizers are looking to fill the 750-seat 
Irvine theater. In past years, no more than 350 people attended similar 
collaborations, held at noon in smaller venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this event will be more accessible to a larger number of people," 
said co-chairman Timothy B. Dunn, Opera Pacific spokesman. "At lunchtime, 
people had limited time to get to the performance and get back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Like "Capriole Suite," the program will aim for a celebratory approach, 
despite its raison d'etre, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's intended to celebrate artists, our colleagues," Dunn said, "and the 
happiness and fulfillment they've brought to everyone's lives with their 
creative output." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, more than 3,500 Orange County residents have contracted the AIDS 
virus. More than 2,030 have died of the disease, which gave rise to the first 
Day Without Art in 1989. Visual AIDS, a New York coalition, organized the 
inaugural commemoration to coincide with the United Nations' annual World AIDS 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, scores of artists worldwide and roughly 6,200 arts institutions -- 
up about 1,000 from last year -- are expected to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's Barclay program, hosted by KUSC-FM (91.5) deejay Bonnie Grice, 
includes performances by the 65-member Pacific Chorale Intermediate Children's 
Chorus (four short songs), Pacific Symphony (two movements from Mendelssohn's 
Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor), Opera Pacific (works by Delibes and Verdi) and 
the Master Chorale of Orange County (providing taped works for background 
music). 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory actors will give "Shadow," by SCR's literary manager 
John Glore, its first reading. In the 10-minute play, a man dying of AIDS 
complications dreams about a reunion of his friends and family after his death. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the evening, voluntary contributions to 10 county AIDS services 
organizations will be accepted. The agencies' representatives will distribute 
informational pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Arts troupes that are not lending on-stage talent, such as the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society, the Orange County Performing Arts Center and Imagination 
Celebration of Orange County, are providing publicity or other technical 
support for the event.

 Everyone involved has known or admired from afar a singer, actor, designer, 
musician or dancer claimed by the rapacious epidemic that has forever halted 
the creativity of budding choreographer and Joffrey Ballet star Edward Stierle, 
veteran rocker Freddie Mercury, Rock Hudson, Rudolf Nureyev and scores of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Day Without Art "is a very valid concern for all of us in the arts," said 
co-chairman Christopher Burrill, operations manager of the Irvine theater. The 
Irvine Barclay Theatre Encore Circle support group is contributing $650 to 
cover the night's rental fee, Burrill said. Ushers and other theater employees 
are working for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major local effort, "Artists & AIDS Project" at UC Irvine, will 
feature a dramatization of literary works by such writers as Tony Kushner, who 
won the 1993 Pulitzer prize for his AIDS-related play "Angels in America." The 
school's multidisciplinary remembrance, running today through Sunday, is the 
brainchild of Lilia Illes, the fine-arts department's production manager.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've honestly gotten a little tired of going through my Rolodex and seeing 
names of people who are no longer with us," Illes said. "We've always done 
something at the art gallery. Now we're expanding that to the entire school (of 
fine arts)." 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine's Fine Arts Gallery has for the past two years staged its non-juried 
"AIDS: Community Responses" exhibit of work by artists and amateurs. But Illes 
said she wanted to expand the school's Day Without Art effort after 
encountering "a lot of people who said they would never be affected by AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 "That to me is appalling," Illes said. "How can anyone say it's just a gay 
white man's disease? It's not. . . . You don't have to believe in the gay life 
style or support it, but that does not invalidate the disease. . . . The way 
the disease is spreading, ultimately it will be very difficult not to know 
someone who is in some way affected." 
</P>
<P>
 Drama alumnus James Calleri conceived and will direct "JACK/of all trade: New 
Voices on the AIDS Crisis" -- a theatrical quilt of literary work, including a 
Kushner poem -- today through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The AIDS-related plays out there now only touch on AIDS metaphorically," 
Calleri, who lives in New York, said in a phone interview from UCI. "I feel 
like if we're going to talk about AIDS, this devastating thing, then we should 
really go for the jugular. I found writers whom I think are really speaking 
truthfully about it without pulling any punches." 
</P>
<P>
 A one-act play by David Greenspan, another UC Irvine alumnus, is part of the 
dramatization, as is video footage of ACT-UP/New York, an AIDS activist group. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have died from AIDS donate their bodies to ACT-UP to use for 
political purposes," Calleri said. "We've carried one man's body, in an open 
casket, through downtown New York, and taken people's ashes to Washington, 
D.C., and dumped them over the White House fence." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's dance department and Women's Choral Ensemble will stage separate 
events for its "Artists & AIDS Project." 
</P>
<P>
 Several UCI activities are free, but $1 from each admission to ticketed events 
(such as "JACK/of all trade") will be donated to the AIDS Clinical Research 
Program of the school's Department of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Newport Harbor Art Museum today, AIDS prevention will be the focus of a 
dance program for about 120 Rancho Alamitos High School students. San 
Clemente's Coast Ballet Theatre will perform classical and modern ballet 
excerpts for its previously scheduled lecture-demo that is part of the museum's 
ongoing Art & Music project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the great tragedy for us personally," said Lawrence Rosenberg, the 
troupe's co-artistic director, "is that people in the international arts 
community have contracted HIV when it could have been avoided." 
</P>
<P>
 A representative from the county's AIDS Response Program will offer 
information at the museum, which will also display the painting "Elysian" 
(1980) by Jay Phillips, who died of AIDS in 1987, and waive admission for all 
visitors today. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time Day Without Art participants include the Southern California Arts 
Institution in Laguna Beach. Three computer design students will create an 
AIDS-related installation to be placed today in Laguna Art Museum's lobby 
windows along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down the road, the Laguna Playhouse will present a staged reading of Troy 
Tradup's play "The Time at the End of This Time" on Monday, the only night that 
the theater is not presenting its season subscription play "Inspecting Carol." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an accessible piece that I think people are going to find entertaining, 
heartwarming and uplifting," said playhouse executive director Richard A. 
Stein. "It also clearly depicts the tragedy of AIDS and how families deal with 
it when it affects them." 
</P>
<P>
 All proceeds from the $10 ticket sales will benefit Laguna Shanti, an AIDS 
support service agency, Stein said. (The playhouse's usual Day Without Art 
contribution, "Lagunatix," an original musical lampooning the city, will be 
staged Feb. 24 and 25, Stein said, giving the theater more time to prepare the 
popular show, which typically sells out.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Orange Coast College Art Gallery, which is closed today in 
recognition of the event, recently completed an exhibit in which seven 
California artists portrayed personal reflections on AIDS. A related panel on 
AIDS education was held two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Why wasn't all that scheduled to coincide with Day Without Art? 
</P>
<P>
 "I purposely wanted to do our AIDS show in November," said gallery director 
Irini Valleri-Rickerson, "and next year we'll do it in the spring, to really 
remind people that this is an issue we should be thinking about throughout the 
year."

EVERYTHING BUT THE CHURL; EBTG GOT ITS NAME THE WAY THE SEX PISTOLS DID, BUT 
THAT'S WHERE THE COMPARISON ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the Sex Pistols, who named themselves after a punk fashion boutique, 
Everything But the Girl appropriated its name from an English commercial 
establishment. The phrase was the slogan of a furniture store in Hull, where 
musical partners Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt met as university students in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Sex Pistols, Everything But the Girl has had nothing to do with 
rude, confrontational noises, turbulent, controversial image-mongering, and 
self-immolation as a career move. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorn, the primary singer, and Watt, who supports her on guitars and 
keyboards, harmonizes, and takes the occasional lead vocal, have spent the past 
10 years fashioning a low-keyed, well-crafted and diverse brand of intelligent 
pop. 
</P>
<P>
 A more accurate name might be Everything's Possible Because of the Girl. 
Thorn, a shy performer who does not cultivate a glamorous image, has a lovely, 
clear alto voice that tugs at a listener's feelings without any showy straining 
for effect. Over the course of eight U.S. albums (none of them hits here, 
although EBTG does well in England, Europe and Japan), the duo -- which plays 
sold-out shows at the Coach House on Monday and Tuesday -- has tried an array 
of settings for that voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Cool, urbane, seductively rhythmic songs, akin to the jazzy R & B style 
popularized by Sade, have been one facet of EBTG's output. On the 1986 album, 
"Baby, the Stars Shine Bright," the duo punched up its sound with horns and 
strings, with results that bring back memories of Dionne Warwick's classic '60s 
collaborations with Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The album also included a 
couple of nods to the pop-country of Patsy Cline and the R & B-country of Ray 
Charles. But the duo didn't pursue those country strains, leaving the field 
open for k.d. lang a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorn and Watt, who write songs both separately and together, came up with 
their most personal collection on "Idlewild," a sparsely produced 1988 album. 
By 1990, they had switched labels (moving from Sire to Atlantic) and 
strategies, producing, in "The Language of Life," a slick pop-R & B album that 
featured high-profile L.A. session players, as well as a solo turn by the late 
jazz saxophonist Stan Getz on Watt's stark, rueful lounge ballad, "The Road." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Thorn and Watt seem to have decided, quite rightly, that for them 
less is more. The duo's three releases since 1991 have been dominated by 
sparsely rendered folk-pop that forms an ideal backdrop for Thorn's voice. In 
these minimalist settings, the lyrics can have a greater impact, and EBTG is 
often able to bestow them with psychological insights and evocative scenarios 
that give staying power to what otherwise might become a routine venting of 
melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
 Another facet of Thorn and Watt's work has been a penchant for covering pop 
nuggets from such sources as Tom Waits, Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello and 
Crazy Horse (their reading of the Horse's gorgeous sans-Neil Young ballad "I 
Don't Want to Talk About It" was a big hit in England). A few months ago, they 
were reportedly translating noise-rock into mellifluous pop by doing a version 
of a Sonic Youth song in their live set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amplified Heart," the current album by Everything But the Girl, is one of 
their best. The L.A. session men have been replaced by veterans of the British 
folk-rock movement of the late-'60s: bassist Danny Thompson and drummer Dave 
Mattacks. Richard Thompson, the figurehead of that movement, guests as lead 
guitarist on "25th December," Watt's poignant depiction of the knotted strands 
of pride and resentment that can keep close kin emotionally distant. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, besides the Coach House date, Watt will be marking his 32nd 
birthday. (Thorn, who is his romantic as well as musical partner, is two months 
older.) The couple may have a greater appreciation than most thirtysomethings 
of the value of being able to count off another year. During 1992, Watt was 
stricken by Churg Strauss Syndrome, a rare disorder of the autoimmune system 
that almost proved fatal and left him debilitated for about a year before he 
recovered. Longtime fans of EBTG will note a marked change from the the 
round-faced, cherubic-looking Watt of past album covers, to the gaunt figure on 
"Amplified Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The duo has said the ordeal influenced the downcast mood of the album, but 
they resolved not to approach the subject of illness literally in their music. 
Those needing an upbeat note can find it in the album track "We Walk the Same 
Line," a winsome declaration of the will to endure through troubles. It sounds 
like a prime Fleetwood Mac cut with Thorn and Watt doing their best 
approximation of Christine McVie backed by Lindsey Buckingham.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK

 Various Artists 
</P>
<P>
 "Tulare Dust: A Songwriters' Tribute to Merle Haggard" 
</P>
<P>
 HighTone  
</P>
<P>
 This is the other tribute to Hag, and there isn't a better present you could 
give a country music fan. Where October's high-profile "Mama's Hungry Eyes" 
album boasts a load of top country stars, this one has just one bona-fide hit 
maker: Dwight Yoakam, whose solo reading of "Holding Things Together" is a 
reminder of just how big an influence, as a singer and a writer, the man from 
Bakersfield has had on the Kentucky string bean. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquee power or no, the other 14 respected singer-songwriters on "Tulare 
Dust" give performances that couldn't be more loving or more sensitive. 
Arkansas-born Iris DeMent suffuses "Big City" with old-timey wistfulness. Texan 
Robert Earl Keen pulls the pathos out of "Daddy Frank" but never turns maudlin 
in this tale of a happy family band led by a blind mother and deaf father. And 
Lucinda Williams virtually becomes the world-weary, ever-put-upon protagonist 
of "You Don't Have Very Far to Go." 
</P>
<P>
 The songs are not by and large Haggard's best-known, which further bolsters 
the impression the album creates that each artist picked a song from Haggard's 
extensive songbook that had a strong personal meaning for him or her. The 
acoustic instruments and the spare arrangements give the album a folk-bluegrass 
accent and living-room folksiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included on the project are Joe Ely, Rosie Flores, Billy Joe Shaver, 
Peter Case, John Doe, Marshall Crenshaw and the executive producers, Dave Alvin 
and Tom Russell. All give heartfelt testament to Haggard's remarkable ability 
to capture, time after time, the struggles, the yearnings, the heartaches and 
the joys of the working man and woman with sentiment but without 
sentimentality. RANDY LEWIS

KID STUFF: PLEASANT 'DREAM'; BARD WATCHERS SLIP INTO SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE 
AND TUCK INTO SHAKESPEARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken covers children's events for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gentle Parents, woudst thou throwest thy babe into the moat without Floaties? 
Or bid him ride his two-wheeler without training wheels? 
</P>
<P>
 Nay, you cry? 
</P>
<P>
 Then hast Golden West College got a deal for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the premise that the appreciation of Shakespeare is, like swimming or 
biking, an acquired skill, a Golden West theater-arts professor has developed a 
three-part series that allows young audiences to ease into the Bard's work. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Charles Mitchell premieres the series' second show, "Bottom's 
Fantastic Dream," a one-hour play that clips characters and dialogue from 
Shakespeare's comedic fantasy, "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and arranges them, 
he says, so children as young as 10 can enjoy the action. "Bottom's Fantastic 
Dream," which features 15 Golden West students in their late teens to early 
20s, opens Friday at the college's Stage West Studio Theater and continues 
through Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dream" follows September's first installation, "Mother Goose Revue" -- a 
variety show inspired by classic nursery rhymes. ("Love and Death and 
Shakespeare" -- a collection of scenes from "Romeo and Juliet," "Antony and 
Cleopatra" and "Othello" -- closes the series in the spring.) 
</P>
<P>
 How, you may ask yourself, can Mother Goose help prepare young audiences for 
Shakespeare? 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there are vastly different sources for each show, but there are 
quite a few similarities between them," Mitchell explained. " 'Mother Goose' 
used physical action to tell the stories, as does 'Bottom's Fantastic Dream.' 
There was also rhyming dialogue, and Shakespeare is well known for using 
rhyming dialogue in plays like "A Midsummer Night's Dream.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Children who missed the first show in the series shouldn't have any problem 
keeping up with the second part, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' is a very visual play, and very plot-oriented," 
he explained. "And because it has so much action, (an adaptation of it) can 
work very well for children. You just couldn't do this sort of thing with 
'Hamlet.' In 'Bottom's Fantastic Dream,' we've taken Shakespeare's work down to 
a more manageable size." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the play's best-known scenes are included, enhanced with swordplay, 
dancing and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in Napoleonic-style costumes and backed by recorded music written by 
19th-Century composer Felix Mendelssohn for "A Midsummer Night's Dream," 
Mitchell's cast will introduce audiences to the "Dream" team: Bottom, the 
foolish weaver transformed into a donkey by the spirit Puck; Titania, who, 
influenced by a spell from her husband, the fairy king Oberon, falls in love 
with Bottom, and the fairies who mess with the minds of four lovers lost in the 
forest, causing them to confuse just who is in love with whom. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he has carried the idea for "Bottom's Fantastic Dream" since his 
college days, when he read an adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" by 
David Garrick, an 18th-Century English actor, producer and playwright famous 
for his Shakespearean interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 Repackaging a work that might otherwise by daunting for young audiences 
appealed to Mitchell for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps teach my own students how to (handle) Shakespeare," explained 
Mitchell, who plans a full student production of "The Taming of the Shrew" at 
Golden West in March. "And, it's a comfortable way for listeners to experience 
Shakespeare a little less formally than reading it out of a book. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't as much of the language here, (but) the poetic form is still 
there. Anyone who sees this will be seeing and hearing Shakespeare." * What: 
"Bottom's Fantastic Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Friday, Dec. 2, at 8 p.m.; Saturday, Dec. 3, at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday, 
Dec. 4, at 3 p.m.; Thursday, Dec. 8, at 8 p.m.; Dec. 9 at 8 p.m.; Dec. 10 at 3

 Anyone taking a walk down Main Street in Huntington Beach just north of the 
pier might wonder what those rowdy people on the balcony above the pizza joint 
are up to. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just part of the nightly scene at Hurricane Bar and Grill, a tropical 
island-themed nightclub that overlooks the newly renovated downtown boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Airbrushed murals depicting underwater scenes greet you as you enter the dimly 
lit venue. Framed posters of Vargas girls and James Bond vie for attention 
along with surfing photos, beer ads and neon signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Small groups of friends might sit at bar stools around high cocktail tables, 
while the more boisterous prefer to crowd the patio balcony or the long bar. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tail end of the hall, a large fiberglass marlin greets dancers to the 
perpetually grooving dance floor. Around the stage, tropical scenes of painted 
palm trees and sunsets loom under multicolored spotlights. A cushioned booth 
cradles part of the dance floor to give those who just like to sit and watch a 
chance to still be part of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The music is as comfortable as the clientele. There are no high-fashion 
parades here. Both the staff and patrons dress casually, reflecting an equally 
laid-back attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Live bands and solo acts perform rock from the '60s into the '90s Mondays 
through Saturdays from 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. On Sundays from 8 p.m. to 12:30 
a.m., alternative rock bands offer a change of pace. 
</P>
<P>
 A California-style menu of Caribbean cuisine features Barbados Island loaf 
(Dungeness crab sauteed with artichokes, peppers, onions, cheese and cream and 
served on a sourdough roll for $7.95) as well as island fire chicken (white 
meat sauteed with pepper, onion, jalapenos, ancho chile, garlic and white wine 
and served on linguini for $6.95). But perhaps the hottest draw are the popular 
and spicy jerk fries. Food is served at the bar, at indoor tables or on the 
heated deck. 
</P>
<P>
 The grill fires up daily at 11 a.m., except Sundays, when it opens an hour 
earlier for brunch. The kitchen closes at 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and at 
11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But dining and dancing aren't the only diversions here. 
</P>
<P>
 Satellite sports are televised on 11 screens. "Monday Night Football" provides 
a free buffet of munchies such as hot wings, tacos, fruit bowls or submarine 
sandwiches. Dishes vary weekly. A halftime raffle benefiting local surf events 
offers Sunday champagne cruises and ski-lift passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekday happy hour from 4 to 7 p.m. features half-price appetizers and a 50- 
to 75-cent drop in drink prices. Daily beer prices range from $1.75 domestic 
drafts to $4.50 bottled imports. Well drinks range from $3 to $4.50, soft 
drinks are $1.25, and bottled water goes for $1.75. On Sundays, $2 gets you a 
Bloody Mary or a screwdriver.

DO IT!: WHERE ROAD RUNNERS CAN GO OFF COURSE 
</P>

<P>
 The irrepressible Baz Hawley, Orange County's leading (well, only) off-road 
running impresario, is back with a new event that debuts Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 He's billing it as Orange County's first off-road marathon, and it departs 
Blue Jay Campground in the Cleveland National Forest, at about 3,000 feet, and 
climbs to the top of Santiago Peak (one of two peaks that make up Old 
Saddleback) at just under 6,000 feet. The route doubles back along the same 
trails and fire roads for the return. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley is expecting a field of about 100 for this first-time event, including 
some of Southern California's top off-road racers. It is, he concedes, a tough 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm guesstimating the winning time at about three hours," he said. "If they 
come close to three hours, they'll be doing really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it needn't be as grueling as it sounds for those simply in search of 
some exercise and scenery. Hawley has set a time limit of six hours on the 
race, but he figures in that time one could walk most of the way up and run 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many of the entrants so far are people who run on trails for 
recreation but have never tried a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a lot of these phone calls from people who've never done this 
sort of thing before and want to give it a go. I think that's just magic." 
</P>
<P>
 Of about 70 who have signed up, 15 are women, he said. Off-road running 
attracts many road runners who have hit a speed plateau and are looking for a 
new challenge, Hawley explained, adding that what they find besides that 
challenge is camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley also organizes the annual San Juan 50, a 50-mile trail run in the 
Cleveland National Forest, as well as some other long trail runs across the 
state. In recent years, he has sponsored a series of shorter off-road runs in 
Orange County to attract more runners to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who calls Hawley before noon Friday can sign up without paying a late 
fee. The entry charge of $25 will go up to $40 for anyone signing up after 
that. (Those who sign up Sunday must do so before 7:30 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 There will be five aid stations along the route, and Ham radio volunteers will 
track runners' progress. For anyone wishing to spend the night before the race, 
camping is available at $7 a night at the Blue Jay Campground. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Blue Jay Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Sunday, Dec. 4, at 8 a.m. Race-day registration closes at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Blue Jay Campground, Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the San Diego (5) Freeway, take Ortega Highway inland 22 
miles to the town of El Cariso. Two miles past the candy shop, turn left (there 
will be a sign for the Los Pinos Outdoor School) and drive about five minutes 
to Blue Jay. Park in designated areas only. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $25 before Friday noon; $40 thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 367-9070.

KIDS ON FILM: 'SANTA CLAUSE' WORKS DESPITE A FEW FLAWS IN THE FINE PRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Santa Clause," a twist of fate turns cynical toy company executive 
Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) into the real Santa, delighting his alienated son 
Charlie but alarming his ex-wife and her psychiatrist boyfriend, who thinks 
he's dangerously delusional. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 'Tis the season for feel-good family movies about rational or sarcastic 
divorced parents who learn from their children how to believe in magic again, 
and this one is destined to become a classic of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it offers concrete answers for some niggling questions that ultimately 
sow doubt in the minds of young believers: How does Santa get to every child's 
house in the world on one night? (A glitch in the space-time continuum.) How 
can he carry all those presents? (They're beamed in.) How can he get down a 
chimney, and what if you don't have one? (He and his bag shrink to fit even the 
smallest air vent.) How does he know who's naughty and who's nice? (He's 
magically omniscient.) 
</P>
<P>
 So there. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also packed with enough charming special effects to please and excite 
kids weaned on "Star Trek" reruns. Flying elves and reindeer. An electronic 
"North pole" that opens an ice door to Santa's workshop when a code is punched 
in. A sleigh loaded with extras including a CD -- Cookie and Cocoa Dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Weinraub, 10, and his brother Jeremy, 8, said they particularly liked 
watching Scott Calvin's unwelcome transformation from a single dad who takes 
his son to Denny's on Christmas Eve into a fat, bearded nice guy prone to 
wearing red sweat shirts.  
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite part is when he goes to the doctor and says I gained 45 pounds in 
a week," Jeremy said. "And when he goes to work and they go . . . " he added, 
bugging his eyes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin said he liked the scenes "when he shaves his beard and it suddenly 
grows back and when he goes down the chimney -- well, it doesn't have one at 
first -- and he makes himself skinny and there becomes a chimney opening inside 
and he just goes out."  
</P>
<P>
 One 13-year-old said she thought the special effects looked fake. And a few 
small children got bored and walked up and down the aisles. But most gave the 
movie an A-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Even 14-year-old Marian Nader said she liked it, though most of her friends 
might not think it's cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of makes you believe in Santa Claus," she said, adding that when she 
figured out the truth about Santa, it was a real letdown for her. "I wish I 
didn't find out. It's kind of cool to, you know, think it's really Santa 
Claus." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids said they found "The Santa Clause" more realistic, more exciting and 
funnier than the remake of "Miracle on 34th Street." Gentler than "Home Alone," 
the movie's only violence involves the elves' liberation squad, which rescues 
Santa from jail by tying up a guard. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the movie is true to its era. Not only do people think Santa is 
crazy, but the rationalists want to take him to court to take away his 
visitation rights. When little Charlie tells Neal the psychiatrist to lighten 
up, he says, "You're denying your inner child." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience chuckled the heartiest when a sweet child, awaiting Santa by the 
tree, leaves him soy milk because the year before, a partially transformed 
Calvin grumpily told her he was "lactose intolerant."  
</P>
<P>
 The movie doesn't answer every question, though. Some of us still wonder: How 
does Santa know if you're staying at your mom's or your dad's? And, how did 
they make Tim Allen look like he gained 100 pounds?

SPECIAL SCREENING: BERGMAN'S 'SEAL' STARES HARD AT DEATH, FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
writes about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ingmar Bergman was so revered in Sweden, especially around the time "The 
Seventh Seal" was released in 1956, that one of the country's most influential 
film magazines finally became fed up. The editors at Chaplin decided only 
negative criticism would be printed about the famous director and his movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman, not a Swede known for a bubbly sense of humor, thought that was very 
funny. Taking on a pseudonym, he even penned an attack on himself. Bergman 
later confessed to the prank but never quite disputed the article's mocking 
jabs at his career. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have to. Bergman could always count on more reasonable critics to 
defend him. As with many of his pictures, "The Seventh Seal" was declared a 
masterpiece done by an artist who may have been more than a bit of a brooder 
but who never failed to interpret the big concerns facing man. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which ends UC Irvine's "Cinema Potpourri" series Friday night, goes 
the whole nine yards when it comes to existential dread, staring fitfully at 
mortality, faith and God. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman, who's been parodied often -- most notably by one of his top admirers, 
Woody Allen, in comedies like "Love and Death" -- is a worried, anxious and 
ingenious filmmaker throughout "The Seventh Seal." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie begins with one of the most famous scenes of art-house cinema. Max 
von Sydow, playing a knight disillusioned after 10 years fighting in the 
Crusades, sits abjectly on a rocky shore. Hard-eyed Death (Bengt Ekerot) shows 
up, ready to whisk him away. 
</P>
<P>
 But Death, apparently a sporting type, agrees to a game of chess with the 
knight's life at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Sydow, looking like a tormented saint from the mind of a Renaissance 
painter, takes the opportunity to ask about the hereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 His questions, inspired as much by fear as by a hope that his life hasn't been 
meaningless, are ignored by Death, who insists that he doesn't know anything. 
The game and the knight's prodding, which becomes more desperate, are the 
film's continuing threads. 
</P>
<P>
 The landscape Bergman leads us through is both gloomy and striking. Death, as 
one might expect, enjoys killing even more than board games, and he's in the 
middle of a campaign to turn the countryside into a vast burial ground. The 
plague is everywhere, and Bergman takes an almost perverse glee in showing how 
it has destroyed people, their lives and morals. 
</P>
<P>
 A monk (Bertil Anderberg) now steals from the dead and, when introduced, is 
about to rape and kill a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hordes of diseased peasants lurch down the streets like walking corpses from 
"Night of the Living Dead," beating themselves with whips and branches as they 
go. A girl (Maud Hansson) is burned at the stake for having sex with the devil. 
This isn't the pretty, fiord-rich Sweden of travel brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman does take a somewhat more secular, and refreshingly comic, turn with a 
small band of traveling actors led by Jof (Nils Poppe) and his wife, Mia (Bibi 
Andersson). 
</P>
<P>
 Jof's antics and Mia's optimism -- which has nothing to do with religion or 
faith -- contrast with the movie's basic foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman offers them as man's hope; it seems fitting that Jof and Mia are the 
only ones saved when everyone else is forced by Death to dance with him into 
oblivion.

RESTAURANTS; MEALS AS CUBAN AS MOM HERSELF

 Mention Cuban food in Orange County and the conversation immediately turns to 
the garlic-studded, orange-peel roast chicken served at Felix Continental Cafe 
in Orange. But that's not all there is to the cuisine. You won't find it, for 
instance, at Rafi's Cuban Cafe, a nice new mom-and-pop place -- or rather, a 
mom-son-and-daughter-in-law place -- in Tustin.  
</P>

 The bottom of the one-page menu is signed Rafi, Kat and Mom. Rafi is Ralph 
Sanchez, a friendly, enthusiastic host, and many of the dishes you eat in this 
bona fide family operation are brought to the table by his wife, Kat. The real 
star of this cafe, of course, is Mom. You won't see her unless you peer over 
the cash register and into the kitchen. She is an authentic Cuban grandmother, 
and she will be doing all the cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Though spacious in a large, airy brick-walled room, this is essentially a very 
modest place. The tables are covered in slightly worn-looking 
yellow-and-white-checked oilcloth. A few clinical, even somber, posters of Cuba 
are hung on the walls. But the family has the good sense to have mambo music on 
the sound system.  
</P>
<P>
 My favorite thing to eat here is the Cuban sandwich or its smaller cousin, the 
media noche . They deserve to be enshrined in the Sandwich Hall of Fame. 
They're both filled with thin-sliced ham and lechon (roast pork). The meat goes 
on buttered, grilled Cuban bread (a sweet, dense bread ideal for grilling or 
toasting) with some mayo and mustard. The Cuban sandwich also includes Swiss 
cheese. Substitute homemade pickles for the Swiss and you've got media noche 
(literally, "midnight" -- it's the perfect midnight snack). 
</P>
<P>
 Come for lunch and you might enjoy a hearty bowl of Mom's black or red bean 
soup with one of these sandwiches. The red bean soup looks like an ordinary 
bowl of health store pinto beans . . . until you taste it. Subtly flavored with 
cumin and pork fat, it's a dream peasant soup so substantial you probably won't 
finish. The black bean soup is slightly blander but equally hearty, again with 
little grace notes of cumin in the aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the hearty main dishes come with rice and black beans, those staples 
of the Cuban diet. You can also get a side dish of yuca , a starchy root cooked 
with a light garlic sauce and stewed onions, but beans and rice are so basic to 
the cuisine you can order them by themselves in a dish called moros y 
cristianos -- literally, "Moors and Christians." Mix in some yuca and you get 
congri , the perfect complement to fragrant Cuban main dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban food isn't like Mexican food at all, a fact you'll soon discover should 
you happen to order picadillo , tasajo or bacalao . The menu tells us that 
picadillo is Cuban-style ground beef, prepared with sofrito and green olives. 
This is a great kid dish, terrific when messily mixed up with the rice and 
beans. Sofrito is the name for the mixture of sauteed onions, garlic, maybe 
peppers and a few spices that is the universal base of Cuban dishes. The olives 
add a wonderful pungency. 
</P>
<P>
 Tasajo and bacalao are definitely not for beginners. Tasajo (spelled "tasaho" 
on this menu) is a penetratingly flavored dish of beef strips cured in salt and 
then stewed nearly to mush. It's another dish for mixing with rice, but you 
won't need much -- one spoonful could flavor an entire plate. This is the only 
dish here I do not fancy, mainly because of the intense saltiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacalao is salty as well, but the salt doesn't seem so much of a problem -- 
it's natural in a dish of dried codfish. In its tomatoey sauce, this is quite 
unlike the other items here. It has a real homey tang, and the menu proclaims 
it Mom's own favorite.  
</P>
<P>
 I love it, too, but I'm going to say the simple and succulent Cuban-style 
roast pork ( lechon ), which we've already met in the sandwiches, is the best 
entree. Meat-eaters can also choose good grilled steaks or ropa vieja (shredded 
beef in a piquant tomato sauce).  
</P>
<P>
 But chicken-lovers needn't despair. Mom cooks a mean chicken fricassee and a 
distinctive version of arroz con pollo . The latter is a huge portion of 
steamed chicken, off the bone, in a casserole dish with lots of saffron-colored 
rice. Don't order it, though, if you like your rice firm. In the chicken 
juices, the rice softens almost to porridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The desserts are simple and satisfying. Tiny hot empanadas spill out guava 
puree when cut open. A first-rate eggy flan made by Rafi and a dish of grated 
coconut with cream cheese are also available. Wash everything down with bitter, 
intense espresso from Cuban coffee beans or canned Cuban soft drinks like Coco 
Rico (coconut flavor), Malta (malt) or Jupina (pineapple).  
</P>
<P>
 And don't bother Rafi about the orange peel chicken. It's not an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafi's Cuban Cafe is inexpensive to moderately priced. Sandwiches are $2.95 to 
$4.95. Soups are $2. Entrees are $5.95 to $9.95. Desserts are 95 cents to 
$1.50.

 Whether it's toys for toppings or toys for tamales -- or even cans for crema 
al caramello -- Christmas season charity drives are underway at a number of 
area restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Amici Trattoria makes sure you get your just desserts when you donate even one 
canned good, which will entitle you to the complimentary dessert of your 
choice. ( Crema al caramello is vanilla flan.) Packaged produce and unwrapped 
children's toys are also welcome. The drive continues through Dec. 23 and 
benefits FISH, a group dedicated to preventing homelessness in Irvine, Costa 
Mesa and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of which, anchovies are but one choice of topping that the donation 
of a new, unwrapped toy can get you at BJ's Chicago Pizzerias, where more than 
a dozen topping possibilities range from homemade meatballs to fresh garlic. 
Toys will be picked up Dec. 16 as part of the Toys for Tots program. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Torito Grills, a new, unwrapped toy means $10 off any check of $25 or 
more. That drive runs through Dec. 20, and certificates are valid through Jan. 
15. Toys go to Share Our Selves (S.O.S.) of Costa Mesa, which provides 
emergency food, funds and shelter for those in immediate need.  
</P>
<P>
 Take a couple of toys: Start at the Costa Mesa El Torito Grill, then have 
dessert at Amici next door.

3-HOUR TOUR: DAWN BREAKS OVER VISTA; THE BREAD ALSO RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bread and water can be a meager meal. But when the bread is from Pain du Monde 
in Corona del Mar, and the water is that of endless Pacific Ocean views at 
nearby Emerald Vista -- possibly the best view hike in Orange County -- it's a 
great way to start your day. (You might even be able to get this tour in before 
work.) 
</P>
<P>
 6 to 6:40 a.m.: The coastal hills are backlit by a sun not yet risen. Street 
sweepers ensure that Corona del Mar will still charm at dawn's first light. 
Customers are already waiting when Pain du Monde opens its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, you can buy whole-wheat bagels with raisins (80 cents), blueberry 
banana oat bran muffins ($1.45) and scones like cumulus clouds in Scottish 
(plain), orange and cranberry flavors ($1.45). Think of the breakfast bagel as 
McMonde: It has egg and ham inside and melted cheese and tomato on top ($1.75). 
A bowl of crunchy granola with bananas ($2.65) is an ideal pre-hike breakfast, 
and the cappuccino ($2) can't be beat.  
</P>
<P>
 6:40 to 9: Early mornings this time of the year are the very best for 
panoramic viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Highway south of Corona del Mar is under lots of construction these 
days. I like those signs that show a man with a sign, and sure enough, ahead 
there's a man with a sign. Pass the Newport Coast gateways -- triumphal arches 
for local developers -- and turn into Crystal Cove State Park at El Moro 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The coastal fathers obviously mean business when it comes to development, so a 
sign in the parking lot seemed particularly distressing: "No person shall 
climb, scale, mount, ascend or descend any bluff or rock face not identified, 
developed or otherwise indicated permitting such activity." I didn't see any 
bluffs or rock faces so identified or developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow a path along the backside of El Moro Beach Mobile Home Park. At the 
canyon bottom I found cactus patches live and charred, phone lines, towering 
stands of plants, a creek, "lost white cat" signs -- you're in coyote country; 
this is no place for house cats on the loose -- an orange highway cone, a stink 
bug waving its rear end menacingly and a metal pole with barricade tape loosely 
hanging down for no apparent reason that says: "Police line, do not cross." 
</P>
<P>
 The path joins the maintained El Moro Ridge trail near the almost imposing 
manses of Irvine Cove; other trails appeared to have been mowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The moon was high in the sky, the still-low sun reflected off the bellies of 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from the canyon, the sun hit me blazing. Turning away, I saw that my 
shadow reached clear across the canyon to the ridge opposite; the ridge shadow 
crept perceptibly toward me. 
</P>
<P>
 You could see clearly from a number of vistas along the trail. I saw clearly, 
for instance, that smog had blown 26 miles across the sea and, though the 
cliffs rose above it magnificently unperturbed, choked Catalina Island at sea 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher up, a signpost indicates that it is 7/10ths of a mile to the East 
Cut-Across and 2.8 miles to the park boundary. Turn right, and the other side 
of the post says that Emerald Vista is 2/10ths of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 No sign identifies Emerald Vista. But there's a sign that forbids loitering 
"by law," an antenna and a marker for the Joseph R. Sweany Reservoir that 
describes its capacity as 100,000 gallons, its elevation as 594.50 feet and 
maximum water depth as 15.50 feet (exactly where they're hiding the reservoir 
is anybody's guess). 
</P>
<P>
 A high-voltage box is labeled "consumer commodity . . . contains a one-pound 
box of aerosol spray paint."  
</P>
<P>
 From here you have a 180-degree panorama taking in Newport Harbor, Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, Santa Monica Mountains and possibly the Santa Barbara 
coastline to the north, Catalina looming large and another land mass -- either 
San Clemente Island or Japan -- to the west, successive points jutting into the 
sea like five fingers and San Diego's Point Loma to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly higher on the trail, you can have Catalina, Santiago Peak -- you 
could see the antennae atop Saddleback with the unaided eye -- and Mt. Baldy in 
your sights simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 On a hilltop farther still, you can have it all, a 360-degree view including 
the islands, the peaks, the points, the sun and the moon, and nice homes in two 
directions to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Few views in Orange County can compete; none can be reached so easily. 
</P>
<P>
 To return, simply retrace your steps. The hike's about five miles. To complete 
a slightly longer loop, continue on El Moro Ridge to the East Cut-Across, turn 
left to El Moro Canyon, and left again back to the visitors center. 3-HOUR TOUR

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: IT'S SLOW GOING FOR SOME HEAVY METAL MOVERS ON SEPULVEDA 
BOULEVARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OVERSIZE LOAD: That rocket-shaped behemoth planted smack in the middle of 
Sepulveda Boulevard on Tuesday probably made some think the Hubble telescope 
finally seized up and came crashing to Earth in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. The heavy metal in question is a 32-ton, 194-foot distillation 
column that started at the Port of Los Angeles Monday night and will arrive at 
Chevron's El Segundo refinery this morning. And it's having an understandably 
miserable trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the column forced its movers, Contractors Cargo of Compton, to 
take it slow, flanked by a brigade of 15 to 20 lift trucks moving power lines, 
traffic lights and other overhanging obstacles. This, coupled with a 
restriction to travel only from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m., translated into a three-day 
trip and fewer open lanes on Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 The column was scheduled to spend Wednesday on Aviation Boulevard at Marine 
Avenue. The movers, after coordinating the trip with about every utility and 
regulatory agency in sight, saw street parking as the only option, said 
President Gerald Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent about the whole last year planning this thing, and that was really 
the only place to put it," Wheeler said. "We can't exactly pull into a parking 
place somewhere. We felt it was the least inconvenient to traffic there." 
</P>
<P>
 With construction on Sepulveda already steering commuters to alternate routes, 
the impact is minimal, Wheeler said. "The guys paving are taking up more lanes 
than we are."  
</P>

<P>
 PEACOCK POLITICS: You've heard of books on how to attract the opposite sex. 
Now, the city of Rolling Hills is weighing in with a flyer on how to attract 
peacocks. Or, alternatively, repel them. 
</P>
<P>
 Peacocks, virtually a matter of national security on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, have divided residents for years. While some praise the peacocks' 
beauty, others decry their noisy and destructive ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jody Murdock said the flyer is a response to a steady stream of 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a one-page draft of the flyer, the birds will eat birdseed, pet 
food and bread. They also enjoy munching on gardens sprouting tomatoes, 
broccoli and begonias. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds do not have a taste for plants such as camellia, bougainvillea and 
ivy. Also, peafowl tend to steer clear of homes with dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents unwilling to buy a Rottweiler or replant the yard in ivy can call 
the humane society to have a peacock trapped and relocated, according to the 
flyer. The charge is $40. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft flyer, approved by the City Council on Monday night, will be 
available at City Hall by next week, Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MAYBE PARKING: You can play parking roulette with Carson's parking 
restrictions, but you'd better bring a sizable stack of chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The city started the game when it cut its street-sweeping schedule -- from 
four times a month to twice -- noting that other cities have saved piles of 
money that way.  
</P>
<P>
 And city officials reasoned that changing street parking signs to reflect the 
new sweeping schedule would cost them a chunk of their savings and cause 
"confusion for residents and businesses," according to a city bulletin. 
Besides, the signs might come in handy again if the city decided to scrap the 
new schedule when the trial period ends in June. 
</P>
<P>
 So residents were sent revised schedules and told to do the unthinkable: 
Disregard the signs on the sweeper's off days. 
</P>
<P>
 The word didn't get to the ticket writers, however. At least six people 
followed the new schedule, ignored the "No Parking" signs, and got nailed with 
$28 tickets anyway, said Carson Public Safety head Allen Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking enforcement officers have since been told to follow sweepers on the 
scheduled rounds and ticket only the cars blocking the way. And the tickets 
have been voided. "We are going to make amends to straighten out what seemed to 
be a snafu on our end," Mitchell said. QUOTE OF THE WEEK

ELECTIONS / U.S. CONGRESS; HARMAN TAKES A DEFENSIVE STANCE, STARTS BUILDING 
BRIDGES WITH GOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the GOP takes over Congress in January, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling 
Hills) will probably retain her committee assignments, her office space, even 
much of her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, with so many Democrats ousted or retired from office, she will make a 
leap in seniority in her second term. And with Republicans poised to increase 
defense spending, it could bode well for her South Bay district, where the 
aerospace business still looms large. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changeover still will mean a whole new world -- and a tougher time -- 
for Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Clinton Administration contacts might not mean much if the President finds 
himself at an impasse with the Republican leadership. She was a strong 
supporter of the Family Medical Leave Act and the assault weapons ban, two 
measures the new GOP leaders have hinted they would try to repeal. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to increasing defense funding, she could be caught in a 
bind. She could get pressure from contractors to vote for defense budgets, even 
if President Clinton argues that more money for the military will hinder 
efforts to reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a hypocrite about this," Harman said last week. "We can't infinitely 
expand spending and reduce the deficit at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, political analysts, supporters and even Harman say that it will 
be more critical than ever for her to pursue a middle-of-the-road, if not 
conservative, approach in her second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moderate Republicans are going to forge alliances with the moderate 
Democrats, of which I am one," she said. "The potential for us as a center 
coalition to have an effect on issues is as large, or larger, than in the last 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman declared victory against Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks 
only last week, after final absentee ballots put Harman over the top by a thin 
margin of 812 votes. Brooks has not conceded, and may seek a recount or contest 
the election by trying to prove voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, everyone was saying 'Harman's going to win, she'll spend a lot of 
money,' " said Allan Hoffenblum, a Republican consultant. "Now she'll be 
spending much of her term wondering who's going to run against her. She's a 
sophomore in a minority party, and she's not going to have much influence." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in her first term, Harman cut through red tape to speed up the 
awards for defense conversion grants. But this term Republicans could comb 
through those grants for spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 And California's congressional delegation may no longer have as much influence 
since it could be virtually shut out of committee chairmanships, Republican or 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be more important than ever for them to work together," said Jan 
Denton, executive director of the Washington-based California Institute, a 
public interest group.  
</P>
<P>
 But with the delegation split -- 27 Democrats to 25 Republicans -- Harman 
could play a greater role in uniting its members. 
</P>
<P>
 She teamed with Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) earlier this year to help save 
the C-17 cargo plane, made by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Long Beach. And 
they plan to work together to keep the Long Beach Naval Shipyard off the base 
closure list in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to give a damn (about ideological clashes)," Horn said of the 
center coalition. "What we have to be responsive to is our constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn and Harman made appeals for bipartisanship on the House floor Tuesday. 
Harman also has toned down her rhetoric on the GOP's Contract With America, 
which she called the "Contract on America" during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman says she will take a look at some of its proposals, such as a 
middle-class tax cut. She already is on record in favor of a balanced budget 
amendment, expected to be a GOP priority in the first 100 days.  
</P>
<P>
 "I pledge to stay in the center and build the bipartisan coalitions we built 
the last time," Harman said. "I will be clear to voters. I want a strong 
defense, and I will also vote for deficit reduction at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 On defense issues, some of the South Bay's business leaders, who backed her 
campaign, still believe that she will be able to come through for the district. 
Some of her contacts extend beyond partisan posts, such as Navy Secretary John 
Dalton, who called to wish her the best when absentee votes were being counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jane is a very aggressive individual," said Edward E. (Pete) Aldridge Jr., 
president of the Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo. "I don't think you'll see one 
nickel of change in her attitude in fighting for the South Bay and fighting for 
the high-tech arena. And that, I think, is consistent with the Republican 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace executives backed Harman, even though Brooks called for increased 
defense spending.  
</P>
<P>
 "Having Jane there is to our advantage because she understands the defense 
issues so well," said Steve Chaudet, vice president of public affairs for 
Lockheed Corp. and a director at the California Institute. "She will be as 
effective; it will just be more difficult. If (Brooks) was elected, it would 
have taken her a longer time to get up to speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaudet, along with other aerospace executives, are skeptical that defense 
spending will increase enough to make a difference. The new majority might 
simply stop the decline in defense spending sooner than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that the Republican leadership would be in a mode of stopping 
the decline of the defense spending reductions," said Aldridge of the Aerospace 
Corp. "But I don't think the big boon for defense is in the cards." 
</P>
<P>
 And some business executives aren't sure that it would be wise to go back to 
the defense spending in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens, defense is no longer the 800-pound gorilla," said 
Alan Schwartz, president of the South Bay Assn. of Chambers of Commerce. "It's 
still a major portion of business in the South Bay, but it is no longer 
completely dominant. Even if they start restoring some of the cuts, it's not 
going to go back to the level it once was."  
</P>
<P>
 For now, Harman and her supporters are taking heed of one of her slogans from 
her freshman term: "Listen, then Lead."  
</P>
<P>
 "This crowd will accomplish a good deal of the reform agenda that Congress 
needs," Harman said. "But on substantive issues, the jury is out."

INGLEWOOD PREPARES TO OVERHAUL SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: TACKLING PROBLEMS ONE AT A 
TIME DOESN'T WORK, SUPERINTENDENT SAYS. AN ENVISIONED TOP-TO-BOTTOM REWORKING 
WILL INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After four months as the head of the Inglewood Unified School District, 
McKinley Nash has found that tinkering with school staffing, district personnel 
and curriculum will not save the city's school system. It needs to be reworked 
from top to bottom, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash's conclusion is no surprise to many who have watched the school system 
founder in recent years: Test scores at the middle and high schools are at the 
bottom of the South Bay -- even though the city's elementary schools typically 
perform well. The district is struggling to comply with state bilingual 
education requirements, and its budget problems induced the state to appoint a 
fiscal administrator to the district. Many of the best students leave the 
district to attend high school in other cities, Nash has said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is a surprise is that the City Council and city manager, the Chamber of 
Commerce, religious leaders, and parent and teacher groups all have agreed to 
join with the school board to overhaul the school system. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting to which every segment of Inglewood society was invited, Nash and 
the school board unveiled plans to begin a strategic plan for the system. The 
plan would examine every aspect of the district and develop goals for the 
future. In an unusual act of governmental unity, the City Council already has 
voted to provide $40,000 to pay for the school project, and the board has 
called its first meeting with strategy planner William J. Cook of the Cambridge 
Group of Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer can we sit on the sidelines and point a finger at others for not 
educating our children," said board President Lois Hill Hale. "We have to 
rejuvenate an outdated education system. We on the board of education know 
we're not providing the quality of education we should be for our children."  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than haphazardly attempting to raise test scores or remedy budget 
problems, the district first needs to agree on what its mission should be, Nash 
said. Then it needs to define its specific goals and how it plans to accomplish 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Nash has asked the board to commit to an intense, yearlong effort 
to develop a plan for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strategic plan is really the only way we're going to be able to get all the 
junk out of this system and start over," Nash said in an interview. "We've got 
to look at every single aspect of this system and decide whether it's 
functioning in line with what our goals and values are. But first we need to 
define those goals and values." 
</P>
<P>
 Strategic planning, which gained popularity among corporations 20 years ago, 
has become a trend in education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cambridge Group has helped more than 300 school districts nationwide 
develop strategic plans, and in California the group has worked with the 
Glendale, Beverly Hills and Berkeley school districts, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan requires districts to include representatives from every group 
affected by education on a team of 20 to 30 people and to draft the district's 
beliefs, missions, a variety of analyses, objectives and strategies. The draft 
plan is reviewed with the public, and action teams then are formed to implement 
the strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between the planning that the district has done in the past and 
a strategic plan is that the entire community will be included and decisions 
must be unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently the board invited about 200 people to meet Cook, who will help 
Inglewood develop a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a consultant and I don't come equipped with answers," Cook said to 
about 180 people. "If we begin this process, you'll be the ones to develop 
those. But I do have one saying: 'When the horse dies, it's a really good time 
to dismount.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The audience laughed, but Cook said he was preparing them to look 
unflinchingly at the school system and be willing to do more than minor 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strategic planning also requires a high degree of community unity. All 
decisions reached by the planning committee must be unanimous, and committees 
should include representatives from virtually every segment of society affected 
by Inglewood education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to rejuvenate an outdated education system," Hill Hale said. "But we 
cannot do it without help."  
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at other school districts that have done strategic plans give 
the effort high marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a process that helps a district to focus all of the energies and 
resources in an agreed-upon direction," said LaVoneia Steele, superintendent of 
the Berkeley Unified School System when it began its strategic plan in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cook asks each district that does a strategic plan to identify its core 
beliefs. Berkeley's included: That societies prosper to the extent that they 
care for their children. Each person has a right to make his or her own choice 
and is responsible for his or her own action. Everyone has an unlimited 
capacity for learning. A truly educated person cannot be racist. Excellence is 
worth whatever it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this translates into better-educated students," Steele said. "Our 
objectives are to have 100% of our students graduate . . . to see that all 
graduates are prepared for post-secondary education or employment of their 
choice and that all students achieve their own educational goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills also developed a list of beliefs: That a person's rights to 
thoughts and ideas are inviolate. Society requires standards of right and 
wrong. Every person needs love. Family is the primary influence on each 
person's development. Literacy is vital to individual empowerment. Diversity of 
all kinds enriches. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators in Beverly Hills already know that their school system is 
excellent and are not seeking to correct major problems, said Bert Pearlman, 
assistant superintendent for educational services. The district, however, 
decided that a strategic plan is necessary if it is to carry that excellence 
into the rapidly changing, technological world of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing about Beverly Hills: We are both a very forward-thinking and very 
conservative district," Pearlman said. "We looked as this carefully before 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds abstract in the beginning, but I think this is a process that has 
potential for bringing action home and making ideas real."

WORKFARE PROGRAM IS CRITICIZED; INGLEWOOD: WELFARE RECIPIENTS DO CLERICAL AND 
MAINTENANCE TASKS AT NO COST TO SCHOOL DISTRICT. A UNION REPRESENTATIVE SAYS 
THEY'RE TAKING AWAY JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 County welfare recipients paint over graffiti, pick up trash and answer phones 
at Inglewood Unified School District -- at no cost to the district.  
</P>
<P>
 The labor, administrators say, allows the district to save money while helping 
overburdened maintenance employees and groundskeepers. At the same time, says 
Supt. McKinley Nash, the district is giving able-bodied welfare recipients a 
chance to earn their keep. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives from the California Professional Employees union -- which 
represents the district's maintenance, landscaping and clerical staff -- say 
the workers are taking union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In two years, the district has laid off 12 union employees. In addition, 
despite a district screening process introduced last year, many of the welfare 
workers still have not been checked for criminal records, said union spokesman 
Christopher Graeber.  
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is safety. All regular employees have to meet standards that (the 
general-relief workers) aren't always held to," said Graeber, whose union has 
passed out flyers urging parents to lobby for the welfare workers to be 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, several hundred students marched from Inglewood High School to the 
district office to protest, among other things, alleged cases of welfare 
workers verbally harassing students. Those allegations were investigated but 
officials were unable to determine if they were true, said Inglewood High 
School Principal Kenneth Crowe.  
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood Unified joined the General Relief Workfare program in 1984. Under 
the program, welfare recipients can work six to eight days a month for public 
agencies. For their services, the workers receive about $200 a month, said 
program spokeswoman Mary Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials and school administrators say the workers are 
indispensable.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us . . . think everybody who is able should have the 
opportunity to work," said Inglewood school board President Lois Hill Hale. 
</P>
<P>
 But instances where the workers were caught smoking, showing up for work drunk 
or where workers with criminal records slipped through have raised questions 
about the program. Graeber said those incidents show a need to scrap the 
program altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipients, Robertson said, must be fingerprinted to make sure they have 
not registered for relief in other offices. But criminal record checks are not 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not a criterion for receiving aid, so we don't do it," Robertson 
said. The responsibility for background screening falls on the districts that 
use the workers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several school districts in Los Angeles County have used general-relief 
workers in the past. But problems with worker behavior led many to leave the 
program. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, background checks revealed 
that several general-relief workers had been convicted for assault and sexual 
molestation. The incidents showed the necessity for background checks, but the 
high cost of checks -- reportedly $65 each -- led Los Angeles Unified to phase 
out the program, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood is the only district in the county still accepting new workers, 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood has had its share of problems with the general-relief program. 
Workers have been caught smoking in school bathrooms or with alcohol on their 
breath, school administrators say. In each instance, officials said, the 
workers were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, a worker at Woodworth Elementary School was dismissed after he 
ordered several fourth- and fifth-graders to kiss his feet, said Woodworth 
Principal Lacy Alexander. The worker, officials said, had a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 The worker slipped through the system despite a 1993 district mandate that all 
welfare workers' backgrounds be checked, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say the problem may have come from a misunderstanding of 
district policy. Administrators at several schools believed that all 
general-relief workers were checked by the county before being sent. Others 
believed that the checks were completed by the local police. Still others 
believed that the background checks applied only to new workers.  
</P>
<P>
 Many principals admit they are still unsure if all general-relief workers have 
been checked. Inglewood School District Police Chief Michael Johnson said only 
60 checks have been completed since the district began checking last year. 
Officials say the district has 80 welfare workers at any given time, but that 
number changes as new workers are added and others leave.  
</P>
<P>
 But Supt. Nash said the problem has been corrected and a new set of guidelines 
was sent to all school principals last month. Those guidelines include 
mandatory background checks by school district police. 
</P>
<P>
 Many school principals said they rely on the general-relief workers to help 
complete tasks that regular employees cannot finish. 
</P>
<P>
 At Morningside High School, Principal Liza Daniels said only two regular 
employees are assigned to clean up the 56-acre campus. Without five to eight 
relief workers, the work would not get done, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several general-relief workers agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we left, the school would be a mess because we do it all," said Walter 
Capers, who has worked at Morningside for two years. Capers says the stereotype 
of general-relief workers as criminals is unfair.  
</P>
<P>
 Graeber and other union employees admit that general-relief workers help keep 
campuses clean. But, Graeber said, getting rid of the workers would be a good 
way to force the district to rehire employees who were laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to make having a clean campus a priority, and they have to make 
rehiring our employees a priority," Graeber said. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials say the cash-strapped district cannot afford to rehire 
the employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lose the (welfare) workers, we will all lose," board President Hill 
Hale said.

MUSEUM PROPOSAL NOW IN DOUBT FOR BANNING'S LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wilmington residents say they can feel it slipping through their fingers. 
After six years of hard work, officials are moving against their plans to 
renovate and develop a historical site on the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision won't be made until early next year as to whether the Port 
of Los Angeles will build a museum of port history for the Wilmington 
community. But a consultant has recommended axing the project. And when a city 
task force discussed that recommendation on Wednesday, it fueled speculation 
that the development will not get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has pitted former Harbor Commissioner Gertrude Schwab against the 
current harbor board and left many residents feeling dejected and outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just so disheartened now," said Schwab, a longtime community 
activist. "It's such a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been lobbying the Harbor Department since 1988 to fund a 
community project on 10 acres at the end of Avalon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 After appointing a local committee to find out what the community wanted, 
harbor commissioners agreed in 1991 to what became known as the Banning's 
Landing project. The cost to the port would be $5 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But a cash-strapped Harbor Department deferred $70 million worth of 
recreational projects last year, and Banning's Landing was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was another hitch for Wilmington: Mayor Richard J. Riordan and the 
Harbor Commission established the 16-member Worldport LA Futures Commercial 
Task Force to look at all commercial development plans by the port. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force was only supposed to look at ways to enhance the project, said 
George De La Torre, former chairman of the community committee who now sits on 
the task force. But, instead, it looked at whether Banning's Landing would make 
any money.  
</P>
<P>
 Schwab said residents were first alerted to moves against the project when the 
port's deputy executive director of development, Dwayne Lee, authorized the 
demolition of a Heinz cannery on Fries Street in February. She said the 
structure and the loading dock were supposed to be renovated and preserved as 
part of the Banning's Landing project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The handwriting was on the wall," said Schwab. "That was going to be the 
death of our historical area down there." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents have vowed to keep the pressure on officials to follow through 
with the longstanding promise. More than 1,000 signatures were gathered on a 
petition to be presented to the task force and the harbor board.  
</P>
<P>
 Schwab said residents are angry because the port has spent millions of dollars 
on recreational facilities in neighboring San Pedro and "not a dime" in 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations considered by the task force suggest that properties 
covering 120 acres be considered for commercial and recreational development in 
San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay Yoshitani, deputy executive director of maritime affairs at the port, 
agreed the Harbor Department has spent more money in San Pedro. But Yoshitani 
said the San Pedro projects, such as Cabrillo Museum, also involve the 
investment of private funds. "We wouldn't be averse at all if a private 
investor came to us with a project for Wilmington," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of millions of dollars of port money to the Los Angeles general fund 
over the past two years has forced port officials to look hard at projects that 
don't produce revenue, Yoshitani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents argue that the Banning's Landing project was never intended as a 
money maker. The development is meant to mark the spot where Phineas Banning, 
later known as "Father of the Harbor," established Wilmington in 1857, and to 
give residents a sense of history and pride.

IT'S ACADEMIC -- WEST HIGH WINS DECATHLON AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the fifth year running, West High School in Torrance has won the Los 
Angeles County Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member team, composed of three A students, three B students and three 
C students, placed first, beating out Diamond Bar High School, which came in 
second, and Peninsula High School, which placed third. 
</P>
<P>
 All high schools in Los Angeles County are eligible to compete in the 
decathlon, except for ones in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which 
holds its own competition. In March, West will compete against Marshall High 
School, the winner of the Los Angeles Unified decathlon, and about 45 other 
schools, in the state academic decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 In state competition, West High traditionally has placed second in 
even-numbered years and third in odd-numbered ones. 
</P>
<P>
 But its victories at the county level have been so numerous that the question 
of whether West will win has changed. The question now is, how does West keep 
winning? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll blame it on the coach," said decathlete Tim Rider, complimenting biology 
teacher George Floratos, who guides the team. "Also, our school has momentum," 
said Rider, a senior who also was on last year's team. "Now that we've won, no 
one wants to be the team to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Students take a qualifying test to be on Floratos' team, and the top three 
students in each grade category are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they've been chosen, from that point on, they act as a team," Floratos 
said. "It's just like any athletic team; you have to develop camaraderie and 
you have quality time with them. You become their father, their counselor. They 
have a problem, they come to you. And once in a while you've got to kick them 
in the rear." 
</P>
<P>
 Then from March to November, students study about two hours a day at home and 
meet twice weekly at Floratos' home, endeavoring to become well versed in 10 
areas of study. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Decathletes are tested on their knowledge of science, history, language and 
literature, essay writing, impromptu and prepared speech-giving, the interview 
process, music, art, economics and mathematics through calculus. In addition to 
the primary subjects, a main theme is chosen every year. This year's subject 
was biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing 10 subjects for me and six or seven for school, so they learn 
to read carefully and well," Floratos said.  
</P>
<P>
 Floratos said the reason his teams keep winning is simple. Regardless of their 
grades, everyone chosen for the team has the capacity to be an A student. The 
students are not incomprehensibly brilliant, but he tries to motivate them to 
work very hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is good at motivating people," said Rider, adding that other academic 
endeavors often do not interest him. "When it comes to school, I'm extremely 
lazy. I'm a C student. A lot of times I don't find what we're doing in school 
very interesting. It's not challenging enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wish that all high school students could experience academic decathlon 
and what it represents," Rider said. "It represents joy -- it's the joy of 
learning."

HERMOSA BEACH FACE LIFT WINS FINAL APPROVAL; RENOVATION: PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO 
ATTRACT STROLLING SHOPPERS AND NEW BUSINESSES DOWNTOWN. BUT CRITICS HAVE 
ASSAILED PLAN TO RAISE PARKING RATES TO HELP FUND THE WORK. 
</P>

<P>
 The mayor calls Hermosa Beach's aging downtown a sewer. A consultant hired by 
the city politely describes portions of it as unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's business district has taken its lumps, but officials plan to 
improve it with a $6-million face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans approved unanimously by the City Council last week call for doubling the 
width of some downtown sidewalks to accommodate outdoor dining and closing a 
portion of Pier Avenue to eastbound traffic. Palm trees will be added, 
newspaper kiosks may be installed, and lights may be strung canopy-style down a 
portion of Pier Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the city's plan to attract strolling shoppers and new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, shops in downtown Hermosa have lost business to nearby malls 
and cities, officials say. Manhattan Beach, for example, attracted many 
shoppers and businesses after officials spruced up the city's downtown area 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Hermosa Beach wants a piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to become Manhattan Beach," said Councilman John Bowler. 
"We're just trying to emulate its business success."  
</P>
<P>
 Last year the city established a commission to consider improving the area, 
and officials worked with a Canadian consulting firm to develop the latest 
plan. Improving the area is more important than ever, Bowler said, because 
dwindling state funds to local cities have forced Hermosa Beach to become more 
reliant on tax dollars from merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the project will probably begin next year and take at least four years 
to complete. But before construction companies can submit bids on the work, 
officials must finalize several aspects of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has yet to decide whether to raise parking rates downtown. To help 
pay for the project, the consulting firm recommended rates on downtown meters 
be raised from 25 cents per half-hour to 25 cents for 15 minutes. Residents 
would be exempt from the fee, but the plan has drawn criticism because the city 
already has a reputation for overzealously enforcing expired parking meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Robert (Burgie) Benz believes raising parking rates will drive away 
customers. But overall, he supports the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should help improve things," he said. "It should be a damn carnival 
downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Benz believes the city's downtown began deteriorating about 15 years ago when 
council members began imposing tighter restrictions on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hermosa just languished in this type of atmosphere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benz is optimistic that business will improve in the area. The current 
council has eased regulations on merchants to promote new investments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And plans are under way to improve the city's pier, which traditionally has 
attracted many visitors to Hermosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, city officials must determine how to pay for the work on the streets and 
sidewalks. City staff members are expected to make funding recommendations to 
the council in January.

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; EPA'S REPORT ON DDT TESTING IS DUE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will report tonight on the results of 
recent chemical testing in a South Bay neighborhood where DDT was found last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials will discuss the results of their tests of soil, indoor air 
and drinking water in homes along West 204th Street between Normandie and 
Vermont avenues in an unincorporated area east of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests turned up DDT and another pesticide in household dust in 25 of the 
28 homes tested, EPA officials reported last month. However, no contaminants 
were found in sufficient levels to merit the permanent relocation of people in 
the area, they said. Residents were angered by that conclusion, claiming that 
the EPA was deliberately downplaying the test findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood sits near a former DDT-manufacturer, Montrose Chemical Corp., 
which is now a federal Superfund site. To the north is a proposed Superfund 
site that was once a synthetic rubber factory operated by Shell Oil Co. and Dow 
Chemical Co., among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will discuss the testing and planned cleanup activities at a public 
meeting from 6 to 9:30 p.m. at the Van Deene School Auditorium, 826 Javelin 
St., near Vermont Avenue. More information is available from the EPA at (415) 
744-2182 or (800) 231-3075. DEBORAH SCHOCH

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; POLICE PROBE POSSIBLE LINK IN 3 SEX ASSAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are investigating whether the rape of two women in their 60s and the 
sexual assault of a 52-year-old woman are connected.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest attack occurred Nov. 24 in Manhattan Beach when a 68-year-old woman 
was raped about 2:30 a.m. by a man who entered her home through an unlocked 
sliding door, said Manhattan Beach police spokeswoman Mary Laquet. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was described as a 25- to 30-year-old black man, about 6 feet tall 
with a muscular build, short hair and a medium complexion. He stole a small 
amount of cash and then fled from the home in the 1300 block of 17th Street, 
police said. Authorities say the man's description is similar to that of 
suspects in two assaults committed recently in the harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, a 66-year-old woman was raped in Harbor City after a man broke 
into her home in the 1600 block of 262nd Street and cut the cords on her 
telephone, said Los Angeles Police Detective Latricia Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 6, a woman working at a San Pedro dry-cleaning firm was sexually 
assaulted after a man entered the business about 10:30 a.m., pointed a gun at 
the woman and ordered her to the back of the business. The man fled with $25, 
Simmons said. JAMES BENNING

COMMUNITY NEWS: GARDENA; NEW LAW PHASES OUT SWAP MEETS BY 1998 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously adopted a new ordinance banning swap meets in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vermont Drive-In and Swap Meet, which has operated since the mid-1960s, 
will be phased out during the next three years under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth W. Landau said about 300 residents had complained to the 
city that the weekend swap meet creates excessive foot and auto traffic in 
their neighborhoods, as well as trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide Theatre Corp. and Pacific Theatres, which own the property, agreed 
to a settlement with the city earlier this month. The city had proposed moving 
vendors out within 18 months, but the owners wanted eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 650 vendors will be allowed to continue to sell their wares until Jan. 
1, 1998.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PORT OF LOS ANGELES; FIRM ORDERED TO PAY HEAL THE BAY $50,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An oil spill in Los Angeles Harbor has brought the nonprofit environmental 
organization Heal the Bay a $50,000 windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese shipping firm Shinko Maritime Co. Ltd. was ordered to make the 
contribution and pay another $50,000 in fines when it pleaded no contest on 
Monday to a charge of negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 About 630 gallons of heavy oil spilled into the harbor when the freighter 
Tropical Dawn, chartered by Shinko, was refueling Aug. 9, 1993, said Los 
Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Booms that were placed around the Tropical Dawn contained most of the spill, 
but the pilings and seawall beneath about 1,600 feet of pier had to be 
steam-cleaned, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heal the Bay spokesman Roger Gorke said he hoped the hefty fine, ordered by 
Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Barry Taylor, would be a deterrent. "Some of 
these companies think that environmental pollution is just another cost of 
doing business," Gorke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heal the Bay, which has an annual operating budget of $500,000 to $750,000, 
focuses on restricting the flow of debris that washes into the ocean from area 
streets, Gorke said. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; CITY COUNCIL APPROVES MINORITY HIRING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members unanimously approved an affirmative action hiring plan 
Monday, almost five years after an original proposal was drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for hiring that reflects the ethnic makeup of the county work 
force.Although no numbers have been set, beginning next July, city officials 
will set goals for hiring of women and minorities. Those goals, however, will 
be considered targets and not quotas, according to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year the city came under fire for not having an affirmative 
action plan when it applied for a federal police grant. Although the Police 
Department received the grant, reports released during the application revealed 
that the force had only three African Americans among 90 sworn officers. The 
city is 28% black.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several racial discrimination suits filed against the department 
spurred U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and Department of Justice 
officials to question the city's lack of an affirmative action plan. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said a plan was drafted in 1989, but it was never brought 
before the council for a vote. Officials could not offer an explanation for the 
delay. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; COUNCIL APPROVES 10% INCREASE IN WATER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a 10% increase in the cost of water, the first 
in a series of rate hikes that over five years could add up to 44% to users' 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases, officials say, are necessary to offset rising water costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A water rate study completed late in the summer revealed that consumers' water 
rates have not risen since 1989. During that time, the cost of water that the 
city buys from outside sources has gone up almost 200%, said Charles 
Herbertson, director of public works. The city has been absorbing the cost, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A single-family household that pays about $24 a month will pay nearly $27 a 
month by the end of the year. If planned rate increases are approved, that 
household could pay as much as $37 a month by 1999. For large water users, 
including apartment buildings and businesses, the costs could reach hundreds of 
dollars a month, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Steven Andersen, Ginny M. Lambert and Betty J. Ainsworth voted 
for the increase. Mayor Larry Guidi and Councilwoman Martha Bails voted against 
it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't see voting for another tax increase on the community," Guidi said. 
"We're coming back again after raising the utility users fee and asking for 
money without reorganizing the city."  
</P>
<P>
 The rate increases initially will raise enough money to keep the water 
department from dipping into the city's general fund, Herbertson said. If the 
additional increases are passed, the revenue would be used to upgrade the 
city's water system, including replacing aging water mains and increasing the 
capacity of the water treatment plant, he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PALOS VERDES ESTATES; DANGEROUS-ANIMAL ORDINANCE ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents, police and animals have been given a new code to live by. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Estates City Council voted 5 to 0 on Nov. 22 to enact a 
dangerous-animal ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Police Department took over animal regulation from the Los Angeles 
chapter of the Humane Society last year, but existing city codes did not offer 
police any guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Gary Johansen said the department received about six calls last 
year of dogs biting, and in some cases killing, other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Animals that seriously injure or kill people or pets are considered dangerous, 
as are dogs maintained for the purpose of fighting, according to the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Violating the ordinance is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in 
jail and a $1,000 fine for the owner, said City Atty. Stephanie Scher. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous animals may be put to sleep or allowed to stay in the city as long 
as they are properly contained and identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners who disagree with police that their animals are dangerous may take 
their case to the Humane Society pound master. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: ROLLING HILLS ESTATES; CITY COUNCIL NAMES BECK NEW MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the mayor's gavel has changed hands in this peninsula city, don't 
expect many changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Following custom, the City Council voted 5 to 0 on Nov. 22 to make Mayor Pro 
Tem Robert Beck the next mayor.He replaces Barbara Rauch, who goes back to the 
council after a one-year mayoral term. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, who owns a law firm in Torrance, said he has no hidden agenda and no 
special projects to push through the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I come up with something, I'll give you a call," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Beck, 46, mentioned the George F Canyon Nature Center and the neighborhood 
compatibility study, which outlines the character of each neighborhood, as 
important projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's vote carries no extra weight, and his recommendations for city 
committees must be approved by the council, said City Manager Doug Prichard. 
</P>
<P>
 With Councilwoman Susan Seamans abstaining, the council selected Peter M. 
Weber as the new mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, a former planning commissioner, is serving his first four-year term on 
the council and said he expects to run again in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Becks were recently honored as the South Bay's international family of the 
year. Beck and his wife, Nancy, have five children, ages 5 to 22, including two 
who were adopted from Russia in August, 1993.

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; PILLARS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES; FOR SOUTH BAY'S PIERS, 
IT'S A CONSTANT CYCLE OF CONSTRUCTION, DESTRUCTION, RECONSTRUCTION. MORE THAN 
MERELY WALKWAYS, THEY ARE A TIE TO CITIES' PASTS AND A VISION FOR THEIR FUTURE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are perched on the westernmost side of the continent, at the very water's 
edge, and yet somehow it still isn't quite far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 So we build piers. 
</P>
<P>
 They jut from every South Bay beach town, from Manhattan to Hermosa to 
Redondo, fingers of wood or concrete reaching out to the sea. For more than a 
hundred years we have built them, enjoyed them, watched them get knocked down 
by waves or fires, and then built them up again. No matter how well-built they 
are, no matter how many tons of concrete or miles of reinforcing steel are put 
into them, someday the piers will crumble and topple, a victim of time and salt 
and pounding waves. But eventually, the piers will rise again. It's a constant 
cycle of construction and destruction and reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 We're in a reconstruction cycle now. New or newly renovated piers are busting 
out all over the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In Redondo Beach, city officials are planning a January opening for the new 
Municipal Pier, nearly seven years after storms and a fire dumped much of the 
old horseshoe-shaped pier into the ocean. In Hermosa Beach, plans are being 
formulated to renovate that city's 30-year-old fishing pier with new railings, 
beacons, a new snack shop and, maybe, a lighted neon tube running the pier's 
entire 1,140-foot length. In Manhattan Beach, a restoration of that city's 
928-foot, 1920s-vintage concrete pier, including the Roundhouse at the end, was 
completed two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an important process, this pier renewal, more important than simply 
providing platforms for fishermen or diners or strolling lovers. Because piers 
reflect as well as define the cities that they connect to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways a pier provides an identity for a community," says James 
Crumpley, of Moffatt & Nichol Engineers in Long Beach, who has designed piers 
up and down the West Coast -- including the Hermosa Beach Pier in the early 
1960s. "Sometimes you can tell a lot about a community just by looking at its 
pier." 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly is true in the South Bay. The graceful lines and stately light 
towers of the Manhattan Beach Pier suit the quiet, upscale, family-oriented 
city of Manhattan Beach -- a town so traditionally staid that until the 1930s 
even men weren't allowed to wear topless bathing suits on the beach. The spare, 
utilitarian look of the Hermosa Beach fishing pier likewise matches that city's 
laid-back, unassuming style. Under reconstruction in Redondo Beach, the 
Municipal Pier, with its collection of arcades, fish restaurants and bikini 
shops, harks back to the days when Redondo Beach was one of the wildest, 
bawdiest, most sin-saturated waterfronts on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, piers are simultaneously a connection to the past and a vision for 
the future. And in the South Bay's piers, you can see plenty of both. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The design life of this project is 50 years," says City of Redondo Beach 
engineer Richard Becker as he watches construction workers wrestle another 
piece of the Municipal Pier into place. "But the actual life? Who knows? All we 
can do is build it as strong as we possibly can. We'd like to have it last a 
hundred years, but . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's voice trails off, as if he really doesn't want to be nailed down to a 
prediction. And who can blame him for not wanting to tempt the pier gods? After 
all, the recent history of the Redondo Beach pier has not been one of sunny 
good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo is the granddaddy of South Bay pier communities. The first of its 
piers was built in 1889, when some entrepreneurs decided that the deep-water 
canyon lying just off Redondo Beach made it a natural place for a port -- this 
at a time when the now mighty Port of Los Angeles on the other side of the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula was a mosquito-infested swamp.  
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Redondo piers were strictly commercial ventures, not 
recreational ones. Until about 1912, ships bearing lumber and other goods 
offloaded at the three piers -- also called wharves -- that extended from 
Redondo's beaches, with trains standing by to transport the goods inland. 
Thriving port-side businesses offered gambling and prostitution.  
</P>
<P>
 But eventually San Pedro won favor over Redondo as the site for a deep-water 
port, and Redondo's piers began to be used more for fishing and recreation than 
maritime commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1988 the Redondo Beach pier was an amalgamation of two old recreational 
piers -- the Horseshoe Pier, built in 1926, and the Monstad Pier, built in 1928 
-- with a "Fishing Promenade" built in 1983 connecting the two. Crammed with 
restaurants, an arcade and beach-style shops, the Redondo Beach pier was 
visited by about 4 million people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And then multiple disasters struck. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1988, two storms battered the pier and ripped out 20 pilings. 
While repairs were under way, another storm in April wiped out the Fishing 
Promenade and damaged the Monstad section. Then in May, while workers were 
again frantically trying to repair the pier in time for the summer season, a 
fire broke out. Business owners, visitors and workers had to run for their 
lives as creosote-soaked timbers went up in black, oily smoke. When it was 
over, 34,000 square feet of the pier and 15 businesses had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was absolutely stunned," remembers Jim Hall, a lifelong South Bay resident 
and now executive director of the Redondo Beach Pier Assn., which represents 
major leaseholders on the pier. "It was always just the place to go in Redondo 
Beach. It was an institution. But I was absolutely confident that it would rise 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was so sure the pier would come back, or even if they wanted 
it to. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners in the area were happy the pier was gone, and with it the 
crowds it attracted. Soon after the City Council promised to rebuild, squabbles 
erupted between pro-pier and anti-pier forces. Finally, in March, 1991, after 
months of rancorous debate, Redondo Beach voters approved the pier 
reconstruction. After more disagreements over the design, the $11-million 
reconstruction project, paid for with federal, state and local funds, was 
launched in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of looking like a rickety old wooden barge, as the old pier did, the 
new concrete-decked pier will have a more seaworthy look, with wooden 
guardrails and lampposts resembling lighthouses and shade coverings resembling 
sails. Relief impressions of porpoises, seals and a 40-foot whale will be 
etched into the concrete deck. 
</P>
<P>
 On the practical side, the pier will also be five feet higher above the water 
-- allowing storm waves to wash under instead of over the pier -- and will be 
supported by more than 200 concrete pilings driven as far as 70 feet into the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The public will have a chance to walk out on the new pier after the 
ribbon-cutting ceremony Jan. 22. But it will still be two or three years before 
the structures on top of the pier are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 What those structures will be remains a subject of debate. Last summer the 
largest leaseholder, Steve Shoemaker, announced he was putting his lease up for 
sale on the grounds that city officials wouldn't let him put up an attraction 
such as a wax museum or an aquarium. City officials have said they would prefer 
something a little classier.  
</P>
<P>
 But after all the arguments are over, Redondo Beach, a city founded on piers, 
will once again have a pier to call its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot more than just a pier," Becker says. "It's a fundamental part 
of this city's history." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Whenever Wilmer Drake, 77, wants to recall the Manhattan Beach Pier of his 
youth, all he has to do is take a walk down Manhattan Beach Boulevard to the 
water's edge. The pier is still there, looking just like it did oh so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like it was back in the 1920s," says Drake, a retired plumber who 
used to fish off the pier when he was a boy. And that's just the way Drake and 
most other people in Manhattan Beach like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Manhattan Beach pier was built at the turn of the century. A wooden 
fishing pier, it was knocked down by a storm a few years later, and another 
wooden pier, made out of lashed-together railroad ties, was put up in its 
place. That pier, too, was soon knocked down by waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach residents, obviously tired of having their piers knocked down 
so easily, in 1918 started building a state-of-the-art structure with concrete 
pilings and decking -- the first steel-reinforced concrete pier on the West 
Coast. It was intended to be 1,500 feet long, but in 1920 the city ran out of 
money at 928 feet and decided to just leave it that length. In 1921 the 
distinctive "Roundhouse" building -- actually an octagon -- was built at the 
end to sell hot dogs and soft drinks.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the city's only pier. Farther north, at 33rd Street, was Peck's 
Pier, a wooden structure built in the early 1900s. In those days of segregation 
-- which wasn't confined to the Deep South -- it was the only pier in Manhattan 
Beach that blacks were allowed to use. Eventually, a combination of storms and 
social justice rid the city of both the pier and its reason for existence. . 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the main Manhattan Beach Pier held on through countless storms and 
breaking waves for seven decades -- an astonishing amount of time given the 
life expectancy of other open-ocean piers. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, however, corrosion of some concrete pilings and the steel 
reinforcing rods in the deck made major repairs necessary. There were several 
proposals for changes, but the city decided not to change a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of sentiment to keep the pier in its traditional 
configuration," says Mike Daly, interim administrative services director for 
the city. After all, he added, "the pier is like our Statue of Liberty," and 
who would presume to change the Statue of Liberty? 
</P>
<P>
 The $4.4-million restoration project, which included replacing the entire deck 
and rebuilding the Roundhouse, which contains a cafe and an aquarium/marine 
museum, was completed in 1992. The Roundhouse was rebuilt as it was in the 
1920s, as were the globe-mounted light poles that line the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 True, some things change. For example, it's more of a strollers' pier than a 
fishing pier these days. Although there are still some fishermen, it is 
cappuccino, not fish bait, that's in the hands of most people on the Manhattan 
Beach Pier these days. That's partly because of changing demographics and 
partly because the fishing ain't what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to catch halibut in abundance off the pier," Drake remembers. "Caught 
barracuda and sea bass, too. But they hardly ever catch them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Fishing prospects aside, Drake, like most people in Manhattan Beach, seems 
happy with the way the pier restoration turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it this way," he says. "It's good to have something just the way it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They have cappuccino at the end of the Manhattan Beach Pier," says Mary 
Rooney, assistant city manager of Hermosa Beach. "At the end of our pier we 
have fish guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney laughs as she talks about the divergent images of the two piers in the 
adjacent beachside communities. But it's the sort of comment Hermosa residents 
make about their pier. They may love their pier, but they aren't going to put 
on any airs about it. It's a fishing pier. Always has been. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa Beach traces its pier history to 1904, to a wooden trestle that lasted 
only nine years before a storm knocked it down. The next pier, a 900-footer 
built in 1914, fared better, but was condemned as unsafe in 1957. The current 
pier, a 1,140-foot concrete-decked structure, was completed in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was almost three decades ago, and now, armed with $1.5 million in 
county special improvement funds, the city is looking at sprucing up the pier. 
Tentative plans call for expanding the plaza at the beach end of the pier, 
refurbishing the outside of the county lifeguard headquarters building, adding 
a cafe at the end and installing fishing platforms along the sides of the pier 
to give fishermen more room. Decorative changes would include putting in new 
lighting along the length of the pier, perhaps including a neon tube that would 
extend the length of the pier like a glowing guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishermen who use the pier aren't too sure about the neon guardrail. But 
they like the fishing platform idea. At 20 feet wide, the Hermosa pier is 
narrower than most, and even though overhead casting is prohibited, when it's 
crammed with strollers on weekends it's almost too crowded to fish from. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful idea," says Modesto Martin, 73, of Los Angeles, who's been 
fishing off the Hermosa Beach pier almost every weekend for 16 years. "We need 
more room." 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably going to take a while. The plaza expansion phase of the 
$3.5-million project should be done by 1996, but the pier renovation will have 
to wait until the city finds more money. Eventually, though, Hermosa Beach 
officials assume the pier renovation project will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 And if history is any indication, they're probably right. Storms, fires, 
political squabbles and lack of money have been crashing against South Bay 
piers for more than a century. Yet somehow, those piers always get fixed.

 "I was tired of wearing a suit," says Mike Hogan, a one-time computer 
salesman. When he saw pictures of a friend's father's restaurant in the 
Sacramento- and Folsom-based Java Centrale chain, he almost immediately decided 
to buy a franchise. So a year and a half ago, together with another friend (and 
now partner) Keoni Smith, he took off his suit and opened this 
coffee/sandwich/dessert place in Torrance just across from Del Amo Fashion 
Square. It's a modern-looking cafe decked out in purple, yellow and black, 
highlighted by a counter full of desserts and muffins and a wall displaying 
coffee beans from around the world -- India, Ethiopia, Costa Rica, Zimbabwe, 
Sumatra, Hawaii, Colombia. And though it may be the coffee beans that Java 
Centrale is known for, this is also a popular spot for lunch, which brings in 
workers from nearby office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many order one of Java's salads, perhaps the antipasto salad ($4.15), with 
salami, red peppers, provolone and marinated artichokes, or the Greek chicken 
salad ($4.99), enlivened by Greek peppers, olives and feta. 
</P>
<P>
 The sandwiches, all served on fresh bread and rolls from the Pier Avenue 
Bakery, include one based on chicken breast with pesto, provolone, red bell 
peppers . . . and, rather oddly, alfalfa sprouts ($4.99). The ham and Swiss 
comes with artichoke hearts and a spicy Creole mustard and mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a place to save room for dessert, even if it means passing up a 
sandwich. Some of the cakes, like the mocha crunch, come from L.A. Mousse. The 
cheesecakes, from the Cheesecake Factory, include Heath Bar fudge, raspberry 
white chocolate, brownie fudge and pumpkin spice (all $3.15 a slice).  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, as any cheesecake purist knows, the only way to test the worth of a 
cheesecake is to sample the plain version. It's not as good as my mom's, but 
it'll do.  
</P>
<P>
 Java Centrale is at 21223 Hawthorne Blvd., Torrance. (310) 792-1755. Open 
Monday through Thursday 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., 
Saturday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

PERSONAL BEST: NOTABLE ACHIEVERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY; INSTRUCTOR HAS FLAIR FOR 
THE ART OF TEACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerald Scheib's students either hate his classes or love them, but the ones 
who love them keep coming back again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why teaching is so satisfying," said Scheib, an art teacher at Mission 
College in Sylmar who sees art in everyday objects like the designs of cars, 
chairs and clothes. He was recently named California's Outstanding Higher 
Education Art Educator by the California Art Education Assn. He believes he is 
the first community college teacher to earn the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Often his students walk into class insecure and unsure of their abilities, but 
then find the talent hidden within them. They get hooked, and keep coming back 
to take more classes, even auditing classes just to absorb more knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get rid of these people," he said, jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheib himself was hooked into art as a college student in the late 1950s and 
early 1960s while pursuing an engineering degree. He had been struggling 
through calculus and breezing through art classes, but thought everyone was 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart wasn't in engineering," said Scheib, a member of the Sputnik 
generation who used to test model rockets in the desert.  
</P>
<P>
 Scheib and his friends at Bell High School in the 1950s -- admittedly a group 
of nerds -- would get together to grind telescope lenses and go on astronomy 
outings. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his third year in college, he switched his focus from engineering to 
art and graduated from Cal State Los Angeles. "I felt my life would be empty 
without it," Scheib said. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has kept involved in engineering, with 20 years of experience in the 
U.S. Navy Reserves as an electronics technician. And what became his favorite 
forms of art -- metal sculpting and jewelry-making -- did neatly combine the 
precision of science and engineering with the creativity of artistic 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always likened myself to being a pioneer," Scheib said. He was the first 
photography teacher at Sylmar High School when it opened in 1963. After a stint 
as an art teacher at University High School, Scheib landed a teaching job at 
newly opened Mission College in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had to drive everywhere," said Scheib, remembering what it was like when 
the college held classes in storefronts scattered around the San Fernando area. 
His first class was in a second-floor business office on Brand Boulevard. Even 
now, after the campus opened in Sylmar in 1991, the art classes still do not 
have a permanent site. Classes are held in a nearby county-owned building. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheib is one of only two full-time art teachers at the school, an example of 
what the current recession has done to educational budgets. There is not even 
an art major at the school, although the jewelry class Scheib teaches is a draw 
because Mission is one of only a few community colleges to offer the program. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Scheib, the past president of the California Art Education Assn. who 
earned the award partly because of his volunteer work to promote the arts in 
schools, is optimistic about the future of arts in colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art is the reason for life," said Scheib, arguing that students do better at 
schools when there is an art program. Even if they are not going to pursue a 
career in the arts, it helps give students a sense of fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never been a problem finding students or finding an interest. We will 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 The scaling back of budgets is a necessary change in order to survive, but 
when tough times are over there has to be a place for arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should be afraid of change," Scheib said. "If we didn't have change we 
would be dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Change is also part of the reason he enjoys art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never get tired of it," said Scheib, who plans on working on his skills as 
a hand engraver when he retires in about three years. "There's always something 
to learn."

 Magic Mountain is offering free admission the next two weekends to anyone who 
donates a new toy worth $10 or more to the Toys for Tots drive, park officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The toys will be collected at the admissions gate by Marine Corps reserves, 
who will then distribute them to needy children throughout the Southland, said 
Palmer Moody, a spokesman for the amusement park. He said all toys should be 
new and not wrapped in Christmas paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular park admission for adults is $29, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Mountain has collected more than 250,000 toys in the decade that it has 
participated in the 47-year-old program, Moody said. MARK SABBATINI

MISSOURI'S O'LINEY STRONG AT FINISH TO BEAT PURDUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior Paul O'Liney scored a career-high 24 points and Missouri held off 
Purdue's one offensive push for a 69-66 victory Wednesday night in the Great 
Eight basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Liney, who had matched his career high with 23 points in the season-opener, 
had all 11 of his second-half points in the final 9:38. His sophomore backcourt 
mate, Jason Sutherland, finished with 14 points, five in the final 48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a matchup of conference champions from last season as Missouri 
(2-0) went unbeaten in the Big Eight and Purdue (3-1) won the Big Ten. Both 
were hit hard by losses, Missouri with three graduated starters and a 
season-ending injury to freshman of the year Kelly Thames; Purdue by the 
decision of national player of the year Glenn Robinson to opt for the NBA 
draft, where he was the No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue, which won the three-game Big Island Invitational, struggled 
offensively except for a second-half spurt that featured junior college 
transfer Roy Hairston. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston had six points in a 12-4 run that brought the Boilermakers into a 
55-55 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston finished with 17 points. Brandon Brantley had 12 and Porter Roberts 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue, which trailed, 39-28, when Missouri scored the first basket of the 
second half, took its first lead since 2-0 at 59-58 on two free throws by 
Cuonzo Martin with 3:58 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Liney and Roberts exchanged three-pointers and the Tigers got the lead for 
good on two free throws by O'Liney with 1:46 to play. After Martin missed a 
jumper, Missouri ran time off the clock and Julian Winfield was able to save 
the ball with one second left on the 35-second shot clock. Winfield inbounded 
the ball to Sutherland near the baseline and the 6-foot-1 guard got off a 
leaning one-hander that went through the net as the horn sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland added two more free throws after a turnover and the Tigers led 
67-62 with 45 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland and O'Liney each made one of two free throws following Purdue 
baskets and the Boilermakers had a chance to tie. They went inside and Brantley 
missed a dunk with 10 seconds left and then missed a three-pointer with four 
seconds left.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BLUE-CHIP RALLY FALTERS; YIELDS SLIDE ON REPORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A late spree of computerized selling erased a strong rally in blue-chip stocks 
Wednesday, while bond yields fell back for the first time in three days on an 
unexpected report of economic weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 The closely watched Dow Jones industrial average, which gained as much as 23 
points early in the session, ended the day up just 0.68 point at 3,739.23. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes were mostly weaker, with the New York Stock Exchange's 
composite index off 0.49 point at 248.41, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 
off 1.48 points at 453.69 and the Nasdaq composite index down 1.16 points at 
750.32. 
</P>
<P>
 But the American Stock Exchange's market value index edged up 0.77 point to 
433.86. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE, advancing issues led declines by a margin of nearly 5 to 4. Big 
Board volume totaled 300.48 million shares, up from 286.62 million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks got support for most of the session from the bond market, where the 
Treasury's 30-year bond yield retreated to 8.0% from Tuesday's 8.03% after a 
government report of weaker-than-expected factory use suggested some economic 
weakness. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 11/32 point, 
or $3.44 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields initially rose after the Commerce Department said the gross domestic 
product rose at a 3.9% annual rate in the third quarter, 0.5 percentage point 
higher than an earlier estimate. Inflation measures in the report also rose. 
</P>
<P>
 But prices rose after the government said factories weren't operating as close 
to their limits as initially thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier capacity utilization rates showed factories running at 84.9% in 
October. The government revised that number downward to 84.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower utilization figure was seen as anti-inflationary and lifted the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the early rally in stocks amounted to a continued technical 
rebound after last week's market rout, which saw the Dow average plunge 137 
points in two days. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rally lacked conviction, said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at 
Prudential Securities. "No one is convinced that we're out of the woods by any 
means," he said. "You do have some overselling and some seasonal bias to the 
upside, but this is still a market that is driven by concern about a Fed 
tightening, about a too-strong economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The stocks of economically sensitive companies, which took the brunt of the 
losses last week, rose as the strong economic data suggested the economy is 
still growing, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the 30 Dow index components, United Technologies was up 1 at 58 1/2, 
International Paper rose 7/8 to 71 1/2 and Union Carbide added 7/8 to 28 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The stocks of international companies benefited from the ratification of the 
GATT international trade treaty on Tuesday by the U.S. House of 
Representatives. The Senate is expected to vote on the measure today. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Senate ratifies, I think you'll see a follow-through with stocks," 
said Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest beneficiaries of the optimism on GATT were chemical stocks. In 
addition to Union Carbide, Dow Chemical rose 1 to 64, Goodrich added 3/4 to 44 
1/2 and Monsanto rose 1 1/8 to 72. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among cyclicals, Weyerhaeuser rose 1 1/2 to 38 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler gained 1 to 48 1/2 amid expectations that its board will raise the 
common-stock dividend at a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texaco rose 1/8 to 62 1/8 and Apache jumped 2 7/8 to 28. Apache and Texaco 
said they reached an agreement under which Apache will buy more than 300 Texaco 
oil fields for $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lotus Development rose 3 to 44 3/4 on renewed market rumors that Oracle 
Corp. was preparing to make a bid for Lotus. Both companies declined to 
comment, citing policies against discussing market speculation. Oracle was off 
1 3/8 at 41 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were higher. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed at 
19,075.62, up 149.13 points, while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average edged up 
3.98 points at 2,048.26. In London, the Financial Times 100-share average 
gained 20.3 points to close at 3,081.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index closed 4.82 points lower at 2,591.34 after 
President-elect Ernesto Zedillo made some surprise Cabinet appointments. 
Telefonos de Mexico's American depositary receipts fell 1 3/8 to 52 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver futures, meanwhile, hit their lowest level in nearly a year when a 
price slide linked to waning inflation fears steepened dramatically. Gold 
futures also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver led a broad decline in commodity prices that lowered the Commodity 
Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities 1.35 points to 229.23. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver for December delivery dropped 14.9 cents on the New York Merc to $4.896 
an ounce, the lowest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Dec. 7, 
1993. December gold fell $1.30 to $380.70 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar ended slightly lower in foreign exchange trading.

 Dole Now Owns About 99.5% of Castle & Cooke: The Westlake Village-based food 
company said its Dole Acquisition Corp. unit accepted all 5,019,947 tendered 
shares in the Hawaiian real estate developer at $15.75 apiece and that it 
expects the merger to take place within 30 days. Under Hawaii law, Dole Food 
Co. said, it can complete the merger with Castle & Cooke Homes Inc. without the 
need for a vote of that company's shareholders.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SANTA FE SPRINGS; $2,000 FEE FOR MASSAGE PARLORS CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN COX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is considering a combination of zoning restrictions and hefty 
fees to discourage illegitimate massage parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which is scheduled for consideration at the council's meeting 
Dec. 8, would require prospective massage parlor operators to pay $2,000 when 
applying for a business permit.The fees would pay for extensive background 
checks of the applicants, said Fred Latham, assistant city manager. Permits 
currently are free. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed massage parlor would also have to be approved by the city's 
planning commission and council before opening in a commercial business area, 
such as a shopping mall or office building.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials declared a moratorium on massage parlor applications in 
February after receiving a number of inquiries from people wanting to open 
them. The moratorium expires next month. JOHN COX

CITY HALL NEWS: PASADENA; REPLACEMENT FOR UNSAFE FIREHOUSE STILL UNBUILT AFTER 
5 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN UHRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1989, Pasadena Fire Department officials decided Station 34 could not 
take another jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1917, the unreinforced masonry building sustained major damage in the 
1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, forcing city officials to look for another 
home for a fire station to serve the southeast part of the city. In the 
meantime, the Fire Department obtained a special permit to use temporary 
trailers on Del Mar Boulevard, a short distance from the old station. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially the Fire Department had planned to use the trailers until mid-1990. 
But today, after the five-year special-use permit for the trailers has expired, 
some observers are wondering if a permanent station will ever be built. The 
Fire Department is expected to file for a new permit soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would only be there for 18 months," Fire Department 
administrative analyst Diane Johnson said of the trailer quarters at 1138 E. 
Del Mar Blvd. The property has been leased to the city by Caltech for $1 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Station 34 was closed, the city has spent close to $4 million on two new 
fire stations, one at Hammond Street and North Fair Oaks Avenue in Northwest 
Pasadena, the other on South Fair Oaks Avenue in Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The city says it lacks funds to build a firehouse to replace Station 34. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department, which was paying $1,400 a month to rent the trailers, has 
since bought them for a total of $65,000, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Thomson, who represents that area of the city, said the 
current situation is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue has not gone away and the residents there have not forgotten it," 
Thomson said. "When we went in there, we told the neighbors it would be a 
temporary site. It's been five years and I think people are past being patient. 
We need a permanent site." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Wilden, manager of the 107-unit condominium complex that faces the 
temporary fire station on Del Mar Boulevard, agrees. But he said residents, who 
for years have complained about sirens and blaring horns of firetrucks leaving 
the temporary station, will not tolerate a permanent station on the same site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an ongoing problem," Wilden said. "The best scenario would be that 
the temporary station would be temporary and that they would move into a 
permanent station somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 That might be easier said than done. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thomson said he hopes that Caltech, which is included in the 
station's service area, will contribute to the cost of building a new station, 
Caltech spokesman Hall Daily said the school has received no proposals for a 
new station and no funding requests for such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department concedes that it has no plans for relocating Station 34 or 
building a permanent station. The old station, on Oak Knoll Avenue, still 
stands but is boarded up. Last month, the city installed a flashing yellow 
light in front of the Del Mar station, a condition of the original special-use 
permit issued in 1989 that had never been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has just had delays for one reason or another, and no one has ever 
done anything about it," Wilden said.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: PICO RIVERA; COUNCIL DROPS PLAN TO HOLD FEWER MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has shelved a proposal to reduce the number of council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Beatrice Proo and Councilman John G. Chavez opposed the plan by Vice 
Mayor Garth G. Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't support it from the outset," Proo said. "We need to conduct business 
in a timely manner and offer an opportunity for input from the public. I'd say 
this is a dead issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner suggested reducing the number of meetings of the council and other 
city agencies to save money. Under his plan, the council would have met once 
every three weeks or once a month instead of every two weeks. JOHN D. WAGNER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: DOWNEY; CITY TO ALLOW APPEALS OF CART IMPOUND FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grocery stores and other businesses will soon be able to appeal charges that 
they have previously paid when they retrieve abandoned shopping carts from a 
city impound yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has decided that store managers should be able to argue their 
cases before a city administrator if they feel the charges are unfair.The city 
charges $25 for each basket plus $5 a day for storage. The city sells carts 
that aren't claimed within 20 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees might be waived, for example, if cart owners can show that the city 
confiscated carts that were on private property, said City Atty. Cheryl J. 
Kane. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane said the ordinance change is designed to protect the city from possible 
legal action by cart owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey stopped charging impound fees in July while city staff revised the 
ordinance to include the new appeals procedure, said City Manager Gerald M. 
Caton. The fees will be reinstated when the revised law takes effect Dec. 22.

 EL MONTE: The City Council has authorized the purchase of a police helicopter 
after renting one since September, 1993. The helicopter will cost $90,000 plus 
$400,000 for maintenance over the first five years and will allow more time in 
the air than the rented helicopter did.

 GLENDORA: The council approved development plans for a Super K mart at Lone

 PASADENA: Council members placed a measure on the March ballot to limit the 
amount the city can take annually from its water and power company to 8% of its 
profits. The city currently takes about 10% of utility profits a year. 
</P>

 SOUTH PASADENA: Former Mayor Lee D. Prentiss will accept $500,000 from the 
city for violating his civil rights, his attorney said. A jury had awarded 
Prentiss $1.2 million after agreeing with his claim that city officials had 
withdrawn a building permit as political retaliation. A judge reduced the 
verdict last month. The City Council must agree to the settlement as well.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SIGNAL HILL; SITE FOR PARK ACCEPTED WITH CLEANUP CLAUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes you can't even give away land in this city that once teemed with oil 
rigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two local charitable foundations finally persuaded the city last month to 
accept their gift of about a half an acre of land at the corner of Burnett 
Street and Gardena Avenue for a possible park.But the offer had been on the 
table for five years, and the city only accepted after the foundations agreed 
to pay $80,000 to clean up the contaminated site. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Director Gary Jones said the city did not want to get stuck paying to 
clean up soil saturated with oil from an abandoned well -- a common problem 
with vacant land in a city where millions of barrels of oil have been produced 
since 1921. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Memorial Medical Center Foundation and the Albert Reinhardt 
Foundation owned the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's parks commission has studied three possible uses: a park geared for 
people who work in Signal Hill, a community garden or an area for in-line 
roller-skating. STEVE EAMES

A WINNING RECIPE; 22,000 STUDENTS GET 2 FREE MEALS DAILY IN COMPTON SCHOOL 
DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMELYN CRUZ LAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Monday morning and, like clockwork, Tommie Callegari heads down a narrow 
street to a beige, weather-beaten building to begin her daily task of feeding 
22,000 schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 As director of Compton Unified School District's lunch program, Callegari 
oversees one of the few programs in the state that provides breakfast and lunch 
without charge to all students. About 90% of families in the area are low 
income and are eligible for free meals from the state, and the district pays 
for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years the school district's food program has been fraught with 
problems: a multimillion-dollar deficit and sagging employee morale. In 
addition, many students refused the lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 In two years, Callegari has made the program profitable, increased workers' 
enthusiasm and improved the menu, according to state officials. The lunch 
program also is also gaining popularity among students. About 4,000 more 
students are eating in school cafeterias now than when Callegari took over two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She encourages each school's cafeteria staff to prepare items from scratch, 
which is less expensive than using prepared foods such as chicken patties and 
fish sticks. Workers chop the onions, peppers and various vegetables for 
fajitas and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are also encouraged to use their own recipes whenever possible. Items 
such as rice pudding, sweet potato cake and whole-wheat cookies have begun 
appearing on school menus. 
</P>
<P>
 Callegari said she wanted to give her staff a chance to be creative, "of not 
just serving like robots but being able to put a little bit of themselves into 
(the job)." She added that home-style cooking has also made student meals more 
nutritious. Staff is able to control the amount of salt, fat and sugar in 
recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort paid off when the district received the state Department of 
Education's outstanding school lunch program award this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had such a remarkable improvement in the way they were organized, the 
initiative of the staff, the atmosphere that the staff worked under," said 
state evaluator George Schaedler.

 "Without doubt this is the most improved program I have reviewed in 15 years 
on the job," he wrote in his report. "Many of the staff at the sites who are 
now doing excellent jobs meeting federal and state requirements are the same 
ones who did not do this under previous administrations. This proves to me that 
the talent was always there at Compton, but the leadership in the past had 
failed in their task." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when the district first began offering free meals to all students, it 
hired a management firm to run the school cafeterias. School officials hoped to 
save money by bringing in outside expertise. But after three years, the program 
had run up $4 million in deficits, mostly due to poor record-keeping, according 
to district officials. The district ended the contract with United School Food 
Services and hired Callegari, a consultant with the state Department of 
Education, to manage the program. 
</P>
<P>
 She took a one-year leave of absence from her state job, but later resigned to 
accept the district position permanently. "I enjoyed that (state) work, but 
this was an opportunity to be able to do some of the things we told others they 
needed to be doing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent visit to Abraham Lincoln Elementary School, Callegari surveyed 
cafeteria workers as they served a procession of first-graders. She moved 
briskly and spoke softly while keeping a watchful eye on the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at what they eat and how much food they're throwing away," Callegari 
said. "That way I get an idea of what they like or don't like or if we're 
serving portions that are too large." 
</P>
<P>
 That day, most of the pint-size students finished their low-fat hamburgers and 
oven-baked french fries. However, some threw out their rice pudding and sliced 
peaches, prompting Callegari to comment on how finicky children can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next, we'll see how they like asparagus," she quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key reasons for the program's growing popularity among students is 
a new computerized record-keeping system that keeps track of meals served to 
low-income students without singling them out as they go through the lunch 
lines. The district has to record the number of meals served to low-income 
students to qualify for state funds for the meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "In elementary school, the kids don't really care that it's a free meal," 
Callegari said. "When they get to middle school they begin to care a little 
more that it's a free meal. And by the time they get to high school they freak 
out if it's a welfare program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very proud of our food service but we also want our students to be able 
to partake of it in a very dignified way," she said. Even hungry children will 
pass up eating if there's a possibility that they're going to be picked on by 
their peers, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in her modest, wood-paneled administrative office, Callegari beams while 
describing her plan to establish a districtwide nutrition program that would 
educate children about the value of good eating habits and the long-range 
effects diet has on health. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a dream of mine to make a lasting impression," she said, smiling.

FUNDING POSES MAJOR HURDLE FOR CITY'S NEW POLICE FORCE; HAWAIIAN GARDENS: 
COUNCIL MAJORITY FAVORS ULTILITY TAX TO PAY FOR OFFICERS AND EQUIPMENT. PATROLS 
BY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ARE SCHEDULED TO END IN FEBRUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hawaiian Gardens officials are moving ahead with plans to set up the city's 
own police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the City Council voted in September to create a police department, 
officials have selected a chief, and city staffers have ordered patrol cars, 
radios, computers and guns. Officials are recruiting 19 officers. A commercial 
building on Carson Street is being converted into a police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the city has to find the money to pay for it all. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate that it will cost $900,000 to start a police 
department and that annual operating costs will total $2.2 million. The city 
now pays $1.5 million a year to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to 
provide law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the five City Council members favor a 6% tax on residential utility 
bills and an 8% tax on business utility bills to pay for the department, which 
is scheduled take over law enforcement duties in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The three -- Mayor Kathleen Navejas and Councilmen Robert Canada and Robert 
Prida -- say a local police force will be able to protect residents and 
businesses better than the Sheriff's Department can. They also believe most 
residents are willing to pay higher taxes for improved law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say that the city, which has a $4.4-million budget, already is 
spending more money than it gets and that the utility tax will not generate 
enough revenue. The city had a $1.9-million surplus 18 months ago, but that was 
gobbled up last year by deficit spending, according to budget documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply can't afford it," said Councilman Domenic Ruggeri. He and 
Councilman Lupe Cabrera oppose the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Navejas says the city is not as bad off as Ruggeri makes it sound. She points 
out, for example, that the council has slashed $500,000 in spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility tax, which is likely to come up for a vote in January, could 
generate between $750,000 and $1 million a year, all of which would go toward 
law enforcement, Navejas said. The tax is expected to cost the typical 
household about $6 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ruggeri said the utility tax will bring in only $300,000 to $400,000 a 
year because many residents are eligible for exemptions granted to senior 
citizens or low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds so romantic to have our own police department, but I think we're 
making a big mistake," Ruggeri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navejas shrugged off the critics.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're my political opponents," she said. "They oppose everything I do. I 
believe we can afford the department if we adopt the utility tax." 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is carried out, Hawaiian Gardens will be the first city in Los 
Angeles County to form its own police department since Bell Gardens did so in 
1970, according to Lt. Margaret Cheney of the sheriff's contract law 
enforcement bureau.  
</P>
<P>
 Navejas said the council is only responding to the wishes of Hawaiian Gardens 
residents. About 73% of those who responded to a city survey said they favored 
a city police department, while 63% favored a utility tax to pay for it. The 
survey was sent to all 4,047 households in the city, which is slightly under 
one square mile. The city received 539 responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although buoyed by the results, Navejas, Canada and Prida are not rushing to 
approve the tax. Officials are holding a series of weekly town hall meetings to 
explain plans for the police department and proposed tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "For what we pay the Sheriff's Department, we get very little service," 
Navejas said at last week's meeting, held at a senior citizens apartment 
complex. "For just a little bit more money, we can provide the service you 
deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 She went a further in a recent city newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many times have people been hurt or maligned because an overburdened and 
understaffed sheriff did not respond to a call in time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her remarks rankled Lakewood Sheriff's Station Cmdr. Frank Vadurro, who 
defended the department's performance in Hawaiian Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an affront to the men and women who have been working hard and risking 
their lives to protect the citizens of Hawaiian Gardens," he said of Navejas' 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Vadurro said his station's average response time to 2,236 emergency calls in 
Hawaiian Gardens in 1993 was 3.7 minutes. "That's hardly an agency that's 
overburdened," he said. Moreover, he said, violent crime in Hawaiian Gardens 
dropped 5.4% in 1993 and 12.4% in the first eight months of this year compared 
with the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walter McKinney, who has been selected as the city's first police chief, 
said the proposed city department would have more officers on patrol than the 
Sheriff's Department and would be more effective by identifying and responding 
to potential problems instead of responding only to calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakewood Sheriff's Station currently assigns 12 deputies to each 
eight-hour shift patrolling Hawaiian Gardens, Artesia, Lakewood and Bellflower. 
Hawaiian Gardens officials said there are times now when no one is patrolling 
their city.

REP. MOORHEAD TAKES CHAIRMANSHIP SLIGHT IN STRIDE; CONGRESS: LONGTIME 
LAWMAKER'S AMIABLE NATURE COST HIM THE LEADERSHIP OF A KEY COMMITTEE. BUT HE 
SAYS HE IS STILL EAGER TO HELP THE NEW LEADERSHIP PASS ITS CONSERVATIVE AGENDA. 
</P>

<P>
 In Newt Gingrich's eyes, Rep. Carlos Moorhead was just too nice a guy. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Moorhead's gentle, congenial nature cost him the chairmanship 
of a key congressional committee, it's one thing he won't give up. Ever the 
good foot soldier, the get-along guy refuses to bad mouth Gingrich (R-Ga.), the 
incoming House Speaker who decided that despite 22 years in Congress' minority 
party, Moorhead wasn't aggressive enough to be one of the top power brokers in 
a new Republican era. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his shortcomings in the eyes of Gingrich, Moorhead said, "I just don't 
want to be a mean person." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead has been on an emotional roller coaster since the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, Moorhead won his 12th term at age 72, and a Republican wave swept 
the nation, giving the GOP control of the House of Representatives for the 
first time in 40 years. Moorhead would be part of the in crowd after laboring 
for decades in a House dominated by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Moorhead was 
in line to be appointed chairman, with the power to steer debate on a broad 
range of business, health, environment and technology issues. Moorhead also was 
the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee but had agreed to forgo 
the chairmanship of that committee because he was more interested in Energy and 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hard-nosed Gingrich was dealing the cards and the time-honored 
seniority system of appointing committee chairmen went out the window as it has 
on occasion over the years.  
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich told Moorhead he would have to be satisfied with a chairmanship of a 
judiciary subcommittee on intellectual property, which handles copyright 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think mine is a little different style perhaps than what Mr. Gingrich is 
looking for," said Moorhead, who is known for encouraging bipartisan 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Moorhead said he is satisfied with the subcommittee 
chairmanship, which will enable him to influence copyright issues, an important 
topic in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to tell you I think I shouldn't have had it (the committee 
chairmanship), because I do," said Moorhead, whose district includes Pasadena, 
Glendale and Burbank. "But there is something to be said for the new leadership 
of the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the election in 1996 will tell what kind of damage the intraparty 
jostling will have on Moorhead's political future should he decide to seek a 
13th term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it was handled didn't have anything to do with his ability or 
record," said political scientist Larry Berg of the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, who has a reputation as a staunchly conservative, hard-working but 
dull politician, was first elected to the state Assembly in 1966. He won two 
more terms in the Assembly before winning a seat in Congress in 1972 at the age 
of 50.  
</P>
<P>
 He first made a name for himself as a member of the House Judiciary Committee 
in 1974. He was part of a minority voting against the first article of 
impeachment against former President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last-ditch defenders of Nixon, Moorhead admitted after the 
president resigned that the evidence against him was damning. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmaker has backed one conservative cause after another over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, he was targeted for defeat by the National Organization for Women 
because he voted against an attempt to revive the Equal Rights Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 He voted for aid to the Contras in Nicaragua and was a strong backer of the 
"Star Wars" Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Moorhead voted against the Clinton Administration crime bill, 
which included a ban on assault rifles. He also opposed President Clinton's 
proposal to have employers pay for employees' health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Moorhead consistently draws rave reviews from conservative 
interest groups, while receiving failing grades from liberal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorhead generally avoids the spotlight in favor of spending a lot of time 
on committee assignments on technical issues. His tendency to be a low-key 
lawmaker has cost him points with his own party over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Moorhead survived a challenge by Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. 
(R-Va.) to assume the coveted position of the ranking Republican on the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee. Moorhead was next in line to succeed retiring 
Rep. Norman R. Lent (R-N.Y.), but Bliley portrayed himself as a stronger 
leader.  
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich now has chosen Bliley over Moorhead to chair the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that matters now, Moorhead said. He is looking forward to supporting 
the "Republican Contract with America" when Congress reconvenes. The contract, 
drafted by Gingrich, urges passage of a balanced-budget amendment, term limits 
for members of Congress, welfare reform and tax-reduction measures.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican Party has a big job to do," Moorhead said.

MISCALCULATION CREATES BUDGET BOMBSHELL FOR COUNTY, CITIES; SPENDING: LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY MUST TURN OVER MORE FUNDS TO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was bad enough for counties and cities when the state squeezed them like so 
many tubes of toothpaste to spread more of their property tax revenues to the 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state is saying that Los Angeles County and its cities did not 
contribute as much money as expected in the last two years and owe the state 
additional tax revenues for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next two years, the county must pay $85 million, county libraries 
must pay $837,000, Pomona must pay $934,000, West Covina must pay $239,000 and 
Covina must pay $195,000. Half will have to be repaid by May. 
</P>
<P>
 Many city officials learned about the cost at a Nov. 2 meeting with the county 
auditor-controller's staff and have to scramble to revise the city budgets and 
possibly cut services to make up for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was astounded, as were most of the people at the meeting," said Mary 
Bradley, Pasadena's finance director. The city will use a $1.6-million 
stabilization fund to pay $278,000 each year for the next two years and cover 
the loss of an additional $500,000 annually, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they found it hard to believe that local agencies were 
unaware of the legislation. "This was a hot topic of debate. . . . This should 
have come as no surprise to local government officials. . . . There had been 
about a year of discussions," said Steve Olsen, deputy director of the state 
Finance Department. "Los Angeles County knew what they had done." 
</P>
<P>
 While drawing up the 1992-93 budget, the state Legislature created a fund for 
schools and passed legislation ordering counties to shift property tax revenues 
from local governments to the schools fund. For the 1993-94 budget, legislators 
increased the amount to be shifted into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials said 12 counties, including Los Angeles County, calculated 
the shift differently than the state did, and in both years did not move enough 
money from local agencies to schools. And now cities, special districts and the 
county owe more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened, county officials said, was that the state forgot about 
redevelopment agencies. The state's formula gave counties, cities and special 
districts a certain amount and figured on all the rest going to schools. But 
the county also had to give money to redevelopment agencies in some cities, and 
took that out of money that otherwise would have gone to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant that in 1993-94 the state fell $300 million short of the $2.6 
billion it expected to shift to schools statewide, leading legislators to pass 
legislation in July to collect the money that was owed and force the county to 
pay redevelopment agencies out of local government funds, not the school fund, 
Olsen said. He said it was either tell cities and counties to pay up or cut 
state services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tyler McCauley, county assistant auditor-controller, said that what the 
county did was legal under state law and that to address the problem, 
Sacramento legislators are changing the rules. Not only must local governments 
pay the extra money they got over the last two years, but from now on they will 
get less money because their share of property tax revenues will be figured on 
the state's formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double hit," McCauley said. "It's like your salary is being cut and it 
went into effect a year ago." Pay-Back Time 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the amounts of money that Los Angeles County and San Gabriel Valley 
cities owe the state in additional property tax revenues for schools. The 
amounts must be paid over the next two years. Cities that do not have a 
redevelopment agency do not owe any money. 02,26,16 Agency Amount owed** L.A. 
County general fund $85 million County libraries $837,000 County flood control

Each entity will also lose about the same amount as above in property tax 
revenues annually in addition to the repayment.

vehicles owe amounts less than $5,000.

EDUCATORS GREET PERFORMANCE REPORT WITH CAUTION; REACTION: COMPARING SUCH ITEMS 
AS TEST SCORES AND DROPOUT RATES IS INADEQUATE FOR JUDGING OVERALL QUALITY, 
CRITICS SAY. EVEN OFFICIALS AT SAN MARINO, THE TOP-RATED LOCAL SCHOOL, SAY 
OTHER FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT.

<P>
 The recently released California High School Performance Report, which rates 
the combined academic performance of students, has prompted both pride and 
skepticism among local school officials and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino High received the highest scores of the 42 high schools evaluated 
in the San Gabriel Valley, and Arrow High, a small continuation school in 
Glendora, received the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics cite deficiencies in the report, and even proponents say the figures, 
used alone, are not a good indicator of how good a school is. 
</P>
<P>
 "By itself, the report is typically misused," said Pat McCabe, a research 
evaluator for the state Department of Education. She supports the report but 
said it is often misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools with the high scores are praised and the low-scoring schools are 
beat up. Parents need to look at overall state ranking, how well they compare 
against other schools, and are they growing and improving?" McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is also missing information on the percentage of students who go on 
to community colleges and vocational schools, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others condemn the report for its use of data from 1992-93, saying that 
enrollment and test scores change every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are useless and empty figures," said William Bibbiani, senior research 
analyst for the Pasadena Unified School District, where the average performance 
score was a relatively low 40.0 out of 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the rehashing of old numbers by state department statisticians. 
Sure the figures are correct, but the numbers are meaningless," Bibbiani said.  
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Education created the annual performance report 
in 1982 to help show schools their strengths and weaknesses and to show 
comparisons with a group of 100 schools with similar demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was also designed to give the public a glimpse inside local schools 
and can be helpful to parents in deciding where to move. Under a state law set 
to take effect in May, 1995, the report would also be used to assist students 
wanting to change school districts. McCabe said the report data is best used in 
conjunction with a local school report, which provides information such as the 
quality of teachers and special programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school in the state was given a rating based on test scores from the 
Scholastic Assessment Test, Advanced Placement test, American College Test and 
the California Learning Assessment System, a statewide exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Dropout rates, geometry class enrollments and the numbers of college-bound 
students were also factored in. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators whose schools scored highly were pleased but were quick to note 
that the scores are not the only indicators of good education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proud, but we aren't elitist about it. There are a lot of good schools 
who didn't score as high," said Thomas Godley, superintendent of the San Marino 
Unified School District. "We have good students and support from parents, which 
is a major factor in successful schools these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of San Marino district parents join the PTA and help with 
everything from reviewing textbooks to volunteering in the classroom, said 
Christine Rogers, president of the San Marino PTA Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Godley said the high school's small size is another reason for its success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 1,000 students and know every kid by name, so it's very hard for a 
kid to get lost in the big critical mass," Godley said. "They have a real sense 
of belonging, and they are better students because of that."  
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Arrow High, a small continuation school for students who are 
behind on course credits, were not alarmed at receiving the lowest marks in the 
region. "None of us here think the report means anything," Principal Jon McNeil 
said. "When you look at raw data, you need to look at all the data. The 
performance scores are just not an accurate indication of what we do here every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrow High has an enrollment of 103 students, many of whom come from troubled 
families and have disciplinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we are one of the finer alternative schools," McNeil said. "We see a 
lot of kids who were once good students but fell off the edge due to some 
family crisis. Our job is to put them back together again." 
</P>
<P>
 The report itself does a disservice to some cities, critics such as Bibbiani 
say, because it implies that students can't get a good education in urban 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report rewards the affluent suburbs and smites the rest of us," Bibbiani 
said. "Poor kids drop out because they need jobs, which has no bearing on the 
quality of the school." 
</P>
<P>
 According to real estate agents, district performance scores are among the 
factors affecting the price of homes, although most prospective buyers don't 
ask about the scores. 
</P>
<P>

Lorenzini, a real estate agent with Century 21 Val in Arcadia. "But most people 
have never even heard of them."

 Edla Scharre, a real estate agent with Prudential California in San Marino, 
said home buyers there definitely show an interest in schools, but she has not 
had anyone specifically ask to see the performance report for San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people already know San Marino has good schools, but I don't use the 
report as an indicator because I think it unfairly rates some very good 
schools," Scharre said.

<P>
 In evaluating a school, parents should not rely solely on the performance 
report, Bibbiani said, but should investigate the schools on their own.

 "There is a quest for the number, but it's not that simple. You have to visit 
the school, talk to the teachers, talk to the kids and look at the community as 
a whole," he said. School Rankings

 The performance value shows how the school performed during the 1992-93 school 
year, according to the state Department of Education, based on student scores 
on four standardized tests, dropout rates, and the number of students in 
college-prep and geometry classes. The highest possible score is 100. The 
comparison score shows the average performance of a group of 100 schools, 
picked by the state for their similar demographics. 03,32,13,12 Performance

 Ed Murphy saw a disturbing trend among many of his Bell High School students 
facing life in a society increasingly dependent on television and computers for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 They could not tell what was a commercial and what wasn't. The lines between 
the end of a sitcom and the beginning of a news program were blurry. Reality 
became fiction and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, Murphy said, they were video illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talent, intelligence and creativity are all there," said Murphy, 53, who 
teaches video production. "But these abilities aren't being tapped when 
students don't know anything about the technologies that produce what they see 
and hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1970s, Murphy has helped students decipher the endless stream 
of information through his "video literacy" classes. Now, with computers 
becoming more commonplace and interactive video technologies looming, Murphy is 
training his students to face the information overload that comes with 
multimedia technology. 
</P>
<P>
 By incorporating hands-on training in multimedia, Murphy hopes to expand 
awareness of recent systems such as CD-ROM -- something most of his students 
would not normally have access to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the kids that come in here are not literate in either English or 
Spanish since they are recent arrivals," Murphy said. "But now as a society 
we're on the verge of an entirely different kind of literacy -- video literacy 
-- which is what I hope to teach them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show my students how not to be fallible to commercials and their 
accompanying stereotypes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way for a student to learn the fundamentals of where images come from 
and what they mean, Murphy said, is for them to produce their own. 
</P>
<P>
 In Murphy's crowded classes, which average 38 students each, students share 
time at several Macintosh computers available for developing graphics and text 
for their videos. When not at the computers, students hone their skills on an 
editing machine that looks like a cross between a VCR and a television set, 
with a few controls foreign to both. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy if you have enough time to edit everything you shoot," said Jaime 
Mayorquin as he sat at a Macintosh composing an advertising flyer for a 
videotape yearbook that the entire class is producing. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape yearbooks, which sell for $10 each, are one of several hands-on 
projects for Murphy's students. 
</P>
<P>
 Each student is also required to produce a video of his or her own by the end 
of each term. Last year for the first time, Murphy and 28 of his students 
gathered their videotapes together and developed the Bell High School Video 
Portfolios CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 Each compact disc features an interview with a student producer, along with 
comments by Murphy and another video production teacher, Larry Stone. The 
videos represent the range of productions done by Bell students, including 
public service announcements, essays, poems and music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 For Francisco Santos, 19, who produced a video to accompany the song 
"Casimira," a tune by the popular norteno band Banda Machos, this exposure will 
be followed by further opportunities.  
</P>
<P>
 With money saved from his job at a poultry processing plant in Vernon, Santos 
recently purchased his own camcorder and began taping quinceaneras , a 
traditional Latino birthday celebration for 15-year-old girls, for $150 per 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much better than cutting up chickens," Santos said.

<P>
 Long Beach officials have come up with a new tactic in their effort to run 
topless clubs out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, which reluctantly loosened its law regulating adult 
businesses in the wake of recent court decisions, has decided to take a stab at 
amending the U.S. Constitution to exclude topless and nude dancing from the 1st 
Amendment provision allowing free expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a resolution urging the National League of Cities to 
lobby Congress to approve the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to restore sanity to the courts' interpretations of the 1st 
Amendment," said Councilman Douglas S. Drummond, who led the effort. "Walking 
down the street without clothes on is not freedom of expression, it's 
outrageous behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal cast the lone dissenting vote. "When we begin to 
deal with 1st Amendment rights, we open ourselves to potential censorship," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenthal said he recognizes that cities have a problem regulating topless 
bars, "but it should be dealt with at the local level." 
</P>
<P>
 The League of Cities may take up the Long Beach proposal at the group's 
four-day annual conference beginning today in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know the likelihood of it being passed," league spokesman Randy Arndt 
said. "It's up to all the other cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said he is aware that a proposed amendment faces an uphill battle. 
Constitutional amendments first must be proposed by two-thirds majorities in 
the House and Senate, then must be ratified by legislatures in three-fourths of 
the states. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Roger Jon Diamond, who represents about 60 adult businesses 
throughout Southern California, including Angels, the only topless club in Long 
Beach, criticized the council's new effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frightening that elected officials would want to take away one of our 
freedoms," he said. "The next thing you know they'll try to take away our 
guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond said he also plans to lobby for a state law prohibiting topless 
dancing wherever alcoholic beverages are sold. "That would be a lot simpler 
(than amending the Constitution)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the rights of states to deny liquor licenses 
to businesses featuring topless and nude dancing, but California bans alcohol 
only when dancers are completely nude.

 A nonprofit organization that helps low-income residents in Long Beach start 
their own businesses has received a $500,000 federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach-based California American Woman's Economic Development Corp. 
will use the money to provide business training in six disadvantaged areas: 
MacArthur Park, Washington Middle School, Hellman Street, Willmore city/Drake 
Park, Wrigley and North Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The local agency's Neighborhood Entrepreneurial Program trained 17 people in 
the MacArthur Park and Washington Middle School areas last year. Twenty 
residents of the Hellman Street and Willmore city/Drake Park neighborhoods are 
enrolled in this year's class. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will help fund 
training for up to 180 people in the next three years. The Long Beach 
organization must match the federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, residents of targeted areas must be low-income and have a desire 
to become self-sufficient. The applicants with the most viable business plans 
are accepted.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; CITY MAY PROPOSE EASING FLIGHT LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EAMES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A six-year cease-fire has been declared in the lengthy legal battle between 
the city and a group of airlines over flight restrictions at Long Beach 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a proposed settlement, the city can enact an ordinance limiting airlines 
to 41 daily flights, the same allotment set six years ago by a U.S. District 
Court judge. The airlines agreed to continue using the quietest jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Airline business at the airport has dwindled to the point where five airlines 
now offer only 12 daily flights, but city officials said the agreement will 
remove the cloud of litigation and allow the city to try to lure more airlines. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "This clears the way for the city to go out and romance the airlines to come 
back to Long Beach," said Terry Fiskin, a member of the Airport Advisory 
Commission. "But once you divorce somebody, it's hard to get them to fall in 
love with you again." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which the City Council will consider early next year after an 
environmental review is completed, will expire Jan. 1, 2001. "Basically, that's 
when all bets are off," said Airport Manager Chris Kunze. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will be free to change flight and noise limits and the airlines can 
challenge the rules in court again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten airlines sued the city in federal court in 1983 after the city imposed a 
limit of 18 flights a day. Airlines claimed the cap was unreasonable. In 1988, 
a U.S. District Court judge ruled that the limit was unconstitutional and set a 
temporary limit of 41 flights. The city appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, 10 carriers operated at Long Beach Airport, offering the maximum 41 
daily flights. But a year later, airlines began eliminating flights or pulling 
out of the airport altogether as the economy began to slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Donelon, founder of the 1,500-member neighborhood association for 
California Heights, the community located west of the airport, said his 
neighbors are resigned to the compromise agreement. STEVE EAMES

 DIAMOND BAR: A 27-year-old Montclair man was killed Monday night in a 
hit-and-run accident on the Pomona (60) Freeway. Crispin Vazquez was hit at 
6:45 p.m. as he pulled over to the shoulder to investigate mechanical problems 
with his truck, authorities said. Vazquez was under the rear portion of the 
attached trailer when he was struck in the head by a car that did not stop. 
Anyone who witnessed the accident is asked to call (213) 669-4472 or (310)

 MONROVIA: Police shot and wounded a 42-year-old man Saturday after he 
threatened police officers who responded to a call at his house. Douglas 
Rowland was shot in the upper torso and was in stable condition at Arcadia 
Methodist Hospital, police said. Police responded to a domestic dispute call at 
a home in the 200 block of N. Encinitas Avenue at about 6:30 p.m. When officers 
contacted Rowland, who lived at the house, he told them he was armed and that 
he would shoot any officer who came into his house. After a two-hour standoff, 
Rowland walked out of the back door armed with a rifle and confronted officers. 
The officers ordered Rowland to drop his rifle and when he didn't comply, shot 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: A 4-year-old Hollywood boy died Thursday after a 125-pound barbell 
fell on his chest. Jakeita Clayton died at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles

COMMUNITY NEWS: PASADENA; DOO DAH'S FOUNDER SURRENDERS PARADE REINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 17 years, Doo Dah founder and organizer Peter Apanel has decided to step 
down and hand over the alternative parade to The Light-Bringer Project, a 
Pasadena nonprofit arts group. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel announced his decision on Monday at the International Festivals Assn. 
meeting in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Apanel, who has run the parade as a full-time job, could not be reached for 
comment. But in the past, Apanel has said he is tired of the annual wrangling 
over the parade, the complications of putting it together, and the low 
financial rewards. He had anticipated losing about $5,000 on this year's 
parade, which was held Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Apanel worked with a co-sponsor, The Light-Bringer Project, for the 
first time. The group helped recruit more community entries, such as one from 
the King's Village housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 But Light-Bringer plans to retain Doo Dah's irreverent spirit, "making sure it 
stays as fun and silly as it always was," said Patricia Hurley, associate 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Light-Bringer will also consider other locations, she said. This year's parade 
was back as a free event in Old Pasadena, after an unsuccessful attempt in 1993 
to charge admission in front of Pasadena City Hall.

 A high school teacher claims the school's principal intentionally endangered 
his life by not allowing the teacher to seek medical care for his asthmatic 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Romero, a graphic arts and silk-screening instructor at Mark Keppel High 
School, said Principal Rudy Chavez has harassed him for complaining about a 
Feb. 3 incident in which Romero was not allowed to leave the school after 
suffering an asthma attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's claim, filed with the school district Nov. 21, names Chavez and Heber 
Meeks, superintendent of the Alhambra City and High School Districts. Meeks and 
Chavez declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, who has taught at Mark Keppel for 24 years, said in the claim that he 
must use a special breathing machine when his asthma flares up.

 In the neat tract homes and aging motel rooms of the San Gabriel Valley, 
scores of amateur chemists are whipping up batches of methamphet amine at a 
rate that has drug investi gators overwhelmed and puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
 This year in the valley, anti-narcotics forces are seizing methamphetamine 
labs at nearly triple the rate of last year. Nearly three-fourths of the labs 
seized in four counties covered by a regional anti-drug task force have been in 
the valley, which accounts for less than 10% of the region's total population. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more labs seized in the East San Gabriel Valley than any other 
region of the United States right now," said Walter Allen, a special agent 
supervisor with the California Department of Justice's Bureau of Narcotic 
Enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug of biker gangs in the 1960s and '70s, methamphetamine has become the 
most popular high in the San Gabriel Valley. Law enforcement officials say the 
majority of arrests made for possession or for being under the influence of a 
controlled substance are for methamphetamine, which has surpassed cocaine in 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the reasons for this surge are clear: meth, a central nervous 
system stimulant, is similar in price and effect to cocaine but the high can 
last 10 to 12 times longer -- for 24 hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, meth can be "cooked" with chemicals largely found at 
the corner drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminals learn how to make meth in jail, they pass the recipes on," said 
Covina police Det. Vic Lupu. "They don't have to rely on Colombians to get 
drugs."  
</P>
<P>
 In these clandestine laboratories, or "clan labs" as authorities call them, 
manufacturers mix the same volatile chemicals found in car batteries, 
insecticides and paint, until they produce the white crystalline powder that 
sells for $80 to $100 a gram. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually every city in the valley has a lot of problems with clan labs," 
Baldwin Park Police Chief Carmine Lanza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Narcotics investigators can only theorize why the home of the Rose Bowl and 
Raging Waters is also the national hot spot for meth. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's the number of cheap motels that line the valley's freeways that 
give cookers easy ins and quick outs, since many of the arrests are in those 
motels. Perhaps it's because the valley is the geographic link between Los 
Angeles and the Inland Empire, which already has a flourishing meth trade. 
Perhaps someone got started here who helped other people get started and the 
trade grew exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
 Methamphetamine -- also called speed, crank, tweak, ice, lightning, even "the 
devil's drug" -- is most often snorted like cocaine, although it also can be 
smoked, injected or taken in tablet form. 
</P>
<P>
 Injection produces the fastest high; as quick as 14 seconds, said UCLA School 
of Medicine psychopharmacologist Ronald K. Siegel. Tablets, the slowest method, 
take several minutes to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Methamphetamine raises blood pressure and heart rate, and increases electrical 
activity in the brain, producing feelings of euphoria, arousal, stimulation and 
energy. Users can go without sleep and remain active for days with a minimum of 
food because the drug suppresses appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 With continued use, however, the feelings of euphoria can turn into 
nervousness, agitation, anxiety and paranoia. Prolonged use can lead to 
psychosis, accompanied by hallucinations and delusions -- and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, "Whispers: The Voices of Paranoia," Siegel tells the story of a 
young housecleaner who was using small amounts of methamphetamine to get her 
through her workday. One night, as she was watching "The Ten Commandments" with 
her boyfriend and 7-year-old daughter, she became agitated, upset and paranoid. 
Believing evil was near, she killed her daughter, stabbing her six times with a 
serrated knife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the drugs I've researched over the past 25 years," Siegel said, "meth 
is the one that really is the scariest." 
</P>
<P>
 Meth stimulates the limbic system, a part of the brain that controls the human 
impulses for fear, violence and sex, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People become animals acting with just the limbic system," Siegel said. "They 
become survival-oriented. It's the rage that can drive a Hitler, drive a 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Ward, admissions director for Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center in 
Pasadena, said the number of methamphetamine admissions has doubled in the past 
six months. Most of the meth users who come to Impact are white males between 
18 and 25, Ward said, and most are making the drug as well as using it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meth is the drug of choice in the teen-age (and) young adult population," 
said Dr. Drew Pinsky, medical director for the chemical dependency program at 
Los Encinas Hospital in Pasadena. "Speed hit here in a huge, phenomenal way, 
mostly due to price and distribution." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first six months of this year, anti-narcotics forces seized 98 
methamphetamine labs in the San Gabriel Valley -- a rate nearly triple the 
seizures in the valley during all of 1993. These 98 labs represented 72% of all 
the seizures made in the first half of 1994 by the six-member meth-lab task 
force working out of the Los Angeles office of the state Bureau of Narcotic 
Enforcement, which takes in all of Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San 
Luis Obispo counties. Five more investigators joined the task force last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of small labs found in the San Gabriel Valley puts a strain on the 
state task force, which focuses on the major traffickers. Most of the cookers 
in the valley are small-time, making up less than a pound at a time, said Gregg 
McClung, supervisor for the Los Angeles-based task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The labs are cheap to set up, easy to operate, and take just a few laboratory 
beakers, a Bunsen burner and some chemicals that are often easy to obtain. The 
entire "lab" can be packed into a medium-size suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug investigators say one of the biggest problems associated with busting 
meth labs are the cleanups, which are time-consuming, dangerous and costly. A 
small lab, like those typically found in the San Gabriel Valley, costs from 
$2,000 to $5,000 to clean up because of the toxic chemicals involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the California Department of Justice spent $1.3 million on lab 
cleanups, McClung said. Police departments in whose jurisdiction a lab is found 
pay for the cleanups from their own budget, and are later reimbursed from the 
Department of Justice, if there is money left in the department's budget; 
sometimes the funds for cleanup run out six months into the year, leaving 
police departments to fend for themselves. The funds this year ran out in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities, such as West Covina and Covina, have taken to billing motel 
owners where labs are seized for the cleanups, which can take two special 
agents and a chemist eight to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Labs are fire hazards for neighbors and motel customers. In 1993, three 
illegal methamphetamine labs were discovered after explosions; two of those 
injured the alleged drug makers, but no neighbors were hurt. Figures for 1994 
are not available. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is really cause for concern with meth labs is they are often set up in 
motel and hotel rooms and the probability for explosion or fire is very high. 
They could endanger a lot of people," Baldwin Park Police Chief Lanza said. 
</P>
<P>
 And often, the users themselves are dangerous. They haven't slept in days. 
They are paranoid and they are armed. Inevitably, law enforcement officials 
say, where they find meth, they also find heavy ammunition and pornography. 
"Meth users almost always have guns and almost always have pornographic 
material," McClung said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence for manufacture of methamphetamine is three, five or seven years 
in state prison, depending on the cooker's criminal history and the amount of 
the drug involved, and a fine of up to $50,000. "An average sentence for meth 
cookers is three years in state prison, which means they will serve 18 months 
(before qualifying for probation)," West Covina Police Detective Neil Hopkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McClung, Allen and others at the Department of Justice advocate forming a San 
Gabriel Valley task force, comprised of officers from local police agencies. 
The task force would concentrate on stopping the small-time cookers in the 
valley. The formation of the task force will ultimately depend on whether local 
police departments, already strapped for funds, will be able to devote officers 
to the cause.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to have to be a concerted effort by all," McClung said. "It's just 
a matter of time before we have a tragedy out in a motel." Developed by 
Japanese chemists in the early 1900s, methamphetamine was first used as a 
medication in Germany in the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Often used to treat narcolepsy, psychiatric disorders and as a weight-loss 
aid, methamphetamine is sold under the trade names Desoxyn, Methedrine and 
Methampex. It can also be found in small doses in over-the-counter cold 
medications, including Vicks Inhalers. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical meth user is a white male in his 20s and 30s, although some law 
enforcement officials say they have seen users as young as 14 and as old as 50. 
Meth, unlike cocaine, is a blue-collar drug, traditionally used by truck 
drivers, military officers and bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina Police Sgt. Mark Tedesco said most of the meth users he has 
encountered have low self-esteem, come from broken homes and are lower 
middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the 27-year-old ex-skinhead from West Covina who injects $150 worth of 
speed into his veins every day. His body shows it; at 6 foot 2, he weighs only 
155 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The high makes my toenails boil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meth addict, who asked that his name not be published, said his father, a 
trucker who spent much of his time on the road, used to beat him when he 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 A high school dropout at age 17, the youth began using speed when he started 
working construction jobs. The other guys used it to get them through 10-to-16 
hour days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like being sober," he said, fidgeting with his lighter. "Then I feel 
all the pains I got." Drug Lab Seizures

<P>
 Narcotics investigators say methamphetamine laboratories are becoming 
commonplace in nice neighborhoods as well as old motel areas in the valley. 
They say residents should be aware of the following signs of a clandestine 
laboratory: 
</P>
<P>
 * Strong or unusual chemical odors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laboratory equipment (glass tubes, beakers, Bunsen burners, funnels). 
</P>
<P>
 * Fortifications on houses or outbuildings, such as heavily barred windows or 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemical cans or drums in the front or back yard (these containers often 
have the labels marked or painted over). 
</P>
<P>
 * Automobile or foot traffic at all hours of the day or night. 
</P>
<P>
 * People going outside the building only long enough to smoke, especially at 
motels or during bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
 * New high fences with no visible livestock or animals.

 Making methamphetamine is not as hard as making a cake from scratch, said West 
Covina Police detective Neil Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary ingredient in methamphetamine -- ephedrine -- is regulated by the 
Department of Justice in the United States.But ephedrine, a common ingredient 
in cold medications used to relieve nasal congestion and asthma, is unregulated 
in Mexico and smuggled into this country, law enforcement authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other chemicals can be used as well, but drug investigators believe than 90% 
of all methamphetamine produced in California is made through the ephedrine 
method, which takes four to six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to change ephedrine, which is close in molecular structure to 
methamphetamine, from an acid form to a base. 
</P>
<P>
 Some meth makers mix ephedrine, red phosphorus and hydriodic acid; others use 
ephedrine and high-pressure hydrogen gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemicals are mixed and heated for several hours and the impurities are 
extracted. What remains is liquid methamphetamine. The liquid is then converted 
into powdered methamphetamine. Once it is dry, the meth is the color of peanut 
butter. Acetone is used to clean it and make it white. LISA O'NEILL

PEOPLE: CAL POLY GARDEN THERAPY PROJECT NURTURES THE DISABLED 
</P>

 Surrounded by fields of alfalfa, corn and giant pumpkins, Donald Toscano dug 
his hands into a plastic pot containing a scented geranium and focused on its 
tenacious roots. The open field was hot and dust was everywhere, but Toscano 
took pains to make sure the plant was securely transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Toscano, 30, is one of 70 participants in Casa Colina's horticultural therapy 
program for disabled people who work 15 acres just west of Cal Poly Pomona 
every day, rain or shine. Casa Colina is a nonprofit, community governed 
rehabilitation center in Pomona that assists people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The horticulture therapy program is one of the largest of its kind in the 
nation. Participants, who have disabilities such as a spinal cord injury, 
Down's syndrome or a brain injury, earn up to $5 an hour and learn valuable 
gardening skills, said program coordinator Leslie Gaudineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Division manager Paul Alderson said many participants have gone on to jobs 
outside the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Toscano, who has a developmental disability and worked in the program for 
several years, recently finished the program and started a job at Home Depot in 
Pomona as a parking lot attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will miss Paul. He's been so nice to me," Toscano said. "But now I'll have 
money to buy a CD player." 
</P>
<P>
 The group is developing a drought-resistant garden using plants from around 
the world, including Mexican sage, poverty plant and scented geranium. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is also involved in several community projects, including composting 
more than 1,000 tons of green waste from Claremont for use in their garden and 
redesigning the landscape at the University Village, a 22-acre student housing 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "My challenge is to create really meaningful work -- not just busy work -- for 
them," Alderson said. "Working here gives them the sense of being providers, 
not just receivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Alderson, a former social worker, stressed that it is important for 
participants to learn problem-solving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are my heroes," he said. "They know they have challenges that other 
people don't, but they don't have a moment of hesitation when I ask them to do 
something. To me, the real disabled people are people who aren't doing anything 
about the environment."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SPAGHETTI FACTORY IS IN A CLASS BY ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The cool, cavernous building in Duarte known as The Old Spaghetti Factory was 
once a five-room schoolhouse for first- through eleventh-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 The high walls are lined with black-and-white photos of the original 
schoolhouse. But the real treat is the gallery of old student photos. 
Inquisitive faces stare out at you while you slurp up linguine in the place 
where they once learned how to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1909, the Duarte School was the only school serving the Duarte area 
until 1925. From the early 1950s until 1990, when it was closed, it served as 
the administration building for the Duarte Unified School District. The Old 
Spaghetti Factory bought it three years later and converted it into a 
restaurant. The old principal's office is the most requested room, said Joe 
Kalfus, one of the restaurant's general managers. The simple green drapes and 
solid round table create a serious atmosphere that works well for business 
lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Brass headboards were used to create the backs of booths. Near the entrance is 
a glass case containing antiques donated by customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fabricated Pacific Electric Railway car in the middle of the main room, 
which used to serve as the auditorium, feels a bit out of sync with the 
classroom theme, but according to General Manager Steve Medalia, the railway 
cars are a signature item of the Old Spaghetti Factory and can be found in all 
26 restaurants in the nationwide chain. Medalia said most of the restaurants in 
the chain are in historic buildings, from an old packinghouse in Riverside to a 
former cannery in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The lunch crowd consists mostly of people on their breaks, but dinner draws 
families and large lively parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The environment is informal, relaxed and especially good for large groups. 
While reservations are not accepted, the sheer size of the place virtually 
guarantees quick seating. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu offers standard Italian fare from spaghetti and meatballs to lasagna. 
Each dinner is served with soup or salad and fresh bread. There is a full bar, 
wine list and children's menu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Spaghetti Factory, 1431 Buena Vista Ave., Duarte. Open 11:30 a.m. to 2 
p.m. for lunch and 5 to 10 p.m. for dinner Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 
10:30 p.m. Friday, noon to 10:30 p.m. Saturday, and noon to 9:30 p.m. Sunday.

 HAPPY DEMOCRAT: While most Democrats this week are bluer than the skies over 
Washington, there is an exception. CIA chief R. James Woolsey has admitted to 
friends that the Republican takeover of Congress makes his life easier. 
Woolsey, who was appointed by President Clinton, spent the last two years 
fighting Democrats' attempts to cut the intelligence budget. Now he may have to 
contend with the more pleasant prospect of GOP attempts to add money as part of 
their push to strengthen national defense.

 TAMER BLUE YONDER: The Air Force is beating a "strategic withdrawal" from a 
bid by its former chief of staff, Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, to grab turf from the 
Army, Navy and Marine Corps. Only a month after taking over, McPeak's 
successor, Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, has quietly written the congressional 
Commission on Roles and Missions asking that it withdraw McPeak's controversial 
proposal to give the Air Force primary responsibility for maintaining U.S. 
military presence abroad -- replacing the current practice of relying on Navy 
warships. He also has pulled back a much-criticized McPeak plan to eliminate 
the current Army-Navy-Air Force-Marine Corps special operations command, which 
oversees all Green Beret-style operations.

 UNUSUAL GIFT: Given George Bush's presidential record as a strong protector 
and defender of the People's Republic of China, few would expect generosity 
toward him today from the government of Taiwan, which China regards as a 
renegade province. Yet Taiwan is contributing a whopping $1 million to Bush's 
presidential library. Benjamin Lu, Taiwan's official representative to 
Washington, brought the money to the ground-breaking ceremonies, which were 
held Wednesday on the Texas A&M campus in College Station. It's worth recalling 
that during the last year of his presidency, Bush also moved to upgrade U.S. 
ties with Taiwan, including approving the sale of F-16 fighter jets to the 
island. Bush will give the keynote speech next month at a major conference in 
Taiwan.

 ALTMAN SIGHTING: Roger Altman, forced to resign as deputy Treasury secretary 
as a result of his role in the Whitewater affair following last summer's 
congressional hearings, has surfaced in a new role at the White House. Altman 
has been working for the last couple of months in an unpaid, voluntary capacity 
to help arrange next week's Summit of the Americas in Miami. He has been 
working on the summit with the staff of the National Economic Council, run by 
his old friend, council Chairman Robert E. Rubin. Altman plans to return to the 
private sector after the summit.

 SHOW ME, CALL ME? Clinton Administration lawyers managed to anger and 
embarrass Missouri's Democratic attorney general last week when they held a 
press briefing to announce they would argue against the state in a 
desegregation case before the Supreme Court. The state had spent more than $1 
million on the case since 1984. But to make matters worse, U.S. Solicitor 
General Drew S. Days forgot to tell state Atty. Gen. Jay Nixon before briefing 
reporters. "We were served with the news by the Associated Press," said a 
steamed Nixon, the first Democrat to hold the job since 1968.

FEAR, PAIN RETURN FOR 2 VICTIMS OF RAPE; CRIME: AFTER SLOWLY REBUILDING THEIR 
LIVES, THE WOMEN ARE FIGHTING TO CHANGE THE SCHEDULED PAROLE OF THE 'PILLOWCASE 
RAPIST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 17 years ago, a man broke into Rebecca's house in West Los Angeles, 
placed a pillowcase over her head and raped her while her 2-year-old son, who 
had crawled into bed with his mother, whimpered at her side. 
</P>
<P>
 For years after, Rebecca fought recurring nightmares, agoraphobia and 
excessive weight gain. Finally, she forgave the rapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I started to get better," said Rebecca, now 40. After eight years 
she recovered and, in her mind, became better for the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 But two weeks ago the nightmares returned: Rebecca, who now lives in Baldwin 
Hills, heard news reports that her suspected assailant, Reginald Donald Muldrew 
-- dubbed the "Pillowcase Rapist" because he covered his victims' faces with 
pillowcases, blouses or scarves -- was scheduled to be paroled from state 
prison to nearby Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew, 46, was convicted of six sexual assaults and numerous other felonies 
in 1978 and is suspected by police of having committed more than 200 sexual 
assaults and 150 burglaries in Los Angeles from 1975 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 State corrections officials will not confirm Muldrew's destination -- saying 
only that he will be released somewhere in Southern California early this month 
if he passes a psychiatric examination. However, Covina Police Chief John Lentz 
says state officials have told him that Muldrew is scheduled to be paroled to 
Covina on Sunday. After serving 15 years in prison, Muldrew is eligible for 
release under the state's determinate sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Lentz and other city officials have fought to keep Muldrew out of the 
community, organizing a protest rally and gathering more than 20,000 
signatures.  
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of this very public event, two of Muldrew's suspected victims 
have decided to share their most private pain. Rebecca and Carol -- pseudonyms 
provided by The Times, which does not publish the names of rape victims -- are 
adding their voices to the chorus demanding that Muldrew's parole be blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man destroyed me within forever," said Carol, who was raped in Southwest 
Los Angeles and now lives in the central city. "He has no rights to be free to 
harm anyone ever again." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca said she became pregnant by her assailant and had an abortion. Carol 
carries not only emotional but physical scars, including a cut on her left 
cheek that required 21 stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina police said Rebecca's name is on a Los Angeles Police Department list 
of cases in which Muldrew was suspected but never prosecuted. They said that 
Carol's name is not on the list, but that her story sounds credible and they 
are investigating court records to corroborate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Richie, executive director of Project Sister, a sexual assault crisis 
intervention agency in Pomona, said victims of rape and other crimes are more 
likely these days to speak out about their experiences.  
</P>
<P>
 "Women coming forward like this is a reminder," said Leah Aldridge, 
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. "These 
crimes do not have faceless, nameless victims. For many women, speaking out 
about something like this . . . can do a lot to increase their healing process 
and reduce the level of helplessness." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca's husband was not home when the young mother went to bed about 12:30 
a.m. on Jan. 7, 1978. "I woke up because something jolted me awake," she said. 
"I looked in the doorway and saw a dark figure kneeling and pointing a gun." 
The man told her not to move or he would shoot her. 
</P>
<P>
 He lurched forward, put something over her head and raped her. When he was 
done, he went through drawers and closets and, before leaving, told her to 
count to 100 before she moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca cooperated and went into the living room, where her husband, who had 
returned home during the attack, was asleep in a chair. "He didn't believe me," 
Rebecca said of her husband, from whom she is now separated. "He couldn't 
accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband broke into tears when Rebecca told him that she was pregnant by 
her assailant and that she had chosen to have an abortion. "I guess because he 
didn't protect me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not go out of her house for three years, suffered panic 
attacks and gained 90 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shutting down and not talking to people; they didn't understand," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca, who describes herself as a devout Catholic, said she would now like 
to talk to her rapist and ask him what happened in his childhood to make him 
commit such acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be interesting to know if he feels he will do it again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol woke to the sound of a ringing telephone Dec. 7, 1975, and found a man 
standing at the edge of her bed. He grabbed the 21-year-old post office worker, 
who fought for her life. He took a razor and slashed her left cheek, leaving a 
permanent scar. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapist dragged Carol from her bedroom, put a pillowcase over her head and 
tied her hands and feet. He beat, kicked, punched and raped her. She was 
sodomized and forced to perform oral sex. In between the sex acts, the rapist 
put cigarettes out on her back. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol's 3-year-old twin daughters were in the room while their mother was 
being raped. One of the girls slept through the incident. The rapist fed her 
sister cereal in the kitchen while he ate Carol's food and drank her liquor, 
Carol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since hearing of the release of the man she believes raped her, Carol said, 
she has gone back into therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've forgiven him because I think he's a very sick person," she said. "That 
doesn't mean he should be free. He has damaged me for life. . . . I don't think 
he should die; that's the easy way out. I think he should sit in that little 
cell every day thinking about what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a fear of going into the house alone," she wrote in a letter to the 
Department of Corrections asking that Muldrew's parole be blocked. "I have a 
fear of being in a house alone. Don't make my life and the other lives he has 
destroyed any worse. Leave this man locked up forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a cold, ruthless animal that needs to be caged and guarded like those 
dangerous animals in the zoo. His freedom should only be a thought in his mind, 
because in my mind he has imprisoned me for life."

LIFE AT A SLOW CLIP; 50 YEARS AFTER BARBER STARTED CUTTING HAIR IN A CHINATOWN 
SHOP, BUSINESS IS WINDING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK B. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly 50 years, Tapia Remigio has sat or snipped hair in the worn 
barber's chair closest to the front window of his dimly lit shop on Hill Street 
in Chinatown. It is the only chair he will use. 
</P>
<P>
 Back when Chinatown was booming and a haircut cost $2 ($4 with a shampoo), 
there were three other barbers at the New China Town Barber Shop and they cut 
hair from dawn to dusk seven days a week. All that remains now is the shop's 
heart and soul, Remigio. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy, as his friends call him, spends most days sitting in the old chair 
flipping through the newspaper or watching television. On a good day, two or 
three customers come in search of a trim. Most of his regulars are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old customers have died," he said. "But their kids keep coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 He figures he was born somewhere around 1920 in East Los Angeles after his 
parents left Mexico. Reared by his grandparents, he played with the other 
children in his Boyle Heights neighborhood, most of whom were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned to speak Jewish (Yiddish) by hanging out with them," he said, 
twirling his round brown glasses.  
</P>
<P>
 The lessons helped when he was drafted into the Army for World War II. "When I 
went to Europe, the Jews there were surprised that I could communicate with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1930s before he became a barber, Remy hung with the pachucos, the 
hip young Latino men who sported zoot suits and hung out at Hollenbeck Park. 
Often, government officials would come to the park and offer the out-of-work 
men a chance to travel to the mountains and work for the federal Civilian 
Conservation Corps, putting out fires and earning a little cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "They basically gave us enough money to buy cigarettes," he said. "The rest of 
the money we sent back home to our families." 
</P>
<P>
 His shop is a museum, with one of those clanky cash registers with dollar 
amounts written on the keys. It still springs open. The same dusty clock that 
was there when he walked in and asked former owner Gene Cosca for a job in 1945 
still ticks on the wall in the back of the shop. Even his vintage 
black-and-white RCA Victor TV works if he struggles with it a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy remembers Prohibition, when the only place to get alcohol was from 
illegal suppliers. If the police were conducting a bust, the alcohol smugglers 
would break the containers and send wine pouring through the streets, leaving 
the streets smelling sweet but sticky. 
</P>
<P>
 His two children live in Pomona and visit frequently to check up on him or 
give updates on his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no desire to retire. He enjoys his independence and his comfortable 
apartment in an Eastside senior citizens complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work here so that I won't have to stay home and do nothing," he said with a 
smile, showing his original set of pearly whites. "Too many old people just sit 
home, they die that way." 
</P>
<P>
 His one pet peeve nowadays is when ornery children hop into the barber's 
chair. "I really don't like to cut little kids' hair. They get too excited and 
since I am older now, I get a little nervous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gangly man, whose only major health ailment was a hernia during the war, 
is up each day by 7 and commutes to work in his "baby," a clean gray 1977 
Oldsmobile. He lives the straight and narrow with one exception: "I'm supposed 
to wear my glasses when I drive, but I never do." 
</P>
<P>
 He is optimistic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "In two years people say that Chinatown will be revitalized again. I hope I 
will be here."

EDELMAN BACKS HIS CHIEF AIDE FOR COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retiring County Supervisor Ed Edelman on Wednesday "strongly recommended" that 
his chief deputy be appointed to the Los Angeles City Council seat to be left 
vacant next week when Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky becomes a county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman suggested that the 5th District seat -- representing the Westside and 
much of Sherman Oaks, Studio City and North Hollywood -- be filled temporarily 
by Bob Geoghegan. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoghegan, who has been an Edelman aide for 21 years, said he had no interest 
in retaining the office beyond April, when an election will be held for the 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to step in and make sure the Valley has a voting voice to protect 
its interests," Geoghegan said.  
</P>
<P>
 Since Yaroslavsky was elected to the board in June, there has been 
disagreement on whether his council post would be watched over by a non-voting 
legislative analyst -- favored by the City Council president -- or by a 
full-fledged voting representative appointed by the council, an idea backed by 
many in the 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
 The city charter states that at least eight members of the council must vote 
in favor of extending voting rights to such interim council members. Also, they 
must live in the district they represent. Geoghegan, who lives in Culver City, 
said he would move to the district if he is selected. 
</P>
<P>
 A voting member is considered especially important by residents of 
earthquake-ravaged areas of Sherman Oaks and Studio City, who want to ensure 
their neighborhoods are not overlooked when relief aid is dispensed by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, prior to this week, no one had stepped forward to volunteer for the 
lame duck post, though several people, including Yaroslavsky's wife, Barbara, 
have announced their intention to run for the seat in the April election. If 
necessary, a runoff election would be held in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, the influential Edelman, who is retiring from the board Friday, 
said Geoghegan would be the best interim representative for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is incredibly gifted and knows the Fifth Council District, having worked 
in it for many years," Edelman said in a news release. "He would be 
non-partisan in his approach and could immediately help ensure that the 
District is properly represented for the next seven months. I recommend him 
without any hesitation whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the announcement, Edelman had consulted both Yaroslavsky and 
Councilwoman Laura Chick "and got a good reaction," Geoghegan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Yaroslavsky nor Chick was available for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoghegan, 50, has been an aide to Edelman since 1973, when the supervisor was 
a city councilman representing the 5th District. He has been Edelman's chief 
deputy for the past 14 years.

CONCRETE ASSISTANCE; LAPD: MERCHANTS HOPE NEW POLICE FOOT PATROLS WILL SPRUCE 
UP IMAGE OF DOWNTOWN RESEDA'S BUSINESS DISTRICT AND ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS TO SHOP 
THERE AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downtown Reseda -- home to discount prices, plentiful parking and a vibrant 
ethnic marketplace -- has a new attraction: cops walking beats, as they did 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-November, Los Angeles police officers have been patrolling the 
business district on foot in an effort to polish the neighborhood's image 
during the busy holiday shopping season and perhaps beyond it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foot patrols are more than simply an increased police presence. 
They're just one step in what local business leaders hope will be a 
multi-pronged effort to revive the Reseda business district, an effort begun 
several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The foot beat -- similar to those established from time to time in other 
neighborhoods -- runs along Reseda Boulevard between Saticoy and Vanowen 
streets and on Sherman Way between Crebs and Lindley avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders, local merchants and police share the belief that the 
reassuring appearance of officers walking a beat is the first step toward 
changing what they describe as a distorted public perception that the area is 
plagued by crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to clean up the business district so that people will shop in 
Reseda again," said LAPD Officer Stephanie Tisdale, who patrols Reseda as a 
senior lead officer. "People are driving by and not stopping because it looks 
like a scary place to shop." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, Tisdale said, the neighborhood has only an average crime rate and 
fewer crimes are reported in downtown Reseda than the Ventura Boulevard area in 
the West Valley, which is popular with shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's tainted image appears to stem from its dowdy appearance. Damaged by 
the Northridge temblor, cluttered by trash and tacky signs and criticized for 
its desolate sidewalks and boarded-up buildings, it is a community that in 
recent years has acquired an off-putting face. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that may be changing as in the effort to revive the local shopping 
area. Merchants formed an association in September and have already organized 
plans to place 20 garbage cans outside of businesses and hang more than 200 
colorful banners advertising local shops, said Margaret Howard, secretary of 
the Reseda Merchants Assn., which boasts a membership of about 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly the biggest development: a police substation. 
</P>
<P>
 The substation, scheduled to open as soon as the department can find a 
location for it, will house a community relations officer, the West Valley 
Division's Jeopardy program for youths at risk for becoming gang members and 
the newly formed Gray Squad, tailored to meet the needs of the elderly, Sgt. 
Walt Kainz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Valley Division's PALS club, a civilian booster organization, has 
offered to cover $2,500 a month rent for three years, Tisdale and Kainz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, trying to spruce up Reseda's image with the foot patrols has 
produced its own obstacles for police in a community where 27 ethnic groups 
speak a mind-boggling 67 dialects, ranging from Spanish to Farsi, according to 
census figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden appearance of police officers walking the streets, for example, 
apparently surprised some merchants, many of whom come from countries where the 
cop on the beat routinely gets a payoff, Tisdale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt they may not be trusting us," Tisdale said. "Our first goal was to 
get the businesses involved and to get them to understand that the Police 
Department really wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
 But it became apparent Wednesday that Tisdale and her partner, Officer Mark 
Pryor, had won over many business owners who greeted them as they stopped by 
their shops while walking their beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of reminds me of the old days," said Dennis Black, owner of Linda 
Rae's, a secondhand store on Reseda Boulevard. "Their appearance, especially 
around the holidays, is always nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard even hung a sign on the front door of her family business, Reseda 
Rubber Stamp, that reads: "Thank You West Valley LAPD for Footbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've walked foot beats in Watts and the southwest area before, but I've never 
had a response like this, where they actually come out of their shops to say 
hello," Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
 If local merchants feel safer they may be more inclined to open their front 
doors, which often remain closed. Many of the shops are now oriented toward the 
rear parking lots, Pryor said. The string of locked front doors, creating what 
appears to be a shopper's ghost town, is one factor that gives the neighborhood 
a grim aspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the foot beat are also hoping to foster an improved sense of 
security among residents so that they will choose to shop in Reseda, as throngs 
did decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to bring back the quality of the community feeling it had 40 years 
ago," said Nancy McMillan, president of the merchants association. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the recent improvements evolved from a two-day workshop that Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick held in June to help turn around failing 
commercial areas in her west San Fernando Valley district. Architects, urban 
planners, landscapers and finance experts joined residents and merchants in 
devising simple ways to improve their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's little things," said Rayna Gabin, a field deputy for Chick. "But it's 
all these little things that will make it better." 
</P>
<P>
 Much remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisdale openly expressed her frustration Tuesday night at a business watch 
meeting attended by only about two dozen merchants, although she and Pryor had 
distributed more than 250 flyers advertising the meeting. Several merchants 
suggested that the low turnout could be partially explained by the fact that 
many immigrant business owners do not understand English -- a theory Tisdale 
doubted. The shop owners seem to understand her when she drops by their stores, 
and many native English-speaking merchants also failed to appear at the 
meeting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the foot patrol will continue into the next year remains to be seen 
and could depend on getting all the merchants involved in the business watch 
and the newly formed merchants' association, Tisdale said. For now, the program 
is scheduled to remain in place at least through the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting Tuesday, Tisdale said she plans to ask her supervisor, LAPD 
Capt. Val Paniccia, to extend the foot patrol for an additional four months, 
beginning in January, but possibly with reduced hours. It currently costs 
$15,000 a month in overtime to staff the foot beat with two officers from 10 
a.m. to 7 p.m., six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long way to go," Tisdale said. But if police can succeed in 
organizing Neighborhood Watch and other community-based programs in residential 
neighborhoods, "why can't we do it with the businesses?"

WAR DIARY RETURNED TO FAMILY IN JAPAN; JOURNAL: WOODLAND HILLS MAN PRESENTS THE 
50-YEAR-OLD MEMENTO TO RELATIVES OF ITS AUTHOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a brief ceremony Wednesday in an isolated town in northern Japan, a San 
Fernando Valley man returned a 50-year-old diary, which his uncle treasured as 
a war souvenir, to the family of the Japanese sailor who wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Elsbernd, 38, a Woodland Hills manufacturing engineer for a 
Japanese-owned company, presented the diary to Hiroshi Nemoto, a 70-year-old 
nephew of Kazumi Nemoto, who died in the Philippines during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1945, the leather-bound volume had been tucked away by Elsbernd's uncle, 
Albert Elsbernd of Cincinnati, until the elder Elsbernd decided that it should 
be returned to its rightful owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an emotional day," Mark Elsbernd said, following a three-hour meeting 
that included a tour of the village of Samekawa, about 200 miles north of 
Tokyo, and of the village's war memorial to its dead sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe the warm feelings I got from the family. And I thought to 
myself 'It's over. The diary is finally back in the place it belongs.' This 
world really is a pretty small place." 
</P>
<P>
 The diary was found in a desk in a shellfire-pocked building in the 
Philippines in 1945 and brought back by a U.S. soldier who gave it as a war 
memento to his girlfriend's little brother -- Albert Elsbernd, then 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 64 and retired from the Cincinnati Police Department, Albert Elsbernd 
recently decided that the diary, which he never managed to translate, should be 
returned to the author or his family. For help he contacted his nephew Mark, an 
engineer for Dataproducts Corp., owned by the Hitachi corporation of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Elsbernd contacted company executives in Japan, who took a special 
interest in the project and launched a search for members of Nemoto's family 
who could claim the diary. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazumi Nemoto, a Japanese naval aircraft technician who would have been 70 
this year, kept the diary for several months in 1945 -- logging not only 
personal data, but precise accounts of military movements and various aircraft 
records. The diary also included passages describing a malarial outbreak that 
killed many Japanese troops -- perhaps killing Nemoto as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Its final entry was not long before Nemoto's death on April 24, 1945, at the 
age of 21, according to Japanese military records. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for Nemoto's family was taken up by a high-ranking Hitachi 
executive, Hiroshi Gonmori, now 70 -- who as luck would have it also served in 
naval aviation in the Philippines. Gonmori initiated a search of military 
records and contacted the Japanese press. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemoto's nephew Hiroshi saw a Nov. 10 story in a Japanese newspaper and called 
the paper to identify himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemoto, the youngest of seven children, is a municipal official in Samekawa 
who had long given up hope of collecting any more mementos of his dead uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Elsbernd agreed to return the diary on his next business trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsbernd said he could feel his heart beating Wednesday when he finally came 
face-to-face with Nemoto. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bowed to me, and I bowed back," he said. "Then we shook hands. I smiled. 
He smiled. Then I gave him the book. I told him. 'Sir, this diary belongs with 
you, not us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nemoto then offered a tour of the village, including the burial ground that 
includes a monument to the Japanese soldiers from Samekawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the day was over," Elsbernd recalled, "I felt like I knew the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Katsuhide Kato, a Hitachi executive present at the ceremony: "This day 
is part of the history of World War II. A final chapter. Many people died in 
that war. But this was a happy day."

PLANTING SEEDS OF PATRIOTISM; ENVIRONMENT: ORGANIZATION FOUNDED BY A SIMI 
VALLEY WOMAN HAS GROWN THOUSANDS OF TREES IN HONOR OF THE U.S. MILITARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nearly four years ago, as the United States entered the Persian Gulf War, Mary 
C. McCurdy prayed that her Army Reserve son would not be called for service. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she wanted to show her immense gratitude for those who did go into 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought, 'My goodness, look at all these people who are going off to 
fight for our country,' " she said. "I wanted to do something that would be a 
lasting tribute." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a small group of friends in Simi Valley, McCurdy launched the 
Freedom Tree Organization, an ambitious project dedicated to planting half a 
million trees around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off in my mind thinking 50,000 trees," she recalled. "But somehow 
when it came out of my mouth it grew to 500,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Though McCurdy's son was never called for service in the Gulf, Freedom Tree 
has remained committed to planting. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of government grants, private donations and proceeds from the 
sale of Seeds for Freedom packets, the group has planted about 26,000 trees in 
schoolyards, parks and walkways in six states and as many countries. 
</P>
<P>
 At that rate, the group won't reach its goal for another 72 years. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, says McCurdy, 52, a native of Colombia who moved to California in 
the 1960s. The point is to keep planting trees and increasing awareness of the 
battles fought by U. S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach that end, the group has established a number of programs under the 
Freedom Tree umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 These include Freedom Tree Groves, Avenues of Freedom and Seeds for Freedom. 
Each packet, sold for a dollar, holds at least five seeds. Plaques honoring the 
military are often placed in the groves of trees the group plants. The group 
also hopes eventually to open a Freedom Tree park and museum in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want is to have a place where people can come and learn about the 
history of their country, about the battles and those who fought them," McCurdy 
said. "This is one of our biggest goals." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy's Oxnard home, in a harbor-front gated community, is a shrine to 
Freedom Tree. In the front doorway stands a large Freedom Tree flag, modeled 
after an American flag with four cookie cutter trees stitched over a white 
stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy works as a business development consultant for a cable company, but 
her home reflects her extensive volunteer work for Freedom Tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are covered with plaques and certificates from Freedom Tree fans, 
among them the Los Angeles Police Department, the Army Reserve and former 
President Ronald Reagan. "I have a thousand more," McCurdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even McCurdy's brown BMW does not escape mention of the military. "The few, 
the proud, the Marines" boasts a baseball cap perched in her rear window. And 
packets of Freedom Tree seeds litter the front seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," she said, scooping up a handful of seed packets. "Take some and plant 
them. Spread the dream and carry it forward." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurdy first pitched her tree-planting plan to the Rancho Simi Recreation and 
Parks District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was standing up there at the meeting, telling them about all the beautiful 
trees they could have, and just like that they said, 'Yes, go ahead and do it, 
we will help you,' " McCurdy said. "I was so surprised I almost fainted right 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Hunt, assistant park planner, said the district welcomed McCurdy's 
proposal, but was skeptical about its scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we were supportive of a project of that type," Hunt said. "We 
thought it was a pretty big undertaking, so we suggested that we start on a 
small scale, then move beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 The park district helped win federal grants of nearly $150,000. The funds were 
used to plant about 2,000 trees throughout the city's parks and along the 
Arroyo Simi. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the group won a $100,000 federal grant to provide urban forestry 
training for 39 Los Angeles residents affected by the riots that year. Those 
residents then helped plant 3,000 trees around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom Tree has also received grants to plant trees in 22 U. S. cities and in 
Guam, Hong Kong, Kenya, Uganda and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom Tree has worked closely with the California Department of Forestry and 
Fire Protection to secure loans and plant trees. Chief of staff Don Banghart 
praised the group for its message. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of other groups out there planting trees, but Freedom Tree is 
a unique group because of their goal of honoring the military," Banghart said. 
"They have a vision that really seems to inspire people." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley alone, the group has planted thousands of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 At Atherwood Elementary School, students have planted oak, mulberry and 
sycamore trees at the school with the help of the organization. "It is 
educational and ecologically sound," Principal Beverly Radloff said. "It's such 
a nice idea." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Schwalbenberg, general manager for the Clarion Hotel in Simi Valley, 
manages the group's finances. The annual budget of the volunteer-driven 
organization varies, depending on the number and scope of projects in the 
works, Schwalbenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could be dealing with $50,000 or several hundred thousand dollars in any 
given year based on the programs we're involved with," he said. "The bottom 
line is that the group is planting trees and doing something for the military." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent windy afternoon, McCurdy visited a stand of trees her group 
planted near the 18th hole of the Sea Bee Golf Course at the U. S. Naval 
Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Steve G. Kramer, who helped plant the trees, accompanied McCurdy, righting 
several eucalyptus saplings that had doubled over in the strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked trees that were drought resistant and would do well in salty soil," 
Kramer said. "It's a great feeling to know these trees that are so small now 
are going to grow and be here for a long, long time."

IMPROVED GASOLINE BLEND ARRIVES IN COUNTY TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tanker trucks begin delivering a new blend of gasoline to service stations 
across Ventura County today, trying an altered formula designed to cut 15% of 
pollution emitted from cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The reformulated gasoline, expected to raise gas prices 5 to 10 cents per 
gallon, will be required at all gas stations in the county and other places 
around the nation that violate federal health standards for air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the federal Clean Air Act does not require the sale of the new blend 
until Jan. 1, oil companies will infuse storage tanks with the cleaner-burning 
fuel this month so they can flush out the old gas by the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the price increase should hit the pump, said Tim Hamilton of the 
Automotive Trade Organizations of California, which represents service station 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "My prediction is that we are going to see prices ease up a nickel to a dime 
in January," Hamilton said. But he warned that the price per gallon could jump 
as high as 25 cents if oil refineries fail to produce enough of the new 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The new formula will replace all grades of gasoline regardless of octane. 
</P>
<P>
 The improved fuel was applauded Wednesday by environmentalists and county air 
quality officials as an important step toward reducing pollution from cars -- 
the largest contributor to the county's serious smog problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute the reformulated gas hits the market, there will be an immediate 
improvement in the performance of cars," said Veronica Kun, a senior scientist 
with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It is a very worthwhile and 
cost-effective solution over the next couple of decades, as long as we have 
internal combustion engines that rely on gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
 The new formula mandated by the Clean Air Act was developed during a six-year, 
$40-million research program undertaken by a consortium of 14 oil companies and 
America's Big Three auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, much of the effort to reduce automobile pollution has 
concentrated on improving cars. But this time, auto and oil companies tinkered 
with gasoline formulas to reduce the emission of compounds that react with 
other chemicals in sunlight to form ozone, the major component of smog. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a simple concept," said J. Wayne Miller, a leading chemical engineer 
with Unocal Corp. who worked with the consortium on the new formula. But he 
said it was not so simple to derive the new formula or figure out the 
least-costly way to manufacture it. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said it will cost the industry an average of 5 cents a gallon to make 
the new formula. Market conditions, he said, will determine if that is passed 
on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is scheduled to tour Ventura County today to talk about reformulated 
gasoline that reduces 15% of air toxics, such as benzene, and 15% of 
smog-forming hydrocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reformulated gasoline is part of a series of steps to making air 
healthier to breathe," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in March, 1996, the California Air Resources Board will require oil 
companies to sell an even cleaner-burning blend of gasoline throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federally mandated reformulated gasoline emerging this month will only 
be required for sale in Ventura County, the greater Los Angeles area, San 
Diego, and other areas around the country with severe smog problems: Hartford, 
New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Houston and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of other metropolitan areas have decided to join the program, so the 
reformulated gas will account for nearly 35% of all domestic gasoline 
consumption, according to Unocal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's highest smog levels usually occur in the inland valleys, such 
as Ojai Valley and Simi Valley, where breezes off the ocean trap air pollutants 
against surrounding mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 William Mount, Ventura County's deputy air pollution control officer, said he 
views reformulated gas as a cost-effective way to further reduce air pollution 
and help the county meet federal clean-air standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've squeezed about everything we can out of our industrial section," Mount 
said. The new fuel, he said, "is not going to make a major impact, but it is 
part of the overall solution."

JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS HOSPITAL SUIT; COURTS: COMMUNITY MEMORIAL CONTENDS 
COUNTY FACILITY HAS WRONGLY SIPHONED OFF PATIENTS FROM PRIVATE SECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN STEVENS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge refused Wednesday to dismiss a Community Memorial 
Hospital lawsuit that claims the nearby county hospital is illegally wooing 
private patients -- and he indicated that he would allow the case to go to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Frederick A. Jones said he would review Assistant County Counsel Noel 
Klebaum's argument that statutes governing unfair business practices and 
competition do not apply to counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones said he felt that Community Memorial had grounds to sue because 
Ventura County Medical Center has been acting as a "quasi-corporation" by 
trying to attract paying patients. He also criticized the county for trying to 
get around key issues raised by the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't see the county squarely facing the complaint as brought," 
Jones said before taking the case under submission. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys expect a ruling in a few days. If the case is allowed to proceed, 
the county will have 30 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial Hospital sued the county in July. The private hospital in 
Ventura contends that the county has overstepped its mandate as medical safety 
net for the poor by siphoning off paying patients from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial, located just two blocks from the county medical center, 
claims the county violated state and federal laws in setting up a network of 
clinics and forging contracts with local doctors to refer patients to the 
medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Klebaum argued Wednesday that the private hospital's bid to limit the 
county to treating poor and indigent patients cuts across the county's right 
"to treat any class of patient." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that limiting California counties to treating only the poor would 
deprive patients of freedom of choice and force public hospitals to check 
whether patients have private health insurance and whether they sought 
treatment elsewhere before admitting them. 
</P>
<P>
 John McDermott, an attorney representing Community Memorial, agreed that 
counties should be able to accept paying patients under certain circumstances 
such as emergencies or when private facilities cannot meet a specific medical 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said poor patients should be the county's first priority, and that 
county hospital efforts to recruit paying patients -- especially pregnant women 
who bring generous Medi-Cal reimbursements -- could ultimately take beds away 
from the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "By taking beds out of service that otherwise would be available for 
indigents, they're reducing the flow of indigent patients they have to take," 
McDermott said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the poor are already suffering under a year-old county policy that 
encourages county employees to be treated at county facilities, while the poor 
"sit and wait." 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is the single largest employer in Ventura County. This is an 
important patient base," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from displacing poor patients, the policy has hurt private physicians, 
McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overnight, practices disappeared," he said.

CONSULTANT CITES USES FOR SURPLUS NAVY LAND; PORT HUENEME: THE CITY AND OXNARD 
HARBOR DISTRICT ARE URGED TO JOINTLY OBTAIN AND DEVELOP THE 33-ACRE OCEANFRONT 
SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A restaurant, a fishery and a marine education center would enhance an 
oceanfront strip of surplus Navy land and boost Port Hueneme's economy, a 
consulting firm says. 
</P>
<P>
 Roma Design Group, an architectural and planning firm, has suggested that Port 
Hueneme and the Oxnard Harbor District join forces to obtain the 33-acre parcel 
the Navy is disposing of and develop it into a money-making entity. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco-based firm also recommended that officials consider allowing 
a homeless group to build a shelter at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting Tuesday night, a 25-member task force that included 
representatives from the city, the harbor and the Navy met to discuss what 
guidelines they should use in selecting the potential users for the property, 
which will be available for development in April, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the criteria include how much revenue the tenants would generate and 
whether the businesses would be compatible with a coastal environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no final plans have been made, city and harbor officials want to 
create a redevelopment agency to acquire the surplus Navy property. If they are 
successful, they would lease it to tenants and split the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to say that this is a god-sent gift to the city," said Tom 
Figg, Port Hueneme's director of community development. "But we are excited 
about its challenges and possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to acquire the land began in June, 1993, when the Navy decided to move 
its Naval Civil Engineering Lab at the property to the Naval Construction 
Battalion Center in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, city officials and nonprofit organizations, including a homeless 
coalition and education agencies, have been fighting to get a piece of the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, it appeared that the coalition of nonprofit groups to aid the 
homeless had them all beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 gave homeless 
organizations priority on all surplus federal property if no federal agencies 
wanted the land. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, no federal agency stepped up to claim the Navy property. 
</P>
<P>
 But under an amendment to the McKinney Act signed in October by President 
Clinton, military bases will be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the homeless coalition will have to compete for the property. And instead 
of going directly to federal officials, it will have to deal with a local 
committee overseeing use of the surplus Navy land. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the U.S. Department of Defense still has the final say over who gets 
the land, tenants have to meet the needs of the community -- in this case, the 
city and the harbor district. 
</P>
<P>
 After raising more than $200,000 in federal and state grants, the city and the 
harbor hired the consulting firm to evaluate the site and come up with 
recommendations for possible users. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's meeting, Bonnie Fisher, a representative from Roma Design 
Group, advised the task force against allowing a prison to be built on the site 
and against putting a permanent Cal State University off-campus center there. 
</P>
<P>
 A prison would make little use of the site's coastal advantages, Fisher said, 
and a campus would use one-third to one-half of the property for parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher also advised against residential housing in the area because the site 
is situated at the entrance of the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the recommendations by Fisher include water-oriented uses such as a 
fish farm, an abalone farm and commercial and sports fishing businesses. She 
also suggested that a restaurant would provide public access to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The site needs a broad range of users, which would bring a combination of 
different activities and which would generate revenues to the area," Fisher 
told the group. "The site has a wide range of possibilities, and they all 
should be considered carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has until April to submit a list of selected users to the Department 
of Defense.

CITIZENS GROUP FEARS IMPACT OF CHAIN STORE; OJAI: ENVIRONMENTALISTS WILL TELL 
COUNTY THAT A CONSULTANT INCORRECTLY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF A PROPOSED PAY 
LESS DRUG OUTLET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 25 years, Nancy Kruschke has greeted customers by name at the Ojai Village 
Pharmacy, a vine-covered shop that is one of five independent drugstores in the 
Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of history in this store," she said, looking around the office 
that was a kitchen when the drugstore served hot lunches. "We have people still 
shopping here that grew up in town, married, had their own children and now 
have grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, Kruschke is uncertain of the Village Pharmacy's future. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Pay Less Drug Stores, a discount chain with 545 outlets in 11 
Western states, wants to open a store just 3 1/2 miles down the valley's main 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be tough. It's going to be real tough," Kruschke said of the 
competition that Pay Less will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the picturesque valley see Pay Less as part of a broader issue: They 
argue that discount stores overwhelm small merchants, creating a homogeneous 
landscape and blotting out a community's character. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the environmental group Citizens to Preserve the Ojai has filed 
an appeal against Pay Less' proposal to open an 8,000-square-foot store in Mira 
Monte, just south of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal -- which challenges a traffic study performed by a Santa Barbara 
consulting firm -- is scheduled to be heard by the Ventura County Planning 
Commission today. The commission's meeting begins at 8:30 a.m. in the county 
government center at 800 S. Victoria Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's meeting will mark the first time Pay Less' plans for Mira Monte have 
been aired in a public forum. Because the 8,000-square-foot building sits in an 
unincorporated area, no public hearing was needed, and county planners signed 
off on the routine permit in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal by Citizens to Preserve the Ojai centers on a traffic study showing 
that Pay Less would attract 308 fewer car trips per day than the Valley Market, 
which used to inhabit the store, and add 23 fewer car trips to California 33 at 
rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a poor study," said Stan Greene, president of the environmental group. 
 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to traffic considerations, Greene said, county officials "need to 
look at any large enterprise in terms of its impact on the general welfare of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Moore, an Ojai resident who represents Pay Less locally, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone in the Ojai Valley believes that Pay Less, or other chain 
stores, will destroy the area's character. Imposing further restrictions on 
commercial development, they say, impinges on free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Marva Hollebrands, owner of the Blazing Shears beauty shop in Mira Monte, 
thinks the threat to small merchants in downtown Ojai has been overblown.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're more upset about the Ojai people who can't keep their noses out of our 
business," she said. "They need real issues to worry about. This is not a real 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over Pay Less began in July, when the company announced a 
tentative agreement to buy Ojai's only bowling alley. But that plan was dropped 
after residents and merchants packed a city Planning Commission meeting in 
August to voice their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time the city gave a chilly reception to a national 
chain. In 1979, the City Council passed an emergency zoning ordinance that 
blocked plans for a Wendy's fast-food restaurant on Ojai Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wencal Management Inc., which owns Wendy's, sued the city for violation of 
property rights and won a $15,000 settlement.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Pay Less have formed a group called Citizens for a Chain-Free 
Ojai. But they say they are not opposed to all chains, only the mega-stores 
that offer deep discounts and thus drive off local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray King, a retired engineer from Los Angeles, said his opposition to Pay Less 
grew after reading the 1994 book "How Superstore Sprawl Can Harm Communities." 
</P>
<P>
 "Discount stores tend to suck the downtown dry," said King, whose back yard 
looks out on the proposed Pay Less site. "And when you lose your downtown, you 
lose your sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You end up with a homogenous kind of world." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the anti-chain activists persuaded a citizens' committee studying 
development in the Ojai Valley to endorse guidelines that would make it more 
difficult for chain stores to move into existing buildings. If adopted by the 
Board of Supervisors, the regulations would require a public hearing for a 
change of tenants in buildings that are more than 5,000 square feet in area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things are exposed to the public, everybody knows what's going on and 
can have a say," said Len Klaif, an attorney and massage therapist who formed 
Citizens for a Chain-Free Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if those restrictions are adopted, they will apply only to new 
projects and would not affect Pay Less. 
</P>
<P>
 Lannie Springer thinks Oak View residents may benefit from the Pay Less 
because it may reduce the number of Ojai shoppers driving through their 
community to reach discount drugstores in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, the unofficial mayor of Oak View and a member of the citizens 
development committee, voted against the public-hearing requirement. If people 
are unhappy with discount stores, she said, they should organize boycotts, not 
lobby the county to pass more rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tie a person's hands on what they can do with their property, it's just 
beyond my understanding," she said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
TAKES INITIAL STEP ON WORKER'S COMP REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has taken an initial step toward having a private 
firm take over administration of nearly half of the city's worker's 
compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday asked for a formal request seeking companies to manage 
claims by injured police officers and firefighters -- an assignment that would 
take up about 46% of the city's massive worker's compensation caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled system has the equivalent of nearly one claim for each of the 
city's 44,000 employees. Earlier this year, a top supervisor in the worker's 
compensation system was accused of heading a ring that allegedly bilked the 
city out of $1 million in fraudulent injury claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than five years of warnings of potential abuses, city officials 
only recently began to move to reform the worker's compensation system.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 2 
EX-OFFICERS GET 6 MONTHS IN OFF-DUTY SHOOTING SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two ex-Los Angeles police officers involved in a drunken, off-duty freeway 
shooting spree Feb. 9 have been sentenced to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge George W. Trammell also fined Michael Herrera and Ted 
Teyechea $5,000 apiece, placed them on three years' felony probation and 
ordered them to pay the cost of their probation and incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of sentencing Tuesday, the judge lambasted California Highway 
Patrol motorcycle Officer Scott Wall, who arrested the defendants after a 
pursuit on the Harbor and Artesia freeways.  
</P>
<P>
 Trammell called Wall "the most culpable" person in the case and said that in 
33 years on the bench he had never seen an officer "so thoroughly impeached by 
his own testimony."  
</P>
<P>
 Wall claimed that Teyechea and Herrera shot at him during a freeway chase, but 
he gave conflicting accounts of the incident to investigators and during his 
testimony at the trial.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EDELMAN 
SUGGESTS DEPUTY FOR TEMPORARY COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Departing Supervisor Ed Edelman said no thanks Wednesday to a suggestion that 
he temporarily fill Supervisor-elect Zev Yaroslavsky's City Council seat, but 
offered his chief deputy for the job instead.  
</P>
<P>
 Edelman held the council seat before Yaroslavsky and now will be succeeded by 
the Westside veteran on the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor strongly recommended "that the City Council give consideration 
to appointing my chief deputy, Bob Geoghegan, to the City Council's seat until 
July, 1995, when the new city councilman will be elected."  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Edelman -- who opted not to run for a sixth term -- will leave the 
Board of Supervisors after 20 years. Three days later, Yaroslavsky will be 
sworn in.  
</P>
<P>
 Fifth District residents are clamoring for an interim council replacement 
because they are worried that otherwise their interests will be ignored until 
July. Some people suggested that Edelman would be the perfect substitute until 
the new council member is elected. Yaroslavsky's wife, Barbara, is running for 
the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The council can appoint a successor to Yaroslavsky with a simple majority vote 
but in the past has shied away from filling such vacancies.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SLAIN 
OFFICER'S WIDOW WILL KEEP HORSE HE RODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beth Heim, the widow of the Los Angeles police officer gunned down last month 
in Hollywood, will get to keep the horse her husband rode as a member of the 
mounted unit of the LAPD's elite Metro Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday agreed that Heim should be sold 
Panzer, a part thoroughbred, part draft horse, for $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Charles Heim had planned to buy the horse when he retired from the 
police force because he was worried that nobody else would be able to handle 
the cantankerous animal. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to sell the animal to Beth Heim, also a police officer, for 
the nominal price, saying that the sale was for "a humanitarian purpose."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BLOOD 
SUPPLY DANGEROUSLY LOW, RED CROSS REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The amount of blood available at American Red Cross facilities remains 
dangerously low, despite a good donor turnout during the Thanksgiving holiday, 
a Red Cross official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the special efforts of blood donors during Thanksgiving week, Red Cross 
was able to collect 4,620 units of blood," said Daniel Connor, principal 
officer of the local Red Cross Blood Services. 
</P>
<P>
 That marked 106% of the agency's goal for that period and "enabled us to 
provide a good supply to hospitals," Connor said, "but it was not enough for 
Red Cross to continue resupplying hospitals at adequate levels."  
</P>
<P>
 This year has been a tough one for blood collections, he said. The situation 
is not expected to get better soon because the number of year-end donations 
traditionally drops compared to the first 10 months.  
</P>
<P>
 Recent donors will not be able to give again for 56 days, Connor said. "But 
there are thousands of others who will be able to donate, and we will need 
every one of them," he said. Donors must be 17 or older, healthy and not at 
risk for HIV or AIDS, Connor said. Appointments to donate can be made by 
calling (800) GIVE-LIFE.

<P>
 Women who want to become law enforcement officers are invited to a seminar at 
Fullerton College on Saturday, where some testing and training will be offered 
to those interested in applying for the campus's police academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Marie Valencia will conduct the four-hour 
seminar, which begins at 8 a.m. She will discuss the academy and provide 
instructions for its written examination and military drill and conduct a 
physical agility test, which are required for admission into the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton College's police academy is a 10-month training program in which 
graduates qualify for employment at any police department in the state, said 
John Sparkenbach, chairman of the college's administration of justice 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to bring up the number of women graduates," he said. "Law 
enforcement agencies throughout the county are eagerly looking for women to 
come to their departments." 
</P>
<P>
 Women should meet at the practice football field on campus. The college is at

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; WEST HIGH 
SCHOOL WINS 5TH COUNTY DECATHLON IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the fifth year running, West High School of Torrance has won the Los 
Angeles County Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member team of three A students, three B students and three C 
students beat out Diamond Bar High School, which came in second, and Peninsula 
High School, which placed third. 
</P>
<P>
 At the state decathlon in March, West will face about 45 other high schools, 
including Marshall High School, winner of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District Decathlon. Los Angeles Unified holds its own decathlon and does not 
participate in the county competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In state competition, West has placed second and third in recent years. The 
secrets to West's repeat victories, its coach and team members say, are its 
high level of motivation and plain hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 The academic decathlon consists of 10 events, including six written exams on 
subjects such as music and art, literature, science, mathematics and economics, 
speech and essay contests, an interview and a Super Quiz finale.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY WORKS ON PARK CENTRE COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a Calabasas City Council vote next week, city negotiators are working 
this week to finalize a compromise with the developer of Park Centre Calabasas 
to reduce the size of the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Lopata, who is representing the city, said he met for a 
final time with representatives for the developer, Kilroy Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopata declined to discuss what was said at the Tuesday morning meeting, which 
was also attended by City Councilman Dennis Washburn, another city negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is the proposal from the (city) is not finished yet," said 
Lopata. "To tell you what we've worked on is not going to help the process." 
</P>
<P>
 He would only say "some new ideas surfaced and Kilroy was looking into the new 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopata said the details will be kept secret until Friday afternoon, within the 
72-hour public notice required by law before the City Council's vote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Kilroy Industries could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy Industries received county approval for a 1.5-million-square-foot 
office and retail center at the corner of Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas 
before Calabasas became a city in 1989. The project includes a 
50,000-square-foot retail center, with the rest as office space. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer wants to increase the retail center to 200,000 square feet, 
because there is little demand for office space in this economic climate. The 
developer must get city approval for any change in the project plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy Industries has agreed to reduce the overall size of the project by 
300,000 square feet for a total of almost 1.2 million square feet, Lopata said 
in a recent interview. The developer has also offered to allow residents to 
help draw up a master plan for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were scheduled to vote on the project at a meeting in August, 
but postponed the matter after all five members told the developer they would 
reject the project unless it was scaled down. The council formed a committee, 
made up of Lopata, Washburn and representatives from Kilroy Industries, to work 
out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilroy Industries also wants to build a 2,000- to 2,400-seat movie theater as 
part of the project and it remains to be seen how the council as a whole will 
react to that proposal. Many Calabasas residents are opposed to a theater of 
that size and are urging council members to reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley said Tuesday that she is "hoping for something 
that is more congruent with the scale of the surrounding neighborhood." FRANK 
MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; STUDENTS DRESS CAMPUS UP, GET GARDENING TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The secret to successfully growing daffodils is to plant the bulbs with the 
bottom part down: That's one of the many horticultural tips students at Calahan 
Street Elementary in Northridge learned this week as they kicked off their 
schoolwide gardening project. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 daffodil bulbs -- one for every student at Calahan -- are being 
planted in front of the school, said PTA representative Cheryl Crooks, who 
recently helped land the parent-teacher organization a $1,000 grant to make the 
campus greener. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the daffodils were paid for by 50-cent donations from parents, they are 
the first phase of beautifying the elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects that will be funded by the grant include the planting of flowering 
shrubs and Los Angeles Unified School District-approved trees, Crooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calahan's PTA was one of 23 nonprofit organizations throughout Los Angeles to 
receive grant money from the city's Environmental Affairs Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools have no gardeners," said Crooks, who was dismayed by how barren 
the school campus looked. 
</P>
<P>
 As she showed kindergartners and fifth-graders on Wednesday how to dig a hole 
deep enough for the bulbs and mark it with an ice cream stick, Crooks said, 
"The kids are learning how to plant and measure." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more greenery," said Dione Kollee, 10. "If we plant, it'll make our 
school a better place for kids to come to." 
</P>
<P>
 A classmate, Chelsea Warfield, also 10, said, "This helps to make our school 
more decorated." MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COLLEGE'S ELECTION RESULTS IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allegations of unfair electioneering and complaints that administrators 
prevented candidates from speaking about their opponents threatened to postpone 
or even nullify the results of this week's Associated Student Body elections, a 
Glendale College official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of students called for the disqualification of incumbent ASB President 
Arthur Khachatourians, saying a campaign worker for Khachatourians stood near 
the voting tables Tuesday and instructed a group of about 30 students how to 
vote.  
</P>
<P>
 Khachatourians, meanwhile, said the student in question did not work for his 
campaign and the allegations were part of an effort to remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as it would be in a regular national election, this is inappropriate 
behavior because it sways the voters' opinions and thereby fixes the returns to 
go one way or the other," said Rebecca Barras, a former ASB representative, who 
said she witnessed the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Barras and other students, including several candidates in the elections that 
began Tuesday morning and were expected to conclude Wednesday evening, 
contended that administrators should have pulled Khachatourians off the ballot. 
 
</P>
<P>
 They said they brought the matter to Paul Schlossman, dean of student 
activities, who oversees ASB government meetings and the election process, but 
were dismayed when he instead offered to cancel the elections altogether and 
reschedule them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a clear violation, you don't cancel the election. Removal of the 
candidate should be the option," said Kevin Hopkins, a candidate for Associated 
Men Students president. Canceling the election would also penalize those 
candidates who had "campaigned fairly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates complained that during a recent political forum, they were 
ordered by administrators not to criticize their opponents or the college 
administration in their speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlossman said Tuesday he was "fielding complaints right and left" about the 
election, but he would not comment on charges that the voting process was 
tainted in favor of the incumbent president.  
</P>
<P>
 He said verbal complaints had been made against "a number of candidates" and 
administrators are following the college's grievance procedures to sort them 
out, which could end up postponing or even nullifying the election results, 
which are due today. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachatourians, meanwhile, said he believes those calling for his removal from 
the race are taking aim at him for not having always opposed the positions of 
the college administration, which they consider "evil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've not seen me go around and accuse other candidates. I've stood on the 
issues that I believe in," he said. "They don't want to see me get reelected, 
and they will do anything . . . in a very unethical way to be elected." STEVE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FIREFIGHTERS CONTAIN BLAZE IN RIVERBED

<P>
 A fire in the Santa Clara River bed burned about an acre of brush Wednesday 
morning, sending up flames and thick clouds of smoke visible from the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Two engine companies responded to the 9 a.m. fire and encircled the 
blaze.Rather than trying to push through the cane and other brush, they decided 
to let the plant life burn. The flames were contained about 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a contradiction for us to come to a fire and watch it burn, but 
sometimes it's better to just let it go for a while," said Ventura County Fire 
Engineer Dave Kromka. 
</P>
<P>
 A county arson investigator said he suspected the blaze was sparked earlier in 
the morning by a cigarette or a smoldering campfire. The stretch of riverbed 
adjacent to Johnson Drive is dotted with makeshift homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right where it started we found two or three mattresses, some sheets and some 
plastic," said investigator Peter Cronk. "It looks like there was a regular 
camp down there." JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PLANNERS TO STUDY 2 DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>

<P>
 The Oxnard Planning Commission tonight is scheduled to decide whether to move 
forward with plans for two developments on opposite ends of the city: the 
435-home Village West subdivision near Ormond Beach and a 100-home development 
in north Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will analyze an updated environmental report for the 33-acre 
Village West development to determine if the document is adequate and what 
effect the development would have on the surrounding area, a mixture of fragile 
wetlands and heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Co., which also wants to build 5,000 homes among the marshes at 
Ormond Beach, is proposing the development southeast of Hueneme and Perkins 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental report was discussed during the commission's Nov. 17 
meeting, but a decision was postponed after commissioners said they needed more 
information on the impact of an old nearby dump on the property and the effect 
of the development on wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Arthur Joe Lopez said he was concerned about a 1988 city report 
mentioning that the Halaco Engineering plant, located half a mile from the 
proposed site and itself the target of environmentalists, was built on top of 
an open-air landfill for which no records exist. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MOTORIST ARRESTED IN HIT-RUN ACCIDENTS

<P>
 An Oxnard man suspected in two hit-and-run accidents was arrested Wednesday 
morning following a cross-town police chase that ended when the man abandoned 
his car and the vehicle slammed into a sign pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas R. Rivera, 31, was being held in Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 
felony evading a peace officer and hit-and-run causing property damage.Bail was 
set at $10,000. Rivera told police he did not have a license and began driving 
only a few months ago. He also said that a friend had lent him the white Crown 
Victoria he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began just before 9:30 a.m. when two burglary detectives, Sgt. 
John Leach and Cpl. Jeff Killion, spotted a motorist driving illegally in a 
center lane and then turning quickly onto Pleasant Place, which runs through 
the campus of E.P. Foster School. 
</P>
<P>
 The two detectives followed the car. "We thought something had happened, that 
maybe a parent was in trouble," Killion said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorist drove through the campus, then turned right on Olive Street. When 
the car reached the on-ramp to California 33 at Stanley Avenue, the driver made 
an erratic U-turn and sped back down Olive Street, Killion said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the detectives continued their pursuit, police dispatchers broadcast 
information about a hit-and-run that had just occurred in the Ventura Avenue 
area. A second hit-and-run was later reported on Poli Street, and two witnesses 
identified Rivera as the driver in both crashes. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SESSION TO FOCUS ON ANIMAL REGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public workshop will be held today on a proposed county ordinance that would 
regulate the number of animals, ranging from pigeons to buffalo, allowed on 
private land. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, part of a large package of zoning amendments intended to 
streamline county policies, would replace an existing policy that allows an 
unlimited number of animals on parcels over 10 acres in agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new rules cover a range of livestock, rodents, reptiles and 
birds, it is the section dealing with horses that has drawn controversy. 
Several ranchers in the Ojai area, including Jaime and Kay Skeeters, the owners 
of Ojai Valley Farms, have opposed the proposal. They say the rules are too 
restrictive for large ranches and horse-boarding operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's workshop will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. in Room 344 of the Hall of 
Administration at the County Government Center. JULIE FIELDS

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GANTUS ANNOUNCES SCHOOL BOARD BID

<P>
 John Gantus, a Glendale attorney who has been active behind the scenes in 
local politics for several years, has announced that he will run for one of two 
seats on the Glendale school board that will be up for grabs in the city's 
April municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Gantus, 46, has gained local notoriety for his work representing the developer 
of the controversial Sleepy Hollow development and for working on the campaigns 
of City Councilwoman Mary Ann Plumley and other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is running to help "take back local control of our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our schools have become total slaves to the state Legislature for their 
funding, and the programs the school district must provide," Gantus said in a 
news release.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he would also support the conversion of certain school campuses for 
use as "neighborhood centers," wherein the school serves as the center for 
educational and recreational activities for area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gantus, who has been a member of the city Board of Zoning Adjustments for five 
years, and his wife, Jo Ann, have four children between the ages of 7 and 15, 
all of whom attend private, religious schools.  
</P>
<P>
 "My children are in schools that best suit our family's values for a strong, 
Christian educational environment. That is not for everyone, and definitely 
does not supplant the need for a strong public school system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent school board members Blanche Greenwood and Sharon Beauchamp have not 
yet announced whether they will seek reelection April 4. STEVE RYFLE

sixth-floor Van Nuys courtroom is graffiti warning that the "sex kid," Panah, 
"must die." 
</P>
<P>
 A bailiff who escorted the once suicidal defendant to court recently was 
assigned to other duties after reportedly telling Panah, "Why don't you just 
kill yourself and save the taxpayers time and money?" 
</P>
<P>
 A seasoned detective broke into tears on the witness stand in pretrial 
hearings last month as he recounted his futile search for Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert Sheahen recalled in court papers that he recently met 
a longtime legal colleague who told him, "No offense, Bob, but I hope your guy 
dies." 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, a 23-year-old department store clerk, is charged with murder, 
kidnaping, rape, sodomy and committing lewd acts with a child. He could face 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and plans to employ an insanity 
defense. Testimony in the trial is scheduled to begin Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Court records lay bare the ugliness of the killing, and set the stage for what 
could be a disturbing courtroom battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very ugly trial," said Nicole's mother, Lori Parker. "I'm 
dreading it." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's Iranian community also is abuzz about the case because 
Panah is believed to be the first Iranian immigrant to face a possible death 
sentence in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Television coverage in the community of Iranian immigrants "has reached 
saturation level," Sheahen said in court papers, arguing unsuccessfully that 
the case should have been moved out of the San Fernando Valley for Panah to 
receive a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen points to what he called strong anti-Iranian feelings in American 
society, describing Panah in court papers as "a foreigner from the most loathed 
location on the planet, and clearly a member of a group which arouses community 
hostility." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Peter Berman has disputed that argument in his legal response, 
pointing out that the Valley is ethnically diverse enough so that picking an 
impartial jury should not be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah is accused of luring the 8-year-old girl into his apartment, sodomizing 
her, strangling her and stuffing her nude, battered body in a suitcase left in 
his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole disappeared shortly after 11:45 a.m. on Nov. 20, 1993. She was last 
seen playing with a softball and mitt in the courtyard between her father's 
apartment and Panah's. 
</P>
<P>
 Her body was found in Panah's closet about 24 hours later after a search 
staged from a command post at the Woodland Hills apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah was arrested Nov. 21, after slashing his wrists and swallowing a bottle 
of sleeping pills in an apparent suicide attempt. He appeared at a former 
girlfriend's apartment, saying he had "done something really bad" and she would 
be hearing about it, she told police. He also told her the missing child was 
dead, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the emotional caldron is the fact that families of the victim and 
the defendant enjoy stature in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah's mother, Mehri Monfared, has been her son's staunchest defender. She 
has led efforts to establish a legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
 She produces a popular television show in Los Angeles for the Iranian 
community. The case has been featured prominently on Iranian television shows 
and the International Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Parker has worked as a paralegal and a legal secretary, and is engaged to 
marry prominent criminal defense attorney Martin Gladstein. "The community 
really has rallied around me," she said, adding that she received 3,000 cards 
and letters after Nicole's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladstein said that neither he nor Parker has enjoyed any special treatment 
from court staff. If they are sympathetic figures, it is "because Nicole was so 
young and so innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the case strikes a public chord, it is not because of issues of 
privilege or prejudice, he said. It is a matter of lost innocence, and a lost 
sense of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who has kids realized there is no place that is safe anymore. If it 
can happen to a little 8-year-old in a secured apartment complex in a nice part 
of town, it can happen to anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a defenseless, little tiny girl," Parker said. "That's where the 
emotion comes from . . . This is every parent's worst nightmare."

STATE TO SIDE WITH COUNTY IN MEDI-CAL FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials indicated in a letter released Wednesday that they will side 
with Los Angeles County in its battle to win reimbursement from the federal 
government of millions of dollars in Medi-Cal claims -- a long-running dispute 
that could leave the county with a huge hole in its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In the draft letter to the County Board of Supervisors, state health officials 
call a decision by federal authorities to postpone action on the reimbursement 
claims "unfair and unjust." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter from the state Department of Health Services is expected to be 
finalized Friday and sent to the federal Health Care Financing Administration, 
which has expressed doubts about reimbursement claims by Los Angeles and other 
California counties. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the letter, federal health care officials fear that paying off 
California's reimbursement claims will set a precedent in other states. Federal 
officials have projected that Medicaid costs nationwide could rise by $10 
billion. State and county officials dispute that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that if we can dispel the notion that paying California's claim 
will have a significant adverse effect on the Medicaid budget, we will then be 
in a better position to resolve the remaining issues," board Chairwoman Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke writes in a letter sent Wednesday to Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is seeking $640 million in reimbursements for the administrative 
costs of running its Medi-Cal program over the last three years. The sum has 
been included in the county's 1994-95 fiscal year budget, and its subtraction 
could force more budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, in its draft letter to the federal government, notes the possible 
dire consequences of that prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "County budgets were designed based on the expected receipt of 
(reimbursements)," the letter states. "HCFA's deferral of payment of . . . 
claims puts county health programs at risk of closure."

RAPIST TRANSFERRED TO PRISON IN LANCASTER TO AWAIT PAROLE 
</P>

<P>
 Convicted rapist Reginald Donald Muldrew has been transferred from Pelican Bay 
State Prison in Northern California to the state prison in Lancaster in 
preparation for his parole, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Corrections spokesman William Gengler said Muldrew, 
46, has completed a psychiatric examination, the results of which should be 
available by Friday.If Muldrew fails the exam, he could be kept in custody for 
six months, Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gengler also said authorities have not determined into what city Muldrew will 
be paroled, but said he is scheduled to be paroled somewhere in Southern 
California. Typically, Gengler said, the psychiatric exam is administered the 
day of parole but can be done in advance. Department of Corrections officials 
would not say when Muldrew's parole date was. However, Covina Police Chief John 
Lentz said state officials told him that Muldrew was scheduled to be released 
Sunday in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Gengler said the department has received statements from eight women in the 
Los Angeles area who say they were victims of Muldrew and are requesting that 
he not be paroled within 35 miles of where they live. Under state law, a 
parolee cannot be released within 35 miles of his victims or those who 
testified against him in court. The department is checking the validity of the 
women's claims, Gengler said, adding that they appeared to be valid.  
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew arrived at the Lancaster prison Monday afternoon, prison spokesman 
Dean Crenshaw said. Muldrew is being housed in a high-security unit where 
inmates spend most of their time in their cells. LISA O'NEILL

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; JAZZMAN STILL BLOWING STRONG AT THE AGE OF 90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is unclear, even to Arnold Brilhart, why he chose the saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe for no grander reason than it is a relatively sturdy musical instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Brilhart was just a whippersnapper when he decommissioned his first 
music-maker, accidentally swatting his father's prized flute off the family 
piano. A few years later, he dropped a violin while peddling his bicycle. Then, 
he ran over it. 
</P>
<P>
 Saxophones, especially altos, have held up a little better. And 83 years after 
he picked up his first, Brilhart is still blowing -- long after friends like 
Charlie Parker and John Coltrane and the Dorsey brothers cased their own saxes 
for the last time. Brilhart shrugs. "That's just what I played," the 
90-year-old says in his typically direct fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime San Fernando Valley resident who moved to Vista this summer after 
the Northridge earthquake demolished his home and many of the 78 r.p.m. records 
he played on, Brilhart was a prominent player in music circles from the birth 
to the decline of the Big Band era. He was a sideman known mostly to those in 
the business who helped shape that quintessentially American sound and who 
continues to shape the sax sound itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Brilhart played his first note on an alto at 7, and by the time he was 18 was 
spending five hours on trains to get to and from his home in Yonkers, N. Y., to 
gigs on Coney Island, playing with the Yerkes Flotilla Orchestra, which 
performed in Navy uniforms. It was 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few years, he was playing 15 or 20 radio shows a week, recording 
almost constantly, sitting in the first alto chair alongside the likes of Louis 
Armstrong, Benny Goodman and the California Ramblers Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when music was written down, as it ought to be, he says, and a good 
musician could sight-read a chart and play it with finesse. "It wasn't like 
these guys who just fake things," he said. He notes, however, that a new wave 
of gifted young players are learning the classics and still shaping the sax 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the swing road, Brilhart, like every other discriminating sax player, 
began his quest for the perfect sound, the right combination of sweet and fat 
and warm, with enough bite to ring like an alto yet not become shrill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started making reeds and mouthpieces because the ones on the market were so 
lousy," he says. So, he filed and honed, glued and experimented in between 
playing and practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many of the anarchist jazz players of his age, Brilhart has mixed his 
philosophies and methods, shunning dissonant solos for clean, clear 
arrangements, forgoing purism for functionalism. Instead of using traditional 
cane reeds, he started a company to produce synthetic versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of insisting on handmade mouthpieces, he has spent the last 12 years 
consulting with Rico International in Sun Valley -- the world's largest reed 
maker, which planned to hold a 90th birthday party for him Wednesday night -- 
on ways to automate mouthpiece production. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one would sound exactly the same! You would know what you are getting," 
he said, exasperated at the notion that a player would want a mouthpiece 
crafted by fallible human hands. And he enjoyed lunching with Charlie Parker, 
"but I could never understand what he was saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Brilhart is admittedly opinionated, obviously passionate, and after more than 
eight decades, still in love with the saxophone -- as well as a dozen other 
instruments, golf, the film "Amadeus," and his wife, Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get to be 90, people think you're done," he said. "I'm thinking 
about what I'll be doing 10 years from now." ERIC SLATER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DIMINUTIVE DECATHLETE IS A BIG WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's sweet and petite, and this week she took the Academic Decathlon by 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Shuger, 17, an academic decathlete from the El Camino Real High School 
team, placed first overall in the Los Angeles Unified School District for her 
individual performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Raking in 8,921 points out of a possible 10,000 and seven gold medals out of 
10 events, Dale said Wednesday that she felt terrific, despite her team's 
placing second to the Marshall High School team, which will go on to compete in 
the state decathlon competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect this at all," Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners were announced Tuesday night before a crowd of about 500 
competitors and 700 coaches, parents and friends during a festive dinner at the 
Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale, at 4-foot-10, was nearly hidden by her huge trophy. She also juggled 10 
medals and three plaques she won as she left the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, Dale and the other eight members of the El Camino team have 
devoted hundreds of hours studying biotechnology, economics, fine arts, 
literature, social studies, essay writing, public speaking and interviewing 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 But this ace student has also taken on three advanced placement classes this 
semester -- honors English and Spanish III, plus a role in the school's 
production of the play, "Working," which opens today. 
</P>
<P>
 And she's only a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Which means the big question on everyone's mind is: Will she be on the El 
Camino team next year? 
</P>
<P>
 Dale said she is unsure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be awesome to do it two years, but it would be hard to top this," 
she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of pressure, a lot of fun, but just too much memorization, and 
it's too competitive," said Dale. 
</P>
<P>
 She said one of the strongest drawing points of decathlon competition for her 
was the teamwork involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Kneeling by her awards Tuesday night, she seemed to be reconsidering her 
decision of a few weeks ago not to return to the team next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty good bribery," Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino coach Dave Roberson, for one, would really like to see her return. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Dale considers doing it again, I know she would have a solid chance at a 
repeat gold-placing," Roberson said. MAKI BECKER

2 MEDFLIES FOUND IN CAMARILLO SEMINARY GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two more Medflies have been found in an eastern Camarillo orange grove, state 
agriculture officials said Wednesday, bringing the total number of flies 
trapped to 66 since the infestation was discovered two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Agricultural workers doing a routine check of panel traps discovered the two 
male Medflies on Nov. 22, said Doug Hendrix, spokesman for the state and 
federal Cooperative Medfly Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The flies were found in traps in an orange grove on the grounds of St. John's 
Seminary, not far from were the first flies were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials planned a fourth aerial application of the pesticide malathion late 
Wednesday after stiff winds delayed the helicopter spraying over a 
16-square-mile eradication zone the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrix said state regulations forbid the aerial application of pesticides in 
winds of more than 10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tuesday night, we had winds hovering around 12 m.p.h., with occasional gusts 
as high as 23 or 24 m.p.h.," Hendrix said. "We canceled the operation around 
11:30 p.m. It had become clear that it wasn't going to get any better." 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service meteorologists Wednesday projected evening breezes to 
8 m.p.h. for the interior portion of the county the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly stronger winds are forecast for daylight hours today. J. E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PROSECUTORS WRAP UP THORNTON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly five weeks of testimony, prosecutors Wednesday wrapped up their 
murder case against Mark Scott Thornton, the 20-year-old Thousand Oaks man 
accused of slaying Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 UC San Francisco psychology professor Chris Hatcher was the state's final 
witness, testifying in Ventura County Superior Court that young kidnap victims 
generally have a tough time coping during abductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors considered the testimony important because defense attorneys have 
tried to discredit a former Thousand Oaks teen-ager who testified that she was 
kidnaped at gunpoint by Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident occurred hours after Thornton had abducted and murdered the 
33-year-old nurse Sept. 14, 1993, prosecutors claim. O'Sullivan was shot to 
death at a remote location in the Santa Monica Mountains during a carjacking, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton faces a possible death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder, 
but he is also charged with 13 other crimes, including the alleged kidnaping of 
17-year-old Stephanie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl testified that Thornton used O'Sullivan's truck to take her by force 
on a five-day sojourn to Northern California and Reno, where he was finally 
arrested. Campbell said he threatened to kill her if she tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, however, has contended that Thornton was in love with Campbell 
and offered to let her leave. She was free to go at any time, Thornton 
attorneys have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatcher, not testifying directly about Campbell, said young kidnap victims 
often do not know how to handle themselves during abductions and will not 
necessarily seek opportunities to escape out of fear. "Certainly age does make 
a difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During their case, which began Nov. 1, prosecutors called more than 60 
witnesses. The defense, which will begin its case today, is expected to call 20 
witnesses over the next week. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; AIR SHOW TO KICK OFF LIBRARY EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thunder of antique war birds will roll through Simi Valley skies Saturday 
over the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to kick off the museum's biggest 
exhibit ever, called "World War II: Personal Accounts." 
</P>
<P>
 Fighters, bombers and trainers from World War II will put on an hourlong air 
show at 2 p.m. at the library, situated off Olsen Road just east of Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Wing of the Confederate Air Force has gathered 17 
planes for the show, including P-51 Mustang fighters, B-25 bombers and a 
Heinkel bomber that served as personal aircraft to Spanish Gen. Francisco 
Franco before it was refitted as a Luftwaffe bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Sky divers will unfurl the American flag overhead to open the show, which will 
also include a big band concert featuring Oxnard's Big John Herman Band. 
</P>
<P>
 The library exhibit opens at 10 a.m. Saturday, displaying 250 items 
documenting wartime life. Curators have collected letters, diaries and 
photographs from soldiers, sailors and Marines about their World War II 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of former President Reagan, all World War II veterans and their 
immediate families can enter the museum free during December. Admission for 
other adults is $4, $2 for seniors, and children under age 16 are admitted 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 The World War II exhibit runs through Feb. 28, and the library is open from 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; MEDIATION SOUGHT IN CONTRACT TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contract negotiations between the Moorpark teachers union and the school 
district have broken down, with union officials calling for the state to 
mediate the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark Education Assn. declared an impasse just before Thanksgiving and 
has referred the matter to the California Public Employment Relations Board, 
said Richard Gillis, the union president. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state board certifies the impasse, a mediator will be assigned to work 
with the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said the negotiations broke down when the financially strapped district 
balked at giving a 1% raise to the district's 250 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers have worked without a contract for two years and, although they 
receive regularly scheduled salary increases based on the number of years they 
have worked, teachers have not had a cost-of-living raise since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 While school board members have pledged support for salary increases, district 
officials have said they cannot offer a raise. They have offered to set up a 
committee to find additional sources of revenue, said Thomas Duffy, district 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Several measures have been discussed to find money to increase salaries, 
including using lottery revenue or cutting back on the district's non-teaching 
staff, but no specific offers have been made to teachers, Gillis said. SCOTT

 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky will be Supervisor Yaroslavsky 
when he performs his duties as grand marshal of Pacoima's annual Christmas 
parade Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who represents the 5th Council District, won his bid to succeed 
Supervisor Ed Edelman and will represent Pacoima and the rest of the 3rd 
Supervisorial District, which covers most of the San Fernando Valley, beginning 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he was a good choice (as grand marshal) because we're the people 
who will have to live with this guy for the next few years," said Ed Kussman, 
secretary of the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce, which sponsors the event. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Richard Alarcon was grand marshal last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other personalities scheduled to attend include Diane Diaz of KNBC news and 
Kim Fields, star of the television show "Living Single," Kussman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, which will feature floats, drill teams, dancers and marching bands 
from area high schools, will begin at 10 a.m. at TransWorld Bank, 13657 Van 
Nuys Blvd., proceed down Van Nuys Boulevard to Glenoaks Boulevard and end at 
the Boys & Girls Club of the San Fernando Valley, 11251 Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Christmas festival will be held at the Boys & Girls Club after the 
parade, featuring games and booths promoting nonprofit organizations.

OXNARD MAN WOUNDED IN APPARENT DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man was seriously wounded Wednesday night in an apparent 
gang-related drive-by shooting in Oxnard's La Colonia neighborhood, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who was not immediately identified, was walking alone on Colonia Road 
about 7 p.m. when he was shot in the shoulder from a passing car, Oxnard police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in surgery at St. John's Regional Medical Center late Wednesday, but 
hospital officials would not characterize his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty well confirmed it was a gang shooting," Police Cmdr. Bob Elder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was shot, the man -- described by acquaintances as about 20 years old 
-- staggered down the street toward Herrera Bakery, said Frank Herrera, whose 
mother called police. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents heard the gunshot," Herrera said. "My mom went out, but all she 
saw was him on the floor."

EAST COUNTY GETS NEW CHILD SUPPORT OFFICE; SIMI VALLEY: BEGINNING TODAY, 
COURTHOUSE WILL ALSO OFFER AID TO BATTERED FAMILY MEMBERS. PROPOSITION 172 
FUNDS WILL FINANCE SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move to make the East County Courthouse more complete, the district 
attorney today will open a new office to help mothers collect child support 
payments and to protect family members who have been battered at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and Supervisor Vicky Howard announced the new 
services Wednesday at the 4-year-old courthouse near Simi Valley City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy and proud that we are now able to offer these services to the 
people of this community," Howard said. "The east end of the county has never 
really had the services that I felt we paid for and deserved because of a tough 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
 During a press conference at the courthouse, Bradbury credited Howard with 
laying the groundwork for the new office, which he said would be funded in part 
by sales tax dollars generated by Proposition 172. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from the voter-approved measure has been used to fill vacant staff 
positions and enabled the district attorney to transfer three employees from 
Ventura to Simi Valley. Between $5,000 and $6,000 also was spent to furnish the 
new office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said the county will provide even more service at the courthouse 
soon. Although it has six courtrooms, the courthouse now uses only two -- and 
those are staffed by court commissioners who hear mostly traffic cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate that in the not to distant future, we'll see criminal trials out 
here as well," Bradbury said. "I think we'll see a Superior Court judge out 
here in the next six to 12 months." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Bradbury said he hopes to assign a deputy district attorney to the 
courthouse within the next year to work with local police agencies to determine 
if charges should be filed in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, police have to drive to Ventura to have their cases reviewed for 
filing decisions," Bradbury said. "This means officers have to spend a lot of 
time on the road. This will allow them to get back to their investigations 
quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Trom, director of the district attorney's Child Support Division, said 
his office handles about 42,000 child support cases, and about 25% to 30% of 
those cases are from the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume things will be very busy here," Trom said. "I think there will soon 
be a need to expand." 
</P>
<P>
 Trom said his office collected $27.5 million in child support payments last 
year, making Ventura County the first in the state for collections. He said, 
however, that more than $100 million is owed in back child support in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, Ana Longo, a family support officer, and Teri Morgan, an 
office assistant, will report to the east county office on the second floor of 
the courthouse at 3855-F Alamo St. 
</P>
<P>
 The office will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and will 
provide services to locate absent parents and enforce child support orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara O'Neil, a victims' advocate, is also assigned to the office to counsel 
crime victims. O'Neil will help victims of domestic violence obtain restraining 
orders quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The new prosecutor's office is the latest addition to a growing number of 
county services at the courthouse. Departments represented include building and 
safety, children's services, public social services and the public defender. 
Supervisor Howard also has an office in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who retires in January, said adding the child support office is a 
wonderful way to "close out my time of service." 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this is one of the most important services we could provide," she 
said.

2 ARRESTED IN ALLEGED DRUG, GUN SALES, CELLULAR THEFT; THOUSAND OAKS: RAIDS CAP 
FOUR-MONTH PROBE. SUSPECTS' OPERATION INCLUDED SOPHISTICATED PHONE 'CHIPPING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police have arrested a pair of accused Thousand Oaks methamphetamine dealers 
who also dabble in gun sales to gangs and cellular phone-service theft -- a 
cutting-edge crime known as "chipping," sheriff's detectives said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can get the ID or code number from a cellular phone and reprogram or 
'chip' the phone," said Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Gary Pentis after twin 
raids on the men's homes that netted drugs, guns, cash and sophisticated 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a multimillion-dollar-a-year fraud," Pentis said. "The person's number 
that they steal gets billed for all their calls, and they can use that number 
for up to a month without being detected, until the (victim) gets a bill with 
thousands of dollars of calls on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives arrested Craig Martin, 21, of Thousand Oaks and Gary Hazher, 32, of 
Newbury Park on suspicion of drug dealing, theft of phone services, credit-card 
fraud, check forgery and other crimes after searching their homes Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 They also arrested Julie Mizzel, 25, of Newbury Park, Hazher's girlfriend, on 
suspicion of drug dealing and possession and credit-card fraud, he said. All 
three were ordered held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $20,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests capped a four-month investigation that began when tipsters told 
detectives that Martin and Hazher were selling methamphetamine, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 An undercover officer bought the drug several times from Martin and Hazher, 
Pentis said.  
</P>
<P>
 Detectives also learned the men had been "chipping" cellular phones and using 
stolen credit-card numbers to order thousands of dollars worth of stereo and 
electronics gear by mail -- some of which the pair resold, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Search warrant in hand, detectives raided Hazher's home in the 100 block of 
Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park at about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they crashed through the front door, Hazher bolted toward a closet where a 
9-millimeter pistol was hidden in a safe, Pentis said. "But we tackled him 
before he could get near it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, other deputies who had been tailing Martin arrested him at the 
Buenaventura Mall in Ventura and confiscated the case he was carrying, which 
held a loaded .38-caliber revolver, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 A the same time, detectives were raiding Martin's home in the 1300 block of 
Calle Avellano, Pentis said. There they found Mizzel, whom they had seen 
earlier participating in methamphetamine sales, Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives seized two ounces of methamphetamine, $3,000 cash, scales, sales 
records, a police scanner and weapons caches in the raids. The guns included 
two assault weapons -- one with a 100-round magazine -- two 12-gauge 
pistol-grip shotguns, three semiautomatic pistols, two revolvers and a 
.308-caliber scope-equipped sniper rifle that alone is worth $2,000 to $3,000, 
Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also seized equipment used for reprogramming cellular-phone chips and 
evidence of check forgery and mail-order credit-card fraud, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of their crimes are pretty sophisticated," Pentis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is continuing and detectives expect to file further charges.

AROUND THE VALLEY: OH MOTHER, TELL YOUR CHILDREN NOT TO DO WHAT I HAVE DONE

 Anthony Kimberly once stabbed a man on the altar of an abandoned funeral home, 
using the victim's money for the cocaine he later injected right on the altar 
steps. He stole things to keep pace with his runaway drug habit: cars, trucks, 
motorcycles -- even a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Cruz knifed one robbery victim in the back, slit the throat of another. 
He dealt drugs, used drugs, threatened a police officer with a loaded gun. For 
his crimes, he spent 13 years behind prison walls. One-third of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Olivarez had a death wish. He took his fiancee on a high-speed suicide 
run on the Simi Valley Freeway because she would not stop freebasing cocaine, a 
drug that had kidnaped his own life. So he tried to kill them both, weaving 
across all four lanes, hoping the car would crash and explode. 
</P>
<P>
 He failed. They crashed, but survived. Olivarez went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were convicts. Now they are teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 They're former hard-timers who again stepped behind the high walls and 
concertina wire -- this time at Juvenile Hall in Sylmar -- to counsel young 
gangbangers and rough boys likely to follow in their footsteps to the Big 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 They have spent a combined 40 years in lonely, dangerous prisons with names 
like Soledad, Mill Creek and Folsom. And one named Chuckawalla that convicts 
call "Chuckie's House." 
</P>
<P>
 Now this rogue's gallery sits stoically at a table in a drafty meeting room, 
facing their audience like solemn preachers, men who had nothing left to prove. 
Especially to this group. 
</P>
<P>
 For here is the newest generation of criminal. Skinny teen-agers, lost inside 
baggy detention jumpsuits and denim jackets, slouch in their chairs, arms 
crossed, eyelids heavy, as though they have heard this Big Brother stuff too 
many times before. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise Guys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Claudia Ryan would have none of it. She's the executive director of the 
Ryan Center in North Hollywood, where 30 ex-convicts live in the process of 
re-entering society. The granddaughter of a prison warden, Ryan rides a 
Harley-Davidson and has a particular vision for ex-cons. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not bogeymen, but people who have done their time and deserve a 
second chance. Her guys, she says, spend hours of volunteer time each month 
proving it. Like these three, they talk to groups at local homes for teen-age 
criminals. They counsel elderly homeowners on how to avoid becoming The Victim, 
at home and on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, at these meetings, Ryan becomes the sergeant-at-arms. As the men talk, 
she scans the audience for the first sign of contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come in here, you give my guys respect," she says in a gravelly voice. 
"You don't understand the word, that's cool. Go back to your units. I just 
don't want my guys shown any disrespect." 
</P>
<P>
 While the tone is stern, this is no Scared Straight rap where youths are 
insulted and demoralized in hopes that they will be shocked and terrified into 
becoming good citizens. This is plain straight talk: men owning up to their 
mistakes in the hope of influencing someone much younger than them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in here talking to you guys because it helps me ," Kimberly says. A thin 
man, he resembles a used car salesman with wild eyes hidden behind sunglasses. 
"It helps keep my mind off the drugs. It helps keep me sober another day." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz tells the group about a wasted life that -- including his incarceration 
as a juvenile -- has kept him locked up for 20 of his 38 years. "I have an 
18-year-old daughter and a 20-year-old son who don't even know me." 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in a white T-shirt, Cruz is a smallish man 
</P>
<P>
 with a shaved head and a goatee -- the vision of a prison inmate, straight out 
of Central Casting. He broadcasts an unsettling quietness. His words are few 
but powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, he tells the group, he spent time at this very juvenile hall. 
Looking around, he says the place looks the same. "I'm the one who's gotten 
older, warehoused in state prisons for two decades." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses, allowing silence to grip the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time behind bars is time you never get back. You've lost it. And those bars 
are always waiting to take you back. Every time you mess up." 
</P>
<P>
 His shiny black hair tucked into a ponytail, Olivarez has the bulging muscles 
of a man who has spent much of his life lifting weights in exercise yards, 
where ruthless men can nurse a petty grudge into a murderous hatred. The boys 
are impressed as he paces the room, detailing murders he has witnessed behind 
bars, cons cutting cons with makeshift knives. 
</P>
<P>
 The trap is set -- they're all inside. Then he springs the real message. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivarez did drugs and went to prison because he was angry. He was enraged at 
being molested by his relatives, and dunked in cold water three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks of the day a relative kicked him in the testicles, robbing him of the 
chance to have his own children someday. The room goes silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Olivarez admits it was hard to reveal details so intimate to a group 
of young strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that was my problem," he says. "I had to let it out. I'm telling these 
kids they've got to let out the anger of their own messed-up childhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the group has received letters from youths -- and one former 
juvenile hall resident has moved into the Ryan Center to straighten out his 
life -- no one knows if any of the straight talk hit home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Cruz says. "All I know is that I tried. That's all that 
matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking away from the walls and the wire, he shrugs. "Every time I hear the 
buzzing as the guards close those doors, it brings back memories. And ain't 
none of 'em pretty."

WORM CONCERN PLANS TO DEFY COUNTY ORDER TO HALT COMPOSTING; RECYCLING: COMPANY 
SAYS IT WILL FIGHT IN COURT TO KEEP OPERATING A SIMI VALLEY AREA GREEN WASTE 
FACILITY THAT RESIDENTS SAY CAUSES DUST, ODOR AND NOISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In defiance of a Ventura County order to halt all composting operations by 
today, the Worm Concern near Simi Valley plans to continue accepting green 
waste and fight the county in court, company officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing up to $10,000 a day in fines, the company has advised customers that it 
will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, however, are equally adamant about making sure the facility 
is closed, as are nearby residents, who have complained about odor, dust and 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (cease-and-desist) order will be enforced," said assistant county counsel 
William Moritz. "And my understanding is that it will be sooner rather than 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 John Bowman, an environmental attorney who represents the Worm Concern, said 
he is not surprised by the county's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has shown no serious interest in resolving this administratively," 
Bowman said. "They seem only interested in putting (the Worm Concern) out of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials denied that charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been given 18 months to get a permit and they have not made serious 
progress in doing that," Moritz said. "This is not out of the blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman and Moritz have had a heated exchange of letters since the county's 
environmental health division issued a cease-and-desist order on Oct. 28. The 
order also demands that the company vacate the site entirely by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest letter sent to the county Monday, Bowman pledged a court battle 
if the county tries to enforce the order. The Worm Concern has also threatened 
to sue for damages if the company is put out of business or hurt financially. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility has been operating without a permit since the spring of 1992 on 
about 20 acres of land off Tierra Rejada Road near Simi Valley. During that 
time, neighbors have repeatedly complained that the business does not belong 
near a residential area. A group of homeowners has hired an attorney and a 
political consultant. They also have lobbied the county to shut down the 
business and threatened a class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that neighbors were pushing to close the Tierra Rejada site, 
county officials were reviewing an environmental assessment submitted by the 
Worm Concern aimed at getting a conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling that the material was incomplete, the county said the operation should 
be considered a solid-waste dump and be subject to the same type of extensive 
environmental review for such facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Worm Concern, which uses worms to recycle about 100 tons of yard 
trimmings a day into fertilizer, argued that the operation was not a dump and 
would even be exempt from such permit requirements in pending state 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're puzzled at the county's unwillingness to work with us," Bowman said. 
"This is clearly not a dump. In fact, this is a beneficial operation that helps 
the county and cities meet their recycling goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the material accepted at the facility comes from a curbside green 
waste recycling program set up for the city of Simi Valley and the surrounding 
area. Similar programs, set to begin in Thousand Oaks and Moorpark over the 
next few years, would more than double the amount of material they accept. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Worm Concern is forced to stop taking green waste altogether, it could 
jeopardize the recycling efforts of those east county cities that must meet a 
state-imposed limit on the amount of trash they send to area landfills, some 
Simi Valley officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that cities reduce by 25% the amount of trash they send to 
landfills by 1995, and 50% by 2000. Because green waste makes up as much as 25% 
of the trash sent to landfills, recycling that waste would go a long way toward 
helping cities meet the state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 G.I. Rubbish and Anderson Rubbish, which haul curbside green waste to Worm 
Concern, have pledged to take the material somewhere else if the county 
enforces the cease-and-desist order, said Joe Hreha, Simi Valley's deputy 
director of environmental services. Both haulers are limited partners in Worm 
Concern and each has a 10% interest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Worm Concern may receive another blow if the owners that lease the property to 
Worm Concern succumb to pressure from irate neighbors and evict the company, 
the attorney for the neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Worm Concern is continuing its search for a site away from 
homeowners, a move company officials hope could also ease the pressure from the 
county, said Pete Racicot, an environmental consultant working for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an illegal activity," Racicot said. "All we're doing is worm 
farming. It's not a danger to anybody. I don't know why the county isn't 
working to help this succeed, because this sort of operation could really help 
them meet their recycling needs."

WOODLAND HILLS MAN ARRESTED IN SWINDLING CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Woodland Hills resident with a history of convictions for theft has 
been arrested in Las Vegas for allegedly swindling more than $500,000 from 
people who sought his services as a purported loan broker. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sanford Turkin, 50, was taken into custody late Tuesday after being 
charged with 42 counts of grand theft and one count of attempted grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 He was being held in lieu of $100,000 bail and was scheduled to appear before 
a Las Vegas judge today or tomorrow to determine when he will return to Los 
Angeles, according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Turkin's alleged victims lost property and businesses as a result of 
his unfulfilled promises that he would help them secure quick loans from the 
federal government's Small Business Administration, said Deputy City Atty. Don 
Kass. 
</P>
<P>
 "He assured them immediate funding, and months and months went by" without any 
receipt of money, Kass said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kass added, the would-be loan applicants gave Turkin up-front fees 
averaging $2,000 to $4,000 for his purported brokerage expertise. In one case, 
according to the city attorney's office, a businessman hoping to repair riot 
damage to his South Los Angeles property paid Turkin $47,000 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a decade, Turkin operated a business called Inter-Cal Financial at 
53 Fallbrook Ave. in Woodland Hills. He advertised his services in area 
newspapers, drawing dozens of alleged victims from throughout the county, Kass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Las Vegas -- opening a new consulting business there -- when the 
state Department of Justice began investigating complaints about his Los 
Angeles operation in June, 1993, Kass said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkin has a record of convictions for grand theft and issuing bad checks that 
dates back to 1976, and he has served time in state prison for those charges, 
Kass said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the new grand theft charges, filed earlier this month in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court, he could face a year in jail and a $1,000 fine for 
each count. For the attempted grand theft charge, he could face a maximum 
sentence of six months in jail and a $500 fine if convicted.

MAN WHO HUNG OUT WITH GANG MEMBERS FATALLY SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Benito Ozaeta was a familiar figure in the 14000 block of Rayen Avenue, 
hanging out with the gang members who congregate at a local apartment building, 
occasionally running errands for them, according to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "His friends would always instigate him to do all their dirty work," said a 
31-year-old resident who did not want his name used. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess this time he just pushed the wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Wednesday were looking for a man they said walked up to Ozaeta as he 
stood on the sidewalk at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and emptied a pistol into him. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman fled. When police arrived, witnesses told them to follow a red car 
leaving the area, Detective Stephen Fisk said. Police did and eventually caught 
up with the car, which Fisk said contained two uninvolved college students. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisk said police knew of no motive in Ozaeta's slaying, which happened across 
the street from an apartment building that neighbors say is a favorite gang 
hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said Ozaeta, 22, known to them as "Indio," was an independent 
operator and though he may have engaged in shady dealings, he was sociable and 
well-liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good person. He was just caught up in the wrong place at the wrong 
time," said a 34-year-old woman Ozaeta frequently stopped to chat with while 
passing through the neighborhood. "He wasn't out there harassing people. He 
would talk socially with people, with older folks, with kids. He kind of kept 
order out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective John Edwards said the killer may also have been responsible for 
stabbing two unidentified men on the same block roughly two hours before the 
shooting. The stabbing victims were hospitalized.

 A 20-year-old man was killed Wednesday when his car went through a red light, 
collided with a dump truck and hit a traffic signal, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was driving north on White Oak Avenue when he ran the traffic signal 
at Saticoy Street and crashed into a city trash truck making a left turn on 
White Oak Avenue and then into the signal, said Officer Don Cox of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Efren Garcia, the driver of the dump truck, was not injured, police said.

CYCLIST GETS YEAR IN JAIL FOR STAGING ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man who rigged his bicycle to fall apart upon impact in staged accidents was 
sentenced to one year in jail after he pleaded no contest Wednesday to theft 
charges, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Siddons, 33, of Tarzana, was first arrested Oct. 26 after police 
watched him stage two accidents with cars leaving the Ventura Freeway at DeSoto 
Avenue in Woodland Hills, according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddons, who said he is an unemployed plumber, was sentenced in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court after he pleaded no contest to six counts of theft. He was 
ordered to begin serving his sentence immediately, said Deputy City Atty. Wayne 
Mooney. He was also ordered to pay $653 in restitution to 11 of his victims, 
Mooney added. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had received several complaints from motorists who reported being 
involved in traffic accidents with a bicyclist who asked for money -- in one 
case $75 -- to repair his bicycle after the accident, according to Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddons was identified by police after he filed a crime report accusing one of 
his victims of hit-and-run driving. Police then followed him to a Tarzana hotel 
and watched him place a red bicycle with a bent front wheel in a car and drive 
to the DeSoto off-ramp, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney said Siddons adjusted the seat and front wheel of the bicycle so they 
would fly off upon impact and began riding along DeSoto Avenue and Clark Street 
near the freeway exit. He first struck a Ford Thunderbird and later a Ford 
Escort as the cars were leaving the freeway off-ramp, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddons was arrested after the second accident and booked for theft at the 
LAPD's Van Nuys Division. He later pleaded not guilty to the charges and was 
released on his own recognizance until his Nov. 17 trial, Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 After news reports of his arrest, eight more motorists contacted police to 
report being rammed by Siddons on his bicycle. More charges were filed against 
Siddons and he was arrested again on Nov. 2.

RETAILER BALKS AT RULING TO PRESERVE MURAL IN HISTORIC BUILDING; LONG BEACH: HE 
SAYS IT'S TOO COSTLY TO RELOCATE THE MASONIC TEMPLE'S SUNSET PAINTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fiery orange and red mural of a setting sun, painted on a wall in Long 
Beach's oldest non-residential building, could thwart a trendy retail chain's 
plans to open a store in the landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Z Gallerie, which sells contemporary furniture and art reproductions, has been 
negotiating with city agencies to set up shop in the 91-year-old building, a 
former Masonic Temple three doors from the chain's existing Pine Avenue store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based company wants to demolish the interior wall on which the 
mural is painted so that it can create an open warehouse-style store similar to 
its other outlets. But the city's Cultural Heritage Commission, which considers 
proposed changes to landmark buildings, has ruled that the unsigned work must 
be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to protect the historic fabric of the lodge," said C. William Avery, 
chairman of the heritage commission and a Mason. "It is a landmark." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said the entire wall could be moved, or the 40-foot-long 
artwork could be relocated to another wall within the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Zeiden, president of Z Gallerie, said an art preservation expert 
estimated that it would cost $80,000 to relocate the mural. "They want me to 
preserve it, but they don't have any money to help me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeiden added that the cost is not the only factor. He said he wants to remove 
the mural from the building because it will detract from the store's 
appearance. "It's got to be gone from the property completely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Z Gallerie has appealed to the city's Planning Commission, the final authority 
on the matter. The commission is scheduled to hear the appeal at 1:30 p.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery said the mural was painted on the west wall on the second floor of the 
temple so that a highly respected lodge member, the senior warden, could sit 
beneath a sunset during gatherings. The lodge's worshipful master sat on the 
eastern side of the room under another painting that was moved to the Mason's 
Bixby Knolls Neptune Lodge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery said his Masonic affiliation did not influence his vote. "Setting 
Masonry aside, I look at historic fabric, the building itself and what it 
represents to the city -- that is why I came on the board," he said. "I see no 
conflict there." 
</P>
<P>
 William F. Stovall, the Masons' California grandmaster, said his organization 
is not willing to contribute funding to preserve the mural. "It is no longer 
our mural, so we do not have much to say about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the heritage commissioners, including Avery, voted to approve Z 
Gallerie's plans in August with the stipulation that the painting would be 
preserved. Four commissioners voted against the entire project and five others 
abstained or were absent. A 15th commissioner has since been appointed and did 
not participate in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masons vacated the turn-of-the-century building in 1971 after the city 
ordered the organization to make seismic improvements that it could not afford, 
Avery said. In 1984, the building was sold to Lloyd Ikerd, a Long Beach 
businessman, who spent $3 million restoring and upgrading it over seven years, 
only to lose it in foreclosure to Bank of America in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have this guy go into a totally restored building and gut it just destroys 
me," Ikerd said of the Z Gallerie proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan F. Shick, Long Beach's community development director, said the 
redevelopment board voted to help Z Gallerie acquire the building. "Getting a 
reliable tenant to use it long term is the key to preservation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former lodge currently has two nonprofit tenants, Beach Charities and the 
American Women's Economic Development Corp. The organizations would have to 
relocate if Z Gallerie moves in. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruthann Lehrer, the city's historic preservation officer, said that the 
heritage commission and Z Gallerie have been negotiating changes in the 
building for months, and that the mural is the last point of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Z Gallerie would be allowed to remove several walls, construct a new freight 
elevator, install skylights, remove interior plaster to expose brick and 
repaint ceiling panels. 
</P>
<P>
 The company would preserve an existing staircase, the historic second-floor 
lodge hall, original fireplaces and much of the original wainscoting, and 
restore the exterior facade.

BUDGET SLIP COSTLY NEWS FOR COUNTY; SPENDING: LEGISLATORS RAISED THE AMOUNT OF 
TAX REVENUES TO BE SHIFTED TO THE SCHOOLS TO REMEDY AN OMISSION IN THE STATE'S 
FORMULA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was bad enough for counties and cities when the state squeezed them like so 
many tubes of toothpaste to spread more of their property tax revenues to the 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the state is saying that Los Angeles County and its cities did not 
contribute as much money as expected in the last two years and owe the state 
additional tax revenues for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next two years, the county must pay $85 million, county libraries 
must pay $837,000, Pomona must pay $934,000, West Covina must pay $239,000 and 
Covina must pay $195,000. Half will have to be repaid by May. 
</P>
<P>
 Many city officials learned about the cost at a Nov. 2 meeting with the county 
auditor-controller's staff and have to scramble to revise the city budgets and 
possibly cut services to make up for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was astounded, as were most of the people at the meeting," said Mary 
Bradley, Pasadena's finance director. The city will use a $1.6-million 
stabilization fund to pay $278,000 each year for the next two years and cover 
the loss of an additional $500,000 annually, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they found it hard to believe that local agencies were 
unaware of the legislation. "This was a hot topic of debate. . . . This should 
have come as no surprise to local government officials. . . . There had been 
about a year of discussions," said Steve Olsen, deputy director of the state 
Finance Department. "Los Angeles County knew what they had done." 
</P>
<P>
 While drawing up the 1992-93 budget, the state Legislature created a fund for 
schools and passed legislation ordering counties to shift property tax revenues 
from local governments to the schools fund. For the 1993-94 budget, legislators 
increased the amount to be shifted into the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials said 12 counties, including Los Angeles County, calculated 
the shift differently than the state did, and in both years did not move enough 
money from local agencies to schools. And now cities, special districts and the 
county owe more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened, county officials said, was that the state forgot about 
redevelopment agencies. The state's formula gave counties, cities and special 
districts a certain amount and figured on all the rest going to schools. But 
the county also had to give money to redevelopment agencies in some cities, and 
took that out of money that otherwise would have gone to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant that in 1993-94 the state fell $300 million short of the $2.6 
billion it expected to shift to schools statewide, leading legislators to pass 
legislation in July to collect the money that was owed and force the county to 
pay redevelopment agencies out of local government funds, not the school fund, 
Olsen said. He said it was either tell cities and counties to pay up or cut 
state services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tyler McCauley, county assistant auditor-controller, said that what the 
county did was legal under state law and that to address the problem, 
Sacramento legislators are changing the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only must local governments pay the extra money they got over the last two 
years, but from now on they will get less money because their share of property 
tax revenues will be figured on the state's formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double hit, " McCauley said. "It's like your salary is being cut and 
it went into effect a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona must pay back $933,000 in the next two years, but it will also lose 
about that much annually in revenues. So this fiscal financial year, it will 
have about $1.4 million less in property tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were completely oblivious to this. . . . We were told this would be a 
minor adjustment," Pomona City Administrator Severo Esquivel said. "We had been 
assured by the League of California Cities and legislators that cities weren't 
being hit this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra was one of the few cities, along with the county, that budgeted to 
cover the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad, and it's not going to get any easier for cities," said Alhambra 
Councilwoman Barbara A. Messina, president-elect of the Independent Cities 
Assn., a group of more than 50 Southland cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Covina, where the council recently passed a utility tax to make ends meet, 
officials said property tax revenues account for less than one-eighth of the 
city's revenue. "It's ludicrous," Covina City Manager Fran Delach said. "We 
feel we're gradually being strangled."

 The burned body of a man was found alongside a well-traveled highway Wednesday 
afternoon by patrolling sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators said the unidentified 
victim was killed, dumped near 65th Street East and Palmdale Boulevard and his 
body set afire. The body was discovered about 1:30 p.m., Deputy Brian Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that because the body was burned beyond recognition, the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office will have to identify the man and determine the 
cause of death. Deputies did not say how the man had been killed. JEANNETTE

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN SUBDUED AFTER 6-HOUR STANDOFF; PLACERITA 
CANYON: MARK EDWARDS IS CAPTURED AFTER ALLEGEDLY THREATENING HIS ROOMMATE AND 
SHOOTING AT DEPUTIES.

 A man who threatened a roommate with a gun and barricaded himself in his house 
for six hours was subdued by sheriff's deputies using tear gas and a dog, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Edwards, 27, was captured outside his Placerita Canyon home after a 
number of shots were fired from a handgun at deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia for 
three dog bites and a broken nose, then booked on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon at the Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles in lieu of $300,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards' 32-year-old roommate, who declined to give his name, said that about 
3:15 p.m. Tuesday, Edwards was having delusions about losing his home and put a 
gun to the roommate's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like he snapped and planned to shoot people up," the man said. "He 
wanted to protect his house." The man said he was able to walk safely from the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies, including a special enforcement team from East Los Angeles, 
surrounded the house and closed off the dirt roads and driveways leading to 
other homes in the rural area. Edwards spoke to police by telephone briefly at 
4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:15 p.m., his sister pleaded through a loudspeaker with Edwards, who still 
refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies fired nine tear-gas cartridges inside at 9:20 p.m. He responded by 
returning fire with a .40-caliber semiautomatic handgun. No one was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found seven empty shell casings from the gun in the room where Edwards was 
shooting at deputies, plus other evidence he was shooting toward them," Sgt. 
Howard Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 More tear-gas was fired into the house about 15 minutes later, causing Edwards 
to come onto the porch, where he was subdued by a police dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies searching the house Wednesday found the handgun, still loaded with 
three rounds, plus an unloaded rifle with 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition 
nearby, Fairchild said. He said they also found pipes and other drug 
paraphernalia but no drugs.

ARIZONA PROVES IT CAN GO THE ROUT AGAINST MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Michigan faithful -- if you can call them that -- began streaming out of 
The Palace of Auburn Hills midway through the second half of Wednesday 
evening's game against Arizona. By then, a Wolverine fan seated behind the 
bench had stood up, glared at the offending scoreboard and held his nose in 
disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing he didn't stick around for the end. Who knows what the guy might 
have done after Michigan's 78-57 loss to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat itself wasn't such a huge surprise, but the rout was. Arizona (3-1) 
began the game ranked No. 9 and had four starters returning from last season's 
Final Four team. The 17th-ranked Wolverines were down to two Fabs -- Jimmy King 
and Ray Jackson -- two freshmen and junior Dugan Fife, who hardly counts these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time it was finished, many of the 18,885 fans who had come to see their 
beloved Wolverines (3-1) were long gone. They had seen enough of Wildcat senior 
guard Damon Stoudamire, who finished with 24 points, seven assists and six 
rebounds, and had had their fill of junior guard Reggie Geary, who once again 
reduced Michigan's top offensive threat into a jump shooting wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when Arizona beat the Wolverines by 24 points, Geary completely 
unnerved Jalen Rose, holding him to four of 15 from the field. He did likewise 
against King, who made one of 10 shots in the first half and only one of two in 
the second half for a total of 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seemed like he just quit looking for (the ball)," Geary said. 
</P>
<P>
 King wasn't alone. Jackson had only 11 points, as did freshman Jerod Ward. In 
all, the Wolverines were a miserable 21 of 67 from the field (31.3%), while 
Arizona shot 50.8%. It was Michigan's lowest point total since its 71-51 loss 
to Duke in the 1992 NCAA championship.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were talking about blowing us out," Geary said of the early going. "At 
the end of the game I didn't hear no more of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The first game of the evening didn't have the same marquee value, but it did 
have a close finish as unranked Missouri defeated unranked Purdue, 69-66. 
</P>
<P>
 Never was Purdue's search for a Big Dog II more evident than in the final 14 
seconds of their game against Missouri. Down by three, there would have been 
little doubt who would have taken the clutch shots last season. Somehow the 
ball would have found its way into Glenn Robinson's hand, the 6-foot-8 power 
forward who later became the NBA's No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 This time junior Brandon Brantley got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Same size as Robinson. Same home state. Same position. But not the same bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Brantley's would-be dunk with 6.3 seconds left to play was partially blocked 
by Missouri's Sammie Haley, the 7-1 center whose twin also plays for the 
Tigers. Haley got a piece of Brantley's wrist, but no one seemed to care, 
especially the referees. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with two seconds remaining, Brantley tried a game-tying three-point 
shot. He missed. So much for comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even consider that," Purdue Coach Gene Keady said. "He's his own 
man. I wish you people would quit worrying about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (3-1), which just returned from a tournament in Hawaii, was 
understandably sluggish. The Boilermakers trailed by 11 points midway through 
the first half and again in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Missouri (2-0) went cold, scoring only 10 points from the 
12-minute mark to 1:47 left in the game. Meanwhile, Purdue slipped ahead for 
the first time since shortly after tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers regained the lead with 48.5 seconds to go, but it wasn't easy. With 
one second on the shot clock, Jason Sutherland took the inbounds pass near the 
baseline, heaved and hoped. The jumper was good, which figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland, a sophomore guard from Watertown, S.D., always has had a flair for 
the dramatic. When he was in high school, Sutherland occasionally would dunk, 
hang on the rim and then, while still in the air, salute the opposing crowd. He 
even has it on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland didn't dunk Wednesday night, but he did convert the key shot of the 
game and then delivered the crucial steal moments after his baseline jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the right spot, the right time," he said.

LONG BEACH OPENS PYRAMID IN GRAND FASHION, 71-64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When they wax nostalgic about the evening at Long Beach State -- they will, 
count on it -- anyone who had anything to do with the opening of the Pyramid 
can smile a smile of success. 
</P>
<P>
 They earned it. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited opening of the university's new pyramid-shaped arena was a 
resounding smash, as Long Beach defeated Detroit Mercy, 71-64, Wednesday night 
in front of 5,021, the largest on-campus athletic crowd in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 A pregame laser show got the crowd in a festive mood -- and the team kept it 
that way. Long Beach built a 12-point first-half lead, watched it shrink to 
three and then turned on the talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, senior forward Mike Atkinson led the way in the 49ers' season 
opener. Atkinson scored 21 points on seven of 11 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed some senior leadership tonight," Atkinson said. "I had the jitters 
early on, but as soon as that first shot went down I felt great. After that, I 
was looking for my shot all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Seth Greenberg: "Mike was Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing by as many as 12 in the first half, Detroit Mercy (1-1) cut the 
lead to 44-41 when Iyapo Montgomery made two free throws with 16:34 to play. 
But the 49ers increased their defensive pressure, and led, 52-45, with 14 
minutes left on a basket by Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach regained command with 8:59 to play. An acrobatic shot under the 
basket by guard Jamie Davis gave the 49ers a 58-50 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then point guard Rasul Salahuddin brought the crowd to its feet. With 8:27 to 
play, he drove the left baseline and dunked. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson scored 13 points as the 49ers took a 42-32 halftime lead. Atkinson 
gave Long Beach its first lead in the Pyramid, 20-19, by making two free throws 
with 9:33 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Atkinson, who led the nation in field-goal percentage last season, 
was at his best near the basket. His teammates got him the ball in the post and 
Atkinson made four of five shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Mercy was led by senior point guard Michael Jackson, who scored 14 
points.

<P>
 Arizona defeated Loyola Marymount, 15-13, 9-15, 15-6, 15-13, in the first 
round of the NCAA tournament in Tucson, Ariz., on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions led by at least three points in each game, but could not hold off 
the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth game, the Lions (19-10) jumped to a 4-0 lead, but the Wildcats 
won the next five points, extended their lead to 9-6, and later won the final 
six points to close out the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitter Kim Blankenship had 12 kills for the Lions. Mardell Wrensch 
added 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very young team," Coach Steve Stratos said. "We played well in the 
first two games. We were putting pressure on the Wildcats for most of the 
match." NAIA 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific cruised to an easy, 15-9, 15-2, 15-9 victory over St. Vincent 
College in the first round of the NAIA Championships in Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle blocker Tiara Ainuu led the Cougar attack with 10 kills and four 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitter Stephanie Benitez contributed six kills and 11 digs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who won the NAIA championship in 1980 and advanced to the 1991 
quarterfinals, are now 11-1 all-time in tournament play. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenth-seeded Azusa Pacific (23-7) plays second-seeded St. Francis (35-8) of 
Illinois and then Hastings College (36-8) today.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; NO. 3 KENTUCKY STAVES OFF NO. 14 OHIO, 79-74 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Preseason NIT champion Ohio University ended a two-week trip by losing at 
Lexington, Ky. But the Bobcats gained the respect of Kentucky coach Rick 
Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohio U. is a great basketball team. They have Final Four potential," Pitino 
said after the No. 14-ranked Bobcats rallied from a 14-point deficit in the 
second half before losing, 79-74, to No. 3-ranked Kentucky on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrick Rhodes made a free throw and a short jumper in the final three minutes 
to help Kentucky withstand the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Delk and Walter McCarty both had 17 points for Kentucky (2-0). Ohio's 
Gary Trent, who came in averaging 25.8 points and 14.5 rebounds, had 21 points 
and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio (4-1) went on a 14-2 run to close to 66-64 on Mike Reese's three-point 
shot from the right wing with 3:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson made a three-point shot from the corner to cut the deficit to 76-73 
with 28.2 seconds left. But Anthony Epps made two free throws less than a 
second later for a five-point cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Wisconsin 61, Wis.-Green Bay 57 -- The Phoenix, who eliminated Jason 
Kidd and California from the first round of the NCAA tournament last March, 
couldn't overcome Rashard Griffith as the Badgers won at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, who scored 21 points, was nine for 13 from the floor. Griffith's 
basket with 4:12 left put Wisconsin (2-0) on top, 58-45, before the Phoenix 
used a 10-0 run to cut the lead to 58-55 with a minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin's Michael Finley missed a three-point shot with 30 seconds left, but 
the Badgers got the ball back when Ben Berlowski stepped out of bounds trying 
to save the rebound. Freshman Sean Daugherty then made two free throws with 24 
seconds left against the Phoenix (0-3). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Arkansas 103, Jackson St. 87 -- Corliss Williamson scored 10 of his 20 
points during an early 14-5 run and the Razorbacks (2-1) defeated the Tigers 
(0-4) at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Michigan State 92, Illinois-Chicago 78 -- Shawn Respert scored 18 
points and set a school record for career three-point baskets by increasing his 
total to 215 as the Spartans (1-0) defeated the Flames (0-1) at Chicago.

 No. 19 Georgetown 99, Morgan St. 63 -- Don Reid had 21 points and Allen 
Iverson added 18 as the Hoyas (1-1) defeated the Bears (0-2) at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 Virginia 94, N. Carolina A&T 50 -- Junior Burrough scored 24 points and 
the Cavaliers (2-1) scored on 22 of their first 25 possessions of the second 
half to defeat the Aggies (1-1) at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Villanova 80, Marist 59 -- Junior Kerry Kittles scored 19 points and 
surpassed the 1,000-point mark in his career to lead the Wildcats (3-1) past 
the Red Foxes (2-1) at home. OTHER GAMES

IRVINE STANDOUT UPSTAGED IN A LOSING HOMECOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The No. 1 three-point shooter in the nation from last season returned home to 
Oklahoma Wednesday night, but it certainly wasn't a victory tour. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the long-range bombs of UC Irvine's Chris Brown that wowed the crowd 
of 6,485 in the Lloyd Noble Center. It was Oklahoma forward Ryan Minor who made 
his first 10 shots, including five three-point shots, and had tied his career 
high with 30 points in the first half en route to a 36-point night in a 99-77 
victory over the Anteaters (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Minor's shooting had helped Oklahoma (2-0) to a 52-35 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys just got me the ball when I was open . . . . and I was open a lot," 
said Minor, who made 13 of 21 shots and had 15 rebounds. His 10-for-10 start 
set a Big Eight record, eclipsing the eight in a row made by Kansas' Danny 
Manning in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who grew up in Muskogee, Okla., and was playing before about 100 family 
members and friends, was frustrated by the belly-to-belly defense of Sooner 
guard John Ontjes. Brown gave his personal cheering section very little to 
applaud, scoring nine points after making one of six three-point shots and six 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really up for coming home and having a great game, really tearing it 
up," Brown said. "But they played me really well and just took me out of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine was pretty much done midway through the first half when Minor hit his 
fourth three-pointer to give Oklahoma a 33-18 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine managed to crawl back to within 11 when freshman Kevin Simmons scored 
on a layup to cut Oklahoma's lead to 60-49, but Minor, who had been held 
scoreless for the first 12 minutes of the second half, made two free throws and 
a baseline jumper and the Sooners were rolling again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had any rhythm tonight," Irvine Coach Rod Baker said, "especially in 
the first half. We just never got it going for two or three possessions in a 
row. They shot the ball extremely well and we can't allow 50 points in a half 
and expect to do very well."

NBA ROUNDUP; O'NEAL FINISHES WITH 41 AS MAGIC SETS CLUB MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orlando Magic set a franchise record with their eighth consecutive victory 
Wednesday night, beating the Sacramento Kings, 114-107, behind Shaquille 
O'Neal's 41 points in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an accomplishment, but we can't lose sight of the fact that we have an 
extremely difficult month of December in front of us," Magic Coach Brian Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anfernee Hardaway added 23 points and 11 assists for Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond led the Kings with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic broke it open with a 10-0 burst in a second quarter in which they 
made 15 of 22 shots (68 percent), taking a 66-52 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 118, Phoenix 105 -- Scottie Pippen scored 35 points on 13-for-17 
shooting and the Bulls withstood a late surge in Chicago to end the Suns' 
four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt good right from the start offensively," said Pippen, who also had nine 
rebounds, six assists and five steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley, making only his second start of the season, led the Suns with 
22 points, but made only six of 14 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "The free throws were big and I missed six or seven of those and that was 
terrible," said Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 109, San Antonio 100 -- Gary Payton scored 21 points and the 
SuperSonics overcame David Robinson's 42 points to win their fourth consecutive 
game in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 118, Detroit 115 -- Dino Radja scored 26 points and the Celtics 
survived a late three-point barrage by the Pistons in getting above .500 for 
the first time this season in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons made five three-point shots in 1:07 to close a 110-100 deficit to 
116-115 with six seconds remaining. Dominique Wilkins then made two free throws 
to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 105, Miami 87 -- Larry Johnson scored 23 points and the Heat led 
only once -- after the opening basket -- as the Hornets won easily in 
Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson just missed posting the Hornets' first triple-double of the season, 
getting 10 rebounds and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies have a three-month extension on 
the scheduled Dec. 1 installment of their expansion fees because the NBA has 
not reached a new collective bargaining agreement. . . . Dennis Scott, who 
missed the first 11 games of the season with a lower back strain, came off 
Orlando's injured list.

NEW POWER PLAYS IN FAMILY COURT; DIVORCE: A GROWING NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO WERE 
ONCE MARRIED TO INFLUENTIAL MEN ARE CHALLENGING A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT THEY SAY 
CHEATS THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Shirley Kirsten tells it, her divorce over the past few years has been less 
a dissolution of marriage than a postmodern version of the 1944 film 
"Gaslight." 
</P>
<P>
 Her psychiatrist husband, she has alleged in court, falsely labeled her 
psychotic, coerced her into a seven-week hospital stay and forced Prozac down 
her throat. 
</P>
<P>
 She claimed in an interview that in the ensuing divorce and custody dispute, 
her husband used his credentials and influence to sway the medical and legal 
professionals in Fresno. (Neither he nor his attorney responded to interview 
requests.) 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the Ingrid Bergman character, Kirsten -- a concert pianist -- 
taught herself legal procedures and sued her husband and the hospital. She 
spoke to the press. She went on "Sally Jessy Raphael." 
</P>
<P>
 The divorce is now final but the custody dispute is ongoing. She remains in 
the family's six-bedroom home with their six children, she said. The hospital 
settled but she lost the battery and defamation suit against her husband, who 
claimed he was only trying to help her with her delusions and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Kirsten sees herself as the moral victor. The point, she said, 
is that while many traditional women divorcing powerful men might walk away in 
tears, "This community saw someone fight back." 
</P>
<P>
 She is among a growing number of women formerly married to doctors, attorneys, 
judges, entrepreneurs and celebrities who are challenging a family law system 
they say still functions according to the old saw, "He who has the gold makes 
the rules." They say this bias cheats them out of money and property, and 
damages their relationship with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're angry," she said. "We're doing stuff about our cases. We're not just 
crying in our pillows." 
</P>
<P>
 In organizing other Fresno wives, Kirsten is following the example of the 
growing Alliance for Divorce and Marriage Reform, a 4-year-old support group 
based in La Jolla, where emotions still run high over the case of socialite and 
convicted murderer Betty Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle-aged homemaker had been losing a bitter legal dispute over property 
and custody of their children with her ex-husband, Dan Broderick, a prominent 
San Diego attorney, when she shot and killed him and his new wife in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance co-founder Ronnie Brown said many members, including some men, can 
relate to Broderick's anger and frustration over a perceived lack of justice in 
family court -- a legal outpost where they say judges are rarely held 
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said alliance members don't condone the Broderick shooting. But, she 
added, "The legal and judicial system in this town bears a large responsibility 
for that tragedy. . . . There are some honest attorneys out there who say she 
got a bum rap (in family court)." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly in smaller cities and towns, she and others said, family court 
decisions seem to be based less on the law than on gender bias, good-ol'-boy 
back-scratching, and the ability to pay for aggressive attorneys and 
sympathetic psychologists. 
</P>
<P>
 The group claims a mailing list of 400, mostly full-time homemakers, and a 
chapter in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Task forces in 21 states -- composed of judges, lawyers and social scientists 
appointed by states' chief justices -- have found disproportionate gender bias 
in family law, affecting women more often than men, said New York attorney Lynn 
Hecht Schafran, who directs a national program to promote judicial equity for 
men and women, sponsored by the National Assn. of Women Judges and the National 
Organization for Women. Nineteen others are studying the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not new, just more openly discussed, Schafran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now people talk about it all the time," she said. "But it isn't getting any 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 She said complaints of injustice are particularly common in smaller towns, 
where the power base comprises people who "all hold hands." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In California, family court is part of the Superior Court system, handling 
divorce, child custody, child support and any other issue related to the 
breakdown of a family. The structure varies from state to state; last summer 
the American Bar Assn. supported a motion to consolidate all such matters under 
a family court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing frustration in several cities is reflected in the installation of 
metal detectors in family court and the rising number of people representing 
themselves, now 40% in Southern California, said Janet Bowermaster, professor 
of law at California Western School of Law in San Diego and a consultant to 
women's rights activists. In Santa Barbara, judges have been given bulletproof 
vests. "We're close to crisis level," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While divorced men have gained attention recently by protesting what they say 
are custody and support biases against them, the ex-wives of prominent men talk 
of never-ending legal battles with controlling husbands who hide assets and use 
tactical delays to wear them down financially and emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego attorney Sharron Voorhees, chair of the family law advisory 
commission to the State Bar of California, said some high-powered men 
manipulate their assets in anticipation of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, she said, a man reduced his annual income from $3 million to 
$400,000 by restructuring his business loan to make higher payments. "Then, of 
course, he was awarded the interest in the business," she said. The wife was 
awarded spousal support, which is subject to modification at any time. "He's 
totally in control of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond losing money, Voorhees said the affluent longtime homemakers experience 
a "psychological undertow" of lost identity marked by dramatic drops in status 
and lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Waggoner, founder of the Denver chapter of the alliance, said she has 
watched the divorced women in her affluent neighborhood move out with their 
children into small apartments. "When I run into them at school functions, 
they're exhausted, they've worked all day and taken care of the kids at night. 
Now they're trying to come back to school in the evening to hear the orchestra 
concert. They look tired. I'm watching them get old -- old in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 One Alliance member, a mother of two school-age boys, said she is facing 
eviction and taking church handouts while her ex-husband, a developer and civic 
leader, is donating to charity and taking expensive vacations. They are 
fighting for custody and her share of what she says was once a $2-million 
business. "I get so frustrated, I end up crying all the time. It's abusive, 
what he's doing to us. Lying all the time. He doesn't send support. I don't 
have an attorney to represent me." 
</P>
<P>
 Another member said she is now seeking her sixth attorney in 11 years to 
settle a dispute with her ex-husband, a physician, over his pension and 
profit-sharing plan. Meanwhile, she said she has applied for food stamps and 
has no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most wrenching stories involve accusations of child abuse. While some 
accusations that arise in custody disputes are indeed false, some mothers said 
judges have sided with abusive husbands, awarding them custody on grounds that 
the mothers trumped up the accusations and alienated the children from their 
fathers. Moreover, they said the judges ordered records to be sealed, or gag 
orders on the mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 One 44-year-old mother said that after she ended a brief marriage to an 
abusive attorney, he was awarded custody of her son even though he was not the 
biological father. She said she is now $80,000 in debt and homeless. The judge, 
her ex-husband and the court-appointed attorney he paid for were "in cahoots," 
all agreeing she had brainwashed the child into thinking he was molested, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found me guilty of abusing my child without arresting me or having a 
trial," she said. "I'm going ballistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Harrington, national director of the Washington, D.C.-based American 
Fathers Coalition, said there is "partial truth" what the alliance says on 
economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any type of high-income client can manipulate the court system to their 
advantage if they are willing to spend the money to reach that goal. The other 
party is at a definite disadvantage," he said, noting that those cases are in 
the minority. But, he said, "courts tend to favor mothers in custody and 
child-abuse claims, where high-income men are just as easily derailed as 
low-income men." 
</P>
<P>
 In regular meetings, the groups of activist divorcees are helping each other 
with support, information on court procedure, and names of judges and attorneys 
to be avoided. Alliance co-founder Ronnie Brown often accompanies women to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Kirsten, represent themselves in court and teach others how to 
take depositions and file briefs. As her own attorney, Kirsten said she 
questioned her ex-husband on the stand for eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Another judicial activist, Cindy Hart of Santa Barbara, has been representing 
herself for two years in her divorce settlement and has become a force behind a 
drive to unseat Superior Court Judge Bruce Dodds. "He (said) in court, 'All I 
have to do is look at her to see if she had psychological problems' and I 
walked out of his courtroom with a psychological ruling," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging in an interview that he might appear insensitive at times, Dodds 
affirmed that he found Hart had a mental disability: "After listening to her, 
it was clear she had some psychological, emotional problems." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, he said litigants find themselves in family court through a 
"self-selecting process. We see the ones who have problems. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Many litigants come in seeking vindication, Dodds said, but civil courts deal 
only in financial resolutions. "We turn people's sorrow into dollars and 
cents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodds, recently re-elected, said confidentiality requirements prevent him from 
commenting at length on a report in the Santa Barbara News-Press that he is 
being investigated by the state Commission on Judicial Performance for judicial 
misconduct. But, he said, "There are no allegations relating to Cindy Hart," or 
a second woman who complained that Dodds minimized the sexual molestation of 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
 An American Bar Assn. official said family court reforms are necessary, but 
would be superficial and would not address the real problem: the inherent 
emotion and trauma in a contentious divorce. "When a man and a woman break up a 
relationship, all hell breaks loose," said attorney Raymond Trombadore, chair 
of the ABA's professional discipline committee. 
</P>
<P>
 An ABA report, following a series of national public hearings in 1989 and 
1990, concluded that most charges of bias and injustice were individual, based 
on perception, and not systemic. "I don't doubt people come out of this system 
with tremendously bruised sensitivities," he said. But "it's the bitterness, 
the rage of those two people which produces the result, not the court, not the 
lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance member Lori Graham of Del Mar replied, "I think they want to protect 
their own. The system itself is incestuous. The (Bar Assn.'s) highest income 
earners are family law attorneys. . . . The system itself creates trauma. It's 
pure vampirism." 
</P>
<P>
 Both agreed a new system would help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe what we need to do is ask whether we ought to be in this business in 
the first place," Trombadore said. "Maybe these people ought to be turned over 
to a more predictable, less conflict-laden system so they don't use the system 
to generate all this Sturm and Angst. " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, NOW's Schafran said, "Women have to be much more savvy about the 
system. Women have to be much more independent about their finances. Women who 
chose to stay home are making a perfectly respectable, wonderful choice. They 
should know the risk they run in making that choice."

BREAKING THE BOUNDARIES OF RACE; SUSAN STRAIGHT'S STORIES ABOUT BLACK LIFE 
CAPTURE EVERYDAY DETAILS OF PAIN AND TRIUMPH. SO WHY THE HEATED DEBATE OVER HER 
NOVELS? ALTHOUGH SHE WRITES ABOUT A WORLD SHE KNOWS, SUSAN STRAIGHT IS WHITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wind's up. The hot air feels dry enough to snap -- as brittle as a twig. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs most Southern Californians know how to read all too well. Time to scan 
the skies, the scrubby hills gone blond. Water the roof instead of the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening pages of Susan Straight's latest novel, "Blacker Than a Thousand 
Midnights" (Hyperion, 1994), pause on the last anxious hours of Southern 
California's fire season and protagonist Darnell Tucker's jumble of worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Torn between the drama and danger of the flames, and the even more keyed-up 
suspense of just what awaits him at home, Darnell daydreams: "(Brenda) was 
going to show big soon -- her stomach swelling. The mass of fear grew hard in 
his stomach again. Different from fire-scared. . . . But this panic, that 
yesterday's fire was the last, that he'd be home in Rio Seco for good." 
</P>
<P>
 For Darnell, this notion is more terrifying than stepping into a wildfire. 
"Midnights" follows Darnell's journey toward manhood, watching his friends fall 
out of step around him -- victims of the street, the police, of their own poor 
decisions. Living day-to-day, making something out of nothing, presents a far 
more formidable challenge for a black man in this corner of California. Being a 
young man with dreams and being a young black man with dreams are two very 
different things, Darnell understands -- especially when it comes to realizing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the slow pan of an eloquent camera, Susan Straight illustrates, with 
seen-it-all precision, the minute details and minor triumphs within Darnell's 
world: a young black man, determined, with a dream. The loneliest of loners, a 
nature boy -- "not normal for a brotha," chide his partners -- Darnell wants to 
make his own way, on his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darnell is the door through which we discover Susan Straight. She refuses to 
be put in a box, with the same quiet vehemence her fictional creation does. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone perusing Straight's work in a bookstore, then flipping to her photo on 
the flyleaf, might ask: Just how can Susan Straight presume to know the inner 
world of a young black man? Seeing as she's a woman. More audaciously, seeing 
as she is white. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a benign proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go (to read) I'm scared," she says without a trace of fear. "I 
have to be. 'Cause look at me! And this time, you know, I was reading about a 
guy. So I had to stand up there and read this section about Darnell . . . and I 
thought: 'If you're not supposed to cross any line, I just crossed two of 
them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The author of two other books chronicling black life -- the story collection 
"Aquaboogie" (Milkweed Editions, 1990) and the novel "I Been in Sorrow's 
Kitchen and Licked Out All the Pots" (Hyperion, 1992) -- Straight would prefer 
to linger in the background. She relishes the chance to talk about Darnell's 
world -- the fictional Inland Empire town of Rio Seco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then," she cracks in her soft voice, a smile starting at the corners of her 
mouth, but not quite materializing, "we never have to talk about me, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 In stone-washed denim shorts, matching sleeveless shirt and sandals, Straight, 
34, settles down in her sunny breakfast room in the Riverside home she shares 
with her high-school sweetheart and husband of 10 years, Dwayne Simms, and 
their two daughters, Gaila, 5, and Delphine, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riverside native, Straight's roots are sunk deep here. Her mother, Gail 
Watson, a hard-working Swiss immigrant "of peasant stock," raised Straight and 
her two brothers single-handedly. The neighborhood in which she came of age 
offered one of those classic, however difficult to maintain, Southern 
California backdrops where children of various races coexist with little 
fanfare or incident. Not to sugarcoat nor melodramatize, Straight simply fell 
in, made friends -- many of whom were black, including her future husband. 
Nowadays, despite the daily nettling concerns of her extended family -- which 
largely inform her work -- the life around her flourisher, a culturally lush 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone tells stories, almost legends, about people and cars and events," 
she writes in "Aquaboogie's" author's note. "I've heard them for so many years 
that I wanted my stories to be on paper instead of only in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Straight, who is an assistant professor of English at UC Riverside and 
periodically leads writing workshops at the California Youth Authority, 
considers herself a full-time mother. The writing, although spiritually 
all-encompassing, takes a back seat to her family, household chores, major and 
minor disturbances around the home. Straight waits for the silent hours at the 
end of the day to lean over her typewriter and stretch out inside her world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be able to stay up till 2 or 3 in the morning and get up at 6 or 7. 
Now somebody wakes up and they're sick. And then somebody drunk goes by on the 
sidewalk maybe around 3. . . . It's hard to be on a straight line forward and 
marshal your thoughts and say, 'Well, this is what I'm going to do tonight,' 
cause somebody's coughing in there." 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be the quintessential writer's life. But, Straight allows, it will 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 In person, she appears much younger, shyer than the glamour-shot author photos 
-- her freckled face scrubbed clean, pale blue eyes slightly obscured behind 
glasses. The thoughtful high-school daydreamer profile. She's not quite the 
face one might immediately put to the persona behind these intense and 
intensive narrative works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From early composition classes to graduate-school fiction workshops, aspirants 
are often strongly advised: Write what you know.  
</P>
<P>
 Straight has done just that. An animus inhabits the machinery of Rio Seco -- 
from the lilt of the speech and the scent of hair-grease right down to 
"brothamans" and the "hellafines" -- without a trace of outsiderness or being 
forced. More essential, she has conveyed the often difficult-to-articulate 
feelings, the slow-simmer, the subtle though daily last-straw moments: 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't even see that red Chevy truck who was going first at the stop sign, 
and braked the El Camino hard. A white guy with reddish-blond eyebrows leaned 
out the open window and said, Damn nigger! Before he jerked his wheel and sped 
around the El Camino . . . Darnell's eye, his forehead, rang with anger. . . . 
Why I gotta be a nigger. Why can't I be an asshole, or blind. A new daddy? A 
jerk?" 
</P>
<P>
 But even though it is Straight's world, her writing about it has been much to 
the confusion and consternation of many she has encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequent question, often lodged rhetorically, is whether or not 
Straight "can do that." To some -- black, white or other -- it smacks of 
cultural appropriation. For years people of color have felt the sting of having 
their stories half-told, mis-told or told for the profit of others, if told at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Daniel James, who was white, assumed the fictional persona Danny 
Santiago to "authenticate" his 1983 novel of an East L.A. Chicano youth, 
"Famous All Over Town." James shocked friends and enraged critics when he 
revealed his deception a year later. The book won a literary award but created 
a brouhaha that still echoes -- just who is qualified to write about whom? 
</P>
<P>
 For Straight, the circumstances are starkly different. "I'm not going to walk 
around pretending I'm black. You can't be who you're not. I know that people 
try on each other's cultures, but to truly know someone is not to walk around 
and pretend you are Ice Cube." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly living it and publicly writing about it, however, are two very 
different endeavors. At USC, after being a sportswriter for the Daily Trojan, 
Straight came to fiction in creative writing class. At first, "I tried to write 
like everybody else," she recalls, but eventually her Riverside influences 
began to seep into the prose. 
</P>
<P>
 The "acceptability" of her subject matter, which had barely lifted an eyebrow 
in college, in graduate school at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst 
was fervently debated. "There were no black students . . . no black faculty."  
</P>
<P>
 Once there, Straight made a beeline to Prof. Jay Neugeboren, whose novel "Big 
Man" framed a black basketball player as its protagonist.  
</P>
<P>
 "I gave him (my story) 'Safe Hooptie.' There was other work on the back. He 
looked at it and said: 'What are you, poor? You can't afford paper?' And I 
said: 'Yeah, you got a problem with that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks aside, Neugeboren became Straight's champion, teaching her how to prune 
and tuck -- to sharpen the focus. 
</P>
<P>
 She happened into other glimmers of inspiration: thought-shapers such as James 
Baldwin and Julius Lester. But in the writing workshop, the atmosphere starkly 
differed. When she wasn't fed up, Straight found herself amused by the 
assumptions: "Oh, she's blond, she's from California. She's going to be dumb 
and she's going to write about surfers." 
</P>
<P>
 Her stories threw them for quite a different loop. "I turned in my Darnell 
stories. And they would say: 'What are you doing writing about this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cinderella success certainly didn't lay in wait outside the classroom either. 
"Those stories (in 'Aquaboogie') were really hard to sell. I would send them 
out and people would say: 'This is fascinating stuff, but I'm afraid it's a 
little rough for us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Riverside, with Dwayne juggling job and school, the Simms family got 
by the best they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was teaching at Job Corps full-time. Teaching refugees (English as a Second 
Language) in the evening," says Straight as Gaila wanders in and scrambles onto 
her mother's knees. "Dwayne and I were doing clean-up jobs, hauling everything 
to the dump." 
</P>
<P>
 At some point the writing ceased. No crevice of time to compose thoughts. No 
encouragement in the mail. But in 1988, on a wager from Neugeboren, Straight 
reluctantly sent a couple of stories out to literary magazines, including 
TriQuarterly -- which snatched two of them up almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Milkweed National Fiction Prize and publication of the collection moved 
Straight out of the shadows. Hyperion Editor Pat Mulcahy quickly signed her to 
a two-book deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it had tremendous emotional power as well as literary quality," 
Mulcahy says. "Many young writers today don't have a community of people to 
write about. And Susan is following an American tradition that isn't as 
prevalent as when Faulkner was writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Her reviews have been solid, but Mulcahy was surprised by the 
sometimes-hostile reaction Straight has received in an occasional think piece 
or at readings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I supposed that I was a little naive about it. I thought it was especially 
interesting that she's white, that she can write within the culture. I just 
thought other people would accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the debate heats up, the Straight-as-curio scenario rears its head most 
often. The fact that she is white (and in this context an exotic), the wary of 
varying races speculate, places her work at the top of the pile in editors' 
offices, maybe on a film producer's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most black people come at it with a natural suspicion. 'How does she know? Is 
she someone who can tell our story?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall . . . black people give her a chance more than white liberals," 
Mulcahy says. "Once they read the work, and get to know a little more about 
Susan as a person, they know she's not a tourist. She's no lightning rod, she's 
just Susan." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Race is its own conductor. And Straight finds herself at the center 
of a storm that still furiously works its will. 
</P>
<P>
 Debates over appropriation and accountability rage. "White adults in 
literature and the arts have demonstrated an . . . anthropological-like 
interest in affairs of black folks," wrote Quinn Eli in "White Authors Cash In 
on Black Themes" last year in Emerge magazine. Eli takes to task such writers 
as Richard Price ("Clockers") and Mary Ann Rogan ("A Heartbeat Away") for 
insensitive portrayals and "arrogant" defense (in the case of Rogan) of their 
endeavors. Although Eli recognizes Straight's formidable powers as a 
storyteller, and as a soul who too bears witness, "Nevertheless, her book is no 
less privileged a book than (Price's and Rogan's). This one . . . received 
widespread attention from reviewers and literary pundits that equally 
compelling books by black writers are rarely afforded. . . . This means that 
although she's a writer of phenomenal talent, it is only incidental to her 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it smarts, Straight understands the impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I know this looks funny," she says, earnestly, arms outstretched, in her 
straight-from-the-hip manner. "It looks funny to me, you know? And the hardest 
part is that if I keep writing about the same things, and I keep looking the 
same way . . . (I) have to keep answering the questions." 
</P>
<P>
 She shares bookstore vignettes like war stories: "The funniest was in 
Philadelphia. This white woman stood up and said: 'How can you write about a 
black woman and you have blond hair?' Then a black woman stood up said: "I love 
the book, she did a great job, and I think you should sit down.' So I was going 
like whoa, can we just move on? I don't wanna go there." 
</P>
<P>
 But James Fugate, co-owner of Inglewood's Eso Won Books, says although he 
thought it might happen, his customers haven't taken issue with Straight's 
race. "I think people knew her from ('Sorrow's Kitchen') and didn't care at 
all. She's a more serious literature writer than some of the work available. 
That's always good. Especially in the black community, we get inundated with 
trash. I would like to see more serious novels published about our experience. 
And I think she is dealing with some serious themes." 
</P>
<P>
 One theme Straight finds more intriguing is the manner in which cultures don't 
blend in Southern California. "They really do mix as far as fashion and music . 
. . and yet it's one of the most segregated places in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of segregation only enforces stereotypes -- rigidly defined boxes. 
"I have lots of friends who would like to do things, and people would say, 
'Man, you can't do that kind of stuff, you're a brother.' And it's so hard to 
only have this big a box that you're supposed to fit in. I think that is always 
what I am looking at. Always writing about what people's box is." 
</P>
<P>
 It's evident she'll always be turning hers inside out. Or messily spilling out 
of its confines. Despite the pressure and consequences from without, she has 
little reason nor inspiration to shift gears. Nor to write about her place 
within these worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her next book will chronicle the story of a family from the Tulsa riots in 
1921 to L.A.'s urban upheaval in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went on the trip for Darnell's book," Straight says, "at black 
bookstores people said they were tired of reading about pathologies. They were 
tired of everything having to be so violent, so criminal to be a black story. 
They said what they like about Darnell was that it was about what they called a 
'normal brother.' The guys who are going to work, and coming home and doing an 
ordinary thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody pays attention to the fathers who stick around. It's always: the lost 
black father. I think nobody pays attention to the ordinary black father, 
whether he's 50, or 70 or 20." 
</P>
<P>
 It's far from exotic, Straight maintains. "We all sit in Dwayne's father's 
driveway, 50 or 60 of us at a time, at a party or something, and we all laugh. 
'Cause you would never read about somebody like us. Not about what we eat, or 
what we talk about, or what we do or anything like that," says Straight, 
peering out the window, past the garden, at the light retreating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has worked hard today, or done what they had to do. And everybody 
sits around and talks. They talk about politics, and they talk about beer, and 
they talk about the weather. And it's ordinary. And to me, that's the good 
life."

 Jeffrey Dahmer and a lawyer arrive at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter says, "Now

 "So what did you do?" he asks Dahmer. "I killed 17 people and ate them," 
Dahmer replies. "You were pretty bad," says St. Peter, "you'll have to serve a

 Then he asks the lawyer, "And what did you do?"

 The lawyer looks nervous and says, "I don't remember, and I plead insanity."

 Leaving for work one morning, reader Peter Harmer of Santa Barbara informed 
son Alexander, 4, that he would be attending a televised workshop on a local 
cable channel. Pointing to a spot directly on the screen with his finger, 
Harmer informed his son that he would be "in the television later," and that if 
the boy watched carefully, he would see him. Alexander started to cry, asking 
his father:

BY DESIGN; THE SECRET OF THEIR SUCCESS; DONNA KARAN AND HER HUSBAND 'GOT 
TOGETHER THROUGH A PASSION AND GREW A BUSINESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Karan and her husband, Stephan Weiss, are seated across from one another 
in a Hollywood restaurant. Her long slender fingers are wrapped around a 
"cleansing" cup of hot water spiced with lemon. His hands rest on the table, 
ready at any moment, it seems, to reach out to touch the woman he repeatedly 
says he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 She is an animated speaker, wrinkling her nose, flashing her blue eyes, 
tossing her long, shiny brunet ponytail. His silver ponytail stays close to the 
nape of his neck as he jokes, teases or turns somber statesman, carefully 
choosing words such as passion , which they both use in sentences loaded with 
verbal caresses. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of checking out local Nordstrom cosmetic counters, the couple are 
plodding on with a series of interviews before attending a party to thank the 
troops and rally them for more action. Two weeks ago, Nordstrom launched DK Men 
on the West Coast and, a store representative says, it has joined the women's 
fragrance, Donna Karan New York, as one of the chain's top five performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, co-chief executive officer of the company and part-time sculptor, 
designed the throttle-shaped black glass and gun metal bottle. The scent inside 
is equally masculine -- inspired by the smells of a New York tobacco shop, race 
cars and a scrap of chamois-soft suede. Just as Karan's signature perfume is 
said to be inspired by the aroma of red suede and the back of Weiss' neck. 
</P>
<P>
 To Karan, Weiss is more than just a sexy neck; he is her muse and soul mate. 
Describing their 10-year marriage and professional life, she says: "It's two 
people who got together through a passion and grew a business that's quite 
wonderful. Certainly, he's my inspiration for everything I've designed in 
menswear. And when I think about my women's clothes, I have to tell you I think 
about him -- what he likes, what he doesn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I depend on him for a lot," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The past two years have been difficult for them both, he adds, alluding to 
press criticism of the company's finances, which followed an aborted public 
offering last year. Things have settled down now. They recently obtained 
refinancing for the next 4 1/4 years, Weiss says, "which secures the growth of 
the company going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Combining work and marriage has its ups and downs, says Karan: "The pros are 
that you're building a baby together and it's very consuming. And it's nice to 
know your husband is involved in it because you share the pleasures and the 
pain. On the other hand, it makes it difficult because you'd like to escape it 
some time." 
</P>
<P>
 They work hard at achieving a balance. They have offices on different floors 
of their Seventh Avenue headquarters, rarely leave the house together or lunch 
together. When they connect in the evening, he is usually the one, he says, who 
calls a halt if they "drift into some work conversation. I'll either say, 'I'm 
leaving the room,' or 'You can come hug me.' Or 'Let's think or talk about 
something else.' Or we'll meditate and clear ourselves that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Karan, 46, calls them complex, private people who are not terribly social. 
They share a love of the outdoors and their combined family (she has a daughter 
from a previous marriage, he has a son, daughter and three grandchildren). 
Weiss, 56, lauds her "sometimes frightening" energy level. She praises his 
intelligence. He raves about her creativity. She commends his artistic 
expression and his self-discipline, calling him "the most centered person I 
know." And she, he says, "is my best friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Karan's reverence for Weiss' opinions, she reduced her long hair to 
almost a buzz cut just one day after they were married. "Because she felt 
secure," he teases. She says it happened because she was feeling "old and 
dowdy" on a shoot where all the models had short hair. To please him, she spent 
two years growing it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Tops on her list of ways to keep romance burning is a whiff of the men's 
fragrance (friend Liam Neeson is the voice on the commercial). But Weiss 
objects to her flip retort and suggests that "there might be some small other 
issue -- like hard work and recommitment." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, they move out to meet another journalist, then on to the party 
where guests surround them, treating them like celebrities and asking for 
autographs. When it comes time to address the crowd (all dressed in black, as 
one amazed waitress points out), Karan is quick to say what has been on her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her own youthful appearance and trendy outfit -- black coat, skirt and 
tank top worn with bare legs and high-heeled suede ankle boots -- she is amazed 
by the age level in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel intimidated, and I'm rarely intimidated. Everyone looks so young. I 
feel like your mother," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look great," shouts a woman, drawing a round of enthusiastic applause. 
Karan moves on to the issue at hand, the fragrance, and suggests every woman 
give it to her significant other, saying: "Yes, it does work." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss chimes in dramatically: "Yes, it does." Whistles everywhere, followed by 
more applause. Karan apologizes for not getting to every Nordstrom store in the 
vicinity. In response, as the 30-second commercial repeats and repeats, a woman 
in the back of the room puts the capper on the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donna, we love you," she calls out, bringing down the house.

BY DESIGN; Q & A: ELSA PERETTI; CREATING IS HER PASSION. THE TIFFANY DESIGNER 
IS FAMOUS FOR HER JEWELRY, BUT SHE ALSO THINKS BIG. AS IN . . . SHE'S RESTORED 
BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN SAJBEL / SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jewelry designer Elsa Peretti's deep voice comes across the phone like honey. 
She's calling from Italy, where she has a home in Rome and another in a 
13th-Century tower by the sea at Porto Ercole. "The farther you go, the better 
you hear. It's amazing," she remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Peretti will arrive in Los Angeles today as an honored guest of "Divine Design 
'94," a Sunday night gala benefiting the AIDS charities Project Angel Food and 
DIFFA. Designer Richard Tyler, broadcaster Elsa Klensch, director Tim Burton 
and interior designer Rose Tarlow will also be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Peretti, 54, is also celebrating her 20th anniversary as a designer for 
Tiffany & Co. Among her best-known works are fluid necklaces and earrings 
shaped like hearts and beans, diamonds by the yard and a wide range of objects 
for the table. The ubiquitous Halston perfume bottle is also hers. The Tiffany 
designs, priced from $50 to $29,000, are second only to engagement rings in 
sales, ringing up close to $80 million worldwide annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Peretti talks about coming to Los Angeles, her work, her time spent in 
New York and her museum in the small Spanish village of Sant Marti Vell, where 
she has restored 10 buildings since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How long has it been since you've visited Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: A long time. In fact, the last time I was there, I was in a very nice 
health farm called Pritikin in Santa Monica. I will ask my companion, Stefano, 
how long it's been. . . . At least 10 years ago. We rented a car and went up 
and down the coast, which was fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you say yes to this event? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A big friend of mine, Berry Berenson, asked me. And I think it's a very 
good cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your museum is filled with a mix of art and common objects. An Andy Warhol 
painting is next to a collection of bird cages. What was the guiding principal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To show what gave me inspiration. And also mix it up with my American life. 
Andy was very near me in those years in America. The bird cages were also very 
near me because each time I was traveling to the Orient, I bought bird cages, 
with the birds inside. I was working a lot in Hong Kong and was very lonely in 
the hotel. I always had my birds. Bird cages are nothing of incredible value, 
but I like them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The American artists and designers represented in the museum were your 
close friends during your years as a model and later as a designer. It's sad to 
see that so many -- Warhol, Halston, Giorgio di Sant'Angelo -- have died. 
</P>
<P>
 A: You got the point. It's terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your life like now without these friends? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I feel very lonely. Now I have very few friends left. I cannot even think 
about it. I really miss them. We were working together and showing my things 
with their things. It was really fantastic. I always learned by that. Now I see 
another type of friends who are very different from the people I was used to 
seeing, the designers. I feel a little alien, because they are people with 
children. Seeing the people I saw without wives was very different. We were 
talking jewelry, talking material, talking shapes, talking colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you still have an apartment in New York? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. That was Halston's apartment a long time ago. New York is very good to 
touch base. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have said, "I'm not very productive." The opposite seems true. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've been productive for 15, 16 years. I made a lot of designs with a lot 
of care. I don't have the feeling that I need to add a lot to my collection, 
because I have an incredibly wide range of things. This is a part of the secret 
of my things, that they are still valid. When I feel a need, I do something 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you been designing much lately? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For me, to put together my museum and all my remembrances was a big effort 
mentally, physically and monetarily. I pushed myself very hard. Now I am in 
need of new gasoline, like a car. Maybe from Los Angeles, I'll just take a 
month off and go to someplace where I can be on a beach and be with my 
companion and just scribble and pick up rocks and do the stupid things that for 
me are very good. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What of your own jewelry do you wear? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Now, a belt with a silver heart, a little pair of platinum heart earrings 
and a little Madonna around my neck that I've had for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've talked about designing jewelry for older women. Are you still 
thinking about this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, just small, platinum things. I keep my hair gray, so I like silver and 
platinum. For women who dye their hair, they can wear whatever they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Other than color and small size, what makes something right for an older 
woman? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Young people can wear anything or nothing or small things. Older women do 
need a little help. My advice is to wear something very light, very wearable, 
of a noble material. For an older woman, always, the reflection of a certain 
light near your ear is very important. Of course, you can have a diamond of 4 
carats, which is very happy. Or you can have a piece of good silver. For 
example, my comma earrings give such a good light to the face that it helps an 
older woman. Every time I have those earrings on I give them away. I'm without 
them now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has success taught you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The best thing is that people are still wearing my things. The success is 
not my success, but the success of my pieces. That's important. I am my 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Sant Marti Vell is also an embodiment of your success. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have the satisfaction of putting a lot of what I earn at Tiffany into 
that, creating another thing. Sant Marti Vell was in ruins. It was a great 
satisfaction that my success and the money were used for a good cause. Not 
personal pleasure, not having children, not having a family. My personal 
pleasure was doing good with what I have. I think I have a family in the people 
working on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the area of personal pleasures, you once joked that the essential 
elements of a good life were good beds and an abundance of bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Laughs) When I arrived in Sant Marti Vell, there was not a bathroom. The 
first champagne popped with my people was when finally we had a bathroom in 
that house.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: COBB SPORTED IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Movie: "Cobb." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Baseball great Tyrus Raymond Cobb (Tommy Lee Jones, pictured) 
reflects on his career as his personally anointed biographer (Robert Wuhl) 
listens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Ruth Carter, whose credits include "What's Love Got to 
Do With It," "Malcom X," "Do the Right Thing" and "School Daze." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Cobb's sporting nature shines through long after his baseball days 
are over. Seen here near the end of his life in 1960, he is a hunter and a 
gambler. At his Nevada mountain lodge, the well-to-do Cobb, who had a personal 
valet, surfaces in beige gabardine riding pants, knee-high lace-up hunting 
boots and a snappy outdoorsman's oilcloth coat. His glen plaid pajamas feature 
flying ducks. Reno gambling scenes show him in a black three-piece pin-striped 
suit and foulard tie. "He had a great tie collection," Carter says. "He always 
wore the fashionable ties of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: For a good portion of the film, as Cobb makes the trip from Nevada to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., his clothing options are 
limited to what would have fit into a couple of suitcases. That included two 
cardigans, several cotton shirts, a few pairs of trousers, a houndstooth sport 
jacket, one suit, a dressing gown, slippers, the duck pajamas and a tuxedo 
(plus all the correct furnishings) for a black-tie dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: Jones was so involved in wardrobe details, Carter says, that 
"every time I walked into his dressing room, I felt like I had to be prepared 
for a pop quiz." The actor insisted that his character's dressing gown be made 
of burgundy cashmere with black faille lapels and gold braid trim and that his 
tuxedo shoes be velvet slippers adorned with fire-breathing dragons. He also 
insisted on aging, or breaking in, the hunting boots and outdoor jacket by 
wearing them himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: Images of baseball uniforms from 1909 to 1924 came from books at 
the Baseball Hall of Fame; Mitchell & Ness, a sports-memorabilia store in 
Philadelphia, provided original patterns for uniforms and small-billed caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Cobb's costumes were custom-made at Sony Pictures' wardrobe 
department, his shoes and boots at Willie's Shoe Repair in Hollywood. His 
outdoor jacket by Filson is from American Rag & Cie in Los Angeles. BETTY

A DIVINE TOUCH; DO YOU FEEL THE URGE TO SHOP? SATISFY IT AT A FLEA MARKET THAT

 Give an interior designer free rein and what do you get? A floor covered in 
birdseed. Crown molding made out of corrugated cardboard.A river of cracked 
mirror chips running through a dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 These are a few of the imaginative twists found in fantasy rooms and magical 
table settings created for Divine Design '94, a three-day fund-raising event 
beginning Friday at the Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the furnishings and accessories used in creating such inviting 
environs as the "Bel Air Retreat of the Vampire Lestat," "A Sleeping Porch in 
Montecito," "Barbara Hutton Trilogy: Part II" and "Medieval Madness" will be 
sold at a silent auction. But visitors can also satisfy their home-decorating 
urges at an upscale flea market, where clothing and home-decor items are priced 
at wholesale and below. A 1937 miniature marble fireplace from a Paul Williams 
house is $7,000. Pillows are tagged at $25 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion and jewelry part of the marketplace -- including a one-of-a-kind 
Christian Lacroix gown and couture pieces from Romeo Gigli, Karl Lagerfeld and 
Jean Paul Gaultier -- are all half-price. Calvin Klein, Benetton, David Dart 
and Fred Segal Flair donated enough merchandise to have their own 
mini-boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets can be purchased at the door or by calling a 24-hour hot line, (310) 
358-8000. One-day passes for Friday or Saturday are $20. A $50 three-day pass 
admits ticket-holders Sunday, too. A $250 ticket includes passes for three days 
plus dinner Sunday night. Divine Design '94 benefits DIFFA/Los Angeles and 
Project Angel Food, a volunteer group that prepares and delivers 4,000 hot 
meals weekly to men, women and children homebound with AIDS. GAILE ROBINSON

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: A REI OF LIGHT, A WHIFF OF PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An interview with Rei Kawakubo, the driving force of Comme des Garcons, is a 
polite but rigorous ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 At the sparkling new deli atop Barneys New York in Beverly Hills -- where she 
is launching her first fragrance -- neither Kawakubo nor her aides dine. 
Questions are painstakingly translated into Japanese, often by two different 
people -- to get the nuances just right. Everyone works hard to ensure Kawakubo 
understands and is understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a decade after she began turning fashion on its head, ridding it of 
artifice and proposing an alternative presentation of the self, there is 
something Kawakubo doesn't understand: the current fascination with fashion 
ideas from the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rei feels she wants to try to transcend that and bring the genders together," 
explained Kawakubo's husband, Adrian Joffe. But asked if clothing is political, 
Kawakubo draws back. "I'm not sure political is the right word," she said. 
"Clothes are a means of social expression, an expression of one's own values." 
</P>
<P>
 While perfume, she said, is a "private pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Kawakubo registered the name Comme des Garcons for a fragrance 12 years ago, 
"just in case." It wasn't until last year, though, that she submitted a 
two-page, handwritten concept of what she was after -- in a "very abstract" 
form -- to four different perfume houses, anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
 One young perfumer concocted a fragrance that matched Kawakubo's idea exactly. 
"Later, he told us he had the feeling it was for Rei," said Joffe.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Work Those Pecs: It is, they like to say in the land of lingerie, the "natural 
extension of the Wonderbra," a view that almost begs the question: What in the 
world could possibly be natural about a padded, push-up sports bra, the latest 
creation of Ventura-based Fashion Forms? 
</P>
<P>
 The extension part is easier to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 At Robinsons-May, where the Our Sports Secret line recently hit the fitting 
room, one saleswoman touted the garment's superior support system. Fashion 
Forms President Ann Deal, however, cuts straight to the point: "A lot of gals 
like to go to the gym to find a boyfriend, and it looks good . . . . It gives 
you cleavage." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, she contends, it's almost public service, cutting down on a 
certain contour confusion. "If you start with your Wonderbra in the morning and 
you go to the gym and suddenly you're flat, well, this lets you be consistent 
all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 All that and the foam pads absorb sweat too.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos and Cleavage: We weren't surprised to learn Richard Tyler has been named 
Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America. But does 
he really have to share the dais with the Wonderbra? The CFDA, which honored 
the sneaker last year, is bestowing a similar honor on Gossard's feat of 
engineering for 1994. We can hardly wait for next year's winner. 
</P>

 Men Never Make Passes . . .: Courtroom appearances are the occasion for the 
best make-overs these days. Witness the kinder, gentler Marcia Clark, the 
sweater-wearing Menendez brothers, the bespectacled Heidi Fleiss. What happened 
to the party girl who posed in an itty-bitty bikini in Vanity Fair not long 
ago? Yep, glasses make airheads look serious and glamour girls seem smart. Hey, 
Heidi, how'd that darn Pythagorean Theory go again ?

 One Store's Loss Is Our Closet's Gain: Vulture tendencies surfaced last Friday 
as we made a beeline for the I. Magnin close-out sale. (Our arms still ache.) 
Regular and sale-priced items were discounted 20%. Even so, the deals were 
bittersweet. One veteran saleswoman, overcome by the frenzy of rabid bargain 
hunters, muttered sadly: "I hate this. It isn't what I spent the last 15 years 
of my career doing." Although we sympathized, we were a teensy bit miffed when 
the saleswoman removed the nice hanger from our expensive designer jacket. Like 
they really need it now.

 Cosmetic Personae: Intellectual provocateur Camille Paglia has abandoned her 
gender-neutral guise for what looks like a bad Merle Norman make-over. You 
know, heavy on the pancake? Unfortunately, there aren't any makeup tips in 
Paglia's new book, "Vamps & Tramps." Thank heavens, then, for 
punk-rocker-turned-designer Vivienne Westwood, who certainly doesn't mind 
mixing anti-social behavior with cosmetics. In Allure, Westwood reveals why she 
makes her face look as pasty white as possible: "It's so much more 
contemptuous." Duh!

EVERYBODY'S UP FOR BIG GAME; 30,000 EXPECTED AT BIG A FOR LOS ALAMITOS-MATER 
DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the first time in years, Anaheim Stadium this week will be home to a 
football game where champions will clash, crowds will roar, beer won't flow and 
team spirit will be as plentiful as the popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Los Angeles Rams have nothing to do with it. Rather, the titans 
of Orange County high school football will meet on the grassy field Friday 
night, before one of the largest crowds to cheer a local schoolboy match. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1-ranked Los Alamitos High School collides with No. 2 Mater Dei High of 
Santa Ana in the CIF Southern Section Division I semifinal playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-anticipated "Big Game," which is expected to draw as many as 30,000 
to the Big A, has ignited pigskin passions in students, teachers, parents and 
old-fashioned football fans countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mater Dei has that Notre Dame-type following. The fans are fanatically 
loyal," said Lt. Timm Browne of the Orange Police Department, whose daughter 
Kendra is a sophomore at the private Catholic high school. "Everyone is talking 
about it. It's for bragging rights." 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Alamitos' following is equally fanatical. Their team is riding a 
47-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge game," said Joanne Diller, 41, a Seal Beach resident who 
bought six tickets Wednesday at the school. "I don't have any kids that go to 
school there or anything. I just like football and the kids play their hearts 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 At both campuses this week, when adults or kids huddle together during breaks, 
the talk turns invariably to the game. School offices report a flood of calls 
from their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest indicator of that intense interest is the venue -- the 
Big A. Originally slated for Saturday at Cerritos College, the game was moved 
to accommodate the expected crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely, however, the attendance will surpass that for the 1992 contest 
between Mater Dei and Rialto Eisenhower, which drew 33,204 to the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the hype, school officials have found it a challenge to keep students 
focused on their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to keep it low-key," said Los Alamitos Principal Carol Hart, in 
her 10th year at the school. "We have to balance football and the academics." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart admitted she has difficulty curbing her own excitement. The game is 
more than a matter of school pride for her, it's also personal. Her son, 
Brandon, is starting linebacker for the Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play a dual role as parent and principal," Hart said. "It's been great for 
our family, and this will be one of the most exciting games we've ever played. 
. . . It's been nerve-racking." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant football coach Dave Money made a similar observation about Mater 
Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can feel the electricity around campus," the Monarchs' offensive 
coordinator said. "We have anticipated this for so long. And you try to tell 
the players not to anticipate it because the press will hype it so much and 
then finally it gets here . . . it's just amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei starting quarterback John Flynn said he is out to redeem his team's 
playoff loss last year to Rialto Eisenhower: "We have been waiting for this 
since August." 
</P>
<P>
 Stellar performances by both Mater Dei and Los Alamitos have set the stage for 
Friday's gridiron classic. Both teams are unbeaten this year. They compete in 
different leagues and haven't met since 1980, when they played to a 0-0 tie. 
Los Alamitos has won three consecutive section titles (Division III in 1991, 
Division II in 1992 and '93). And Mater Dei, a perennial force in county 
football, has captured five Division I section championships, the last one in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angel Stadium is where the pros play, and so it's kind of like we are pros 
too," said Laura Mumolo, a Mater Dei senior. "It's going to be a tough game. 
We're both good." 
</P>
<P>
 (Unlike the professional games, however, alcohol will not be sold at the high 
school contest.) 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement has made Elizabeth Cover's task as pep commissioner at Los 
Alamitos fairly simple. The game has unleashed a torrent of enthusiasm, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so easy to get school spirit going for this," said Cover, a senior. "I'm 
really proud of Los Al spirit. We couldn't have any more support." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to hoisting school banners and posters at their own campuses and 
on nearby streets, students from both schools say folks should expect to see 
their signs popping up on rival turf before week's end. 
</P>
<P>
 However, all students haven't been swept away by the prospect of winning a 
football title. For his part, Mitsu Kimura had other things on his mind than 
"the big game." The Los Alamitos junior is concentrating on his wrestling match 
in the 103-pound weight class, also scheduled for Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole school revolves around football," Kimura said. "If you think about 
it, it's just a sport. It's not that big a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimura is not expecting a big turnout at his wrestling contest, even from 
fellow wrestlers. Teammate Neil Wright said he is going to forfeit his match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'm going to the football game," Wright said. Football Faceoff Here are 
profiles of the two Orange County high schools and their undefeated football 
teams, which square off Friday night at Anaheim Stadium. The winning team will 
represent Orange County in the Southern Section Division I title game next 
week. *

FIRST-CLASS POSTAGE STAMP LIKELY TO COST 32 CENTS SOON; MAIL: U.S. POSTAL 
SERVICE IS EXPECTED TO RATIFY PROPOSAL. IT WOULD COST LOCAL CONSUMERS ABOUT 
$525,000 NEXT YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 The price of a first-class postage stamp will probably rise to 32 cents next 
month, adding more than $500,000 to the cost of mailing cards, letters, 
advertising materials and packages in Orange County next year, mailing industry 
experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service is gearing up for a last-minute post-holiday rush as 
businesses scramble to do as much mailing as possible before the price 
increase, said Terri Bouffiou, spokeswoman for the Santa Ana postal district, 
the central clearinghouse for most of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on the rate hike, approved Wednesday by the independent 
Postal Rate Commission in Washington, will be made next week by the U.S. Postal 
Service board of governors. It is expected to ratify the proposal and determine 
when the new rate will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-cent increase from 29 cents, the rate in effect since 1991, means the 
average U.S. household will spend an additional $7.20 to $9 a year for stamps, 
according to the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission accepted the Postal Service request for a 32-cent first-class 
stamp but decided to shift $450 million in proposed additional revenue from 
consumers and small businesses to major mailers of advertising and newspaper 
and magazine publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service's biggest customers are businesses such as accounting and 
law firms, department stores and insurance companies, which have generally 
supported the proposed price increase because it is being accompanied by a 
promise to hold the new rate steady for three or four years, said Joseph Wirth, 
general manager of Norco Cos. in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the price goes up, this enables them to plan ahead with some 
degree of accuracy for several years, and that's valuable," said Wirth, whose 
company specializes in presorting first-class mail for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a rate increase typically helps his business because Norco serves 
small companies and can use the discounts that the Postal Service offers for 
presorted mail to woo new customers who had not previously considered 
presorting worth paying for. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service asked for a 21-cent postcard rate, but the commission cut 
it to 20 cents, which represents a penny increase. 
</P>
<P>
 For heavier letters, such as wedding invitations and large greeting cards, the 
Postal Service wanted a 25-cent rate for the second ounce. But the commission 
voted to maintain the current rate of 23 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Priority mail now costs $2.90 to ship two pounds or less. The requested rate 
was $3.20, and the commission recommended $3. Express mail, now $9.95 for an 
eight-ounce letter, had a requested rate of $10.95, which the commission 
trimmed to $10.75. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these rates are lower than the Postal Service recommended, and all 
benefit individual mailers," Edward J. Gleiman, chairman of the Postal Rate 
Commission, said at a news conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate increase endorsed by the commission would produce $4.7 billion in new 
revenue next year, giving the Postal Service a budget of nearly $55 billion. In 
Orange County, the higher rates would cost consumers about $525,000 next year, 
mailing industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wirth of Norco Cos. said that the discounts offered for presorted mail will 
probably be in the same range as those offered now: 4.2 cents apiece for 
presorted first-class mail and as much as 7.5 cents apiece for sorted bulk mail 
that is delivered by the business -- or an agent like Norco -- to specially 
designated post offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Elodia Camalich, a sales representative for Master-Sort Presort & Mailing 
Service in Santa Ana, agreed that the effect of Wednesday's proposal on 
businesses "really depends on the discounts." 
</P>
<P>
 If the new rates take effect in early January, that would increase the cost to 
employers of mailing out workers' W-2 forms. It also would boost the cost of 
"inventory sale" advertising typically sent out at the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is an early implementation," Bouffiou said, "a lot of businesses 
will rush to move up whatever first- and third-class mail that can be moved up, 
and the postal system will feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 The price of a stamp has been 29 cents for four years -- the longest period 
without an increase since the Postal Service became a semi-independent agency 
in the early 1970s. But the agency was $1.3 billion in the red for its latest 
fiscal year and is seeking additional revenue to help balance its books.

AIRPORT PANEL OKS ALL-CARGO JETLINER FLIGHTS AT JOHN WAYNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county Airport Commission approved a plan Wednesday that would allow 
United Parcel Service and Federal Express to operate all-cargo jetliners at 
John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 If the County Board of Supervisors similarly approves the plan on Tuesday, a 
United Parcel Service spokesman said, the company expects to begin a weekday 
flight by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking a matter of days," said David Vaughan, the company's 
Washington-based lawyer. "We've been ready for 6 1/2 years." A Federal Express 
representative indicated that his company, too, would hope to start service 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the airport and 
Newport Beach, indicated that he was awaiting Wednesday night's vote before 
deciding whether he favors all-cargo flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport commission's unanimous approval marked another milestone in an 
issue that has simmered for years, pitting local manufacturers who depend on 
air shipments against cities concerned about jet noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The package carriers have long sought approval to start service at John Wayne, 
but the airport has allowed only passenger carriers, under a 1985 court 
agreement with surrounding cities aimed at reducing noise. 
</P>
<P>
 UPS spearheaded the drive to start cargo service at John Wayne by enlisting 
dozens of shipment-dependent businesses to back the effort and paying for a 
$150,000 study to assess the environmental impact of adding a single additional 
jet flight on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement approved Wednesday, UPS will be allowed to fly a single 
flight every weekday afternoon in a two-year test. Although the plane will fly 
in the airport's loudest noise category, UPS will fly a Boeing 757, a plane 
widely used at the noise-impacted airfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are concerned that cargo (jets are) loud and dirty and will fly late 
at night, which is bunk," said Rochelle Lewis, a spokeswoman for the 
Competitive Alliance of Orange County, a support group of local businesses that 
want cargo flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people won't even know what is flying over their heads," added UPS 
spokesman Kenneth Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Express said it plans to use an Airbus 310, another low-noise 
jetliner, when it eventually starts service. The two flights would be in 
addition to 73 daily noise-regulated flights allowed at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The jets will park south of the terminal, near the old terminal and Martin 
Aviation.

BOLSA CHICA PLAN BACKED BY COUNTY COMMISSION; DEVELOPMENT: KOLL COMPANY COULD 
PUT UP 3,300 HOMES IN RETURN FOR BUILDING TIDAL INLET TO RESTORE WETLANDS. SOME 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS OBJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Calling it the best option for restoring deteriorated wetlands, the county 
Planning Commission on Wednesday voted to allow a developer to build 3,300 
homes in the Bolsa Chica area in exchange for creating a tidal inlet to benefit 
the marshes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters said the plan balances environmental concerns with the developer's 
need for a financially viable project, but opponents blasted the vote, 
insisting that no homes should be built on the ecologically sensitive area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering where we've been with this and how many years we've been working 
on it, we're very pleased," said Adrianne Morrison, executive director of 
Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an environmental group. "It's an excellent beginning 
step. . . . We think it is going to be of great benefit" to the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's decision, which capped months of public hearings on the 
issue, is not expected to end the long-running debate about what to do with the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors is set to vote on the plan Dec. 14. The 
project also requires clearance from the California Coastal Commission and U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will return to the issue again next week when it is 
scheduled to vote on a development agreement for the project. The hearing is 
expected to generate more objections from environmentalists as well as city and 
school district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's hearing, representatives of Huntington Beach and two local school 
districts argued that the plan does provide enough revenue to offset costs that 
government agencies will incur from the development for such services as 
streets, sewers and fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city might have to come up with millions of dollars for these things 
without any remuneration" from the developer, said Councilman Ralph Bauer, who 
unsuccessfully sought to delay the vote until city officials could examine the 
plan more closely. "That's not fair," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing both Huntington Beach school districts said the 
proposed fees and taxes do not come close to covering the costs the districts 
will face when reopening schools and buying new buses to serve children from 
the Bolsa Chica area. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the Koll Real Estate Group, the developer, 
denied that a funding gap exists. She said the data the company used to craft 
the plan was based on information from the school districts and city. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said the development would not place a financial burden on local 
governments and that some of the school districts' cost estimates appeared 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan approved Tuesday allows for about 1,000 fewer homes than Koll sought. 
But Dunn said the project appears to be financially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very tight. If we don't have any surprises, it should work," Dunn 
said. "The company is trying to be responsive to the community and to the 
county and do the best (wetlands) restoration possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the restoration plan is the $20-million tidal inlet, which 
would connect the marsh area to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and some environmentalists said the inlet would benefit the 
wetlands by providing them with a direct flow of water from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, ocean waters must flow more than four miles from Anaheim Bay, 
through Huntington Harbour and into the wetlands, said Ron Tippets, the 
county's chief of coastal planning. It takes about 30 days for water to 
circulate from Anaheim Bay to the wetlands and back to the ocean, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some activists Tuesday questioned the benefits of the inlet. Gordon 
LaBedz, a member of the Surfrider Foundation, said the inlet would pollute 
nearby beaches with bacteria from the wetlands and could erode beach cliffs in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the right biological solution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other opponents said the process should be put on hold because the Department 
of the Interior is interested in possibly acquiring the wetlands from Koll. 
</P>
<P>
 But both Koll officials and the county downplayed any Interior Department 
action. Dunn said the department had expressed interest in only a portion of 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think a Republican Congress is going use federal money to (buy the 
wetlands) when they can have them restored for free?" Dunn asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the plan also said the development would give the economy a 
boost, providing jobs and increased tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for 3,300 homes approved Tuesday was crafted by county planners based 
on testimony presented at seven public hearings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many nearby residents have said Koll's plan for 4,286 homes was too intense. 
Before this week, county planners had suggested two alternatives. One plan 
called for 3,200 homes; the other called for 2,500. Neither plan required 
construction of the tidal inlet.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL TAKES SPECIAL VIEW OF DISABILITY

 To anyone watching the children working playfully together in class, it might 
come as a surprise that one-third of them are learning-disabled. It would come 
as a surprise to the students as well, as they are mostly oblivious to the 
disabilities of their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because special-education students at University Park Elementary 
School spend their entire school day integrated with other students. It may be 
the only program in the county that has eliminated barriers between 
special-education and regular students, according to Carol Arnesen, 
special-education administrator for the County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had not heard of that type of a program before," Arnesen said. "Irvine is 
definitely the exception to the rule in implementing that. It is the desired 
objective." 
</P>
<P>
 University Park Principal Craig Ritter said his school will use recently won 
federal funding to measure the success of the 3-year-old program, which could 
become a model for schools throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Special-education students often feel inferior when they spend only a part of 
the day in a regular classroom, according to teacher Jean Fritzsche, who 
developed the program with teacher Kevin Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were using that classroom, but they were never a part of that class," 
Fritzsche said. "Now, the social stigma has really been removed." 
</P>
<P>
 Grade levels and teachers are also mixed, with students in a combination 
second-, third- and fourth-grade class and a combination fifth- and sixth-grade 
class. Each class has a regular and a special-education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just tell them that they're at many different development levels," said 
teacher Charlotte Hollis. "It's beautiful how they help one another." RUSS LOAR

 The two remaining landmark Buffalo Ranch buildings were propped up on jacks 
and readied for an eight-mile journey that was to end about 3 a.m. today at the 
Orange County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings were destined for the Centennial Farm, where they will house 
administrative offices and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Liebeck, curator of the Irvine Historical Society, fought to preserve the 
original 15 brick-red, farm-style buildings that were erected in 1955 for the 
short-lived Buffalo Ranch amusement park. All but two of the 15 buildings were 
recently demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members last summer voted in favor of moving the buildings to the 
fairgrounds, balking at preservation costs estimated at more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is poorer for allowing this to happen," Liebeck said. "Once 
again, the Irvine Co. got everything it wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Hoffman, Irvine Co. vice president of entitlement, said numerous 
alternatives for preserving the site were explored. The company's proposed 
Bonita Canyon Village residential development is planned for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city encouraged us to negotiate with the (Orange County) Fair," Hoffman 
said. "We felt this was a much more practical use, rather than let them sit on 
the corner where people just drive by." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960, the late architect William Pereira located a satellite office at the 
Buffalo Ranch buildings while creating the first master plan for the city of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pereira sold the buildings in 1983 to William Lange, who operated his real 
estate business at the site. After moving earlier this year, Lange gave the 
buildings to the Irvine Co.RUSS LOARHISTORIC BUILDINGS

<P>
 Dog owners seeking licenses for their pets are now required to pay an 
increased fee that was levied this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual fee is now $25 -- or $5 more.If the dog is neutered or spayed, the 
fee is $12.50 -- a $2.50 increase. Senior citizens, who are offered discount 
prices, also will pay more. Their cost is $6.25 -- an increase of $1.25 -- for 
spayed or neutered dogs, and $12.50 -- a $2.50 increase -- for other dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said 3,069 dogs have been licensed so far this year but that 
many people do not know dogs must have licenses as required by state law. 
Residents of La Habra must get their dog licenses at City Hall and renew them 
each year.MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; RESIDENTS URGE COUNCIL TO BLOCK PROPOSAL FOR 
LARGE FOOD WAREHOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal for a second large warehouse to be built in the Valley View Street 
area of south Cypress is causing concern among residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the new warehouse proposal has yet to reach a public hearing, some 
homeowners in the southern part of the city urged the City Council this week to 
kill the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned," said resident Dave Conde. "Help us." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a proposed 150,000-square-foot warehouse that would be built on 
undeveloped commercial land southwest of the intersection of Valley View and 
Katella streets. The warehouse would be used as a distribution site by 
Foodmaker Inc. and would operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The food warehouse project is scheduled for a public hearing Dec. 12. But the 
proposal drew early criticism at Monday night's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners in south Cypress previously opposed a large 
carpet-distribution warehouse that was approved by the City Council on Sept. 
26. Some residents subsequently took the issue to court, and their lawsuit 
challenging the project on grounds of environmental suitability is pending in 
Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Smith, a resident who opposed the carpet warehouse, told the council this 
week that a second warehouse would intensify residential problems in the Valley 
View Street area. He said that Cypress, in seeking such projects, would be 
subjecting residents to huge influx of trucks and noise.BILL BILLITER

<P>
 The owners of four businesses that must be moved from historic downtown 
buildings have filed a claim against the city seeking a minimum of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants of the mostly vacant El Peon complex say they should be compensated 
for losing their location because of the city's recent sale of the property to 
investors who plan to renovate the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the law, as I researched it, what the city has done, in effect, is take 
away their businesses without giving just compensation under the state 
Constitution and the U.S. Constitution," said Richard L. Franck, a Los Angeles 
lawyer representing the owners of Cafe Capistrano, M&M Jewelers, The Cat's Meow 
and Cynthia's Bakery and Tea Room. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Richard K. Denhalter said Wednesday that the city is not obligated 
to pay the tenants, but that officials are willing to discuss city assistance 
in finding the merchants other spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold the property to a purchaser who purchased it with the tenants in 
place," Denhalter said. "They've got a giant mountain to climb before they 
establish a claim." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to consider the claim Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Franck said the new owners have given tenants until Jan. 15 to move so that 
the businesses, which are across the street from Mission San Juan Capistrano, 
can remain open through the holidays. He said he will file a lawsuit if the 
claim is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned $2-million renovation project for the complex has been stalled and 
will not be finished by St. Joseph's Day, March 19, traditionally regarded as 
the day the swallows make their annual return to the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the permits ready to pull," said Steve Nordeck, one of the project's 
partners. "It's a crying shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck said he is stuck in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Whelchel, owner of Cafe Capistrano, said that when the city bought the 
property in the late 1980s, he was assured that he would receive relocation 
money or be able to negotiate with a new owner if the building were sold.JEFF

<P>
 Cecilia L. Age, a 43-year-old businesswoman, is the city's new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 By unanimous vote of fellow council members, Age was elected to the post 
Monday night.She succeeds outgoing Mayor Richard Partin and will serve in the 
post for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the new council was united in electing Age as mayor, it split in 
designating the new mayor pro tem, who serves as council leader when the mayor 
is absent. Councilman Walter K. Bowman, who won the post by a 3-2 vote, 
succeeds Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 Two newcomers on the council, Mary Ann Jones and Tom Carroll, voted against 
Bowman's nomination. Jones had urged the council to instead elect Carroll to 
the post. Carroll said his selection as mayor pro tem would show "the Old 
Guard's willingness to accept new people on the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry, who nominated Bowman, contended that the city 
would profit from having a veteran incumbent such as Bowman in the position. 
Bowman received the backing of Kerry and Age, in addition to his own vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Age, who has lived in the city for 10 years, was first elected to the council 
in 1988 and served a term as mayor in 1990. A native of Whittier, she earned 
her bachelor's degree in speech communication from Cal State Fullerton.BILL

 There won't be any new faces on the Rancho Santiago Community College District 
Board of Trustees when it convenes Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 By retaining the three incumbents who ran in the Nov. 8 election, voters 
apparently affirmed their confidence in the current board to improve education 
in the face of dwindling funds from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters reelected Charles W. (Pete) Maddox, Lawrence R. Labrado and Shirley 
Ralston to the seven-member board by wide margins. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox won in Trustee Area 2, beating his sole challenger by a 2-to-1 ratio. 
Labrado and Ralston defeated three challengers for Trustee Area 3's two seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox said the board will continue to seek ways to lower the cost of 
education to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to years of declining funding from the state, he added that the 
district must strive to "do far more with less." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to educate them with high-tech equipment and prepare them for the 
future," he said. "We can no longer educate people just for the present because 
the technology is changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Labrado downplayed the effects of continuing budget constraints, saying the 
district is in strong financial shape and that "we can't let these little 
obstacles stop us in the process of educating students." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "We'll just try to keep working the best we can with the means that 
we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston called for greater unity and tolerance on the board, which has 
experienced rancorous division over ethics and budgetary matters, adding that 
"now is the time to come together." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would encourage community groups to better acquaint and involve 
themselves in the district's budget and planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important aspect, she said, is to show students that "there is a way 
out of a difficult life and that is education." JON NALICK

 Miguel A. Pulido Jr. became mayor Tuesday night during a swearing-in ceremony 
marked by standing ovations and mariachi music. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a crowd of more than 250 people jammed into the City Council chambers, 
Pulido and council members Patricia McGuigan, Robert L. Richardson and Tony 
Espinoza took their oaths of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders including Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez attended the ceremony, 
as did Rancho Santiago Community College District Chancellor Vivian Blevins and 
several members of the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ceremony, the City Council certified the recent election and turned 
over the mayoralty to Pulido, who becomes the city's first Latino mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Daniel H. Young received a standing ovation for his service to 
the city. He had been mayor since 1986 and was a council member for three years 
before becoming mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 He thanked residents for letting him lead the city. "I hope I have been able 
to serve you well and serve you proud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being sworn in, Pulido told the audience that now is the time "to dream 
about the future, to dream about the things we can do" for the city.JON NALICK

<P>
 The Japanese owner of 225 acres along Salt Creek envisioned as a Pebble 
Beach-style resort have forfeited a $700,000 deposit for failing to meet 
today's deadline to provide the city a security bond for local park 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Monarch Bay Resort Co., the California subsidiary of Tokyo-based 
Nippon Shinpan Co. Ltd., however, insist the future of the resort is not in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The forfeiture comes a week after the City Council unanimously denied the 
company's request for a three-year extension of the deadline to provide 
security for $4.7 million in improvements to Sea Terrace Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will take the deposit as well as 21 acres of parkland that was to 
have been developed as part of the $500-million golf, hotel and residential 
resort project proposed for the 225 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a golf course -- the 18-hole Monarch Beach Golf Links -- and a seven-acre 
first phase of the park are currently located on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think granting an extension would have resulted in the city getting 
anything more than we are getting doing it this way," Councilwoman Karen 
Lloreda said. She added that she hoped the $700,000 would be used for the park 
improvements that Monarch Bay Resort Co. was to have made. 
</P>
<P>
 The resort project was approved by the City Council in 1992 but has been 
delayed because of a lack of financing for the 400-room hotel portion of the 
plan, said Ben Cagle, a spokesman for Monarch Bay Resort. The city agreement 
stipulated that the developers build the hotel before they proceed with the 
residential and commercial portions of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Cagle said company officials decided that without assurances that the project 
could begin, it made no sense to move forward with the funding for park 
improvements.LEN HALL

<P>
 The California Highway Patrol wrapped up a high-profile enforcement program 
Wednesday designed mainly to snare motorists driving too fast between San Juan 
Capistrano and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokesman Bruce Lian said that about 350 citations were expected to be 
written over a two-day period.The exact number of tickets issued has not been 
tallied, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the special enforcement on Nov. 16 and then on Wednesday, 20 officers 
looked for speeders, expired registration tags and motorists not wearing seat 
belts, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction work on the South County portion of Interstate 5 has made it more 
important than ever that motorists drive safely, Lian said. The holiday season 
only compounds that need, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not out there to make revenue," Lian said. "We're out there to slow 
people down. That's our biggest problem out there."JEFF BEAN

that he has been considering leaving the commission for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just a whole lot of little personal items that made it seem time 
for a change," Olvera said. "The timing seemed appropriate, with the selection 
of the new commissioners." 
</P>
<P>
 Olvera, a member of the city's charter Planning Commission, selected in 1989, 
was in the middle of his second four-year term. He will be replaced by the 
commission alternate, Blake Hinman, a local landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently appointed commissioners Lynn Dawson and Jim Hyde to 
their second four-year terms and J. Michael Reed, a former parks commissioner, 
to his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 Olvera said he had succeeded in helping the city write its first-ever General 
Plan and zoning code during his tenure on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I've done a lot," Olvera said. "I had a good time and got a sense 
of satisfaction." LEN HALL

NO LEADS IN PEPPER SPRAY INCIDENT AT CROWDED STORE; AFTERMATH: LACK OF

 Orange County Sheriff's Department officials said Wednesday that they have no 
leads or suspects and will not actively investigate the apparent release of 
pepper spray in a crowded Target store Tuesday evening that forced the 
evacuation of about 300 holiday shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody really saw what happened, so there's very little we can do at this 
point," said Lt. Kim Markison."We have no leads, no suspect information and 
nothing to follow up on. Unless someone comes forward, we don't have anything 
to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 A review of store surveillance tapes proved inconclusive, Markison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been accidental or intentional," Markison said. "At this point, 
we just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials received a 911 call just after 5:30 p.m. Tuesday reporting an 
unknown substance causing respiratory problems for customers and employees at 
the Target store in the 24500 block of Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people were evacuated after shoppers and employees near the 
garden supply and auto parts departments complained of dizziness, nausea and a 
pungent odor. 
</P>
<P>
 At least eight people were rushed to local hospitals, where six were treated 
and released. Two people were admitted to Irvine Medical Center and were 
released Wednesday morning, according to a hospital spokeswoman. Seven others 
were treated at the scene by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Target store does not sell pepper spray, which is intended for use in 
self-defense. This is the first incident of pepper spray misuse reported in 
Orange County, said Sheriff's Lt. Rex Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Store officials would not comment Wednesday on the incident.

MANAGED HEALTH CARE COMING, STATE OFFICIAL SAYS; MEDICINE: SHE HEARS DOCTORS' 
CONCERNS ABOUT QUALITY OF SERVICES UNDER PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM. PROP. 187 
RESTRICTIONS, SHE SAYS, ARE ON HOLD. 
</P>

 The head of the state's Health and Welfare Agency told Orange County doctors 
and nurses Wednesday that incremental, state-by-state health reform is 
"probably the way to go" now that sweeping national reform has foundered -- and 
that California is leading the way with its pursuit of managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief visit to Chapman General Hospital in Orange, Sandra R. Smoley 
fielded a wide range of questions, from how physicians and patients will fare 
under managed care to Medi-Cal reimbursement problems and implementation of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is changed. . . . Everything is status quo," Smoley, the secretary of 
Health and Welfare, said, in answer to a doctor's question about whether the 
anti-illegal immigration measure means they cannot provide prenatal care to 
undocumented women. "We're waiting for the courts to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoley, a former nurse, said there eventually would be "clear-cut . . . 
directions from the state" on how the measure is expected to be enforced. Most 
on the minds of audience members, however, was how they and their patients 
might be affected by health reform. Some said they feared patient's choice of 
physicians and the overall quality of care could be compromised in a system in 
which cost-cutting is the driving force. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Christopher Lyon, an ophthalmologist, said a "major criticism" of managed 
care is that it financially rewards primary-care physicians, who act as 
"gatekeepers," for limiting referrals to specialists. Lyon also said he is 
concerned about certain physicians being excluded from managed-care networks, 
thus decreasing patient access to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is, there is a movement to managed care," Smoley said. 
"It is going to increase access and increase choice. That is the wave of the 
future. . . . What we're doing in California does fit into that system." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the state is looking to expand "health insurance purchasing 
cooperatives" composed of small employers, so they can negotiate better rates 
from managed-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon said later that he believed Smoley's remarks on managed care were 
"diplomatic" and what he expected from a "state bureaucrat" -- but that his 
concerns remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's most on our minds is the viability of private practice in this state" 
for those who choose not to join managed-care networks, said Lyon, surrounded 
by nodding colleagues in the physicians' cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 One physician told Smoley he is bothered by high administrative costs 
generated by the insurance companies that run managed-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoley said that issue has attracted attention in Sacramento, and that while 
proposed legislation to limit these overhead costs recently failed, there is 
now a requirement that insurance companies disclose these costs to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a positive step," Smoley said, because the information can be 
useful when managed-care contracts are negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors complained to Smoley that Medi-Cal reimbursements are unreasonably 
low, and that the program does not cover important medications. 
</P>
<P>
 Some physicians said after the meeting that they are hopeful the massive 
reform of Medi-Cal in Orange County under the OPTIMA program -- which will 
involve bringing about 300,000 low-income patients into managed care networks 
beginning next July -- will improve the reimbursement process. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Dewane, executive director of OPTIMA, who attended the meeting with 
Smoley, said her agency is interested in doing what is necessary to obtain 
specialists' services, which are seriously lacking in the existing Medi-Cal 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 One physician, however, left the meeting openly dissatisfied, saying his 
concerns about Proposition 187 were far from allayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that doctors should practice medicine and stay away from 
politics," said Francisco Jimenez, director of Chapman's Pan-American Clinic, 
which accepts Medi-Cal patients. "I became a physician to see sick people. I 
should not be obligated to report on a very private -- and sacred -- 
relationship between a doctor and a patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Proposition 187, publicly funded non-emergency health care would be 
denied to illegal immigrants.

OFFICIALDOM GETS AN EARFUL AS STUDENTS HAVE THEIR SAY; CULTURE: 'YOUTH RAP' 
PARTICIPANTS VOICE COMPLAINTS OF INSENSITIVITY, DISRESPECT FROM TEACHERS AND 
POLICE. SUPERVISOR, HEAD OF COUNTY SCHOOLS PLEDGE EFFORTS TO HELP.

 Carlo Domingo's complaint is not a new one. Almost every weekend, the Kennedy 
High School senior said, he and his friends are pulled over by police who 
unfairly suspect them of gang affiliations because they hang out in large 
groups and cruise the streets in lowrider cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Authorities don't take the time to figure out who's who and who's in a gang 
and who's not," Domingo said. "The cops see us as a menace. . . . They think 
you're in a gang because there are 15 of you. It's gotten to the point where we 
can't even hang out in a big group." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, some top county officials were listening to Domingo and scores 
of his peers at the second annual "Youth Rap," a chance for teens to make their 
feelings known on the issues most important to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's session on youth violence was attended by County Supervisor Gaddi 
H. Vasquez and County Schools Supt. John Dean. Sixty students from Kennedy 
High, in Anaheim Union High School District, and Valley High, in Santa Ana 
Unified School District, vented their frustration on school dress codes, lack 
of communication between students and teachers, racism, sexism and the feeling 
that school counselors don't understand their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of students also telephoned to speak to the officials on a special hot 
line linked to 45 high school and junior high school campuses across the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of students do care about their schools, but administrators and 
teachers don't value their opinions," one Kennedy High student said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez and Dean offered few solutions but promised to continue accepting 
student input. The information will be forwarded to county school boards and 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll keep the process going as long as it takes to solve the problem," said 
Vasquez, who represents southeastern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Students lamented that their high school years are being marred by violence 
both on and off campus, saying weekend parties are often disrupted by gunshots. 
Most said they felt uncomfortable even in their own front yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, our neighborhood is dangerous. I can't let my 8-year-old sister 
ride her bike on our street because the gang members are just across the street 
drinking and smoking," one Kennedy student said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the hot line came suggestions that parents instill morals in their 
children and spend more time with them, and that schools provide more classroom 
instruction on different cultures and sponsor evening presentations for parents 
on the problems their children face today. 
</P>
<P>
 Several students contended that teachers are commonly insensitive and 
disrespectful toward them. A teacher at Valley High made a cruel joke about 
Proposition 187, the recently passed ballot measure to prohibit social 
services, education and all but emergency health care to illegal immigrants, 
said Eric Castleberry, a 16-year-old junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students echoed Domingo's complaint that they are stereotyped as gang 
members by teachers, law enforcement agents and even their peers because they 
favor lowrider cars and clothing such as oversized T-shirts or khaki pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now Raiders jackets are associated with gang members, but what happens 
when the jackets go out of style?" asked Vak Sambath, a Valley senior. "What 
are you trying to do, keep up with the fashion trends or keep up with the 
problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo said he saw some value in the rap session. "It gives the adults a 
chance to hear the kids. I think it will make a difference because it's giving 
me a chance to tell them my point of view."

REPORT UNDERSCORES UNSOLVED MURDERS OF IMMIGRANT JOURNALISTS; CRIME: PANEL 
CALLS FOR RENEWED EFFORTS TO INVESTIGATE THE CASES, WHICH INCLUDED THE KILLING 
OF THE VIETNAMESE FOUNDER OF A LITTLE SAIGON MAGAZINE. 
</P>

 A Garden Grove magazine editor was among 10 immigrant journalists murdered in 
the United States since 1981 for covering news that disturbed political 
factions from their native countries, according to a report by a private 
nonprofit group that is being released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the 10 killings remain unsolved. This week, the New York-based 
Committee to Protect Journalists, which prepared the report, called on the FBI 
and local police departments to renew efforts to investigate the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this report here is not to consider these unresolved cases 
closed but to underline that they remain open," William Orme, the committee's 
executive director, said at a news conference Wednesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those killed was Tap Van Pham, who started a Little Saigon publication 
called Mai Magazine in 1981. He was killed in a firebomb attack at his Garden 
Grove office more than seven years ago in an apparent political assassination 
after publishing controversial advertising in his Vietnamese-language 
entertainment magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy has never ended for Tam Pham, his 31-year-old daughter, who is now 
an editor at the same magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know what really happened," she said. "It makes me very sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Tam Pham, her two sisters and mother were in Vietnam at the time of the 
attack. The family fled their homeland about three years ago using immigration 
papers prepared by her father before he died, she said. After settling in 
Orange County, her mother, Mai Tran, revived the entertainment magazine, which 
is now based in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stay away from any political issues," Tam Pham said.  
</P>
<P>
 She declined to comment on the nonprofit group's report. 
</P>
<P>
 For many immigrant journalists in Orange County and elsewhere in the United 
States, freedom of speech is not free, said Co Thien Nguyen, editor of Nguoi 
Viet Daily News, California's largest Vietnamese-language newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 slain immigrant journalists mentioned in the report included five 
Vietnamese newspaper and magazine journalists who were killed in Texas, 
California and Virginia, and three Haitian radio hosts who were killed in 
Florida for their support of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The other 
victims were a Chinese American reporter in Daly City, Calif., and a Cuban 
American publisher in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those cases, only two have been solved -- the murders in Daly City and New 
York. In those instances, there was a commitment of resources from law 
enforcement officials in the ethnic communities where the victims worked, 
according to the report, "Silenced: The Unsolved Murders of Immigrant 
Journalists in the United States."  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking out against a politically motivated assassination can mean 
retaliation, said Garden Grove Police Investigator Al Butler, who has worked 
the Pham case since 1989. Many witnesses are not willing to cooperate with 
authorities as a result, making the cases much more difficult to crack, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is the limited resources available from the FBI and the Garden 
Grove Police Department, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the attack, a task force of FBI agents and police investigators worked 
for about a year to solve the murder. But due to transfers and promotions, the 
task force was dissolved without making a lot of headway into the 
identification of a suspect, Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the case was turned over to Butler, who said he now spends about two 
days a month interviewing witnesses and verifying new information. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is a concentrated effort put on it," he said. "Without a 
separate investigator who can pick up and go full time on this, things are 
going to go at a much slower pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Although violence against Vietnamese journalists in Orange County has not gone 
away, it has waned in the past few years, Butler and area Vietnamese 
journalists said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam in February, 
Nguyen said, he has noticed changes for the better. Dissent is more verbal than 
physical among political opponents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to Yen Do, the editor of Nguoi Viet who resigned amid criticisms 
for publicly saying that politics is a game in Little Saigon, and Dr. Co Pham, 
who received death threats after initiating a trade mission to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said that years ago such actions might have provoked violence.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the best situation for the media here, but things have definitely 
improved," Nguyen said. "Where there were firebombs and assassinations before, 
there are now protests and verbal threats."

2 MEN INJURE OCCUPANT, ROB HUNTINGTON HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two armed men dressed in black forced their way into a Huntington Harbour home 
Wednesday night and held the residents captive, pistol-whipping one, while they 
ransacked the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:30 p.m., residents told police, two men wearing ski masks and carrying 
handguns forced their way into the house in the 4000 block of Ondine Circle, 
near Heil Avenue and Algonquin Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 90 minutes, the men ransacked the house and pistol-whipped at least 
one of the occupants, according to Lt. Clyde Stuart. The men then fled with an 
unknown amount of valuables and an ATM bank card. 
</P>
<P>
 After calling police, one of the residents, who have not been identified, was 
treated at the scene for chest pains by medics.

FITTING CONCLUSIONS; IN FINER DRESSING ROOMS, PAMPERING IS FREE. TRY THESE

<P>
 For some shoppers, a dressing room is simply a clean, well-lighted place in 
which to try on clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 They obviously haven't taken a peek inside some of Orange County's finer 
dressing rooms. These are not dressing rooms in the traditional sense, but 
elegantly appointed quarters equipped with frills such as telephones, full-size 
couches and antique writing tables. They make ordinary ones with swinging doors 
or curtains look closer to whitewashed barnyard stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers know that big decisions on whether to buy a garment are made in 
dressing rooms. A dressing room with a huge mirror and soft lighting that takes 
10 years off a woman's face can make her feel like buying the whole store. 
Likewise, a claustrophobic cubicle with fluorescent lighting that turns her 
skin an unhealthy shade can make her look horrible in any outfit -- and that 
means no sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Gellman of Newport Beach, president of the guild alliance of Opera 
Pacific, favors the dressing rooms at Saks Fifth Avenue's Fifth Avenue Club in 
South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, because, she says, they make her feel like a 
diva. 
</P>
<P>
 "They offer tea and a personal shopper and your own sofa," she says. "You feel 
pampered and special." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fifth Avenue Club, a personalized shopping service open to everyone, 
offers a spacious room furnished entirely in beige, with a small sofa in 
striped moire, walls covered with water silk fabric, a massive three-way mirror 
and flattering recessed lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The rooms also have adjustable lighting. The personal shoppers will even dim 
the lights for customers who just want to pop in for a cup of coffee -- a 
relaxing break from shopping, especially around the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a marble-top coffee table stocked with perfumes for customers' 
enjoyment, a phone and a pair of shoes handy lest shoppers who came in wearing 
flats want to see how their outfit looks with heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal shoppers hurry in and out to meet customers' every need, offering tea 
and sweets at no charge from the nearby kitchen and combing the entire store 
for anything customers might want to try on -- from ball gowns to flannel 
nightgowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spaciousness is important. We can pull a lot of merchandise and bring it up 
to the club," says Stephanie Wilcox, director of the Saks Fifth Avenue Club 
With a personal shopper at the ready to fetch a dress in a different size or 
find an accessory to match, shoppers can experiment with all kinds of looks 
without leaving the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one-stop shopping. They only need to take their clothes off once," 
Wilcox says. "We also have robes if they're between outfits." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no such "suites" in Sak's men's departments, although men have 
ventured through the women's evening wear to use these plush accommodations. 
Husbands accompanying their wives while shopping can also relax in the dressing 
rooms or an equally comfortable waiting area outside. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, men's dressing rooms are rather plain. Dressing rooms at 
Ermenegildo Zegna, the menswear boutique at South Coast Plaza, are simply 
furnished with a small bench and two hooks. The reason: Men don't like spending 
a lot of time in dressing rooms trying on clothes, say salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're out of there immediately and in front of a tailor," said Amy Vizek, 
store manager of Ermenegildo Zegna. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chanel boutique at South Coast Plaza has dressing rooms for women that 
match the sophisticated buff-and-black decor of the store. Each room boasts a 
three-way mirror, recessed lighting, soft music and padded walls covered in 
buff-colored suede. The largest of the three rooms has a black leather sofa and 
an end table furnished with a contemporary lamp and a phone that shoppers can 
use to ring up a spouse, an agent or perhaps a credit card company to inquire 
about their limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing rooms at 341 Bayside in Newport Beach offer a romantic getaway: They 
feature upholstered chairs, crystal ceiling lamps that bestow a soft light, 
beige damask wallpaper and antique tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very soft and subdued so the clothing will stand out," says Mona Angell, 
manager of 341 Bayside. "You don't want the room to upstage the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Candy and fresh flowers greet customers at Escada's dressing rooms in South 
Coast Plaza. The all-white rooms are done in a contemporary style, with a clear 
Lucite counter, white marble floor, white leather chair and huge mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the true test of any dressing room is how one looks while trying on 
a bathing suit. The Everything But Water swimsuit stores equip their dressing 
rooms with tinted mirrors that give customers an artificial tan. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers "like it -- especially in winter when they're white," says Rachel 
Childers, sales associate at Everything But Water in the Brea Mall. 
</P>

 One need not frequent only tony boutiques to find inviting dressing rooms. 
Some stores with moderately priced merchandise are encouraging customers to 
stay longer -- and spend more -- by revamping their dressing rooms. JCPenney in 
the Brea Mall, which opened in July 1993, has the kind of updated dressing 
rooms seen in the chain's newer or renovated stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the old 4-by-4-foot stalls that made one feel, quite literally, like 
a clothes horse. In their place are individual 5-by-6-foot dressing rooms 
decorated with wood trim, an understated light beige carpeting and decorator 
wallpaper. Artworks hang in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dressing room kind of finishes off the sale," says Price Parker, manager 
of the Brea store. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing rooms are important because it's there that shoppers can really 
critique clothes, says Dianna Pfaff-Martin, founder of California Image 
Advisors, an image consulting company in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dressing room is an extension of the establishment and should be given as 
much attention as anything else," she says. "I've seen some rooms where the 
clothes are left hanging everywhere or the mirrors are warped so they make you 
look fat." 
</P>
<P>
 A good mirror is essential -- shoppers should use it to closely scrutinize the 
fit and silhouette of the clothes, Pfaff-Martin says. The rooms should also be 
well-lighted so one doesn't choose something that's the wrong color. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm concerned about color, I'll walk out in my tennis socks to the exit 
doors so I can see what the clothes look like in a true light," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she suggests that shoppers know when to turn a deaf ear to 
salespeople who visit dressing rooms to push merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many salespeople go into dressing rooms and offer compliments to get a 
sale," she says. "You have to trust your own judgment." Views From the Rooms 
</P>
<P>
 Times fashion writer Kathyrn Bold visited various dressing rooms in Orange 
County. Here's her assessment:  
</P>
<P>
 Five Favorite Dressing Rooms 
</P>
<P>
 1. Saks Fifth Avenue's Fifth Avenue Club -- Attentive salespeople, tea 
service, complimentary perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Chanel -- Skip the two smaller rooms for the penthouse with the leather 
couch. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Nordstrom -- Dressing rooms vary by department, but those in Special 
Occasion are spacious, attractive and visited regularly by salespeople who are 
attentive but not in your face.  
</P>
<P>
 4. Escada -- With the candy and fresh flowers, I could forgive the 
unflattering lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Victoria's Secret -- The romantic decor of these lingerie boutiques carries 
through into the dressing rooms, which often boast gilded mirrors, fabric wall 
coverings and upholstered seating. 
</P>
<P>
 Five That Need Make-Overs 
</P>
<P>
 1. Neiman Marcus -- If this wasn't Neiman Marcus (in the evening wear 
department, no less), these rather average dressing rooms would be acceptable. 
Alas, it was, and they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Bullock's -- The Mission Valley store had fairly Spartan quarters, 
considering the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Robinsons-May -- Points taken off for neatness. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Target -- The decor says army barracks, and the lighting is awful. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Price Club/Costco -- You say they don't have dressing rooms? My point, 
exactly.

BELLY UP FOR DESIGNER BEER; LIVE MUSIC AND DISCOUNTS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS MAKE 
BREW PUBS THE TOAST OF O.C.

 Harmon Woldar approached the bar at the Huntington Beach Beer Co. one 
Wednesday evening like a man who knew what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like a beer that you can sit and drink all night," Woldar proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Woldar had been working all day and was in no mood for light beer. He wanted 
something he could taste for a while, so he tried a Brickshot Red Ale. After a 
few sips, Woldar's taste buds went searching for another flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a little sweet," said Woldar, eyeing the reddish-brown colored beer 
as if it were a meal rather than a drink. "Do you have something a little more 
bitter?" 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, Woldar was tasting a lighter-colored, but fuller-flavored Pier 
Pale Ale. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is superior beer," Woldar said. "Drinking good beer is a lot like 
drinking fine wines, I guess. It takes a lot of time. Really, it's an art 
form." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, it's an art form whose time has come. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting in the Pacific Northwest and traveling down the California 
Coast, the "Fresh Revolution," as some call it, has hit Orange County. There 
are three brew pubs -- restaurants serving beer brewed on the premises -- in 
Orange County, and by the spring, that number will grow to at least eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like the coffee house popularity that began in the late 1980s, the brew 
pub craze has attracted a sophisticated, eclectic, well-informed group of 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 People go to bars to drink. People go to brew pubs to enjoy ales, porters, 
stouts, amber's red ales, pale ales, wheats, raspberries or whatever style 
might be on that particular brew pub's menu. And typically, they don't just 
enjoy their beer; they discuss why they enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Andriet walked into a place with that sort of crowd, that sort of 
atmosphere and that sort of beer four years ago in Breckinridge, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just knew the moment I had a beer there that it was my kind of place," said 
Andriet, who was in Colorado on a fishing trip. "I had lived in Texas, where 
brew pubs were illegal at the time, so I had no idea what they were. But I just 
fell in love with the concept." 
</P>
<P>
 The Breckinridge Brewing Co. became Andriet's inspiration for the Huntington 
Beach Beer Co. 
</P>
<P>
 After putting together 17 investors and $500,000, Andriet opened the 
Huntington Beach Beer Co. a block from the pier in October, 1992. Two years and 
$4 million in gross sales later, Andriet and three new partners are expanding 
to Laguna Beach on Dec. 14, Newport Beach on March 1 and Anaheim on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible," said Andriet, 34. "I envisioned great success and these 
numbers are that success. Our place has a very social atmosphere. There's no 
live music, no pool tables, just good beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage Brewing Co. in Dana Point and Fullerton Hofbrau, the other two brew 
pubs in Orange County, have also found great success within in a short period. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the 5-year old Heritage Brewing Co., across from the Dana Point 
Harbor, opened another brewery in Lake Elsinore. The Lake Elsinore site is a 
microbrewery -- a brewery with annual production of fewer than 15,000 barrels 
that produces beer for consumption off the premises. Heritage is using Coors to 
distribute its bottles and kegs of beer to bars and stores throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofbrau, less than a mile from Cal State Fullerton, is in its fourth year. 
Majority owner Gunther Buerk said plans are in the works to go public and to 
open a medium size, stand-alone microbrewery in the Los Angeles or Orange 
County area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that we've been able to prosper during the worst economic times in 
the (recent) history of California," said Hofbrau general manager Russell 
Brent. "With a lot of restaurants in this area going out of business due to the 
decline of the aerospace industry, we've had 30% growth over last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The brew pub and microbrewery industry in California and the United States is 
growing even faster, some estimates say by as much 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Wesley, who writes about the microbrewery industry and the history of 
beer for several beer publications, said there were about 2,200 breweries in 
the U.S. before Prohibition, and 400 during the '50s. But by the '60s, major 
breweries had bought out most of the small ones and Americans were limited to 
drinking mostly light, mass-produced beer from national breweries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, there were only 21 microbreweries and eight brew pubs in the U.S. 
Brew pubs weren't allowed in California until 1982 when the state legalized 
consumption of on-premise brewing by passing the "brew pub law." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, the Mendocino Brewing Co. in Hopland, 90 miles north of San 
Francisco, became the state's first brew pub. Michael Laybourn, CEO of 
Mendocino Brewing Co., said he simply took advantage of a shift in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We noticed import sales started going up 10% to 20% a year," said Laybourn, 
whose trademark beer is Red Tail Ale. "So we thought there might be an interest 
in heavier beers. We wanted to make English-style ales, a red ale, a black 
stout and a pale ale. Now, everybody across the country is making ales, reds, 
stouts or dark ales." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most mass-produced beers -- Budweiser, Coors and Miller -- are 
lagers, Laybourn said ales have more history in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilgrims landed with ale, and that's what most people still drink in that 
part of the country," he said. "James Madison, George Washington, Ben Franklin 
and Thomas Jefferson all brewed ale." 
</P>
<P>
 But Laybourn acknowledges that most beer drinkers in the U.S. still favor 
lighter lager-style beers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bud sells 87 million barrels of beer a year," Laybourn said. "Sierra Nevada 
(one of most popular regional specialty microbreweries) sells 100,000 barrels." 
</P>
<P>
 Microbreweries only have a little more than 1% of the beer market in the U.S., 
but industry experts expect that figure could grow to 5% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In 12 years, nearly 100 brew pubs have opened in California. And although brew 
pubs are still illegal in Mississippi and Georgia because those states have not 
passed laws that legalize them, there are some 530 brew pubs and microbreweries 
in the U.S. In the first nine months of 1994, 88 brew pubs have opened their 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of brew pubs in the U.S. could double next year," Wesley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has lagged far behind state and national trends with only three 
brew pubs, but that is changing with Huntington Beach Co.'s three new sites and 
the opening of McCormick and Schmick's brew pub in Irvine and the Sunset Beach 
Fish House and Brewery in Peter's Landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the beer industry is where the wine industry was 15 to 20 years ago," 
said Hofbrau's Brent. "Southern California is not as saturated with brew pubs 
as Portland, Seattle and the Bay Area are. In parts of Portland, there's a brew 
pub on almost every corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Brent, like Huntington Beach Beer Co.'s Andriet, saw his opportunity through a 
pint of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I graduated from hotel and restaurant school, I ate and drank from 
England to Greece and all the countries in between," Brent said. "I was so 
impressed with the Bavarian beer, that I made up my mind when I came back here 
I would open a place like the German brew pubs over here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther Buerk, who grew up near Munich, was just the man Brent was looking 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been over here 30 years and I always missed the good German Bavarian 
beer," said Buerk. "My biggest complaint was that I couldn't find any good beer 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Buerk and Brent invested $450,000 in computer-controlled brewing equipment 
from Munich. "We brew our beer under the oldest brewing laws in the history of 
the world, a process called Reinheitsgebot that started in 1516 and has turned 
into the industry standard," said Brent. "The computer-controlled brewery 
allows us to reproduce the same quality beer batch after batch." The brew pub 
has won the Southern California Restaurant Writer's Assn. silver award the past 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Buerk and Brent say they have tried to make Hofbrau -- a German term meaning 
"Royal Court Brewery" -- attractive to families and college students, who are 
given discounts on beer by showing student identification and are entertained 
by alternative music bands on Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Hofbrau's most popular beer is Kings Lager, which is smooth and 
full-bodied with a golden color. The second-most popular is Hefe-Weizen, a 
blend of wheat and barley malt with Hersbrucker hops. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Beer Co. is most noted for its Pier Pale Ale, which recently 
won the silver medal in the pale ale category at the Great American Beer 
Festival in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly Santilli, who was sharing a pitcher of Brickshot Red Ale with her 
friend Greg Bunker on a busy Wednesday night, doesn't have a favorite style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beers here are all different," said Santilli, 26. "I like experimenting." 
</P>
<P>
 Santilli said she drank a lot of Coors Light, and occasionally still does, 
before getting hooked on beers such as Blonde Ale and Brickshot Red. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Ciora, the brew pub's regional manager, said he didn't know what a treat 
beer could be until he began working at the Huntington Beach Beer Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to have a 12-pack of just about anything in my fridge, but now I'll 
have four quality beers in there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the people who are used to drinking light beers from the major beer 
companies, the first step might be a lager," Ciora said. "Then, the next thing 
you know, they're drinking porters and stouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ciora said he considers himself somewhat of a beer snob. He became a 
recognized beer judge after passing an exam last month in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll turn my nose up at most everything now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For snobs or for those who can't get enough good beer, the Huntington Beach 
Beer Co. has started beer appreciation night and a beer enthusiasts club. 
</P>
<P>
 "On beer appreciation night, the beer master (Alex Puchner) will talk about 
styles of beer, and people will taste beers from those styles," he said. "The 
beer enthusiast club is a more serious group. There's a lot of beer enthusiasts 
out there, but we want more of them. One of our main goals is to educate the 
people of Orange County about beer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Heritage Brewing Co. doesn't have any clubs that meet regularly, but it 
does have live music every night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't do much live entertainment when we first opened, but now every 
night we have somebody playing here," said Paul Storey, general manager of the 
Heritage Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Storey said his brew pub's two bottled beers, Red Fox Pale Ale and Mulligan 
Lager, have also worked well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't keep production for our beer," he said. "We're selling it faster 
than we can make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hofbrau's Brent, "We're here to stay. Anybody that tells me this is a fad 
is crazy."

CLOSET RX; MAD FOR PLAID? THERE'S A PATTERN HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've ever wanted to go to Scotland, take a good look around your local 
mall. There are so many patterns of plaid being displayed, you might start 
hearing bagpipe tunes instead of Muzak. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaids are making a return across the Atlantic in a variety of fabrics, 
although you're seeing more in the traditional flannel and wool at this time of 
year. If meatloaf is considered comfort food, plaid is comfort wear. You know 
just what to expect from a plaid skirt because you've probably worn one similar 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few seasons they renew their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding that people are becoming intrigued with plaid," says Brenda 
Davidson of Pendleton Sport Shop in Laguna Hills. "They want to know the 
history behind the traditional Scottish patterns." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional plaids like the black watch -- in forest green, black and navy -- 
are often hard to keep in stock. "There's an interest in their history that 
adds to their look," Davidson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they're popular and can add a great splash of color to an outfit, 
there are ways of getting carried away with plaids. If you're going to wear a 
red plaid skirt, be careful of the plaid bow you select for your hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mixing plaids is a bad idea," Davidson says. "It doesn't look like you've put 
much thought into what you're wearing." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time it can really work is if you're wearing the same basic pattern 
and color, but it has bigger or smaller squares," says Sandy Miller of Twice 
the Style in Costa Mesa. "They have to be compatible. Otherwise, the only time 
a mix of plaids works is if it's in a patchwork pattern where four or five 
plaids in the same color range are used." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some people become so enamored with a particular pattern that they 
match it with a scarf or blouse, "it's best to wear a solid with a plaid," says 
Davidson, "something that draws out a color in the pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 There are more subtle ways of showing off a pattern. "You can wear a plaid 
blazer with what appears to be a solid, pleated skirt," Davidson says. "But 
underneath the pleats is a matching pattern, so it's only visible when you 
walk."

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: MS. ANTOINETTE LIBERATES THE CORSET SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA KAUFMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before corsets became a mainstay of Paris and Milan runways, Jeannette 
Luther (also known as Ms. Antoinette) was sewing the sensuous undergarments in 
her bedroom and selling them through a catalogue of snapshots she took of 
herself modeling her creations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen years later, sales of Versatile Fashions by Ms. Antoinette corsets 
are, in her words, "exploding," with gross receipts expected to hit $700,000 
this year and the $1-million mark in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther finds it easy to explain the enduring romance of the corset, a 
close-fitting undergarment worn from the hips to the breasts.  
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with making women feel beautiful outside; then they work on 
feeling beautiful inside their soul," says Luther, a woman with red ponytail 
cascading down her back, silver flecked eyelashes and two-inch-long black 
fingernails drizzled with gold and silver nail polish. "Eternal youth comes 
along with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Versatile's customers include comedian Roseanne and singers Madonna and Pat 
Benatar. Most of the company's clients are in their 30s or 40s. "They're so 
excited about finding a new fashion statement," says Luther, who says she's in 
her 50s. "This is elegant; this is strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Women often experience an adrenaline rush when they see their waistlines 
reduced, Luther says. "It's exciting to see them change something." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most of Luther's designs are worn over clothing. That wasn't the case 
until a few years ago, when clothing styles became more form-fitting and 
brought the undergarments out of hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of her business is mail-order through her catalogue, with the 
majority of sales to specialty shops across the United States. Victoria's 
Secret in January will begin carrying her designs. "I can't make shipments fast 
enough to Japan," Luther adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther began experimenting with corsets in 1976, after contacting John 
Sutcliff, owner of Atomage, an exotic fashion house in London. Sutcliff 
introduced Luther to a cross-dresser and designer of corsets who had his 
boutique near Stratford-on-Avon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw corsets in the fabrics I had dreamed about, in silks and brocades," 
Luther says.  
</P>
<P>
 The designer, who dressed as Marilyn Monroe, taught her some of the basics of 
corsetry and served as a role model. "He was living his fantasy. That gave me 
permission to live mine. It gave me a safe haven to express myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Today Luther works out of a 2,000-square-foot factory in Orange. There's also 
a retail store in Anaheim and a separate space where corsets are assembled. 
"We're pushed way to the max," says Luther, who's scouting for a space to 
consolidate her operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Versatile's most popular models are the Ribbon ($109) and the Majesty ($289). 
The ribbon corset of polyurethane with Lycra and satin, which comes in lengths 
of eight to 11 1/2 inches, features webbing in a material similar to that used 
in seat belts. With tapering around the hips and back lacing, it resembles a 
Renaissance-style belt. 
</P>
<P>
 The back-lacing Majesty has sweetheart form cups and 36 stays, the greatest 
number of any of Versatile's corsets, resulting in the most figure-shaping, 
Luther says. Stays are 1/4-inch wide, lightweight steel bars that run the 
length of the corset. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna models a black satin Majesty in one of the photographs in her "Sex" 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 The Majesty of Chinese silk brocade each comes in hues of red, burgundy, 
sapphire blue, white and off-white. Corsets of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, a 
shiny fabric resembling patent leather that's machine washable, is gaining in 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venus model in waist sizes up to 38 is popular with large-sized women. 
Similar to the pipe corsets of the past, it creates the illusion of being 
taller and longer-waisted. And, Luther says, often the corseted effect is more 
dramatic on Rubenesque women, such as Roseanne, who picked up a black satin 
Venus at a Chicago boutique and was so pleased she wore it for a recent People 
magazine cover shoot, Luther says. 
</P>
<P>
 Luther's stays were originally whalebone, but she later switched to steel 
stays custom-made in Europe. In the Victorian era, whalebone stays were 
extremely stiff and sometimes poked through the fabric. But the fancy and 
expensive undergarments, "did mean you were well off," Luther says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, well-bred girls from the age of 4 were fitted with juvenile corsets, 
and, by adulthood, their back muscles had atrophied so they could not sit or 
stand for long unsupported. It also made it impossible to draw a deep breath, 
leading one 1929 correspondent to the fashion magazine London Life to insist 
tight lacing "gives a numbed buoyant feeling, which in time becomes a delight, 
in spite of the discomfort and in time acts much as a drug for it cannot be 
done without . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a perfect example of abusing corsets," says Versatile's manufacturing 
supervisor, Cecilia Echeverria. "We encourage people to wear them but to learn 
to wear them." They have an instructive video tape and a brochure on how to 
corset. 
</P>
<P>
 Corsets do reposition internal organs and compress the ribs but, Luther says, 
they are safe as long as laces are not pulled too tightly. And Luther says an 
orthopedic surgeon examined her creations early on to make sure they wouldn't 
damage the wearers. The doctor recommended a satin guard be inserted beneath 
the lacing to cushion the spinal column which she did. 
</P>
<P>
 Versatile's corsets range in price from $49 to $379. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears corsets' sentimental value leads some loyalists to hang onto them 
even when they've become a bit tattered. Every so often, Luther receives a 
well-worn corset in the mail. "It looks like World War II, but they want me to 
re-brace it," Luther says.

OFF THE CUFF; DRESSED UP WITH ALL THE TRIMMINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I t's the holiday season, and, if you're lucky, those party invitations have 
been coming since Thanksgiving. Dressing up is easy if you're Santa -- you just 
drag out that old red suit and make your entrance. But what about women who 
don't want to wear the same tired stuff to every get-together?  
</P>
<P>
 Sam Smith, owner of Rebel Smith Collection in Villa del Sol in Fullerton and 
Triangle Square in Costa Mesa, says you can stretch your festive wardrobe 
allowance by accessorizing an outfit to make it look different for each 
occasion.  
</P>
<P>
 As a fashion consultant, she advises her clients to mix up complementary 
accessories to create the attention-getting devices they're looking for.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allows people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.

</P>
<P>
 The hardest thing about the holidays is figuring out what to wear to 
last-minute parties. None of us has time to shop on the spur of the moment, but 
if you shop wisely beforehand, you can create new looks for new occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 I would suggest purchasing a simple pantsuit or dress in a solid color with a 
great line that looks different by adding different necklaces or earrings, 
putting on a vest or a velvet blazer, or wearing it with a pump or a granny 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine or rich brown colors that are popular this season can be accented 
with gold jewelry, a lace vest or velvet bolero. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a lady come in the other night saying, "I need something for a party." 
She was looking for a "party dress" with beads. Instead, I suggested a stretchy 
dress in Lycra velvet with a turtleneck and a nice line. We paired it with an 
antique necklace with brushed gold and brushed gold earrings, and that's all 
she needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women think everything has to match: the necklace, purse, shoes. That's 
boring. What makes an outfit interesting is what is used to put it all 
together. It's like walking into a room with interesting artifacts. You want to 
look at each one, and you don't want everything to look the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories are so hard for so many people, but they are what make an outfit. 
A black dress can be enhanced with a beautiful pearl necklace with a pewter 
heart, wonderful antique pewter earrings with semiprecious stones and a vintage 
velvet handbag. 
</P>
<P>
 You should never throw away your accessories, but use them year after year 
with an updated silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 Over-accessorizing is tacky. You have to look at an outfit and ask, "Do I need 
this belt, or will it conflict with the necklace?" Simple looks the best. I try 
never to overdress; I try to be elegantly underdressed rather than gussied up. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much confidence you have, you always ask yourself, "Do I look 
right?" Especially if your job is to dress other people. I go to my closet and 
ask, "What am I going to wear?" I wish I had someone who would dress me.

BEHIND THE SCENES: A TOUCH OF FANTASY; CHRISTMAS FASHION SHOW FEATURES 
SUMPTUOUS FABRICS THAT FEEL AS GOOD AS THEY LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holiday wrappings are all about sumptuous fabrics that are as gorgeous to the 
touch as they are to the eye. That was the resounding message from Giorgio 
Armani, TSE Cashmere, Calvin Klein, Fendi and other design houses that 
presented their winter wares Tuesday at "A Christmas Fantasy" fashion show 
luncheon at the Ritz Carlton in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 About 650 guests turned out for the 10th anniversary event, which is sponsored 
by South Coast Plaza and benefits the South County Community Clinic Auxiliary. 
The San Juan Capistrano clinic provides health-care services annually to more 
than 18,000 uninsured and under-insured patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatrics swept the runway, at times in a most unconventional way. Dancers 
moved the lunching ladies with their hip-hop maneuvers around luggage from 
Bottega Veneta. Even the ever-sensible Easy Spirit pumps were given a, uh, sexy 
boost via levitation from a magician and models clad in skimpy Santa costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 From couture to junior fashions, the clothes showcased seemed to beg to be 
touched: Velvet, silk, cashmere and brushed wool were generously used. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out trousers ultra-flared or slim, plus vests, jackets and dresses in 
black velvet from Emporio Armani. Along the same feel, the lace patterns of a 
see-through bodysuit and tank dress are fuzzy like velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rampage opted for a wilder look of velvet and netting with leopard, although 
it brought black velvet back for prom-ish evening dresses. Tip: Try the plaid, 
'50-inspired bustier dress. Complete with a mini crinoline, it's sexy and punk. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Klein recalls Jean Harlow in long, vanilla silk gowns that ooze 
glamour. For day, pieces keep the ease simply with minimal seams. Barneys New 
York continued the theme, presenting silk, shiny and black, in a suit dress and 
raw in a gorgeous green Nehru jacket and slim pants, plus a Chinese silk vest 
paired with a long, flowing skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfy knits colored heather, cream, wheat and barley were shown from TSE 
Cashmere and Joan & David. And the wrap -- in velvet from Armani or wool dotted 
with fur balls from Fendi -- for these parts seems like a viable option to a 
heavy winter coat.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this crowd went craziest for sparkle.  
</P>
<P>
 Glimmering paillettes cover trousers and jackets from St. John (including a 
fun taxi-check pattern). And Lili Rubin provided the glitz of sequins, beads 
and rhinestones that O.C. women are so fond of for those New Year's Eve society 
galas. ROSE APODACA JONES

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; CASA TERESA IS MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER PORT IN A STORM; 
SUPPORTERS AND GRADUATES OF THE SHELTER FOR PREGNANT, HOMELESS WOMEN CELEBRATE 
ITS SUCCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A holiday luncheon staged by the Founders Guild of Casa Teresa, a shelter for 
homeless pregnant women, heard three young women tell what it's like to be 
single, pregnant and without a home. 
</P>
<P>
 The women spoke to about 100 guild members and guests Monday at the Ritz 
Restaurant in Newport Beach. The luncheon was not a fund-raiser, but a 
celebration of the Orange-based shelter's good deeds. Survivors' Stories 
</P>
<P>
 At first this seemed like a traditional holiday get-together, complete with 
glowing Christmas trees and garland, holiday music and a feast of roast goose. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when Sherri Riggle and Shari Bainhill, two young mothers who have 
graduated from the Casa Teresa program, and current Casa resident Becky 
Eckerle, took turns at the podium and spoke briefly about their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 In her green velvet dress, Riggle looked no different than the other 
well-dressed women attending the holiday luncheon. Yet four years ago she was 
pregnant and had no place to live. A high school counselor referred her to Casa 
Teresa, and she stayed there from April 1990 to November 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff members were always there for me. They gave me a lot of support, 
which was what a 17-year-old having a baby needs," said Riggle, who attended 
the gala with her 4-year-old daughter, Brandi, in tow. Riggle stayed at Casa 
for two months after her daughter was born before moving into an apartment with 
an old Casa roommate. She is now married and has a two-year-old son, her own 
home and a job with a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is very good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Casa residents, like Eckerle, are from broken homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel at home at Casa Teresa, and I haven't had a home in a long 
time," Eckerle told the group. Casa Opens Doors 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Teresa started in 1976, when founder Sally Sullivan and her husband 
purchased an apartment building where women 18 or older could stay and have 
their babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was such a need for housing for pregnant women over 18. There was 
nowhere for them to go," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women come to the home after they have broken up with a boyfriend and 
find themselves pregnant but without a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Others "have families who kicked them out of the house," said Jennifer 
Spindler, president of the Founders Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 Women stay at Casa Teresa for up to two months after their baby is born. 
During this time, they receive counseling and assistance in finding a permanent 
place to live. The shelter can accommodate 25 women at a time. Casa Teresa also 
operates a second, transitional shelter that provides low-income housing for 
the new mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the women leave, they often stay in touch with the shelter and with 
their companions -- volunteers who help the women before and after their 
pregnancies. Riggle is still friends with her companion, Christine Paddon. The 
two attended the luncheon together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've adopted her," Paddon says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my second mom," Riggle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests included: Mary Burnell, luncheon chairwomen; Mary Frome, guilds 
founder; Dr. Jim Pugh, staff psychologist at Casa; Jean Mayo, Lissa Callaghan, 
Carol Thomson, Lee Ann Marienthal, Lucy Polito and Madeleine Marin-Finn.KATHRYN

SANTA ANA DISTRICT GETS 'SPACE-SAVER' SCHOOL OK; EDUCATION: UNTRIED PROGRAM 
WILL BE TESTED. STATE PANEL REJECTS CRITICISM THAT BRISTOL MARKETPLACE SITE IS 
TOO COSTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state panel gave the green light Wednesday to the Santa Ana Unified School 
District's experimental space-saver school proposal, rejecting criticism from 
local residents and state real estate experts that the project will prove too 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Allocation Board, which disburses funds for school sites and 
construction, voted unanimously to approve an appraisal of an 11-acre site in 
Santa Ana's Bristol MarketPlace shopping complex, where the school district 
hopes to build the first space-saver school in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major relief," said Robert W. Balen, a member of the Santa Ana 
school board. "I'm extremely glad we could do this for the schoolkids in our 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics pointed to a report by state real estate experts suggesting the 
Bristol MarketPlace parcel was up to five times more costly than several other 
sites -- in part because two existing stores will have to be demolished -- and 
too risky because of toxic contamination from leaky gas tanks at an auto center 
on the property. The report said the parcel will cost $40 a square foot 
compared to $8 to $15 a square foot at other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board made a bad decision," said Santa Ana Councilwoman Lisa 
Mills, who led the fight against the project. "What is the purpose of this 
board if not to ensure the proper use of public funds?" 
</P>
<P>
 The still-untested state space-saver program is designed to find school sites 
in crowded cities, such as Santa Ana, that are experiencing a space crunch. 
Instead of resorting to condemnation proceedings to tear down neighborhoods, 
the program allows districts to apply for funds to build multistory schools in 
conjunction with existing commercial centers, parks or other unique sites. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials first approved the idea in the late 1980s, but no school 
district has yet been able to come up with a workable plan to capitalize on it. 
Santa Ana school officials, facing a shortage of space for 18,000 students by 
the end of this decade, have worked eagerly to become the state's first 
district to successfully tap into the program. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a brief exchange with the allocation board, Mills argued that the 
seven-member panel was ignoring provisions of the law that do not allow a 
space-saver school when more affordable sites are available. 
</P>
<P>
 "To spend $40 a foot and tear down a new HomeBase building is not a good use 
of the taxpayers' dollars," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allocation board members rejected the notion that they should become embroiled 
in a local political dispute between Santa Ana school district officials and 
residents of neighborhoods surrounding the project. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who sits on the allocation board 
and lobbied heavily on behalf of Santa Ana school officials for the space-saver 
project, said that opponents had "contaminated" the allocation effort with 
"misinformation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public should have faith in the process that was used," Bergeson 
said after the decision. "There's been a lot of misunderstandings, but I think 
it has been dealt with responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
 Balen and other Santa Ana school officials, meanwhile, argued that the threat 
of toxic contamination had been overblown by critics. District officials say 
there has been no ground-water contamination and that the property owner has 
agreed to clean up the gas spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Before approving the project, the allocation board added several provisions to 
ensure the contamination has been cleaned up and make the seller responsible if 
problems crop up in the future because of the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also contend that cheaper sites had been deemed unsuitable 
as candidates for the space-saver program, an effort to combine schools with 
businesses and other uses in congested cities, where undeveloped land is hard 
to come by. Before giving its blessing in October, the state Department of 
Education concluded there were only three other sites within the city suitable 
for an intermediate school, but all were too isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious there are cheaper parcels, but none had the right combination of 
size, location, configuration or a willing property owner," Balen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the property's final price tag has not been hammered out, the state 
set aside nearly $23 million last year to buy the parcel in Bristol 
MarketPlace, a shopping center at 17th and Bristol streets. To make way for the 
school, an existing HomeBase store and a Montgomery Wards automotive center 
will have to be demolished. Plans call for a two-story intermediate school to 
be built atop a parking lot that will used by shopping center customers. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), an allocation board member and author 
of the bill that paved the way for the space-saver program, said the Bristol 
MarketPlace site "frankly doesn't meet the image of the law as I envisioned 
it." But he argued that Santa Ana school officials had properly followed the 
allocation board's guidelines for selecting the property and would be getting 
money years sooner than had they applied under traditional school-funding 
procedures.

KNOTT FAMILY OFFERS REWARD IN BLUDGEONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family that operates Knott's Berry Farm offered a $10,000 reward Wednesday 
for information in the bludgeoning of a 17-year-old great-granddaughter of the 
park's late founder, Walter Knott, as she slept in her San Diego County home. 
</P>
<P>
 Desire Anderson, an honor student and figure skater aspiring to be a doctor, 
has remained in a coma and on life-support systems since the attack in her 
bedroom just after midnight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all in shock," said Marion Knott of Newport Beach, Desire's 
grandmother. "This is a beautiful young girl who has everything going for her. 
She's outstanding. So sweet and so gentle." 
</P>
<P>
 Knott said the family was offering the reward "because we have no motive, no 
idea why anybody would do this." Sheriff's deputies "have no leads on who would 
do it. This is out of the blue. It's an area where nothing like this ever 
happens. It's the most secure little community you've ever been in." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's condition is "critical, day-to-day," Knott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said an intruder apparently entered the family home in the 4400 block 
of La Canada in south Fallbrook through an unlocked door or window. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Anderson, Desire's mother, told deputies she heard someone in her 
daughter's bedroom. The intruder "fled when her mother heard the noise and 
called out to her from the master bedroom," Lt. Doug Clements said. Anderson 
"then went to her room when she received no response," Clements said. "She 
discovered her daughter was seriously injured and called 911." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said Wednesday that the family's four-acre horse ranch is on a 
private road, that she recognizes the sound of every vehicle that uses it, and 
that she did not believe the attacker drove. She also said she believed the 
intruder came through a window, although she wouldn't say why. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lived there for 24 years and never locked a door," Anderson said. "This 
is the old country." But not locking the doors and windows "was wrong," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've cried and cried and cried for three days," Anderson said. But Wednesday, 
she added, Desire's "vibrations were more positive than they've been. Today I 
really felt good. She's going to come home and sleep in her own bed soon, I 
know this. It's like a movie that you watch on television, and you never think 
it's going to happen to you. My daughter's going to make it. She's my partner." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who suffered blunt trauma injuries to the head, was taken by Life 
Flight helicopter to Palomar Memorial Hospital, Escondido, where she is listed 
in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott family members said they believe that a hammer ws used in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A supervisor with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Fallbrook "is 
not crime-ridden at all. It's real rural, avocado and citrus ranches, middle to 
high income. It's a very small, quiet community, right next to the southern 
part of Camp Pendleton. There are a few problems with Marines and illegal 
aliens from time to time -- the usual. But it's not like the rest of the 
county. It's pretty quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior at Fallbrook High School, Desire expected to apply to colleges this 
week and plans to be a doctor, her grandmother said. A member of the French 
club, she had completed all the French courses the school offers and had become 
a French teacher's aide. She doesn't date, and spends most of her time outside 
school training as a competitive figure skater, Marion Knott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is absolutely the most beautiful, gentle girl you would want to meet," 
Knott said, fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager's uncle, Daryl Anderson of Newport Beach, said the family is 
"stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the American tragedy," Anderson said. "You think it will happen to 
someone else and never to your own family. You just don't know what to do or 
who to turn to when something like this happens. It's just one of those 
stunning things." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who is a partner in Knott's Berry Farm, described his niece as an 
A-student whose primary focus is academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very quiet and very smart and very involved in what she does," he said. 
"She was in the process of applying for colleges for the fall of 1995." 
Anderson said Desire's first choice for college UC San Diego, where she plans 
to study premed. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncle said the family is desperate to find whoever attacked the teen-ager 
and hopes the reward will motivate someone to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information is asked to contact Homicide Team II at the San Diego 
County Sheriff's Department at (619) 692-5600. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the family continues its vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a waiting game," Anderson said. "Right now, we're just waiting for 
Desire." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Knott, Desire's great-uncle, said Desire is an only child whose 
parents are divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 "She and her mother are very devoted -- just like the Bobbsey Twins," Knott 
said. "They are very close." 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker, Diane Anderson said, "must have been a very sick individual."

U.S. WILLING TO PROVIDE TROOPS TO AID A PULLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has agreed in principle to send U.S. troops to help 
evacuate U.N. peacekeeping forces from Bosnia if the United Nations or the 
European allies ever request such help, U.S. officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, made earlier this week by the President's top national security 
advisers, is expected to be conveyed to the European allies by Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher at a meeting today of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials stressed that the United States has not yet received a request 
to help evacuate U.N. peacekeeping troops, and policy-makers said they see 
little prospect that the United Nations will actually decide to withdraw its 
forces any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 They also insisted that the Pentagon has not yet completed plans for 
evacuating the U.N. forces, which now include about 24,000 British, French, 
Canadian and other troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not aware of any contingency plan," Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials said top presidential advisers have agreed in 
principle -- with President Clinton's informal concurrence -- that the United 
States would participate in a multinational effort to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials said no details are yet available, outside military 
analysts speculated that the operation could require 4,000 U.S. ground troops 
and dozens of NATO warplanes to provide air cover. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether such an operation would include about 
2,000 Marines now aboard a Navy helicopter carrier in the Adriatic Sea off the 
Bosnian coast. The warship was sent to the region over the weekend to rescue 
NATO pilots or U.N. forces if they got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to assure NATO in advance that U.S. forces will help in any 
evacuation was intended to assuage the allies, who have been critical of U.S. 
policy -- particularly after Clinton announced that U.S. forces no longer will 
enforce an arms ban against Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration had promised the United Nations and the allies months ago 
that it would consider any formal request to help in extracting U.N. 
peacekeeping forces, but it has not yet indicated officially that it is willing 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Wednesday that the decision to accommodate a U.N. or 
allied request for help is contingent on U.S. approval of operational details 
and consultations with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the move, which would mark the first time U.S. ground troops would 
set foot in Bosnia, could prove controversial at home. Congressional 
Republicans have warned that they will push to block any attempt to use U.S. 
ground troops in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, wrapping up a trip to NATO 
headquarters Wednesday, used a series of television interviews to attack NATO, 
the United Nations and what he called U.S. acquiescence to Europe's Bosnia 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been following the European plan for the last two years," Dole said, 
asserting it has produced 200,000 deaths and no negotiated solution. "It's time 
for a new option." 
</P>
<P>
 Military experts said the job of evacuating U.N. peacekeeping forces from 
Bosnia could be difficult and potentially risky, depending on conditions 
imposed by the combatants, the Serb nationalist forces and the largely Muslim 
Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they would hope to negotiate a "permissive withdrawal," 
under which the U.N. forces would be allowed to travel unharassed to airplanes 
and to seaports. U.S. forces would provide security and sea and air 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if either the Serbs or the Muslims decided to challenge the U.N. 
forces militarily, the United States and its NATO allies could be forced to 
evacuate the U.N. units under combat conditions, requiring a heavily armed 
force that would fight its way in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts familiar with military thinking on the issue said that could require 
at least 4,000 ground troops and as many as 15,000. It would also require 
massive air strikes by NATO warplanes to knock out Serbian missiles and 
artillery. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told 
reporters Wednesday that evacuating the U.N. troops from Bosnia would require 
"a significant force. (It is) something that is not done with just a handful of 
forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Strategists said the evacuation could be a drawn-out operation. Kofi Annan, 
the U.N.'s top peacekeeping official, told reporters Monday that a full-fledged 
evacuation would take at least 165 days, and some analysts said it could 
require almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Much would depend on whether the Serb nationalists and Muslims posed a threat 
to U.N. and U.S. troops -- either out of longstanding anger at their 
intervention or resentment at their pulling out -- and whether the peacekeepers 
were allowed to travel to airfields or seaports. 
</P>
<P>
 The assurances to the allies marked the latest in a series of such steps that 
the Administration has taken in an effort to heal the rift in NATO that has 
followed the U.S. decision to stop enforcing the U.N. arms embargo against the 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.S. officials disclosed Monday that the Administration had agreed to 
suspend its longstanding calls for more NATO air strikes and instead back a 
European proposal to allow the nationalists to form a federation with 
Yugoslavia if they accept a U.N. peace plan.

SALVADORANS GIRD FOR LOSSES AS SPECIAL STATUS IN U.S. ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The streets of this tiny village are paved with dollars from Los Angeles and 
other U.S. cities where Salvadorans live, work and prop up their home country's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most houses have tiled floors, iron gates and fresh coats of pastel paint. 
There is an ambulance. The children wear shoes and ride bicycles, and the 
church was built with money sent from some of the estimated 1 million 
Salvadorans who fled the country during 12 years of civil war and now reside in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not know what we would do without the help," said Leonor Guzman de 
Arauz, 62, whose six children live in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Clinton Administration prepares to end a special protected-status 
program for Salvadorans, officials and residents are assessing the impact on 
towns like this and on a nation that is exceedingly dependent on remittances. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary program had allowed many Salvadorans to remain and work in the 
United States because war raged at home. Now the war is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Although massive deportations are not expected with the end of the program, 
Salvadoran officials fear that any sizable return of its citizens will deal a 
devastating blow to a delicate postwar economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's barely enough work for those of us here, what will those who come 
back do?" bricklayer Jose Oscar Rivera asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll come to be hungry like the rest of us," said his wife, Juana Bonilla, 
seated at a tamale stand in front of their small home in San Jose la Paz 
Arriba. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla is a member of the town's improvements committee, which channels the 
money that comes in regularly from relatives in the United States. Towns 
throughout El Salvador have similar committees with partner organizations in 
U.S. cities, and the money goes to repairing roads and remodeling homes and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Salvadorans also use the money for such basics as paying light and water 
bills and buying food, or for luxuries such as television sets and 
videocassette recorders. Some invest, using the income to set up small 
mom-and-pop markets or other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvadoran Central Bank estimates that remittances this year will top $1 
billion, almost as much as all exports income combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that more than a third of all Salvadoran families have at 
least one relative in the United States, and remittances account for 60% of the 
income of families who receive them. 
</P>
<P>
 More worrisome than the potential decline in dollars, say Salvadoran 
officials, is the capacity of the domestic job market to absorb an influx of 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, El Salvador's social services and infrastructure, such as electrical 
grids, hospitals and roads, were destroyed during the war and are only slowly 
being rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Large numbers of new residents would strain the services and utilities, 
Salvadoran officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not prepared to take these immigrants," Foreign Minister Oscar 
Santamaria said. "That is why we ask the U.S. government to understand that the 
Salvadoran people are trying to consolidate the pacification process. If our 
petition is not heard, it will jeopardize our national stability." 
</P>
<P>
 "You would have here a social problem worse than the war," union leader 
Rosario Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 years, leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front battled U.S.-backed forces to a virtual standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N.-brokered peace accords in 1992 ended the brutal conflict, which claimed 
tens of thousands of lives and propelled a massive exodus, primarily to Los 
Angeles, Houston and Washington. Families were scattered as Salvadorans fled in 
search of peace and economic opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of U.S. support for Salvadoran governments, it was difficult for 
Salvadorans to obtain political asylum. After years of legal wrangling, 
immigrant advocates in 1990 won congressional approval for the temporary 
program that immediately gave almost 200,000 Salvadorans the legal right to 
reside and work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was extended several times, but it expires Dec. 31 and is not 
expected to win renewal, despite pleas from Salvadoran President Armando 
Calderon Sol and others. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the lobbying effort behind an extension was intense, if unsuccessful. 
It saw a rare uniting of forces that included the right-wing government, the 
leftist former guerrillas and a wide array of American advocate groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, Alan Flanigan, also argued for an 
extension, saying ending the protected status will have dire consequences by 
driving Salvadorans underground and reducing the income they provide families 
in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many families who receive remittances reside . . . in the principal 
ex-conflict zones where the greatest civil war fighting took place," Flanigan 
stated in a cable to the U.S. State Department earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are among the poorest areas in El Salvador. The effect of significantly 
reduced remittances would be economically disastrous for these areas. In fact, 
it would probably lead to increased illegal immigration to the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Some immigrant advocates and leftist politicians here contend that it was U.S. 
policy that drove Salvadorans to the United States in the first place, and 
therefore Washington ought to give El Salvador a break. 
</P>
<P>
 But others in Congress and from organizations that want to restrict 
immigration argue that the special status was always intended to be temporary, 
and the time for it to end has come. 
</P>
<P>
 The dependence on dollars from the United States has also had plenty of 
negative effects on the Salvadoran economy. It has created a culture of 
dependency among many Salvadorans, who find it easier to await the regular 
remittance check than to get a job. 
</P>
<P>
 While the infusion of cash enables El Salvador to cover its huge trade 
deficit, it also distorts the local economy by inflating housing and land 
prices and overvaluing the colon, the national monetary unit. 
</P>
<P>
 For ordinary Salvadorans, however, such distortions seem to be dwarfed by the 
way in which the money helps people get by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Entire families make ends meet with those dollars," said Rosita Gonzalez, a 
homemaker in San Jose la Paz Arriba. Seated in her well-appointed home, with 
two wall-chime clocks and a full set of living-room furniture, Gonzalez fretted 
that even though the war is over, a tidal wave of crime continues to make El 
Salvador a dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no war, but we live under threat," she said. "We are not at peace." 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years painting houses in Marin County, Hector Manuel Romero returned 
to nearby Santiago Nonualco, the town that is the county seat for this area, 
where he lives off the interest from money he banked, plus income from renting 
two homes he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left here, I had nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Alidio Vasquez, the mayor of Santiago, calculated that at least half of 
the county's 67,000 residents depend on income from relatives living in the 
States, some legal, some illegal and most in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority seek out Los Angeles because of the language," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he expects to inaugurate in January a park dedicated to 
Santiagoans living in Los Angeles. He was interviewed at the Santiago stadium 
during a Saturday morning soccer game. Inside the stadium, graffiti covering 
the green walls announced the presence of "Mara Salvatrucha," a notorious Los 
Angeles gang made up of Salvadorans. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said he is mortified that many of his compatriots may be forced 
underground or deported. In the best of times, about 40 area residents travel 
to the United States each month, he said. But already county officials are 
beginning to notice a drop-off. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the remittances are cut, it would be like having a business that was in 
the red every month," he said. "There would be a huge damage for the whole 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans have always helped us," Vasquez continued. "If they can't send 
aid, then at least they should help us by keeping our brothers there."

MEXICO'S NEW LEADER UNVEILS DIVERSE CABINET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President-elect Ernesto Zedillo, promising an era of historic reform on the 
eve of his inauguration, on Wednesday unveiled a new government of veteran 
technocrats, hard-line ruling-party stalwarts, trusted personal aides and -- 
for the first time in almost seven decades -- an opposition member. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they will attempt to steer Mexico into the 21st Century through a 
minefield of political crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominated by free-market economic reformers, the "mixed-bag" Cabinet of 23 men 
and two women, mostly younger than 45, is expected to have a positive long-term 
effect on foreign investment and expanding trade with the United States under 
the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The new team named by the 42-year-old economist who will take office in a 
daylong celebration today includes Treasury Secretary Jaime Serra Puche and 
Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are veteran technocrats in the Cabinet of outgoing President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari and chief architects of his radical economic reform 
policies. Both are well known and respected in the United States for their key 
role in negotiating NAFTA last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid political infighting and unsolved assassinations that threaten to 
tear apart Zedillo's long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, 
from within, the new president also gave a key Cabinet post to the party's 
controversial chairman, Ignacio Pichardo, who was recently accused by Mexico's 
former deputy attorney general of obstructing justice in the unsolved Sept. 28 
assassination of PRI Secretary General Francisco Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's stock market, up nearly a point before Zedillo's noon Cabinet 
announcement, fell sharply in the afternoon, apparently on the news of 
Pichardo's appointment as secretary of energy, mines and state industry -- a 
key post that includes management of the state's powerful oil monopoly, Pemex, 
and the Federal Electricity Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts, however, saw the appointment as an appeasement to party 
hard-liners, and they said they expected the market to recover Friday or early 
next week on the basis of Zedillo's other major appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those key appointments was Foreign Secretary Jose Angel Gurria, a 
gregarious economist and prominent Zedillo campaign aide who is also well known 
in Washington and other foreign capitals for his lead role in renegotiating 
Mexico's foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Zedillo intended it to be a mixed-bag Cabinet," Mexican political 
analyst Sergio Sarmiento said. "On the one hand, Zedillo is keeping with 
tradition, appointing the president of PRI to a Cabinet position, although he 
could have been excused for not doing so this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, he has named a member of the opposition as attorney 
general, who now will make sure these unsolved crimes are investigated 
thoroughly and independently. It's a crucial position, and it really changes 
the rules of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 In naming Antonio Lozano, a 41-year-old veteran of the leading opposition 
National Action Party, as the nation's top law-enforcement official, Zedillo 
broke a 65-year PRI tradition of naming only ruling-party members to the inner 
circle of government. 
</P>
<P>
 As attorney general, Lozano will take over the controversial, unsolved 
investigations into the assassinations of Ruiz Massieu in September and Luis 
Donaldo Colosio in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, the PRI's popular, reformist presidential candidate, was gunned down 
at a campaign rally in Tijuana, which led to Zedillo's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Mexicans believe that both were political murders hatched by internal 
party conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
 That theory was bolstered last week by Ruiz Massieu's brother, Mario, who as 
deputy attorney general investigated his murder for two months before resigning 
and publicly alleging that PRI Chairman Pichardo was part of a conspiracy to 
cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Ruiz Massieu, speaking on a Santa Monica radio program Wednesday, 
appeared to regard the Lozano appointment as good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the facts that I gathered were included in my initial investigation 
(report) that I have turned over, and now that there will be an impartial 
investigator, I'm sure that they will all come to light," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts viewed Lozano's appointment as a clear signal by Zedillo that he 
intends to fulfill promises of sweeping political reforms, which include 
officially separating the ruling party from the government apparatus, reducing 
the monolithic power of the Mexican presidency, separating the judiciary from 
politics and ushering in a new era of political pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cabinet shows the thrust of the Zedillo Administration -- continuity of 
the economic program, depoliticization of the Interior Ministry and the federal 
district of Mexico City, and creating an independent judiciary," concluded 
Fernando Escalante, a sociologist and judicial expert at the Colegio de Mexico 
graduate school in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the eve of today's celebration officially christening Zedillo as 
Mexico's president for the next six years, other analysts were less impressed 
with the Cabinet that is inheriting a widespread sense of national insecurity 
fueled by soaring rates of kidnaping, narcotics trafficking and street crime 
and a looming civil war in the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Cabinet still has a lot to prove. It's not very impressive at all," 
observed Emilio Zebadua, an economics professor at the Colegio de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's full of contradictions, and there's the possibility they will not be 
able to deal effectively with these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But even Zebadua praised one of Zedillo's appointments as "an opening" to 
solve the most immediate and dire of those problems -- the simmering conflict 
in Chiapas, where leaders of the indigenous rebel group, the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army, have threatened to break a fragile cease-fire and relaunch 
their armed insurrection, which left scores dead in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost universally acclaimed was Zedillo's selection of Arturo Warman as 
secretary of agriculture and natural resources, which Zebadua called "an 
opening for an enlightened person to come up with a proposal for Chiapas." 
</P>
<P>
 Warman, 57, is an expert on land reform and indigenous Mexican tribes, and his 
book on Mexican independence leader Emiliano Zapata, titled "We Came to 
Object," has become mandatory reading in most Mexican schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Warman's Cabinet post will enable him to negotiate crucial Zapatista demands 
for equitable distribution of land rights and natural resources in the 
embattled state. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most powerful new Cabinet members, though, is also the least known: 
Interior Secretary Esteban Moctezuma Barragan. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts identified Moctezuma as Zedillo's closest personal adviser, who, like 
Zedillo himself, has little experience in Mexico's rough-and-tumble politics 
and its accompanying intrigues. 
</P>
<P>
 But analyst Sarmiento said Moctezuma, a lawyer-turned-technocrat, "has a 
reputation of being a good administrator," adding that his appointment to 
manage the nation's most sensitive public-security agencies is an indication 
that Zedillo saved the most critical departments for the people he trusts most.

BOSNIAN SERBS SNUB U.N. CHIEF; BALKANS: REBELS' REFUSAL TO MEET BOUTROS-GHALI 
SIGNALS END OF TOLERANCE FOR FOREIGN EFFORTS. HE ALSO ANGERS MUSLIMS BY URGING 
REGIME TO CONCEDE ON TRUCE TERMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bosnian Serbs delivered a humiliating snub to one of the world's most 
prominent diplomats Wednesday, refusing to meet U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali and sounding a death knell on their tolerance for foreign efforts 
to protect Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali flew into the artillery-encircled Bosnian capital on an urgent 
mission to secure assurances from Serbian rebel leader Radovan Karadzic that 
his nationalist gunmen would halt attacks on the U.N. "safe area" of Bihac and 
stop harassing U.N. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But after being rebuffed for more than five hours by Karadzic, who refused 
even to speak to the U.N. chief by phone, Boutros-Ghali and his international 
entourage left Sarajevo trailing grave warnings about what lies ahead for the 
country's targeted Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian gunmen loyal to Karadzic appear to have concluded that the 24,000 U.N. 
Protection Force peacekeepers deployed in this country have exhausted their 
usefulness as purveyors of humanitarian aid and buffer forces that have 
effectively shielded the rebels from retaliation by Muslim-led Bosnian 
government troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks, Serbian nationalists have defied NATO air strikes and 
plunged deep into the Bihac safe area, seizing nearly half the territory and 
uprooting tens of thousands more civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Two million Bosnians have already been made homeless by the rebels' siege and 
their practice of "ethnic cleansing," and 200,000 -- most of them Muslims -- 
are dead or missing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs have also taken about 500 U.N. troops hostage as insurance against 
further NATO air strikes and refused to release them despite virtual 
capitulation by Western powers on the use of force to protect U.N. enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing his "deep disappointment" at Karadzic's refusal to meet him at the 
U.N.-controlled airport here, Boutros-Ghali said he will not personally 
recommend withdrawing U.N. troops from Bosnia. But he warned that a pullout 
might be inevitable in view of international impatience with the increasingly 
perilous Balkans mission. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials had warned a day earlier that the future of the Bosnian 
deployment was at stake unless Boutros-Ghali's Sarajevo visit produced 
significant breakthroughs toward a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Sarajevo with plans to press both the Serbian rebels and government 
leaders for concessions that would allow a nationwide cease-fire to be declared 
and new negotiations to open on an ethnic division of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "My message to them is that unless they do this, it will become impossible for 
me to persuade the Security Council to keep UNPROFOR here," Boutros-Ghali told 
reporters, in a veiled warning that the mission's days may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic made clear by standing up Boutros-Ghali that continuation of the 
peacekeeping mission was less important to him than it is to the Bosnian 
Muslims, whom the troops were sent to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mostly Muslim government supporters have also grown resentful of the 
U.N. mission. They believe that it has betrayed them by refusing to protect the 
safe areas with air power. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Sarajevans jeered Boutros-Ghali as he left the downtown offices of 
President Alija Izetbegovic, whom he pressed to concede to Serbian rebel terms 
for a cease-fire and surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 A source who accompanied Boutros-Ghali in his discussions with the Bosnian 
president said he "instilled a sense of reality" into the internationally 
recognized Bosnian leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told them, 'Don't expect UNPROFOR to go beyond peacekeeping. We are 
neither structured nor equipped for it. And don't expect massive air strikes. 
Unless you cooperate, there is no way UNPROFOR can stay,' " the official quoted 
Boutros-Ghali as warning the beleaguered government. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. special envoy for the Balkans, Yasushi Akashi, said that in view of 
the swiftly deteriorating military situation that has put peacekeepers at risk, 
the mission's future will be contingent on concessions from the Muslim-led 
Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 "A stark warning was delivered," Akashi told reporters who traveled with him 
from mission headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. "The Bosnians were a bit 
surprised, but I think that surprise was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 An angered Izetbegovic accused the U.N. mission of repeatedly reneging on 
promises to get tough with the recalcitrant Serbs, who have vetoed every 
negotiated settlement the international community has brokered. 
</P>
<P>
 Izetbegovic also appealed for more effective use of NATO air power to protect 
Bosnian civilians taking refuge in the few areas designated by the United 
Nations as protected zones. All six safe areas -- Sarajevo, Bihac, Gorazde, 
Zepa, Srebrenica and Tuzla -- are routinely subjected to Serbian artillery 
fire, but the U.N. mission rejects air strikes as incompatible with its neutral 
peacekeeping role. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does not have the right to be neutral. He should say clearly to the 
French, British and other powers slowing him down that the legal government 
should be defended," Izetbegovic said of Boutros-Ghali after their one-hour 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say this loud and clear," an impassioned Izetbegovic added. "This is 
about a conflict between a democratic and legal government and black fascism." 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali spent most of the rest of his six-hour visit at the sandbagged 
and barbed wire-enclosed forward headquarters of the U.N. commander for Bosnia, 
British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission officials and aides pleaded by telephone with Karadzic underlings for 
a meeting at the airport, but were told that the rebel leader would see 
Boutros-Ghali only at his self-styled capital, Pale, 10 miles east. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not going to go to Pale because the United Nations has recognized the 
Bosnian republic but we have not recognized any other kind of entity," 
Boutros-Ghali told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali reacted with what he termed "great serenity" to the rebel 
leader's snub, saying only that Karadzic had done his people "a great 
disservice." 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the Serbs clearly trying to force a withdrawal of the U.N. 
forces shielding their enemies, the rebels are likely to see the threats to the 
mission as a victory. More on Bosnia (Southland Edition, A8)

NEWS ANALYSIS; TRADE DEBATE COULD SPUR NATIONALISTIC CANDIDACIES; POLITICS: THE 
BATTLE IS FUELING A POPULIST CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT. BUT VOTERS HAVE PROVED WARY 
OF PROTECTIONISTS.

<P>
 The Senate vote expected today on the world trade accord could emerge as one 
of the first events molding the 1996 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
 Like last year's battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement and the 
landslide California vote for Proposition 187 this fall, the debate on the 
world trade agreement has exposed divisions in both parties that could echo 
through the 1996 contest. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the struggle has demonstrated the growing assertiveness of a 
populist conservative movement that fundamentally rejects the pillars of an 
internationalist foreign policy upheld by presidents of both parties since 
World War II: support for open trade, open immigration and extensive diplomatic 
and military engagement abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over the trade pact -- which would create a new World Trade 
Organization to govern global commerce as a successor to the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade -- could focus these issues by raising the possibility of 
presidential candidacies bearing an economic nationalist message in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, a leading critic 
of the trade pact, immigration and foreign alliances, broadly hinted this week 
that he will carry this banner into the 1996 Republican presidential primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, a victory for the trade agreement in the Senate today, as now 
appears likely, could sunder the fleeting alliance between the GOP and Ross 
Perot, who only weeks ago urged his supporters to vote Republican in the 
midterm congressional election. Now, Perot says that if the Senate approves the 
trade agreement, he will start work immediately on his own third party, which 
could become the vehicle for another independent White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they pass it and have insulted the American voters, Ross is going to 
devote his energy to beginning the third political party," says Russell Verney, 
national policy coordinator for Perot's United We Stand, America, Inc. 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But while a Perot party could add a new element of unpredictability to an 
already unstable political environment, history suggests that a purely 
protectionist message may have only limited electoral appeal. While Americans 
typically have voiced protectionist sentiments in public opinion polls, they 
have not rewarded presidential candidates -- from Republican John B. Connally 
in 1980 to Democrats Richard A. Gephardt or Bob Kerrey -- who have sought the 
White House under that banner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are loath to turn over leadership to candidates who run as 
protectionists," says Republican economic consultant Jeff Bell. "That's been 
the rule over the last few decades." 
</P>
<P>
 The most dynamic opposition on the trade issue has come from Perot, Buchanan 
and other conservatives who believe that the agreement will infringe on 
American "sovereignty" by giving the new World Trade Organization authority to 
impose sanctions if it considers U.S. regulations, such as workplace safety 
rules, an unfair barrier to foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
 This growing conservative skepticism about free trade parallels a wider 
turning away by the right from internationalist positions that have become 
traditional for Republicans. As National Security Adviser Anthony Lake put it 
in a speech Wednesday, "There is a dangerous isolationist backlash in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration -- despite protests from a faction led by former Cabinet 
secretaries Jack Kemp and William J. Bennett -- the center of gravity within 
the GOP has shifted toward greater restrictions, such as Proposition 187 and 
the proposal in the House Republican welfare plan to eliminate virtually all 
social welfare benefits for legal immigrants who are not yet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a growing number of Republicans -- who broadly supported 
aggressive engagement abroad during the Cold War -- are reverting to the 
hands-off, even isolationist, positions common in the party through World War 
II. Republicans almost uniformly opposed President Clinton's use of troops in 
Haiti and have questioned the deployment of U.S. troops as part of 
multinational United Nations peacekeeping forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Republican analysts agree that there will be a measurable audience among 
GOP presidential primary voters for an inward-looking populist message that 
blends protectionism, isolationism and opposition to immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 But most experts agree that the size of that audience is limited. Frank Luntz, 
who has polled for both Buchanan and Perot, says that "between 15% and 20%" of 
the GOP primary base might be attracted to an economic nationalist message. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the leading potential 1996 GOP presidential candidates, only Buchanan is 
opposing the trade agreement. Sources close to Buchanan say that the fight over 
the pact makes it more likely he will run. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot's threat to form a third party if Congress approves the trade agreement 
-- first announced last week at a rally in Wichita, Kan. -- potentially could 
have greater political impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of an independent Perot movement is one of the few bright signs 
for Democratic strategists. On one hand, it portends Perot peppering the GOP 
congressional leadership with the same pointed barbs that he regularly levels 
at Clinton. On another, it offers the possibility of the mercurial billionaire 
splitting the anti-Clinton vote with another independent presidential bid in 
1996.

COLUMN ONE; CARING FOR THE BRAIN UNDER SIEGE; WHERE ONCE TRAGEDY SEEMED ALL BUT 
CERTAIN, DOCTORS ARE USING NEW DRUGS AND TREATMENTS TO FIGHT STROKES. THEY HOPE 
TO ONE DAY TRANSPLANT HUMAN NERVE CELLS BACK INTO BRAINS TO REPAIR DAMAGE.

<P>
 Sometimes, the symptoms start subtly. Unlike the crushing pain of a heart 
attack, the assault begins as mere numbness. Faced with weakness on one side of 
the body, the temptation often is to turn over, go back to sleep and hope 
things will be better in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians say that is the worst thing to do. To ignore the symptoms of a 
stroke is to disregard peril. Every year, 500,000 Americans suffer strokes and 
150,000 die. Strokes are the nation's third leading cause of death, surpassed 
only by heart disease and cancer. For some survivors, the consequences can be 
devastating: disability, lost productivity and high medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people view strokes as an inevitable consequence of aging, carrying the 
grim prognosis that little can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, doctors say, that is starting to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Neurology still has its limits, but more and more the specialty is shifting 
from an almost exclusive focus on diagnosis to embrace new treatments -- 
especially if action is taken early. 
</P>
<P>
 For strokes -- and a range of other neurological illnesses -- doctors are 
experimenting with promising drugs and treatment techniques. Advances in 
imaging routinely provide remarkable pictures of the brain, allowing physicians 
to quickly pinpoint problems -- and begin the search for solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In neurology wards, triumphs are occurring in cases where once only tragedy 
reigned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caring for the brain under siege is a difficult task. Physicians often walk a 
tightrope between success and failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is that more evident than on Payson Six, the neurology floor of the 
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. It began in 1949 as rows of iron 
lungs during a terrible polio epidemic before the Salk vaccine was invented. It 
has evolved into one of the nation's leading treatment, teaching and research 
centers in large measure because of Dr. Fred Plum, the neurologist-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The public caught glimpses of the gray-haired physician last spring, when he 
served as Richard Nixon's neurologist after the massive stroke that led to the 
former President's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Over more than four decades, Plum has seen perhaps 60,000 cases -- "a small 
city," he says dryly. If anything, the exposure to so many people only has 
increased his awe of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are our minds," he says simply. "The brain is the self." 
</P>
<P>
 At 70, Plum remains a precise, hard-driving, no-nonsense taskmaster -- a 
superb bedside teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a week, he holds teaching rounds on Payson Six. One day, followed by 
young physicians and medical students, Plum strode to the bedside of a woman 
whose dark hair had been partially shaved, showing fresh stitches. Confronted 
by all the doctors in white coats, she blurted out her own diagnosis: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an aneurysm," she announced, briefly stifling discussion of her case. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a flight attendant who suddenly had suffered the worst headache of her 
life while worshiping a few days earlier in St. Patrick's Cathedral. She told a 
young priest to call the paramedics. But above all, she didn't want to disturb 
Cardinal John O'Connor, who was conducting services. 
</P>
<P>
 Neurosurgeons clipped off the bleeding blood vessel, but brain scans revealed 
she had a second aneurysm -- a sac formed by an enlargement of a weakened 
artery wall. It was probably the result of a genetic defect in the brain's 
blood vessel architecture. Surgeons planned to operate to prevent it from 
rupturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have one more to treat," Plum reassured her. "Everything about you makes 
us think you will do well." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was finished," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bed directly across the room, a man in his 20s lay unconscious. He had 
been that way for a month after falling 20 feet off an escalator. Plum focused 
the bright beam of his penlight into the patient's right eye. His pupil barely 
reacted. Above the bed, the green spikes of a cardiac monitor showed his 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's right hand made small, scratching movements -- spasms that Plum 
explained were typical of overwhelmingly bad brain injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "George, Henry, Mike," he said in a loud voice. There was no response. He 
moved the man's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I am seeing is not reflex activity," Plum told the group. 
</P>
<P>
 A medical student stared at the patient, who was not much older than herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "God," she said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family has to be told we have no evidence he understands language or has 
sustained attention," Plum continued. " . . . We are very concerned about his 
outcome. In all likelihood, their son will never recover the thing that drives 
us, the business of enthusiasm and taking rewards from what the day brings." 
</P>
<P>
 When all the doctors emerged into the hallway, a friend of the patient asked 
how he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unchanged," one of the residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most strokes occur as a complication of illnesses such as heart disease, high 
blood pressure and hardening of the arteries. Patients may suddenly be unable 
to speak or move an arm or leg, to see or feel. The damage can be transient or 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all strokes are alike. One kind takes place when a vessel inside the brain 
ruptures, flooding tissues with blood. About 80% occur when a blood clot formed 
elsewhere in the body blocks a brain artery. Brain cells deprived of oxygen can 
quickly die. Further injury from a cascade of biological reactions lasting for 
hours, even days, can spread the initial damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a stroke occurs, doctors now know, time becomes the enemy. They must be 
alert to a wide range of problems: potential threats to the lungs, the immune 
system, the joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroke patients are prone to brain swelling because, encased in the skull, 
tissues have no room to expand. Without medical action, death can result. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses in Payson Six's four-bed intensive-care unit constantly search for 
signs that swelling has begun. An early clue: Patients may suddenly become 
fidgety and fussy. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 years ago, the Veterans Administration conducted a landmark trial 
examining the effects of hypertension on heart disease. It yielded an 
unexpected but important finding. When high blood pressure was reduced, deaths 
from strokes dropped dramatically. High blood pressure contributes 
significantly to 90% of strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies have shown that by giving anti-coagulants to patients with 
irregular heartbeats, the risk of stroke decreases by lessening the chance that 
blood clots, which can travel to the brain, will be formed in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent advances in cardiac imaging have refined clotting topography. 
Researchers have discovered that many clots thought to travel to the brain from 
the heart actually come from the aorta, the main artery of the body carrying 
blood from the left ventricle of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 With that knowledge, a few surgeons around the country already are cleaning 
out the aorta, much in the way that partially blocked carotid arteries are 
cleared of fatty deposits -- a more common procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke 
strongly endorsed the carotid surgery, noting the procedure reduced the 
five-year risk of stroke by about half in patients whose arteries were 
significantly narrowed by as much as 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 New drugs and medical procedures also are improving the likelihood of survival 
without serious complications -- providing treatment begins rapidly inasmuch as 
brain cells can quickly die. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most promising approaches involves the use of so called 
"clotbusters," such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). These have proved 
effective in limiting damage from heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Major clinical trials of tPA around the country have produced promising 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lots of patients in the trials who have made miraculous recoveries," 
says Dr. Patrick Lyden of UC San Diego. Doctors have not yet sorted out which 
of the patients had received placebos, he adds, "but we are very hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyden heads a team of stroke specialists who are on alert to treat victims 
brought to five San Diego hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also are studying a variety of drugs designed to reduce the damage 
once a stroke occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stricken patient's brain, an excess amount of glutamate, an amino acid, 
is excreted. This excess flow can kill healthy cells around the original site 
of the stroke. One drug being tested at New York Hospital and other 
institutions is designed to block the flow of glutamate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Payson Six, Dr. Steven A. Goldman and colleague Dr. Denise Barbut (who is 
studying strokes related to open-heart surgery) treated a man in his 60s who 
suffered a serious stroke while undergoing cardiac catheterization. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient, partially blind and paralyzed on the left side, was rushed to the 
neurology floor, and within an hour took part in the clinical trial of a new 
medication that blocks the glutamate flow. After three days, the patient was 
cured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had three or four enormous surprises," Barbut says, couching her 
excitement in the careful language of science. "I don't know to this day how 
many of those (in our study) actually had the drug and how many received a 
placebo. But we have never had the surprise without the drug, put it that way. 
The number of surprises is increasing with these studies." 
</P>
<P>
 To glimpse the future of neurology, it is only necessary to walk a short 
distance from Payson Six to Goldman's laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The researcher, who is both a neurologist and holds a Ph.D in neurobiology, 
places a petri dish with tiny dots of tissue -- human brain cells growing -- 
under a microscope. To see their slender filaments branching out to other nerve 
cells more than inspires reflection. In its most primitive form, it is the 
architecture of communication. 
</P>
<P>
 In each second, the brain can take in perhaps 100 million pieces of 
information; we concentrate on about 40 of them and shut out the rest. 
Researchers estimate the brain contains up to 2 billion nerve cells. On each 
cell's surface are perhaps 60,000 contact points -- receptors. Multiply cells 
by receptors and the organ's complexity becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's research began a decade ago on the brains of canaries. Later, he was 
able to grow nerve cells from rats and from human brain tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman and his postdoctoral fellow Barry Kirschenbaum are about to publish 
evidence in the journal "Cerebral Cortex" that these neurons are generated from 
early precursor cells in the adult human brain. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate goal is to transplant human nerve cells back into brains to 
repair damage. But first, a host of questions remain -- including whether the 
brain will accept cells grown in a laboratory and whether they will assume the 
functions of their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first lessons physicians and nurses quickly learn on Payson Six is 
to appreciate their own mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you close your eyes, it could be you," says Rita Kraut, head nurse on 
the floor. "It makes you realize there is nothing insignificant in this world. 
Everything is important. We have a tendency to put things off and do it 
tomorrow. But you see a lot of times there is no tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad news seems to come in nooks and crannies. A physician or a nurse will take 
someone to one of the small alcoves on Payson Six to discuss sending a loved 
one to a hospice or home to die. Physicians treat about 1,000 patients a year 
on the floor; about 25% die or remain very seriously disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest strain is identifying those people we can give quality of life 
back to, and communicate to the family there is hope, versus that there is not 
anything we can do," says Dr. David Hewitt, the chief resident on Payson Six. 
</P>
<P>
 He hurries into a room with brightly lit screens for a radiology conference. 
MRI scans are starkly illuminated as he presents histories while a 
neuro-radiologist interprets them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt says a woman with a paralyzed right arm has gone into a coma. The 
radiologist looks at her brain scans. They indicate a massive stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians had ordered scans for an elderly women with a history of cancer to 
rule out any spread. The radiologist studies her scans, peering at a very small 
darker shadow before speaking in chilling, antiseptic shorthand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be a little met," he said, referring to the tumor metastasizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Inherent in the process is a wrenching paradox. Advances in imaging often have 
made diagnosis exquisitely precise. But the technology also has given 
physicians earlier knowledge of what, in all likelihood, will be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the face of bad news, a rule exists in neurology: Beware the nihilist. 
Every doctor and nurse on Payson Six has experienced surprises. Kraut remembers 
the 17-year-old girl who was in a coma for three months with encephalitis. One 
day, she woke up and called the head nurse by name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was floored! She came back every Christmas to bring us cookies with her 
parents because she got a new lease on life," Kraut says. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Letherbarrow, a critical care nurse, recalls the man who had a stroke 
followed by almost every complication in the book. He was on a respirator. He 
had pneumonia. It was touch and go. 
</P>
<P>
 The complications gradually were overcome through antibiotics and other 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of what happened next is still special. 
</P>
<P>
 "About two months later, he came back and he walked into the unit and said, 
'Hi, Allie. I came to see you.' That made me feel like, wow, this is just 
incredible," Letherbarrow says. "It's like a big yahoo! It makes you feel 
really big to say, 'Wow, I made a difference in this man's life.' "

NEW TACTIC MAY EASE TRANSPLANTS OF BONE MARROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A novel technique for performing bone marrow transplants could allow virtually 
any family member of a leukemia patient to serve as a donor, a prospect that 
could eliminate the need for the tearful televised pleas for donors that have 
become common in recent years, researchers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Using seven to 10 times the normal amount of donor marrow enables scientists 
to overwhelm the recipient's immune system, allowing a much less precise 
immunological match than is required now, Italian and Israeli researchers 
report in the journal Blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone marrow transplants are a treatment of last resort for victims of leukemia 
and breast cancer and are slowly growing in importance as a therapy for as many 
as 60 genetic disorders, including thalassemia and sickle cell disease. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 people receive bone marrow transplants each year -- the vast 
majority for leukemia -- but 5,000 to 15,000 die after they are denied them 
because of a lack of matching donors, according to the National Institutes of 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, led by biophysicist Yair Reisner of the Weizmann Institute in 
Rehovot, Israel, and Dr. Massimo F. Martelli of the Polyclinico Monteluce in 
Perugia, Italy, has treated 35 Italian patients and is continuing to accept at 
least one per week. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three medical centers in the United States are planning trials soon, 
including Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a rather exciting and simple technological advance that, if it proves 
out in other centers, will greatly increase the scope of successful bone marrow 
transplants," said Dr. John Laszlo, vice president for research at the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cautiously excited," added Reisner. "We still have to prove it with 
more patients, but it looks very good so far." 
</P>
<P>
 The bone marrow transplant is not itself therapeutic -- it does not kill 
cancer cells. That is achieved with very high doses of radiation and 
chemotherapy, which are used in an attempt to wipe out the last vestiges of 
cancer cells in leukemia patients who have not improved with lower doses of 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 But these high doses also kill the healthy bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone marrow is the source of all blood cells, both white and red. Without it, 
a patient normally dies within a few days. A transplant gives the patient a new 
immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 But good results require an exact match at the eight histocompatibility sites 
on the cell, called loci, that are used by immunologists to determine tissue 
compatibility. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of leukemia patients have a brother or sister who is an exact match 
and 3% to 5% have another relative who is such a match. In such cases, about 
90% of the grafts are successful. 
</P>
<P>
 If a relative is not available, a donor is sought among unrelated individuals. 
On average, about one person in every 20,000 will provide an immunological 
match for any patient at five or six of the loci. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, there have been about 2,900 transplants using unrelated donors, 
according to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. The overall 
success rate for these patients ranges between 30% and 40%, depending on the 
stage of their disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisner has been working on rodents for 10 years trying to find a way to 
circumvent the need for precisely matched donors. He concluded that the primary 
reason for rejection of an unmatched marrow graft is residual white cells from 
the patient's immune system, which prevent survival of the graft. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisner's studies in mice showed that using "megadoses" of donor marrow could 
overcome this problem, allowing the graft to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 These megadoses are much greater than the amount of marrow that can be 
obtained from the bone in an arm or leg, the usual site of a donation. To 
obtain the necessary quantities for use in humans, Martelli adapted a technique 
that is used to preserve bone marrow in breast cancer patients who receive high 
doses of chemotherapy or radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 He injects a hormone into the donor to stimulate the production of stem cells, 
which are the precursors of all blood cells, and to trigger their release into 
the bloodstream, then harvests them from the blood. This process produces as 
much as 10 times the amount of marrow otherwise obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 Martelli's team began testing the technique early last year at the hospital in 
Perugia, and results with the first 17 patients are discussed in today's 
report. All of the patients had either acute myelocytic leukemia or acute 
lymphocytic leukemia and all were considered terminal. "These patients were 
really, really sick, with a life expectancy of weeks or even days," Martelli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each received a transplant from a parent or sibling that was mismatched at 
three of the eight loci. The graft survived in 16 of the 17 patients. Only two 
of the patients died from their leukemia, but six died of respiratory 
infections, one from a fungus infection and one from graft-versus-host disease. 
Six are still alive, the longest for 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that survival rate seems small, Martelli said, it is about the same 
as was achieved 20 years ago in the first experimental bone marrow transplants 
using precisely matched donors. As they did then, however, physicians are 
learning how to control the infections and other problems that developed in the 
first grafts, and the survival rate is increasing. Among 18 patients treated 
since Martelli's initial group, only about 30% have died. 
</P>
<P>
 American researchers are eager to try the technique, and oncologists at M.D. 
Anderson Hospital in Houston and Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., 
as well as in Los Angeles, are getting ready to recruit their first patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was impressive and exciting was their ability to get this mismatched 
bone marrow to work and grow in the recipients without the usual fatal 
complications that you would see in such a transplant," said Dr. Carl Lenarsky, 
director of the bone marrow transplant program at Childrens Hospital Los 
Angeles. "We are encouraged by it, and have decided that we will undertake this 
approach." Marrow 'Megadoses' 
</P>
<P>
 A new technique using large doses of bone marrow for transplants promises to 
eliminate the need for precise immunological matching, making much larger 
numbers of donors available for victims of leukemia and certain genetic 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 1) A hormone is injected into a donor to stimulate production of stem cells, 
the crucial cells in bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Five days later, blood is drained from the arm and centrifuged to remove 
stem and other white cells. Red cells and other blood components are reinfused 
into the donor. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The stem cells are treated to remove undesirable white cells and injected 
into the patient.

VICTIMS' FAMILIES TAKE ON SIMPSON'S DEFENSE TEAM; TRIAL: LAWYERS ACCUSE THEM OF 
AN ORCHESTRATED EFFORT. RELATIVES SAY THEY ARE FED UP WITH ATTORNEYS' 
POSTURING.

 Once silent in their grief, the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman have emerged as major offstage players in the O.J. Simpson trial, 
steadily ratcheting up the pressure on the man accused of killing their loved 
ones and influencing the courtroom drama unfolding in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, their newfound activism touched off a major clash with Simpson's 
defense lawyers, who accused the families of working on behalf of prosecutors 
in an orchestrated campaign to deny Simpson a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 That contention was sharply dismissed by the fathers of both victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what you're seeing is the culmination of months of frustration," Fred 
Goldman, the father of Ron Goldman, said in an interview Wednesday. "For six 
months now, we've watched as the defense attorneys have engaged in posturing 
and manipulation of public opinion. Why is it OK for them to speak and not us? 
I just felt that it was high time the playing field got leveled." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Brown, the father of Nicole Simpson, said he too has been angered by 
out-of-court statements by Simpson's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to twist the news and sign the autographs and give daily interviews 
when they leave the courthouse," Lou Brown said. "That has something to do with 
the anger that has welled up in (Nicole's sister) Denise and the rest of us. . 
. . I'm tired of listening to their b.s. I realize it's part of their strategy 
to screw up the conviction of O.J., but it still doesn't go down good when they 
take the actual victim and forget about her and him, Ron and Nicole, and turn 
around and say we got the victim here. B.S., B.S., B.S." 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks following the murders, family members declined to venture 
opinions about Simpson or the defense team. But in recent weeks, bolstered by 
their discussions with one another and led by Denise Brown, they have leveled 
increasingly harsh challenges to the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 They have objected to what they see as unfairly favorable publicity for 
Simpson, at various defense tactics and at the impression that their loved ones 
are being lost in the media frenzy that has engulfed the Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of the families as Simpson accusers has placed the defense team 
in a difficult bind: Failing to respond could make Simpson, who maintains his 
innocence, look guilty. But going on the offensive has angered the families and 
risks making the defense appear indifferent to the suffering of the victims' 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The families' growing visibility has put the Simpson team on the defensive and 
also has begun to creep into the courtroom. Three prospective alternate jurors 
were excused Wednesday after admitting that they had heard comments that Denise 
Brown made in various interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said (Simpson) did it," one prospective juror said. Simpson attorney 
Robert L. Shapiro, who has complained about the remarks by the victims' 
families even as he has tried to defuse them, swung around in his chair at that 
remark and smiled at the reporters in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows how difficult it is to pick a jury when someone is out there 
making these kind of statements," Shapiro said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's clash between the families and the defense had been building since 
earlier this week, when Shapiro responded to comments by some family members 
who believe Simpson is guilty. As he entered court Tuesday, Shapiro told 
reporters that he and the defense team were inclined to "forgive" the families 
for prejudging the case because they were so emotionally involved in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Brown was outraged by those comments, and she immediately went public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am fighting mad," she said Tuesday on Geraldo Rivera's show on CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Fred Goldman was calling into KABC-TV in Los Angeles and 
reading a statement of his own: "Mr. Shapiro, I don't need your forgiveness. It 
is my right, as it is everyone's, to form, to have an opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Goldman still was fuming. "He had the colossal gall to say he 
forgave me," Goldman said. "Can you believe the level of arrogance?" 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetorical escalation prompted Simpson's lawyers to strike back more 
aggressively, accusing the district attorney's office of orchestrating an 
anti-Simpson media campaign and using the families as part of that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, the D.A. speaks out, the chief of police speaks out, both 
families speak out," Simpson attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said as he entered 
the courthouse. "It's clearly orchestrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside court, Cochran called the spate of recent interviews a "media blitz" 
and added: "The court can hardly turn on the television anyplace without seeing 
Denise Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors scoffed at the suggestion that they were manipulating the families 
and said the Simpson lawyers have only themselves to blame for the anger 
directed at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the families) are outraged at the manner in which you've painted all 
the evidence and all the witnesses as tainted and unreliable," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Marcia Clark said. "They are outraged at the way you've turned this into 
a circus." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark added that she has tried in vain to discourage the families from 
speaking publicly but stressed that she cannot control the families, especially 
when they are angry about the conduct of the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Cochran does not like the response, then don't make the first salvo," 
Clark said. "If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's sentiments were largely echoed by various family members. Fred Goldman 
and Lou Brown denied that their comments were part of any orchestrated 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been in touch with the prosecution about what we should say," 
Brown said. "It's just gone too damn far, for the airwaves, the rag sheets, 
even the public press." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman agreed, saying he did not even consult with prosecutors before 
speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have, and the Browns have, independently reached our maximum level 
of tolerance," he said. "Each of us, on our own, just reached capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers at first tried to downplay criticism from the families. When 
Fred Goldman spoke out in an interview with The Times last month, Shapiro 
responded gently to Goldman's criticisms of the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the greatest empathy for the Goldman family and the Brown family and 
the tremendous losses they have suffered," Shapiro said at the time. "Our job 
is to present to the jury the evidence or lack of evidence in a light that is 
most favorable to O.J. Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the families, particularly Denise Brown, increased the pitch of their 
comments, Simpson's lawyers responded with harsher rhetoric of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular lady, a victim no doubt about it, has become an advocate," 
Cochran said in court Wednesday. As a result, he added, Brown is now "impinging 
on our client's right to a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has a right to her opinion, Cochran said, but "we also have a right to 
address this attempt to deprive Mr. Simpson of a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Although both families have become increasingly visible and forceful in recent 
weeks, substantial attention has focused on the transformation of Denise Brown 
-- whose articulate delivery and striking resemblance to her slain sister has 
made her a popular fixture on television. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks immediately after her sister's death, Brown denied that Nicole 
Simpson was beaten by her husband. "If she was beaten up, she wouldn't have 
stayed with him," Brown told the New York Times. As recently as September, the 
members of the Brown family told ABC's "PrimeTime Live" that they had 
difficulty believing that Simpson could have committed the June 12 murders. 
</P>
<P>
 All that has changed in recent months. Denise Brown said she concluded that 
her sister had in fact been a victim of spousal abuse after discovering notes 
belonging to Nicole Simpson. In court Wednesday, Shapiro persuaded Ito to order 
prosecutors to turn over any such notes. Without elaborating on their contents, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman said "some materials have been identified as 
fitting the description" of those requested by defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Having concluded that Simpson beat her sister, Denise Brown became an 
ever-more visible spokeswoman on the issue of spousal abuse. She lent her name 
to an Orange County center for battered women, and last weekend, four members 
of the Brown family appeared at a charity ball to increase public awareness of 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns did not address the Simpson case at that event, but Denise Brown 
has commented extensively elsewhere. She has granted interview after interview 
in recent days, each time claiming that Simpson had threatened to kill his 
ex-wife -- a charge absent from her comments in the months immediately after 
the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Brown -- who once said she would not speak ill of Simpson because he 
is the father of Nicole's two children -- those early qualms are now gone. In 
the interviews over the past week, Brown has left no question that she thinks 
Simpson killed her sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you firmly believe . . . that the right man is accused of committing these 
crimes?" Rivera asked her Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do," Brown responded. "I really do."

DEMOCRATS IN HOUSE RETAIN CURRENT LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Democrats, groping for answers in the wake of their worst defeat at the 
polls in 40 years, reelected their leadership Wednesday after rejecting 
conservative appeals to move the party more to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite bitterness and recriminations over the Nov. 8 election results, 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Democratic Whip David E. 
Bonior of Michigan both easily defeated more conservative challengers for the 
top two Democratic leadership positions in the Republican-led Congress that 
convenes next January. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt, running this time for minority leader, defeated Rep. Charlie Rose of 
North Carolina, 150 to 58, while Bonior brushed aside a challenge from Rep. 
Charles W. Stenholm of Texas for the whip's post, 145 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Vic Fazio of West Sacramento turned aside a challenge from fellow liberal 
and Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Kweisi Mfume of Maryland for the 
chairmanship of the Democratic Caucus, the party's third-ranking post. Fazio, 
who as one of the party's chief election strategists faced criticism from 
fellow Democrats after the defeat at the polls Nov. 8, nevertheless handily 
defeated Mfume, 149 to 57. 
</P>
<P>
 But while they chose to retain their old leadership as they move into the 
minority for the first time since Dwight D. Eisenhower sat in the White House, 
rank-and-file Democrats made it clear in their comments both before and after 
the closed-door elections that they remain deeply divided and confused over the 
direction the party now should take. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the leadership election results seemed likely to weaken the party 
further, with several conservative Southern Democrats threatening to defect to 
GOP ranks and even a number of liberal lawmakers confessing privately that they 
are dissatisfied with the leadership choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is still groping and watching the leaders grope," said Rep. Charles 
E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), acknowledging that none of the candidates had been able to 
offer a clear strategy for winning back a majority in the House in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.) after the vote. "I 
told Gephardt yesterday that when a team has a one-and-nine record they 
generally hire a new coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Tauzin was one of a handful of Southern Democrats who said they are so 
disillusioned with the party's liberal leadership that they are thinking of 
switching their allegiance to the GOP, a move that could leave the Democrats 
with less than 200 seats in the 435-member House. Democrats now hold 204 of the 
seats in the new Congress to the GOP's 230. (There is one independent and 
several non-voting delegates, who are permitted a vote in the Democratic 
caucus.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tauzin, who met earlier this week with incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) to discuss a switch, said after the secret-ballot vote that he would 
wait until a Dec. 13-14 meeting at which the Democrats will vote on new rules 
for committee assignments before deciding whether to desert the party. If the 
conservatives do not receive key committee slots, then as many as a dozen of 
them may bolt, Tauzin said. "It's no threat," he told reporters. "It's just a 
fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to bind up the party's electoral wounds, which have been reopened in 
the two days of often bitter and soul-searching debate that preceded the caucus 
vote, the new leaders pledged that conservatives would be given more say than 
they have had in the past in determining the party's still-uncertain direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was no cakewalk," Fazio said, alluding to the criticism that he and 
other party leaders endured during the closed-door debates. A lot of "pain and 
anguish" was voiced by members, but one thing they all agreed upon was "the 
need for greater inclusion in the party," he added, promising that the 
leadership will listen more attentively than it has in the past to the 
conservative wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more agreement than I have ever heard before on the need for change 
and, from that point of view, I take heart," Stenholm said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the leadership pledged itself to change, other Democrats said they 
are still troubled by the fact that no clear strategy for redefining the party 
and winning back the House has yet emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people . . . spanked our bottom rather hard on Nov. 8, and they 
now want to make sure we understand why they did it," Rose said. "If they (the 
leaders) don't get that message, we may literally wander in the wilderness for 
40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose added that he and other Southern Democrats, many of whom were either 
defeated or survived very close reelection races, were worried that Gingrich 
and other GOP leaders would be able to portray the outcome of Wednesday's 
leadership contests as evidence that the Democrats cannot change. "I hope we 
have some good answers to that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason answers have been slow in coming, other Democrats said, is because 
the leadership has not been able to come to terms yet with the main 
contradiction facing the party in the wake of the midterm elections. The same 
elections that brought the Republicans to power in the House and the Senate 
also decimated the conservative wing of the Democratic Party, with Southern and 
mostly conservative Democrats losing their seats, resulting in a Democratic 
minority that is, if anything, more homogeneously liberal than it was before 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest difficulty now," said a liberal lawmaker who asked not to be 
quoted by name, is that "we are likely to be more resistant to change on one 
side of our brain even as we recognize more than ever the need for it on the 
other."

 WET WINTER: Wonder what winter holds? Don't be fooled by this week's balmy 
temperatures. The venerable Farmer's Almanac predicts a wet season ahead with 
lots of snow in the San Gabriel and Sierra Nevada mountains. Frequent cold 
blasts like last week's are in store for this month and next. . . . If a June 
wedding is planned, take note that it will be cooler than normal.

 NOT JUST WEATHER: While best known for its long-term weather forecasts, the 
203-year-old Farmer's Almanac actually contains a wealth of tidbits, including 
a short course on relativity and stories about cowboy songs. . . . It also 
chronicles trends. Green, for instance, is the most popular color of car right 
now. And old ashtrays are hip. 
</P>
<P>
 NO GRIPING: No matter how windy and cold it gets this winter in Winnetka, 
residents of its sister community in Illinois will have it worse. Mary Lou 
Brown of the Chamber of Commerce in that Chicago suburb said highs this week 
have been in the low 30s -- and winter is still three weeks away. . . . "You 
should smile out in California," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY TO BURN: With winter come higher gas bills. Southern California Gas Co. 
officials warned customers that their next bill might well be higher than usual 
because of November's cold snap (D1). "Customers should not be surprised to 
find that their gas bill is four to seven times higher than their previous 
bill," Vice President Roy Rawlings said. . . . Turn down the heat to 68 degrees

FIRE IN VISALIA KILLS MOTHER, FOUR CHILDREN; TRAGEDY: WOMAN TOOK ONE CHILD TO 
SAFETY, BUT DIED AFTER RE-ENTERING THE BURNING HOUSE FOR THE OTHERS, OFFICIALS 
SAY.

 A mother and her four young children died in a fire apparently ignited by 
something flammable on top of a floor furnace, firefighters said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some type of furniture and/or material fell over the floor furnace," 
according to a report released by Joan Stovall, Visalia Fire Department 
information officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsies were scheduled to determine whether the victims died of smoke 
inhalation or burned to death, said Jay Salazar, Tulare County assistant 
coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members identified the mother as Connie Guerra Hinojos, 26, and her 
children as Gabriel, 9; Marcos, 4; Angel, 3, and Delicia, 4 months. A 
5-year-old son, Isaac, survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were so little," neighbor Gloria Mejia said. "They're little angels." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother managed to get Isaac out of the house as it burned about 10:20 p.m. 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother returned to rescue some of the additional kids, and she did not 
make it out," said fire division Chief George Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead woman's husband and the children's father, identified by neighbors as 
Isaac Hinojos, returned home as firefighters arrived. He reportedly tried to 
get into the house, but firefighters held him back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire personnel entered the structure through the bedroom window where the 
children were said to be," a Fire Department report said. "A search was 
conducted while the fire was held in check. No survivors were found." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old, single-story, wood and stucco house sustained about $50,000 
damage, the Fire Department said.

GAO SAYS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS COST STATE $2.3 BILLION; BUDGET: SEN. BOXER USES 
GOVERNMENT FIGURE TO BOLSTER HER EFFORTS TO GET FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR 
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER HARD-HIT STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The General Accounting Office on Wednesday released a report estimating that 
California will shoulder $2.3 billion in costs during the coming fiscal year to 
provide education, emergency Medicaid and adult incarceration for its large 
population of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, released by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), estimated that the 
state's undocumented population generates $1.3 billion in revenues that flow 
back to the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Boxer used the report's findings to estimate that illegal 
immigrants produce $900 million in state and local tax revenues. She subtracted 
that figure from the $2.3-billion estimate to arrive at a net cost to 
California of $1.4 billion for education, Medicaid and incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer said she will use the study to make her case that the federal government 
should reimburse California and other states hit hard by the costs of dealing 
with illegal immigration within their borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited. We're on very firm ground here," Boxer said in releasing 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
 She vowed that the GAO findings -- particularly the federal revenue generated 
by illegal immigrants -- will make it easier to find congressional converts to 
the fight for additional reimbursement to California during next year's budget 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the appropriate use for these revenues would be a reimbursement to 
the state for its uncovered costs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer would not speculate on how much money, if any, the new 
Republican-controlled, budget-cut-minded Congress might allocate for 
reimbursement funds. But she said President Clinton is sympathetic to 
California's plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I predict he will move toward these numbers in a very big way," Boxer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer will not seek the entire $1.4 billion she estimates is the state's net 
cost. The federal government already supplies about $300 million for various 
immigrant-related programs, she said, and the political reality in Washington 
suggests that California would get far less than full reimbursement.

<P>
 As the immigration issue has heated up in California and elsewhere, 
controversy has arisen over conflicting studies of the fiscal costs and 
benefits of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer requested the GAO study in March to sort out differing views about the 
financial impact of illegal immigrants in California. She cautioned that the 
GAO "wasn't thrilled" with the accuracy of some of the data it relied on to 
compile the report but said she "felt good enough so that I can run with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO cost figures generally back up those that Gov. Pete Wilson has used in 
his effort to win federal reimbursement for such state outlays. But a Wilson 
spokeswoman criticized Boxer's estimate of state and local revenues as 
"intellectually dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a victory for California," said Leslie Goodman, "because . . . an 
independent group has verified Gov. Wilson's cost figures. But we very much 
disagree with (Boxer's) tax figures. The $900 million doesn't begin to cover 
the state costs for all services to illegal immigrant services." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO, rather than start from scratch, examined three existing studies of 
the fiscal impact of illegal immigrants -- two from the state of California and 
one from the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank with immigration 
expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it questioned some of the methodology and data sources used in all 
three of the earlier studies, the GAO estimate of $2.3 billion in total costs 
for education, Medicaid and incarceration is virtually identical to the revised 
figure put out by the Wilson Administration in September. The state's January 
estimate was $2.43 billion for the three major cost areas. 
</P>
<P>
 After analyzing the data, the GAO increased the state's cost estimates for 
education but reduced the costs of incarcerating illegal immigrants. The GAO 
accepted the state estimate of its Medicaid costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the revenue side, the GAO admitted that its findings were open to 
question. The report noted that researchers must use indirect estimation 
methods that rely on varying assumptions about the illegal immigrant 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO chose to accept the Urban Institute's data to estimate that illegal 
immigrants in California generate $1.3 billion in federal revenue. But that 
figure falls between Wilson Administration median and high estimates, which 
state officials argue are probably overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result, there is no agreement about the magnitude of federal revenues 
generated by this population," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO had even greater difficulty in estimating the amount of state and 
local taxes generated by illegal immigrants. The state of California estimates 
ranged from $528 million to $1.4 billion; and Urban Institute researchers 
arrived at an estimate of $1.1 billion. Given this wide discrepancy, the GAO 
was unable to reach a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer chose to use a median estimate of $900 million during her news 
conference releasing the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Boxer took a firmer stand on the net cost of illegal immigrants 
than did the GAO. "For several reasons, we were unable to draw any conclusion 
about California's net cost for illegal aliens," the GAO said.

DAMAGED DNA IS KEY TO TANNING, SCIENTISTS SAY; HEALTH: REPORT IS KEY STEP IN 
UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS. RESEARCHERS HOPE TO BEGIN TESTING A CHEMICAL THAT 
COULD TRIGGER DARKENING OF THE SKIN WITHOUT HARMING CELLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For sun-worshiping Southern Californians, there is bad news and good news 
about tanning today. The bad news is that a so-called "healthy" tan is actually 
strong evidence that DNA in the skin has been severely damaged, researchers 
have found. 
</P>
<P>
 The hitherto little-understood tanning process is actually triggered when the 
body begins repairing DNA damaged by ultraviolet radiation, a team from Boston 
University reports today in the British journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 That repair process initiates the production of melanin, the chemical that 
causes skin to darken protectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the damage is successfully repaired, defective DNA 
accumulates over time, leading eventually to the development of skin cancer, 
including its most deadly form, a tumor known as melanoma. Skin cancer is by 
far the most common form of the disease, with 700,000 cases per year in the 
United States, compared to 1.2 million cases for all other forms combined. 
Melanoma, accounting for 27,500 cases per year, is the fastest-increasing form 
of cancer, with experts predicting that by early in the next century, one in 
every 90 people will develop it. All forms of skin cancer are closely 
associated with exposure to sunlight and tanning. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the team has found that a simple DNA fragment spread on 
the skin can trigger melanin production -- at least in mouse and guinea pig 
skin -- and for the first time produce a natural tan without damaging DNA in 
cells. Existing tanning lotions simply stain or dye the skin, providing a 
cosmetic tan but no protection against the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston University researchers hope to begin testing the preparation on 
humans early next year after they receive approval from the university 
bioethics committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Americans' fascination with a good tan, almost nothing has been known 
about how tans develop. Today's report marks a major step toward understanding 
the process, even though the precise details are not known, said Dr. Barbara A. 
Gilchrest of Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
 What the researchers were able to show, in mouse skin cells and guinea pig 
skin grown in the laboratory, is that tanning is not triggered until DNA damage 
is produced by sunlight and repair of the damage has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not be the only trigger for tanning, but it is certainly the most 
important one," said Gilchrest's colleague, biologist Mark S. Eller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our finding suggests that tanning may be part of an SOS response of the skin 
to UV damage," Gilchrest said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the researchers were attempting to tease out the mechanism for tanning, 
they began looking for other, safer ways to trigger the process. Reasoning that 
it began in response to broken DNA, they tried applying a small DNA fragment -- 
called dipyrimidine dithymidylic acid -- to the cells. Sure enough, the cells 
began producing melanin and got darker. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the chemical has never been tested on humans, "we have no reason to 
think that it would be unsafe," Eller said. And because it is not part of the 
cell's own DNA, there is no risk of cancer.

STATE'S SURGE IN STUDENT LOANS REFLECTS U.S. TREND; EDUCATION: BORROWING TO 
KEEP PACE WITH SOARING COSTS HAS RISEN 40% IN CALIFORNIA TO $1.69 BILLION SINCE 
LAST YEAR, SURVEY FINDS. OFFICIALS FEAR LONG-TERM ECONOMIC EFFECTS.

 Borrowing to pay for college is rising dramatically across the country, with 
more students assuming more debt than ever before, according to a preliminary 
report released Wednesday by the American Council on Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a survey of more than 300 institutions of higher learning, the report 
found that from July, 1993, through June, 1994, the nation's students and 
parents borrowed 41% more than during the previous 12-month period. Borrowing 
in California mirrored that trend, rising 40% over the same period to $1.69 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "To our knowledge, this is the biggest jump that we've seen in history," said 
David Merkowitz, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, who 
lamented "a breaking of the traditional bargain in higher education: that the 
current generation will help pay for the education of the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major structural change in the way we pay for college in the United 
States," said Patrick Callan, executive director of the California Higher 
Education Policy Center. He called the report's findings "cause for significant 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report could not determine the average debt level per student, 
analysts speculated that it, too, is rising sharply. They warned that once 
today's students graduate and begin trying to repay their loans, indebtedness 
will force them to make choices they might not otherwise make. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kinds of decisions will these people make about graduate school if they 
already have huge debts? Will they (feel free to) choose low-paying professions 
like teaching? Will they be able to buy houses or cars? What will be the effect 
on the economy?" asked Merkowitz, who said growing student debt has "very 
severe implications for the future of this country." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, loans have become increasingly important to students because 
other forms of financial aid have not kept pace with soaring college costs. In 
addition, the federal government last year made it easier to borrow money by 
relaxing eligibility requirements while raising the amount students could 
borrow each year. The result: a national borrowing boom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 75 million loans made since the original guaranteed student loan 
program started in 1966, 16% were made in the last two years," said Fred 
Galloway, the American Council on Education's director of federal policy 
analysis. "Furthermore, of the $183 billion borrowed in the nearly 30-year 
history of the program, 22% was borrowed in the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 California is experiencing a record borrowing surge as well. During the 12 
months ending in June, 1994, borrowing increased 65% among California State 
University students -- the first time that Cal State had outpaced the 
University of California in loan volume. Students attending the UC system 
borrowed 54% more than they had the previous academic year, while the number of 
loans increased 36% at community colleges. Borrowing by students at private 
colleges and universities in California rose 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, California's students and their parents borrowed $1.69 billion 
through federal loan programs during the 1993-94 academic year -- a huge 
increase from the previous 12 months, when total borrowing was $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a phenomenal figure," said Dana Callihan, a spokesman for the 
California Student Aid Commission. "Students in one year increased their level 
of borrowing by almost half a billion. That's a big number." 
</P>
<P>
 That number looks all the more staggering when compared to the recent past. 
According to Callihan, in the late 1970s California students were borrowing 
less than $100 million annually. If current patterns continue, borrowing by 
California students could surpass $2 billion by the end of this academic year 
in June, 1995.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: SOWING TERM LIMITS, REAPING SPEAKER'S JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court debate term limits in the abstract, 
California will begin seeing their actual result starting Monday in the state 
Assembly. And the first thing they'll probably see is a new Speaker -- the 
first from Southern California in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, the present Republican leader, was 
elected to the Legislature in 1990, the same year voters narrowly approved 
legislative term limits. Assembly members were limited to three two-year terms 
and the thinking then was that the full impact on the Capitol would not be felt 
until after 1996, when all the entrenched incumbents and old guard leaders were 
forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Brulte is bright and affable -- and a pragmatist rather than a 
firebrand -- he was elected GOP leader two years ago, succeeding a series of 
rather unstable caucus leaderships. Under him, Assembly Republicans became a 
cohesive unit, often working not only with the GOP governor but with the 
Democratic leadership of Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But never, except in his wildest fantasies, did Brulte envision becoming 
Speaker -- the second most powerful job in state government. He figured, as did 
most insiders, that term limits would force him out of the house before 
Republicans could take control, perhaps in 1996 or 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere prospect of term limits, however, shook up the Assembly more than its 
advocates ever imagined. Many members didn't wait for the 1996 boot out the 
door; they left on their own volition to seek another office or other work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, when the new Legislature is sworn in Monday, only 24% of the 
Assembly members -- 19 -- will be holdovers elected prior to 1990. And one of 
them, a Republican, will leave shortly after the new Speaker is chosen to take 
a Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate has undergone much less change. There, members were given slightly 
longer tenure, two four-year terms. Democrats still retain a one-vote majority. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Assembly, the big turnover, combined with a GOP voter trend, has 
ended 24 years of Democratic control and essentially assured the termination of 
Speaker Brown's record 14-year reign. Of the 61 new Assembly members elected 
beginning in 1990, roughly 3 in 5 have been Republican. And of the 28 rookies 
elected last month, 18 are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats went into the 1994 elections outnumbering Republicans by 14 seats. 
Brulte counted on gaining maybe four seats. To virtually everyone's surprise, 
he netted eight, giving the GOP the 41 seats necessary to elect a Speaker. 
Credit the national Republican sweep, Gov. Pete Wilson's strong race and 
Brulte's own adroit placement of campaign funds. But the key to Republican 
takeover was term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Assembly Democrats who abandoned their seats to run for another office 
were replaced by Republicans. Only one Republican seat went to a Democrat in 
such fashion. Thus, the GOP netted three seats from term limit musical chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 As with Congress, the Assembly will be getting a transfusion of new blood and 
new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte, in many ways, is a 180-degree opposite of Brown. He is from 
middle-class roots, represents suburbia, is white, relatively young (38) and 
keeps a low profile for a man who is 6-foot-4 and weighs 340 pounds. Brown is a 
product of segregated rural Texas, is black, represents San Francisco's inner 
city, is the consummate career assemblyman (30 years), is 60 and flamboyant. 
</P>
<P>
 But both are instinctive politicians with street smarts. Causes are far less 
important than conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mark of Brown's brilliance and cunning that few yet are willing to 
declare Brulte the next Speaker. People have become used to Brown's magic. But 
this time is different: Never before has Brown gone up against a GOP that had 
41 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most talked-about scenario is that some Republican -- most likely maverick 
Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar -- will refuse to vote for Brulte and allow Brown 
to slide back into power. But in truth, a more likely scenario is that some 
Democrats -- with their eyes on committee chairmanships -- will abandon Brown 
and side with the winner, Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not politically plausible that in this most triumphant Republican year in 
decades a GOP legislator from a conservative district would help Willie Brown 
hold onto his speakership. "Retribution would be swift and sure in terms of a 
recall," Wilson recently told me, indicating he also would be apt to veto the 
defector's bills. 
</P>
<P>
 So Brulte is destined to be Speaker. And in two years when he's just getting 
the hang of it, he'll be booted out by term limits -- a concept Brulte had 
advocated in the abstract.

'SMOKE A JOINT, LOSE LICENSE' LAW IN EFFECT; CRIME: DRUG OFFENDERS FACE 
SIX-MONTH SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S RIGHTS FOR ANY CONVICTION, EVEN IF UNRELATED 
TO DRIVING. THE MEASURE IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT 131,000 PEOPLE IN THE NEXT 12 
MONTHS. 
</P>

<P>
 Since the 1970s, California's scales of justice have equated the severity of 
possessing less than an ounce of marijuana to running a red light. All that 
changes starting today. 
</P>
<P>
 As of 12:01 a.m., offenders face a six-month suspension of their driver's 
license for any drug conviction, including marijuana and all other illicit 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tough state law enacted this year -- dubbed the "smoke a joint, lose your 
license" law -- is expected to snare the licenses of 131,000 drivers during the 
next 12 months, whether or not their offenses were related to operation of a 
motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 It applies to state and federal drug crimes, ranging from felonies punishable 
by long prison sentences to the so-called decriminalized misdemeanor possession 
of less than an ounce of marijuana, which up to now has been punishable by a 
citation and $100 fine, less than the fine for many traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to complicate prosecution of minor crimes," said Dale Gieringer, 
California coordinator of a national group that advocates decriminalizing 
simple marijuana offenses. "People are going to be contesting charges in court 
because the loss of your license is more of a concern than a fine of $100." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, Gieringer asserted, is an attempt to bypass legislation enacted 
in the 1970s that made possession or cultivation of less than an ounce of 
marijuana for personal use subject to the $100 fine and citation. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials from the Wilson Administration, which pushed for the law, say a 
1993 Department of Motor Vehicles study shows that those arrested on drug 
offenses are prone to more traffic accidents and violations regardless of 
whether their arrest was connected to driving. 
</P>
<P>
 California becomes the 19th state to comply with an extraordinary federal law 
that requires states to enact the driver's license statute or formally declare 
their opposition to such a law -- as 31 states have. States that remain silent 
on the issue risk losing federal highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For California, the cost of not taking action would have resulted in the 
cutoff of 5%, or about $54 million, of its federal road construction and 
maintenance money during the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The compliance bill, carried for Gov. Pete Wilson by Assemblyman Robert Frazee 
(R-Carlsbad), was passed on the last day of the legislative session, Aug. 31 -- 
one month before the federal deadline -- and signed by Wilson. He called it an 
appropriate response to illegal drug use, "regardless of whether or not the 
individual was operating a motor vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most statutes that become permanent, the new law will automatically 
expire next Dec. 1, unless it is renewed by the 1995 Legislature, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges in California long have had the power to suspend or revoke the driver's 
license of anyone found guilty of a drug offense involving the use of a motor 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law makes a radical departure by targeting drug offenses unrelated to 
driving, unless the judge finds a "compelling circumstance" to make an 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 State Director of Motor Vehicles Frank Zolin, whose department sponsored the 
legislation, estimates that 131,000 drivers will lose their licenses because of 
drug convictions in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was also supported by the state Department of Transportation, the 
California Highway Patrol and the Committee on Moral Concerns, a Christian 
lobby. Among opponents were the American Civil Liberties Union, the Teamsters 
Union and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU and the Teamsters argued that suspension of a driver's license should 
occur only as a result of offenses related directly to operation of a motor 
vehicle. Opponents also warned that a minor marijuana conviction, for example, 
could cost a person a job by jeopardizing transportation to and from work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Legislature basically caved in to Wilson, who was insisting on this 
bill," said Gieringer of NORML. "Every state west of Texas opted out of this 
except California." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, Wilson's press secretary, said: "We say the bottom line is, we've 
got to have a penalty. This, by law, requires people to act responsibly. We 
expect it will have the result of cutting back on illegal drug use." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Legislature passed a bill strengthening driver's license 
restrictions but declaring the state's opposition to suspending licenses of 
drug violators. Wilson vetoed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally and in California, critics of linking the loss of a driver's 
license to unrelated drug convictions have charged that there is no credible 
connection between the two. But the Wilson Administration says the DMV study 
shows there is a connection. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV study looked at 106,214 people arrested in 1989 in California on drug 
charges and charted their traffic records for three years. The review found 
that those arrested had 1.6 times more highway crashes as other motorists and 
three times as many traffic offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said those arrested on drug violations represented an "elevated" 
highway safety risk. It concluded that there is a "nexus between drugs and 
traffic safety." 
</P>
<P>
 But NORML challenged the study as failing to build in a control factor for age 
and sex. "It only confirms that young males are worse drivers," NORML said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for NORML's warning of a clogged court system, DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff 
said the measure's potential impact on the judiciary was not studied because 
officials believe it will have relatively little effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly, we looked at the impact of losing between $47 million and $55 
million," he said. "We don't see that this law will be a major factor in 
courtroom calendars, but we do believe it will provide a small but significant 
improvement in traffic safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Highway Patrol officials offered only cautious forecasts on the law's 
potential to reduce both drug use and traffic carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth a try," said Deputy CHP Commissioner D.E. (Spike) Helmick. "If it 
has some deterrent effect on youth, we felt it might have some basis."

FIRE DESTROYS NOTORIOUS ITALIAN SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Achille Lauro's history of misfortune ended in flames Wednesday on the 
Indian Ocean, where nearly 1,000 passengers and crew fled in lifeboats as the 
listing cruise ship burned. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one death was reported.The Italian cruise ship burned into the night, 
tilting 40 degrees over to its port side off the coast of Somalia. The captain 
of a ship that went to the rescue said it might sink. 
</P>
<P>
 The Achille Lauro gained notoriety when Palestinian hijackers killed an 
American passenger in 1985. But its troubled past included the death of an 
Italian fisherman whose boat was rammed in 1971 and two passengers who drowned 
trying to escape a 1981 fire. 
</P>
<P>
 After fighting Wednesday's blaze, the last 60 crew members abandoned the 
vessel and boarded merchant ships helping in the rescue. The 23,478-ton ship 
was burning and listing badly 130 miles south of the Horn of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Italian Coast Guard officials said everyone aboard was 
accounted for. Eight people were injured in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship's owner, Genoa-based Starlauro, said the blaze apparently broke out 
in the passenger area, but the cause was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dmitrios Skapinkais, the Greek captain of the Treasure Island, said the 
liner's captain, who came aboard to use his ship's radiotelephone, said the 
fire started in the engine room. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship was carrying 581 passengers and 404 crew, a port official in Rome 
said. Most of the crew was Italian and the passengers mainly South African, 
German, Dutch and British. Ten Americans were on board -- eight crew and a 
couple that boarded in Genoa. All were reported safe.

NEPAL'S KING HANDS REINS OF GOVERNMENT TO COMMUNISTS; ASIA: NEW PRIME MINISTER 
AND HIS PARTY DO NOT HAVE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY. THAT COULD LIMIT THEIR 
TENURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 One of the oddest couples ever seen in politics took command of this lofty and 
poor Himalayan kingdom Wednesday when Nepal's monarch, revered by millions as a 
living god, swore in a government of Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 This overwhelmingly Hindu land has quite improbably become the world's first 
convert to the tenets of Karl Marx since the Berlin Wall crumbled five years 
ago and the Soviet Bloc began its meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because the Communists are still short of a parliamentary majority, 
Nepal's unprecedented attempt at reconciling the demands of hereditary rule 
with the proletarian revolution may be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The new prime minister, Man Mohan Adhikary, 74, has been a committed if 
moderate Communist for half a century. On Tuesday, when King Birendra tapped 
him for the premier's post to end two weeks of political uncertainty, he rode 
to the royal palace in an old Toyota -- and left in a black Mercedes-Benz 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall keep the country's reality in mind -- adopt practical and pragmatic 
economic policies -- and hope for cooperation from all others in our consensual 
approach," a conciliatory Adhikary told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the king administered Adhikary the oath of office under 
glittering chandeliers at the royal palace. The new prime minister, who used to 
wear his salt-and-pepper beard long and shaggy, had trimmed it to a neat 
goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 To govern this rugged land the size of North Carolina, Adhikary appointed a 
15-member Cabinet of party confidants. His brother, lawyer Bharat Mohan 
Adhikary, was named finance minister. The powerful party general secretary, 
42-year-old Madhav Kumar Nepal, will serve as deputy prime minister, foreign 
minister and defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Adhikary assured Nepalis that he will continue to accept foreign aid and 
capital but will try to use the money more effectively. He vowed to continue 
Nepal's multi-party democracy and neutral tack in foreign policy, but he said 
he will attempt to revise a longstanding, controversial treaty with India that 
many here believe gives the giant to the south too much influence over Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the party has pledged to promote private enterprise, it has also gone 
on record in favor of dismantling large agricultural landholdings and slamming 
the brakes on privatization of state economic assets. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Adhikary's position in Parliament leaves him few options besides 
moderation. In the Nov. 15 election, his Communist Party of Nepal-United 
Marxist-Leninist won 88 seats, topping the 83 grabbed by the centrist Nepali 
Congress party, which had been in power since multi-party democracy was 
restored three years ago. The right-wing, pro-monarchy National Democratic 
Party picked up 20 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress and the monarchists failed to agree on cobbling together a 
governing coalition of 103 seats, the magic number needed to control the 
205-seat chamber, Birendra had no choice under the 1990 constitution but to 
appoint the chairman of the party with the most seats as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Adhikary's government now has 30 days to prove it is supported by a majority 
of the members of the bicameral Parliament's lower house. If it fails, Birendra 
will have to call new elections within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The unforgiving numbers are one reason countries that inject large amounts of 
aid into Nepal don't appear terribly concerned by the Communists' victory. 
"They can't take any drastic or dramatic measures with the kind of strength 
they possess," one Katmandu-based Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Nepali commentator said the United States and other countries had 
indicated to government officials that they will not stop giving assistance to 
Nepal, one of the world's 10 poorest nations, but are following a "wait and 
watch" policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Adhikary was thrown into prison in December, 1960, when the monarch who then 
reigned -- Birendra's father, Mahendra -- staged a coup d'etat with the help of 
the army and dismantled the kingdom's first democratically elected government 
after only 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Times special correspondent Adhikary reported from Katmandu, Times staff 
writer Dahlburg from New Delhi.

FAA REORGANIZING, ADDING SAFETY OFFICE; AVIATION: AGENCY RESPONDS TO CRITICISM 
FOR FAILURE TO ACT IN ADVANCE OF TWO CRASHES -- ONE IN O.C. -- REGARDING 
POTENTIAL DANGER FROM BOEING 757 WAKE TURBULENCE.

 Four months after an internal report criticized the Federal Aviation 
Administration's ability to act upon safety issues, the agency is being 
reorganized along business lines, with the addition of a new safety systems 
office, FAA Administrator David R. Hinson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While insisting that all FAA personnel consider safety their main task, Hinson 
said he is establishing a new safety systems division reporting directly to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The aviation safety goal is "zero defects," he said, adding that he expects 
the new office to help attain this. The office will cooperate with other 
nations, airlines, manufacturers and others to collect all types of information 
about aviation and aircraft operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization comes four months after a joint investigation by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation and the FAA concluded that the FAA did not have 
the proper procedures in place to ensure that safety concerns are acted upon in 
a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and Hinson ordered the internal 
review in mid-June after a series of reports in The Times indicated that the 
FAA knew about the potential danger of Boeing 757 wake turbulence long before 
two crashes that claimed 13 lives. In one of these, the top two executives of 
the In-N-Out Burgers chain and three others were killed in December, 1993, in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 46-page report released after the internal probe, a review panel 
recommended that Hinson create a more effective mechanism to address safety 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the agency lacked "a single organization, mechanism or entity" 
that can identify potential safety problems, alert others within the agency and 
follow up on safety recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before the House Subcommittee on Technology, Environment and 
Aviation on July 28, Hinson pledged that within 60 days he would devise a 
better system to spot and act upon emerging safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to study every bit of available data, analyze it in new ways and 
set up an early-warning system for any problems, Hinson explained. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, large amounts of data are generated during routine 
service and maintenance work, pilot reports, minor flight problems and other 
instances that may not attract attention. 
</P>
<P>
 By compiling these data in computers, analysts could locate patterns or note 
what seem to be minor problems for repair before an incident occurs, Hinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was not a universally held view, the Department of 
Transportation-FAA report revealed that some officials within the FAA believed 
the agency could have acted sooner than it did in taking steps designed to 
prevent accidents caused by Boeing 757 wake turbulence.

POSTAL SERVICE TO RING IN 1995 WITH 32-CENT 1ST-CLASS STAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cost of a first-class letter will rise to 32 cents on Jan. 1 under a 
pricing plan approved Wednesday by the independent Postal Rate Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on rates will be made this month by the U.S. Postal Service 
board of governors, who are expected to ratify the new charges. It would be the 
first increase since 1991, when the cost of postage rose from 25 cents to 29 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The average American household will spend an additional $7.20 to $9.00 a year 
for stamps, according to the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission accepted the Postal Service request for a 32-cent stamp, but 
modified other proposals and decided to shift $450 million in proposed 
additional revenues from consumers and small business to major mailers of 
advertising and newspaper and magazine publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate commission was critical of what chairman Edward J. Gleiman called 
"the Postal Service practice of attempting to place a disproportionate amount 
of overhead costs on first-class mailers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service asked for a 21-cent postcard rate, but the commission cut 
it to 20 cents, which would represent a penny increase. 
</P>
<P>
 For heavier letters, such as those with wedding invitations, family 
photographs or large greeting cards, the Postal Service wanted a 25-cent rate 
for the second ounce. But the commission voted to hold it at the current level 
of 23 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Priority mail now costs $2.90 to ship two pounds or less. The requested rate 
was $3.20, and the commission recommended $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Express Mail, now $9.95 for an eight-ounce letter, had a requested rate of 
$10.95, which the commission trimmed to $10.75. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these rates are lower than the Postal Service recommended and all 
benefit individual mailers," Gleiman told a news conference at commission 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service said it was disappointed that the commission rejected its 
proposal to raise rates 10.3% across the board. "Nevertheless, its decision 
appears designed to meet our revenue requirements," a Postal Service statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hopeful that the governors will act within two weeks and that rates 
can be adjusted as early as possible in January," the Postal Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an alliance with third-class mailers and big advertising and catalogue 
firms that are some of its biggest customers, the Postal Service had asked for 
a uniform 10.3% rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rate commission said that this would be unfair to the first-class mail 
users and proposed a rate structure with an 8.9% increase for this category. 
</P>
<P>
 The added postage burden would be approximately 14% for second-class newspaper 
and periodical publishers and third-class advertising mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Business groups, which had hoped for approval of a uniform increase, accepted 
the decision with reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, it's not a bad decision," said Arthur B. Sackler, managing director 
of the Mailers Council, which represents a broad range of commercial interests. 
"The changes are significant but not severe." 
</P>
<P>
 The rate increase endorsed by the commission would produce $4.7 billion in new 
revenues next year, giving the Postal Service a budget of nearly $55 billion.

'WHITE-COLLAR' MONEY LAUNDRY IS SMASHED; CRIME: LAWYERS, RABBIS, A POLICE 
OFFICER AND AN L.A. DIPLOMAT ARE AMONG 23 CHARGED. RING HANDLED TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DRUG PROCEEDS, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

 An international drug-money laundering operation -- so brazen that prosecutors 
charge it used lawyers, rabbis, a diplomat, and a police officer who reportedly 
stored close to $1 million in his precinct locker -- was broken up Wednesday 
after raids in New York, Florida, Colombia, Europe and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan -- where the indictments of 23 
defendants were unsealed -- said the ring used couriers and cooperative bank 
officials to launder tens of millions of dollars in narcotics proceeds in the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents photographed some of the alleged couriers carrying cash in 
boxes and duffel bags to a Citibank branch in the Bronx, where an assistant 
manager was charged with aiding the operation by depositing the cash and then 
wiring the deposits to accounts in Europe and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of the scheme is the number of professionals involved," 
White said. "It is white-collar crime at its worst." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabbi, police officer, hospital administrator, attorney, honorary consul 
general -- it sounds like a list of professions one would aspire (to)," said 
William A. Gavin, deputy assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York 
field office. "Money became the narcotic. Even people in respectable 
professions yielded and succumbed to temptation." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested after the 10-month investigation were securities dealer 
Latchezar Christov, 57, the honorary consul general in Los Angeles for the 
Republic of Bulgaria, and Donald J. Hayden, 59, also a securities dealer at 
Laidlaw Equities in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Court papers charged that Hayden "received large quantities of cash at his 
office," which was then shipped via Federal Express to other ring members in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged that Christov worked with Hayden, "receiving cash and 
shipping it." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal complaint described Christov's honorary-consul position as being a 
part-time employee of Bulgaria and noted that he had immunity "only in 
connection with official acts" involving diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged that the ring handled drug proceeds for traffickers in the 
United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and cities throughout Europe. During their 
investigation, agents seized about $5 million in cash from alleged members of 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 White charged that the ring leaders in the United States were: Richard Spence, 
a former New York City firefighter and a successful businessman; Harvey Weinig, 
a Manhattan lawyer; and Robert Hirsch, who was Weinig's law partner. Hirsch was 
arrested separately and has pleaded guilty to money laundering and other 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, Spence was responsible for organizing money 
pickups, depositing large sums of cash into bank accounts and moving the cash 
to various accounts via wire transfers. Prosecutors said Spence operated a 
trucking company, a beer distributorship and a home-heating and oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 Court papers charged that Weinig's law firm was used to conceal the 
organization's activities, to engage in banking transactions and to coordinate 
with bankers and couriers in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Also charged was Michael Kalanz, a 30-year-old police officer assigned to a 
precinct in the Bronx. Prosecutors charged Kalanz was "responsible for counting 
and storing substantial amounts of United States currency and transporting it 
to banks on behalf of the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the money was secreted in luggage kept in Kalanz's six-foot precinct 
locker, which was secured with a padlock. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents charged that the network of couriers included two rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents said a search of the home of Gary Salerno, an alleged courier who 
works as a hospital administrator, turned up what appeared to be a "hit man's 
kit" -- including weapons, handcuffs and a garrote, a device used to strangle 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in 
prison and a $500,000 fine.

KOHL, MITTERRAND PRESS POLITICAL SOLUTION IN BOSNIA; DIPLOMACY: GERMAN, FRENCH 
LEADERS SUGGEST THEY MAY ACCEPT A SERBIAN CONFEDERATION. THEY VIEW BIHAC 
ASSAULT AS 'SHRILL WARNING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand of France, 
meeting Wednesday for a final bilateral summit before the French leader's 
retirement, put aside differences on Bosnia-Herzegovina and urged a negotiated 
settlement to the conflict there. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe's elder statesmen called for a diplomatic solution based on "just and 
balanced rights" for all groups in the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a printed statement, Kohl and Mitterrand said if the Bosnian Serbs accept 
the peace proposal drafted by the Contact Group of five nations, the two 
leaders will consider making "adjustments" in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 They apparently were referring to the idea raised by some U.S. and U.N. 
officials in recent days that would allow the Bosnian Serbs to form a 
confederation with Serbia, much as the Bosnian Croats and Muslims confederated 
with Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the United States and its European allies had refused to 
accept a Serbian confederation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one minute to 12 and we must all . . . do everything to pursue the 
peace plan," Kohl said at a joint news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the French-German position will be set forth at a meeting of the 
Contact Group -- the United States, Russia, France, Germany and Britain -- in 
Brussels on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing Serbian assault on the U.N. safe area of Bihac "is the final 
and most shrill warning signal for us," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Kohl's Christian Democratic Union called for a lifting of the U.N. 
arms embargo to the Muslim-backed Bosnian government, a position opposed by 
France and Britain, which have thousands of peacekeeping troops on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl reiterated that he believed in lifting the embargo in principle, but 
backed off the stand in favor of presenting a unified European position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we have no troops there, we restrain ourselves," Kohl said. "The German 
position is to go along with the alliance." 
</P>
<P>
 The 78-year-old Mitterrand added that "Europe's duty is to maintain the 
impression that there is clearly no solution other than a political, negotiated 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 The Contact Group's peace plan, which would give 51% of Bosnia to a 
Muslim-Croat federation and 49% to the Serbs, has been accepted by the Bosnian 
government but rejected by the Serbs, who would have to give up territory they 
have won militarily. It does not allow for a Serbian confederation. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, which views the Bosnian Serbs as the aggressors in the war, 
until now has been urging greater use of NATO air power to pressure the Serbs 
to accept the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kohl-Mitterrand summit was their last before Mitterrand, who is dying of 
prostate cancer, steps down in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kohl is a conservative and Mitterrand a Socialist, they have been 
allies on European unity over the last 12 years that both have been in power. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have had their differences too, and in what seemed to be a quid pro 
quo, Kohl announced that he had invited the leaders of six Eastern European 
countries -- Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Romania and 
Bulgaria -- to make an appearance at a European Union summit in Essen next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany has been far more eager than France to integrate the former Communist 
countries into the EU. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany believes that integration will help protect its borders, while France 
fears diminished influence within the union as its center moves east.

ISRAELI COURT RULES IN GAY COUPLES' FAVOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that El Al airline must extend the same 
benefits to partners of gay employees as it does to partners of heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In a decision hailed as a victory by gays and assailed by rabbis, the court 
upheld the petition of El Al flight attendant Jonathan Danilovitz, who fought a 
five-year court battle to force Israel's national carrier to honor his request 
for an annual complimentary flight with his partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Danilovitz turned to a labor court in 1989 when the airline rejected his 
request for the flight, a privilege extended to heterosexual couples. The labor 
court ruled in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday the Supreme Court rejected El Al's appeal, saying the airline must 
extend equal rights to gay couples.

 Beijing's city government has decided to ban dogs from all public areas from 
dawn to dusk and to limit families -- at a high cost in annual fees -- to 
ownership of no more than one of man's best friends. The law, which takes 
effect May 1, limits every family to no more than one dog and requires Beijing 
citizens and foreigners to obtain approval from local police before they can

EGYPT, UNDER FIRE, DEFENDS SUPPORT OF KADAFI; MIDEAST: DISPUTE WITH U.S. COMES 
AS NATION HAS LOST ITS STATUS AS ONLY ARAB STATE AT PEACE WITH ISRAEL. AT STAKE 
IS BILLIONS IN AID. 
</P>

<P>
 Egypt, caught in a storm over its support for the neighboring regime of Col. 
Moammar Kadafi in Libya, is moving swiftly to shore up its relations with the 
United States at a time when its role as America's most important Arab ally is 
threatened for the first time since the historic Camp David accords. 
</P>
<P>
 Top presidential adviser Osama Baz, returning from a trip to Washington to 
help narrow the rift, said Wednesday that there is no crisis, but he insisted 
that Egypt has the right to maintain independent policies on key Arab issues, 
including support for Kadafi and opposition to a regional chemical weapons ban 
when Israel possesses nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, our views on these issues do not coincide exactly, for the simple 
reason that the U.S. is not a Middle Eastern country. It is far away. It does 
not know as much as we know about the region -- what offers stability and 
tranquillity and what motivates people of the region to behave in a certain 
manner," Baz said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while Egypt is "not encouraging Libya to defy U.N. resolutions, 
but . . . trying to facilitate compliance," the United States must "bear in 
mind it is not an easy thing for a government to extradite its own citizens to 
be tried in another country." 
</P>
<P>
 The disputes come at a crucial juncture for the United States and Egypt, which 
at a time of widening Middle East peace can no longer claim to be the only Arab 
state at peace with Israel as justification for its $2.1 billion a year in U.S. 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt has been stung by allegations that it has overzealously defended the 
Kadafi regime, coupled with reports of massive Libyan investments in the 
Egyptian hotel and tourism sector and complaints by the United States that 
Egypt has violated international sanctions by allowing the shipment of 
embargoed aircraft spare parts to Tripoli, the Libyan capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the U.S. elections, with Republicans threatening to cut foreign 
aid and hinting at a new foreign policy agenda in the Middle East, was even 
more alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), likely chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, raised an alert in Cairo when he recently called Egypt "a hesitant 
and insecure ally" and said Israel is "the only true friend of the United 
States" in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The government and opposition press in Egypt have both gone on the attack, 
accusing the United States of attempting to bend Egypt to its will and labeling 
as "blackmail" any attempt by the United States to use its aid to Egypt as 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wish the Republican Party would understand that Egypt welcomes America's 
friendship without any strings attached," said well-known pro-government 
columnist Mustafa Amin. "But some American politicians understand friendship as 
meaning we should walk behind them." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest flare-up over Libya reflects a longstanding difference of opinion 
between Cairo and Washington over how to deal with the regime of Kadafi, who 
has turned in recent years to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for help in 
mediating the standoff over the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States has pursued a strategy of sanctions and isolation to 
force Kadafi to turn over two suspects for trial in the bombing of the airliner 
and a separate attack on a French airliner in Africa, Egypt has long argued 
that compromise and conciliation are the best ways to change the behavior of 
the renegade Libyan regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent press reports from Washington suggest that the United States compares 
Mubarak unfavorably with assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who 
branded Kadafi a "mad dog." The United States has officially protested what it 
says were two shipments of embargoed spare aircraft parts to Libya across the 
Egyptian border. 
</P>
<P>
 "This difference in view between Egypt and the U.S. on Libya is a matter of 
degree only and a matter of approach rather than a matter of principle, because 
like the U.S., we would like to see Libya sever all its relations with 
organizations that conducted any terrorist activities. We would like stability 
to reign over the region. But the question is not one of punishment or 
reprisal," said Baz, director of the president's bureau of political affairs 
and widely considered the second most powerful man in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Baz said that Egypt -- while arguing that it is a double standard to impose 
sanctions on nations like Libya and Iraq when the world does not move 
forcefully to stop Serbian aggression against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- 
nonetheless has worked aggressively to mediate the Lockerbie standoff with 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 Baz said that while U.S. officials have denied they have any aim of removing 
Kadafi, "we would like to make the point that we don't believe the U.S. or any 
foreign power should indulge in policies or actions that aim at toppling 
regimes in the region. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. officials should not expect us to pursue a policy which is based on 
name-calling with any government, because that's not our style." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Administration has emphasized that it continues to regard Egypt as a 
key ally for which economic aid continues to be critical, not only because of 
Egypt's role in the peace process but because stability in Egypt, threatened 
with a wave of Islamic extremism, is vital to the stability of the entire 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not by accident that Egypt was President Clinton's first stop on his 
just-concluded tour of the region," Assistant Secretary of State Robert 
Pelletreau said last month, pointing to Egypt's crucial role in mediating peace 
talks between Israel and other Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelletreau also emphasized the need for sustainable economic growth and new 
jobs in Egypt, warning that without it, "internal stability will be hard to 
maintain." 
</P>
<P>
 The Libya sanctions dispute arose over official U.S. allegations that Egypt 
allowed the shipment of spare parts to Libya in violation of U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baz said the Egyptian government has conducted an inquiry and found that one 
of the companies cited by the United States, identified as ADA, "does not 
exist." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the other company, which he identified as Samman Co., did ship several 
containers to Libya but that they were shipped through another country and 
there was no indication that they contained spare aircraft parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them strict instructions to make sure of the contents from now on," 
Baz said. "And we are inspecting now, so how can Egypt be accused of violating 
the sanctions, especially since neither the government nor any public-sector 
company has been accused? . . . We have no interest in violating the 
sanctions."

RISE IN STUDENT LOANS REFLECTS U.S. TREND; EDUCATION: BORROWING TO KEEP PACE 
WITH SOARING COSTS INCREASED 40% IN CALIFORNIA TO $1.69 BILLION IN PAST SCHOOL 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Borrowing to pay for college is rising dramatically across the country, with 
more students assuming more debt than ever before, according to a preliminary 
report released Wednesday by the American Council on Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a survey of more than 300 institutions of higher learning, the report 
found that from July, 1993, through June, 1994, the nation's students and 
parents borrowed 41% more than during the previous 12-month period. Borrowing 
in California mirrored that trend, rising 40% over the same period to $1.69 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "To our knowledge, this is the biggest jump that we've seen in history," said 
David Merkowitz, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, who 
lamented "a breaking of the traditional bargain in higher education: that the 
current generation will help pay for the education of the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
 "The costs keep going up, but the grant money hasn't gone up," said Phyllis 
Coldiron, director of financial aid at Chapman University in Orange, which 
mirrors the nationwide trend. "Because the grant money has been static, the gap 
has to be filled with loans or an institution's funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Callan, executive director of the California Higher Education Policy 
Center, called the report's findings "cause for significant concern." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major structural change in the way we pay for college in the United 
States," Callan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report could not determine the average debt level per student, 
analysts speculated that it, too, is rising sharply. They warned that once 
today's students graduate and begin trying to repay their loans, indebtedness 
will force them to make choices they might not otherwise make. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kinds of decisions will these people make about graduate school if they 
already have huge debts? Will they (feel free to) choose low-paying professions 
like teaching? Will they be able to buy houses or cars? What will be the effect 
on the economy?" asked Merkowitz, who said growing student debt has "very 
severe implications for the future of this country." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, loans have become increasingly important to students because 
other forms of financial aid have not kept pace with soaring college costs. In 
addition, the federal government last year made it easier to borrow money by 
relaxing eligibility requirements while raising the amount students could 
borrow each year. The result: a national borrowing boom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 75 million loans made since the original guaranteed student loan 
program started in 1966, 16% were made in the last two years," said Fred 
Galloway, the American Council on Education's director of federal policy 
analysis. "Furthermore, of the $183 billion borrowed in the nearly 30-year 
history of the program, 22% was borrowed in the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 California is experiencing a record borrowing surge as well. During the 12 
months ending in June, 1994, borrowing increased 65% among California State 
University students -- the first time that Cal State had outpaced the 
University of California in loan volume. Cal State Fullerton kept pace; its 
undergraduate and graduate students borrowed about $16.2 million in 1993-94 
compared to almost $9.9 million in 1992-93 -- a 64% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Students attending the UC system borrowed 54% more than they had the previous 
academic year, while the number of loans increased 36% at community colleges. 
Borrowing by students at private colleges and universities in California rose 
47%. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine students borrowed about $24.6 million in federal loans in 1993-94, a 
39% increase over the $17.7 million they borrowed the year before, said 
Kimberly Hart, coordinator of university programs in the student financial 
support office of the UC Office of the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "The limits on how much students can borrow have grown," Hart said. "Students 
are going for those extra loan dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Chapman University in Orange took out $9.6 million in federal 
loans in 1993-94, a 68% increase over the year before.

PALESTINIAN KILLS ISRAELI SOLDIER IN ATTACK WITH AX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ax-wielding Palestinian hacked to death an Israeli soldier Wednesday as she 
waited for a bus in the northern town of Afula, Israeli police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant, identified as Wahib abu Rub, 25, of the West Bank town of 
Qalqiliya, was identified by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a member of Hamas, 
a militant Islamic organization that has vowed to sabotage Israel's peace 
accord with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The ax attack came just one day after the Israeli army announced that it had 
arrested 40 members of the Iziddin al-Qassam military wing of Hamas. The army 
has arrested about 400 Hamas members in the past few months, an army spokesman 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 40 Iziddin al-Qassam members who were arrested were several men 
suspected of helping to plan the bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv in October that 
killed more than 20 people, the spokesman said. The army said it also found 
weapons, chemicals for making bombs and skullcaps -- sometimes worn by 
Palestinians who pose as Jewish settlers to drive through roadblocks or pick up 
Israeli hitchhikers -- in the homes of some of those arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The army said some of the suspects were planning further bombing attacks on 
Israelis in the West Bank and inside Israel's pre-1967 boundaries. The Hamas 
attacks have increased political pressure on Rabin to slow negotiations with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization on extending Palestinian self-rule 
throughout the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's announcement implied that security forces are beginning to go on the 
offensive against the organization. But Israelis had scant time to celebrate 
the news that their security forces had rounded up dozens of hard-core Hamas 
members before Wednesday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Rub reportedly hit Liat Gabai, 19, in the forehead with an ax several 
times before she fell to the ground, the ax embedded in her head. Gabai, who 
reportedly was wearing her army uniform when she was assaulted, was rushed to a 
nearby hospital. She was pronounced dead a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arab ran after her with an ax," said Ilan Tzadok, a witness to the 
attack. "She stood there with the ax in her head and suddenly fell. He ran. 
There were people with guns. I stood before him. We were afraid to open fire. 
He put his arms up and walked into the police station," Tzadok told Israel 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio said Abu Rub was convicted in 1989 of membership in Hamas and 
served time in prison until 1991. But police said today that, in interrogation, 
Abu Rub maintained he is currently a member of Fatah, the mainstream PLO 
faction founded by Yasser Arafat.

PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE GETS CASH INFUSION; MIDEAST: DONOR NATIONS WILL GIVE $148 
MILLION TO BOOST AUTHORITY IN GAZA STRIP AND WEST BANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The troubled Middle East peace process received a major boost Wednesday as a 
group of donor nations agreed to an emergency injection of $148 million to 
prevent the collapse of limited Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will fill a $125-million hole in the current Palestinian operating 
budget, allowing the fledgling government to do such basics as pay its police 
force and other employees through the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional $23 million was earmarked for an urgent jobs creation program 
aimed at putting as many as 5,000 more Palestinians to work in a matter of 
weeks and generating employment for an additional 10,000 to 15,000 within a few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements came at a two-day meeting here of the so-called Ad Hoc Liaison 
Committee that includes Israel, the Palestinians, major donor nations and 
international institutions such as the World Bank and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres earlier this week warned that failure to come up 
with the needed funds would place the entire Middle East peace process in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 With the initial euphoria that followed last year's historic agreement between 
Israel and the PLO all but gone in the Palestinian areas, increased violence 
has threatened both Arafat's grip on power and Israeli security. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the moment of truth," said Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Jan 
Egeland, who chaired the meeting. "The donors rose to this occasion." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Palestinian representative, Minister for Economic Planning and 
International Cooperation Nabil Shaath, praised the accord. "I'm happy to say 
this meeting provides some serious measures for helping out," he said. "It's a 
very important step toward the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference, Egeland said low-key U.S. diplomacy during the 
run-up to the meeting played an important role in getting the necessary funds. 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is said to have personally lobbied 
several foreign ministers by telephone over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment in Gaza is about 50%, and immediate visible economic benefits 
were seen as a crucial ingredient to dampen the volatile political atmosphere 
in the Palestinian areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly unusual nature of most of the assistance -- foreign aid usually 
covers high-profile development projects -- reflected the mood of urgency that 
surrounded the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 This same mood appears to have been responsible for what many participants saw 
as a new level of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't a meeting of slogans but of brainstorming, of real thinking of 
what each side could do to get real results," said the senior Israeli 
representative, Uri Savir. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, a meeting of the same ad hoc committee broke down amid 
recrimination after the Palestinians sought funding for development projects in 
East Jerusalem, which they see as their future capital but which Israelis claim 
as an inseparable part of a city that belongs to them forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Jerusalem issue was not raised this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Egeland said Wednesday's agreement came within the framework of last year's 
initial donor community pledge to back the Middle East agreement with $2.4 
billion, for "the next few years," and constituted not new money but a shift of 
funds initially planned for longer-term projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew that if they didn't give money for the short-term crisis, there 
would be no need for the grand, long-term projects everyone wanted to do," 
Egeland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The donors also agreed to establish a locally based coordinating committee 
with Israeli, Palestinian and their own representatives to help clear 
bottlenecks and bureaucratic snags that have so far slowed the transformation 
of pledged aid into real projects.

TRADE ACCORD SUPPORTERS CONFIDENT OF SENATE APPROVAL; GATT: SENATORS ARE 
REPORTED LINING UP BEHIND THE LANDMARK GLOBAL PACT. UNUSUAL ALLIANCES, FAMILIAR 
ARGUMENTS PRECEDE TODAY'S VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Senate began debate Wednesday on a landmark reduction of tariffs and other 
barriers to world trade as supporters, including senior Clinton Administration 
officials, declared that the final votes for passage are falling into line. 
</P>
<P>
 One survey showed just enough senators supporting or leaning toward supporting 
the pact for the Administration to succeed -- a comfortable position with 24 
hours to go, especially with more votes possible from 15 to 20 senators who 
remain undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do expect that by the time the vote is cast tomorrow, we will have the 
votes," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little like a coach at halftime when you're ahead -- but you've got 
the second half yet to go. . . . " said Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. "The 
momentum is swinging our way." 
</P>
<P>
 With the House having approved the accord that would vastly expand the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has governed global commerce since 1947, 
the Senate ballot today is the final step in a process so long in the making 
that it has spanned three presidencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruit of seven years of negotiations that began during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, the pact ultimately would have 124 nations agree to slash 
tariffs, the taxes charged on imports, by roughly 40% and bring down other 
barriers to global trade. 
</P>
<P>
 It would force participants to cut subsidies to farmers, expanding the market 
for U.S. agriculture, widen copyright protections for computer software, videos 
and recordings that are heavily pirated, and begin to make it easier for 
financial firms, among them accounting offices and insurance companies, to do 
business beyond their home markets. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the Administration has claimed, it would cut tariffs by nearly $750 
billion around the world, a shift that would lower prices and encourage greater 
consumption. Administration officials have also said that it would boost the 
U.S. economy by as much as $200 billion a year -- a figure even other 
supporters label as overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 From early-morning appearances on television news programs to speech-making on 
the Senate floor well after sunset, supporters and opponents rehashed the 
by-now familiar arguments. The debate sliced oddly across the political 
landscape, uniting common foes and driving wedges between longtime allies. 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate appeal that stretched across the spectrum, a business and 
agriculture alliance supporting the agreement brought together a group ranging 
from Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), one of the Senate's most liberal members 
and a trade protectionist, and such western conservatives as Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah). 
</P>
<P>
 Each offered strong backing for the pact as a measure that would create jobs 
by expanding exports. California's two senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara 
Boxer, also joined the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet ideological allies found themselves on opposite sides, as illustrated by 
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and Mikulski, who supported the accord while 
defending her past support for protectionist measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikulski said that her "heart and my soul" remain with "the blue-collar 
community" of Baltimore that traditionally has opposed free-trade measures. The 
trade pact, she said, would add jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go GATT because I'm absolutely convinced (that) the old ways are 
not working . . . and a new economy is about to be born," Mikulski said. "The 
only way the United States will be able to continue as a world economic power 
is to go GATT." 
</P>
<P>
 Metzenbaum, who is retiring, said that the trade pact would limit the United 
States' ability to ban foreign goods made by children and held up pictures of 
children at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around the world today, as many as 200 million children are subjected to 
abusive labor practices in sweat shops, in mines, in factories and in the 
fields," he said. "Global trade may bring great riches to multinational 
corporations but for millions of children around the world it is an unmitigated 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue are concerns that U.S. laws prohibiting the sale of foreign products 
made without regard to workers' rights or danger to the environment could be 
declared by international authorities under the new World Trade Organization, 
which would be created by the pact, to be unfair restraints on trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the new body would have no authority to 
overrule U.S. laws. In an agreement that secured the crucial support of the 
expected next Senate majority leader, Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the Congress could 
vote to end the nation's participation if a panel of U.S. judges finds that the 
international rulings are consistently unfair to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a safety net," Boxer said. "If it doesn't work right, we can get 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the anticipated support count neared the 60 votes needed to waive 
Senate budget rules and move the legislation forward, the Administration 
pressed wavering senators to climb aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton invited about 20, many of them undecided, to a breakfast today at the 
White House, and Bentsen, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and other 
senior officials corralled senators in person and on the telephone to nail down 
their support. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the Associated Press found 60 senators declared in favor of the 
trade plan or leaning toward supporting it, 26 against it or leaning against it 
and 14 undecided. A trade official said that about 20 senators remained 
uncommitted.

U.S. PROPOSES MASSIVE EFFORT TO SAVE EVERGLADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government Wednesday proposed a massive replumbing of much of 
South Florida to save the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1,945-page report, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers laid out options for 
restoring the hydrologic conditions that existed before urban and agricultural 
development decimated one of the world's largest marshes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corps did not endorse any of the six complex options for re-engineering 
water flow. All aim to re-create conditions similar to those that existed when 
the "River of Grass" flowed unimpeded in a 60-mile-wide swath, creating rich 
habitat for millions of birds, reptiles and mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists hope that the Corps and other federal and state agencies 
involved in Everglades restoration, a Clinton Administration priority, will 
endorse the most ambitious plan. That blueprint, in addition to rearranging 
levees and canals, calls for a broad "flowway" of water through the Everglades 
Agricultural Area and the construction of large water-reserve areas.

RAP ARTIST IN SHOOTING LEAVES HOSPITAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rapper Tupac Shakur checked himself out of Bellevue Hospital Center on 
Wednesday night, just hours after surgery for five gunshot wounds, a hospital 
administrator said. He left "against medical advice," said Bellevue 
administrator Larry Dugan. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakur, 23, was shot in the right thigh, left hand, scrotum and twice in the 
head, in what police said appeared to have been a robbery attempt early 
Wednesday morning. The gunmen took $40,000 worth of jewelry from Shakur but 
left his diamond-encrusted Rolex watch on his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Wednesday that they believed the incident was a robbery but had 
not ruled out the possibility that Shakur was set up to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . You can't discount the possibility that he was the intended target," 
said John Miller, deputy commissioner for public information. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a State Supreme Court jury deliberating sexual assault charges 
against Shakur in Manhattan continued without being told of the shooting.

ARTHRITIS, HEART DISEASE DETECTED IN 'ICE MAN' BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 5,300-year-old "Ice Man," whose well-preserved body was discovered in a 
glacier three years ago in the Alps, had arthritis, hardening of the arteries 
and broken ribs that healed slowly, researchers reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not much different from modern man," said Dr. William A. Murphy 
Jr., head of diagnostic imaging at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer 
Center in Houston."There are just very impressive similarities." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy reported on the medical miseries of the mummy, dubbed "Otzi" because it 
was found in Italy's Otzval Valley, at the annual meeting of the Radiological 
Society of North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers believe the gap-toothed Otzi was 25 to 40 when he died, but he 
already had developed fairly severe osteoarthritis -- the kind believed to 
result from wear and tear -- in his neck, lower back and one hip, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcium deposits were discovered in the blood vessels of Otzi's chest, pelvis 
and neck, indicating heart disease stalked the Stone Age man despite his almost 
certainly rigorous existence. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight fractures were discovered in Otzi's ribs, but no one can say 
whether they occurred all at once or at different times, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of thing that might have hospitalized modern man. It certainly 
would have sent modern man to the emergency room," he said. "He did very well 
with these; he certainly lived well beyond the injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy was part of an international team assembled at the University of 
Innsbruck, Austria, to examine the mummy with modern X-rays.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: VICTIMS' FAMILIES SHOULD BE HEARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Observing the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman on 
television this week blasting the lawyers and pronouncing O.J. Simpson guilty, 
I wondered how they had contained themselves for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 How must they have felt sitting in front of their television sets the past few 
months, watching the defense team of Cochran & Shapiro craft their production 
of a drama entitled "The Persecution of O.J."? 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, for example, friends, relatives and lawyers are shown visiting 
Simpson in the County Jail, giving assessments of his mental state, telling how 
much he misses his kids and how he dreams of spending the holidays with them. 
This suspect has more visitors in a week than some prisoners have in a life 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever present at these episodes is Robert L. Shapiro, his face soulful and 
sympathetic, although it's hard to take him seriously when he's wearing a 
garish warm-up suit and an odd baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildup became really big the week before the USC-UCLA football game when 
TV sports shows repeatedly showed the tape of old Trojan Simpson's famous 1967 
winning run against the Bruins. So it is perfectly understandable that Denise 
Brown, Nicole's sister, said Tuesday that the family refuses to "allow another 
day to go by with TV news programs filled from one end to the other with 
sympathetic stories about the defendant, with heavy emphasis on his broken 
field running abilities, and his brilliant acting roles. We just want the 
people of this country to remember that he stands accused of committing a 
terrible crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much is held back in the families' assault. Asked by ABC's Diane Sawyer 
whether she thinks Simpson killed her sister, Brown said in an interview for 
tonight's "Primetime Live" that "my feeling is yes. Yeah, I think he did it." 
As for Simpson, she said, "He believes his own lies." Goldman's father, Fred 
Goldman, said on "Good Morning America" this week that "from the evidence 
that's come forth, it's hard to believe it's anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In court on Wednesday, Shapiro and co-counsel Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. objected 
to the criticisms of the victims' families. Under their rules, you're not 
supposed to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense attorneys cannot overlook a body of federal and state law that 
makes sure victims and their relatives are not consigned to the sidelines, that 
their loss will be remembered, even by the cruelly impersonal criminal justice 
system, that they can fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked about victims rights with Prof. Rory Little of the University of 
California's Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, who teaches legal 
ethics. Little, who was a federal prosecutor for seven years, recalled how 
victims rights laws grew out of a feeling "that the victims were viewed as an 
unnecessary fifth wheel, and they were left out of the process even though they 
were the ones most affected." 
</P>
<P>
 "What really stimulated this feeling was plea bargaining, bargaining away 
sentences by the prosecution," he said. "A rapist would get a few months in a 
treatment center and the victim would read about it in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, victims or their survivors are notified of each legal step 
before it occurs. Victims and their relatives speak to the court before 
sentencing. "It forces you (as a prosecutor) to put yourself in the victim's 
shoes. It forces you to listen. The criminal justice system can be pretty 
mechanical, pretty routine and people in the system lose sight of individual 
cases because they have so many cases to process." 
</P>
<P>
 By speaking out, the Brown and Goldman families are acting within the spirit 
of these laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The families are also exercising their rights under another law, the 1st 
Amendment, guaranteeing freedom of speech. Courts can gag a lawyer but, as 
Professor Little noted, "there isn't anything that restricts the rights of 
someone who isn't a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Little said Denise Brown, seeing "the spotlight on O.J. in a carefully 
orchestrated campaign by his attorney has decided to tell her story, and I 
think she has the right to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 And by doing so, Little said, she has hurt the Simpson team. "Shapiro's job is 
to create as a positive public image of his client as he can and this (the 
families' words) is wreaking havoc with the strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran and Shapiro fought back in the hand-to-hand combat manner they use in 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendly duo you see on television -- the creators of the warm Simpson 
image -- turned into attack dogs when confronted by the families. Unbelievably, 
Cochran tried to portray the mourners as tools of the prosecution rather than 
see them as bereaved human beings. Cochran went so far as to say that you "can 
hardly turn on the television without seeing Denise Brown." This from an 
attorney who is making a handsome living representing big name defendants who 
frequently land him on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 To Cochran and Shapiro, the families are trouble. In their scenario, there can 
be only one victim -- O.J. Simpson, battered by his wife, framed by the police, 
crucified by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 This is as dumb as it is reprehensible. The defense response made sure the 
story will continue to be covered by the media. It won't fade away soon. 
</P>
<P>
 We've been powerfully reminded that a young woman and a young man were stabbed 
to death last summer and that two families' lives will never be the same.

ITO'S ORDER POSES CONFLICT FOR DNA EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The O.J. Simpson case took on a bicoastal tinge Wednesday when Judge Lance A. 
Ito ordered a defense expert to be in his court during the same period this 
month that the expert is supposed to be in a New York courtroom for an 
unrelated murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's order sets up a conflict over the scheduling of Peter Neufeld, a leading 
DNA legal expert whom Simpson's defense team hired to handle much of the work 
for and during a crucial hearing on the admissibility of genetic evidence 
against the former football great in his double murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Before issuing the order Wednesday, Ito warned Simpson's lead attorney, Robert 
L. Shapiro, that Neufeld could be cited for contempt if he is not at the DNA 
hearing in Los Angeles, which is tentatively scheduled for Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to an unexplained tour that he and lawyers took of the Los Angeles 
County Men's Central Jail on Tuesday, Ito said: "Do you think Mr. Neufeld would 
enjoy five days there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro told the judge he did not believe matters would come to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, Ito's order would be the basis of an appeal of a Manhattan 
judge's order issued this week requiring Neufeld to be in court starting today 
on the New York case, which is expected to last at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 State Supreme Court Judge Harold Rothwax has refused to give Neufeld a 
continuance in the New York case and has threatened him with a contempt charge 
and possibly jail time if he is not in court there. 
</P>
<P>
 If Neufeld loses his planned appeal of that order, opening arguments in the 
Simpson case could be delayed weeks. Shapiro said he is doing everything he can 
to avoid that possibility because Simpson has demanded a speedy trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro told Ito that Neufeld was not only involved in the DNA hearing but 
also involved in many other aspects of the case, including overall defense 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a team effort on behalf of Mr. Simpson," Shapiro said. "This is not 
something where someone's attention can be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is charged with the June 12 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no known witnesses to the crimes, much of the prosecution 
case hinges on circumstantial evidence, including the linking of Simpson to 
bloodstains and drops found at the murder scene, at Simpson's estate and inside 
a vehicle he was known to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ito issued the Neufeld order Wednesday, the search for alternate jurors 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, five of the seven jurors questioned were excused from 
service, mostly because they had formed opinions about the case based on news 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Nov. 8, when alternate jury selection began with a pool of 80 people, 38 
potential alternates have been chosen. Only about 20 are left in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that the remaining pool of potential alternates might not yield the 46 
he wants before peremptory challenges begin, Ito announced that he would have 
the jury commission bring in 20 more people to undergo orientation for possible 
service as alternates.

TRAFFIC STOP LEADS TO SEIZURE OF COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A motorist who was pulled over by a California Highway Patrol officer in 
Fontana for not displaying a front license plate on his pickup was arrested 
after the officer discovered 392 kilos of cocaine inside the vehicle, officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two alleged accomplices were later arrested after the driver's pager beeped 
during the arrest, alerting investigators to the location of the other 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration estimated the 
street value of the cocaine at $39 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Alfredo Garmino, 41, of Mexicali, was arrested on suspicion of 
possession and transportation of cocaine for sale. Guillermo Cortez, 21, and 
Ruben Cervantes, 29, were arrested at a motel in Ontario on suspicion of 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

CHECHEN RESIDENTS FLEE CAPITAL IN FACE OF RUSSIAN THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The streets of Chechnya's capital were filled with fleeing residents and the 
roar of raiding jets Wednesday, and neither side in the republic's civil war 
gave any sign of heeding Russia's threat to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian transport planes were bringing troops and weapons to the border of the 
small, mostly Muslim republic in the Caucasus Mountains, it was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be in position to enforce President Boris N. Yeltsin's ultimatum for 
the Chechens to stop fighting by today or face Russian intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting pits forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokar Dudayev, who has 
declared Chechnya independent from Russia, against rebels whom Dudayev says are 
armed and led by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict is the latest to underline the tensions among scores of ethnic 
groups in the former Soviet Union. The Caucasus region has been especially 
fractious. 
</P>
<P>
 For Moscow, which governs dozens of republics and regions in the Russian 
Federation, Chechnya has become a test of whether it is willing to use military 
might to hold the country together.

HOUSE PANEL SHARPLY REBUKES CIA IN AMES CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warning that the "business of intelligence is too important not to do well," 
the House Select Committee on Intelligence on Wednesday sharply criticized the 
CIA for a series of management failures that permitted disgraced spy Aldrich H. 
Ames to sell U.S. secrets to the Russians, leading to the deaths of undercover 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also called for new measures to reform the nation's intelligence 
apparatus and pledged to tighten public oversight of future endeavors when the 
new Congress comes to Washington in January. The findings go further than an 
earlier Senate report because they demand broader public monitoring of future 
CIA operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In harsh descriptions of the way the Central Intelligence Agency has operated 
in the last decade, committee Chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) said the Ames 
episode evolved under a "negligent attitude that prevailed at the agency." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it was lack of attention, lack of systems, lack of standards, lack of 
reporting, bad management . . . to my judgment it was all of the above," 
Glickman said. "It was a classic case of when something goes wrong, everything 
goes wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that there was no "nefarious reason" or "conspiracy of silence" that 
permitted Ames to get away with his betrayals of American intelligence. Rather, 
Glickman said, "I just think it was a case of sloppiness in big capital 
letters." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also released an unclassified transcript of a jailhouse interview 
with Ames conducted by committee leaders as part of the group's eight-month 
probe into allegations of management shortcomings that followed Ames' arrest 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
 The confessed spy told of vast amounts of money that he made selling secrets 
to the former Soviet Union, and he criticized the agency where he had built a 
lengthy and once-promising career. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly have to have intelligence collection, and we certainly need the 
technical resources," Ames said. "But I think there is a legitimate question of 
how much money we should be paying for what we really need. We collect entirely 
too much useless information at too great risk in too many friendly countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames pleaded guilty to espionage for which he acknowledged receiving more than 
$2 million during an eight-year period. Under a plea agreement, he was 
sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Intelligence Committee report last month also concluded that there 
was "gross negligence" inside the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Va. But while 
the House recommendations call for broader management changes, the Senate 
findings dealt more with individual situations, such as dealing with the 
alcohol problems of employees and improving safeguards for protecting internal 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both reports, which represent the most thorough unclassified reviews 
of the Ames debacle, do agree that the agency is in deep disarray. And they 
both concluded that most of the problems predate the administration of CIA 
Director R. James Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to review the analysis and recommendations thoroughly and to work 
with the committee to ensure that the problems we have mutually identified are 
fixed," Woolsey said of the House findings. "I am committed to these changes." 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier investigation by the CIA's inspector general recommended that 23 
current and former CIA officials should be held accountable for the Ames 
fiasco. Woolsey, however, has decided to go no further than reprimanding 11 of 
the officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization will hold an election tonight to 
choose a new president and other key board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The election will be held as part of a general meeting at 7:30 p.m. at the 
Pacific Lodge Boys' Home cafeteria, 4900 Serrania Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Murley, now the group's executive vice president, has been nominated to 
succeed Robert Gross, who is stepping down as president after five years, Gross 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who says he wants to stay active in the organization, has been 
nominated to replace Murley as executive vice president. Another executive vice 
president, Herb Madsen, has been nominated for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The slate, nominated at a Nov. 3 meeting, was approved unanimously, Gross 
said. Secretary Joan Blackmer has been nominated for reelection, as has the 
organization's treasurer, David Glucksman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominated for directors at large were Shirley Blessing, George De Mattos, Judy 
Guardia, Pat Patton, Dorothy Smith, John Walker and Erin Wolfe, according to 
Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who has been a member of the organization for eight years, said in a 
recent interview that he is stepping down as president in order to "bring in 
some fresh blood" to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross has spent a stormy five years as president of the organization, which 
led an effort to prevent the controversial Warner Ridge project, a large-scale 
office development proposed for Woodland Hills near Pierce College. The project 
fell through after a lease agreement with a major tenant went sour. FRANK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK PARK; LONGTIME RESIDENT TO JOIN PARKS BOARD

<P>
 For the first time since the special parks district was founded in 1961, an 
Oak Park resident will sit on the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District 
board of directors, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Oak Park resident Steven Iceland was appointed to fill a vacancy left 
on the five-member board by the resignation of Debi Schultze on Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the parks managed by Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District 
are in Simi Valley, the district owns and operates about 75 acres of parkland 
in Oak Park. 
</P>

 Iceland was selected in a unanimous vote by board members Bonnie Carpenter, 
Don Funk and Jim Meredith last week. Director Mark Johnson, who recently lost a 
reelection bid, was under consideration for the appointment and so could not 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith said Iceland was picked because of his community experience, not to 
fill any geographic quota. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were nine excellent candidates," Meredith said. "It was a very 
difficult choice. But Steve has been so involved in his community for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said she was also impressed by Iceland's knowledge of Ventura County 
politics and government. 
</P>
<P>
 Iceland has been on the Oak Park Advisory Committee to the park district for 
12 years and spent more than a decade on the Oak Park Municipal Advisory 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Simi Valley Police Detective Gene Hostetler, who was elected Nov. 8, 
will be sworn in at tonight's board meeting at 6:30 p.m. at the Sycamore Drive 
Community Center, 1692 Sycamore Drive, Simi Valley. MARY F. POLS

CHILD-MURDER CASE INFLAMES EMOTIONS; TRIAL: STORE CLERK ACCUSED IN GIRL'S DEATH 
PLANS INSANITY DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Hooman Ashkan Panah's capital murder trial begins, there is no doubt that 
emotions run deep about this case involving the sex-murder of second-grader 
Nicole Parker. The signs are everywhere: 
</P>
<P>
 Carved in a wooden railing outside Superior Court Judge Sandy Kreigler's 
sixth-floor Van Nuys courtroom, is graffiti warning that the "sex kid," Panah, 
"must die." 
</P>
<P>
 A bailiff who escorted the once-suicidal defendant to court recently was 
assigned to other duties after reportedly telling Panah, "Why don't you just 
kill yourself and save the taxpayers time and money?" 
</P>
<P>
 A seasoned detective broke into tears on the witness stand last month as he 
recounted his futile search for Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney, Robert Sheahen, hasn't been spared. Sheahen recalled in 
court papers that he recently met a longtime legal colleague who told him, "No 
offense, Bob, but I hope your guy dies." 
</P>
<P>
 Panah, a 23-year-old department store clerk, is charged with murder, 
kidnaping, rape, sodomy and committing lewd acts with a child. He could face 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and plans to use an insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony is scheduled to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because jury selection is continuing and feelings are so easily inflamed in 
the case, prosecutor Peter Berman and defense attorney Sheahen aren't 
discussing details. They are circumspect in their remarks, limiting them to 
matters of fact or procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 But records contained in the court file lay bare the ugliness of the killing, 
and set the stage for what could be a disturbing courtroom battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very ugly trial," said Nicole's mother, Lori Parker. "I'm 
dreading it." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's Iranian community also is abuzz about the case, since 
Panah is believed to be the first Iranian immigrant to face a possible death 
sentence in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Television coverage in the community of Iranian immigrants "has reached 
saturation level," defense attorney Sheahen said in court papers. He argued 
unsuccessfully that the case be moved out of the San Fernando Valley for Panah 
to receive a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen pointed to what he called strong anti-Iranian feelings in American 
society, describing Panah in court papers as "a foreigner from the most loathed 
location on the planet, and clearly a member of a group which arouses community 
hostility." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman disputed that argument in his legal response, pointing out that the 
Valley is ethnically diverse enough that picking an impartial jury shouldn't be 
difficult. If there are strong emotions about the case, he argued, they are a 
reaction to the crime itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah is accused of luring the 8-year-old Nicole into his Woodland Hills 
apartment, sodomizing her, strangling her and stuffing her nude, battered body 
into a suitcase left in his closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole disappeared shortly after 11:45 a.m. on Nov. 20, 1993. She was last 
seen playing with a softball and mitt in the courtyard between her father's 
apartment and Panah's. 
</P>
<P>
 Her body was found in Panah's closet about 24 hours later, following a 
frantic, highly publicized search staged from a command post at the sprawling 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah was arrested Nov. 21 after slashing his wrists and swallowing a bottle 
of sleeping pills in an apparent suicide attempt. After slashing his wrists, he 
appeared at a former girlfriend's apartment, saying he had "done something 
really bad and she would be hearing about it," she told police. He also told 
her the missing child was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 After Panah's arrest, police recovered a blood-stained journal in the BMW he 
was believed to have been driving. In the journal, he apologized to the child's 
family, but blamed Nicole's death on "powerful, evil and psychotic" people who 
"had a very strong weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the emotional caldron is the fact that the families of the victim 
and the defendant enjoy stature in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah's mother, Mehri Monfared, has been her son's staunchest defender. She 
has led efforts to establish a legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
 She produces a popular television show in Los Angeles for the Iranian 
community. The Panah case has been featured prominently on Iranian television 
shows and on the International Channel. In the Iranian community, many members 
"feel strongly that circumstances of this case reflect an appearance of 
institutional bias in favor (of) . . . Mrs. Parker against defendant Panah." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Parker has worked as a paralegal and a legal secretary and is engaged to 
marry prominent criminal defense attorney Martin Gladstein. She is involved in 
the activities of her three other children -- Little League, soccer, church and 
school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community really has rallied around me," she acknowledged. Parker said 
that after Nicole's slaying she received about 3,000 cards and letters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one-year anniversary of Nicole's death, a Catholic priest said Mass at 
her house. Thirty-five friends and relatives attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladstein said that neither he nor Parker has enjoyed any special treatment 
from court staff. If they are sympathetic figures, it is "because of the 
victim, because Nicole was so young and so innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the case strikes a public chord, it is not because of issues of 
privilege or prejudice, he said. It is a matter of lost innocence, and a lost 
sense of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who has kids realized there is no place that is safe anymore. If it 
can happen to a little 8-year-old in a secured apartment complex in a nice part 
of town, it can happen to anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a defenseless, little tiny girl," Parker said. "That's where the 
emotion comes from . . . This is every parent's worst nightmare."

KAREN FINLEY MANAGES TO KEEP BODY AND SOUL TOGETHER; ART: HER BLEND OF RAGE, 
COMPASSION AND DOWN-HOME DETAIL SURFACES AS SHE TELLS A UCI AUDIENCE ABOUT HER 
CONTROVERSIAL PERFORMANCE PIECES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "It's so lovely to be in a place where I'm welcome," Karen Finley told an 
audience at UC Irvine's Little Theatre Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from another artist, the phrase might just have been a pleasantry. But 
Finley has become accustomed to tense encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 She gained a curious kind of infamy after being vilified by conservative 
columnists and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) on the basis of reports of her 
performance piece "We Keep Our Victims Ready" (1989) in which she covered her 
body with various foods. The following year, she was denied a National 
Endowment for the Arts grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the liberal venues around the country that have booked her 
current tour "are so afraid to be associated with me, they won't announce me to 
the press," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new piece, "A Certain Level of Denial" -- which will be performed at the 
Santa Monica Museum of Art tonight as part of the Day Without Art AIDS 
observance -- lost one of its AIDS group sponsors, she said, because they 
feared alienating corporate supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley doesn't look the slightest bit like an artist-provocateur, with her 
friendly, open face, well-groomed shoulder-length hair and sporty clothes. But 
a slide from one of her early pieces, of her naked rear end dripping yam juice, 
served to remind the UCI audience of the extraordinary fearlessness and 
visceral feminist anger in her work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rambling account -- hindered by a stuck slide projector and her admitted 
tiredness after six weeks of touring the country -- Finley talked about her 
background and her work. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from the liberal university community of Evanston, Ill., she discovered 
the world of "happenings" -- spontaneous art events -- as a young teen-ager. 
Performance simply was another medium for her, she said, "similar to jewelry, 
ceramics or acrylic painting." 
</P>
<P>
 But she had grown up watching the politics of the late '60s on TV: the riots 
in the streets during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the 
Vietnam War. And she already was questioning women's traditional roles: "I 
couldn't become an altar boy; I had to wear dresses to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Her training at the San Francisco Art Institute in the late '70s and early 
'80s coincided with the punk rock movement. She and her friends opened for 
bands and performed in nightclubs "instead of sending in slides and waiting to 
be accepted in the traditional nonprofit galleries." 
</P>
<P>
 Living in New York in the mid-'80s, Finley began using her body as a medium in 
work that, she said, deliberately stressed the emotional qualities 
traditionally decried in women. Male artists like Vito Acconci and Chris Burden 
already were mortifying their flesh in the name of art. But Finley said she was 
unprepared for the uproar that occurred when she worked in the nude. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a man takes off his shirt, he's going to work," she said. "When a woman 
takes off her shirt, she becomes easy prey." 
</P>
<P>
 The piece illustrated by the slide of Finley's buttocks deals, in a series of 
monologues involving various types of food, with sexual abuse and misogynist 
attitudes experienced throughout a woman's life. In the scene shown, with the 
yams ("I smeared them on my backside"), a grandmother is abused on Thanksgiving 
by her drug addict grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was kind of horrific," Finley recalled. Her tone changed to 
annoyance as she described the way she felt the press already had begun to 
misconstrue her work. "A man considered liberal -- he wrote liner notes for 
(Bob) Dylan -- (wrote in the Village Voice) that I took uncooked yam and was 
sticking it up my butt. That's an example of my work being taken out of 
context." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her performance work, Finley's output includes painting, 
poetry, recordings (including "A Certain Level of Denial," on Rykodisc), a 
black comedy ("The Theory of Total Blame") and public sculpture (a bronze 
casting of "The Black Sheep," her poem about the outcasts of society, installed 
in an area of downtown New York with a large homeless population). 
</P>
<P>
 Her installations include "Memento Mori," a piece -- seen at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 1992 -- involving tableaux of "dying" 
patients and various rituals for viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very frustrated when my friends were dying," she said. "I didn't feel 
there was a proper grieving ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the NEA's "anti-obscenity" provision of 1990, Finley and three 
other artists were denied grants and sued the agency, arguing that the 
stricture -- which questioned the "serious literary, artistic, political, or 
scientific value" of depictions of sex acts and other activities -- was too 
vague and broad. The lawsuit was settled in the artists' favor last year; the 
government is appealing the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clinton Administration is continuing the appeal of the Bush 
Administration," Finley said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Keep Our Victims Ready," the piece that provoked the fracas, was inspired 
by a news report of a 16-year-old girl found in a trash bin, covered with 
feces. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are marginalized -- as women, gays, lesbians, immigrants and so forth 
-- we are victims no matter what," Finley said. "(In the piece) I give stories 
of people where this (oppression) happens to them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the notorious portion of "We Keep Our Victims Ready," Finley covers her 
body with chocolate to represent the callous treatment of women. She adds 
various other items, including tinsel "because no matter how bad you're 
treated, a woman always knows how to get dressed for dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent laughter at Finley's satirical comments on the treatment of women 
were proof that her universe does have its lighter side. In a similar vein of 
dark humor, her "self-help" book ("Enough Is Enough: Weekly Meditations for 
Living Dysfunctionally," Poseidon Press) contains illustrated mottoes for 
anyone fed up with feel-good platitudes ("Why let go when you can control?"). 
</P>
<P>
 The artist's unique blend of rage, compassion and down-home detail surfaced 
once again at the end of her talk when she stepped in front of the screen where 
slides had been projected, closed her eyes and laced her fingers at her waist. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning her voice into a deep, incantatory vessel, she became an anguished 
survivor, waking up in the middle of the night to read through old phone books 
containing numbers of friends who died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pick up the phone. I ask for your name. . . . Sometimes I pretend I'm 
talking to my dead friends in heaven. The phone just rings and rings. . . . Ah 
ain't got nothing to hold onto, but crying helps when you can't watch any more 
TV and the streets are silent except for the paper trucks with tomorrow's news. 
. . . "

GLASER'S ON-AIR STATEMENT THAT HE'S GAY IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 November was supposed to have been the month that Garrett Glaser, KNBC-TV 
Channel 4's media/entertainment reporter, announced to viewers that he was gay 
in the course of presenting a gay-themed story. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen. And acting news director Kenny Boles says there are "no 
specific plans" for Glaser to "come out" on a newscast, although Boles 
considers it "an important thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly something we're going to look at in the February and May 
sweeps," Boles said in an interview this week. But because of the interim 
nature of his position, he noted, he could not commit the station to any course 
of action. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last August, then-news director Mark Hoffman had said that 
Glaser would be allowed to acknowledge his homosexuality during the November 
ratings sweeps as part of a story relevant to the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, however, Hoffman was fired, and Boles came on as acting news 
director. Shortly thereafter, Boles said he realized that rival stations had 
learned of KNBC's planned mini-documentaries for the November sweeps, forcing 
Channel 4 to scramble to revamp its proposed story lineup. Glaser's report was 
pushed to the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 Boles did give him permission, however, to acknowledge his homosexuality 
during an October appearance on Marilu Henner's syndicated talk show, which is 
broadcast locally on KNBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Boles stressed that having Glaser come out on the air "is an important thing 
to do. . . . It shows that we acknowledge and accept the fact that people, 
including our own reporters, have the right to make their own choices about 
living and loving." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Glaser said he is unconcerned with the postponement. "I'm 
grateful to be working in an environment in which I'm supported. A lot of other 
reporters don't," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Glaser said that although he knows of several other local TV reporters who are 
gay, none has chosen to be as forthcoming about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people," he said, "come up to me and ask, 'Why is it so important 
for you to say that you're gay on the air? Heterosexuals don't say they're 
heterosexual.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's a presumption of heterosexuality in our society. By declaring 
myself, I'm taking a position saying, 'This is who I am, and I'm not ashamed of 
it.' "

ESTATE PROJECT FOR ARTISTS TO OPEN IN L.A. 
</P>

<P>
 A New York organization designed to help artists with AIDS in estate planning 
will be in full operation in Los Angeles in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Coast branch of the Estate Project for Artists With AIDS, established 
in New York in 1991, will work with artists to preserve their work, including 
copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the most famous and successful artists don't know what they need to know 
about legal affairs," Estate Project Director Patrick Moore said. "Writing a 
will can seem like an admission of fatality, so a lot of times it ends up being 
done in an emergency situation, when the artist is very sick. Or not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Estate Project will ensure that artists are provided with easily 
understood guidelines for creating an effective estate via publications and 
individual counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the program, artists will receive assistance with legal counseling, 
cataloguing and inventory of art, archives/documentation, emergency grants and 
fellowships to individual artists, grants for studio space and art materials. 
Expanded exhibition and presenting opportunities will also be available. 
</P>
<P>
 This effort is the work of the Alliance for the Arts, a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to policy research, information services and advocacy for the arts. 
</P>
<P>

WHERE GRANT LEE BUFFALO ROAMS; POP MUSIC: THOUGH STILL AT CULT-LEVEL, THE 
BAND'S DISCOVERED ITS NICHE: 'MOCKINGBIRDS' IS GETTING AIRPLAY AND THE GROUP 
WILL OPEN FOR R.E.M. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Grant Lee Phillips headed south from Stockton a decade ago to study film 
at CalArts, his goal was to make a movie that was somewhere in between "The 
Wizard of Oz" and "In Cold Blood." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both road pictures," notes Phillips, who still harbors cinematic 
ambitions but for now channels his vision into the music of the trio he fronts 
as singer, guitarist and songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, drummer Joey Peters and bassist Paul Kimble, are still at cult-band 
level, but in just a few months their new album, "Mighty Joe Moon," has already 
outsold their 1993 debut, "Fuzzy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mockingbirds" -- an apocalyptic scenario delivered in the form of a tender, 
Lennon-like ballad -- is being played extensively on a variety of radio 
formats, as well as on MTV and VH1, and the group is set to embark soon for 
Australia as the opening act on R.E.M.'s overseas tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty stunned, actually," Phillips, 31, says of the band's advances. "I 
didn't know that radio and television could do all that. Now we are at that 
point where we can play in new towns and see an audience, and that's kind of 
thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he's become a student of record marketing and radio programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not real preoccupied with that kind of stuff. It kind of makes my stomach 
turn a little bit. We just do what we do and those folks who like it will play 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But yeah, I've thought about that. Some of the stations that play 
'Mockingbirds,' I wonder if they will play a song like 'Lone Star,' which is a 
big black cloud, a big mess comin' down the road. . . . We can't be harnessed 
that easily." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. On "Mighty Joe Moon," the group blends roots-rock, folk-rock and 
classic-pop currents into a dreamlike canvas whose scale ranges from the 
intimate to the panoramic, the personal to the historical. Ambiguous and 
haunting, it sometimes evokes the nostalgic, sepia-tinted perspective of the 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I've heard that comparison before," Phillips says. "In some cases I 
feel like Robbie Robertson was probably trying to be truer to history. . . . 
Our songs are more like a tornado sort of came and rolled through history and 
picked it up and scattered it around in different places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of these songs are kind of searching . . . digging for some 
kind of meaning. I don't know that we necessarily find it, but a lot of them 
draw questions: 'What do you believe in and what can we believe in?' " 
</P>
<P>
 That concern might stem in part from the influence of the several Pentecostal 
preachers in the Phillips family tree. His forebears moved to California from 
Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas during the Great Depression, and his introduction 
to music came on visits to church with his grandparents. "It was Pentecostal," 
he says, "but musically if you walked in you'd think it was the Church of Jerry 
Lee Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
 During high school in Stockton, Phillips played in a band and, after 
relocating to L.A., he was seduced away from his film-school plans by the 
Hollywood rock scene. Working as a house roofer by day, he played in the group 
Shiva Burlesque for seven years before forming Grant Lee Buffalo with Kimble 
and Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's taken a while, but he finally feels at home in his adopted basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more time that I spend away from Los Angeles, the more I realize how Los 
Angeles our music all really is. . . . You know, there's moments where it's 
very serene and it's very still, and then there's other times when it's more 
jagged and unpredictable, and that sounds like Los Angeles to me. I think we're 
a fine reflection of that."

IN BLACK HOMES, SOME TV HITS AREN'T SO BIG; RATINGS: ONCE-SMALL DIFFERENCES IN 
VIEWING TASTES HAVE WIDENED IN PRIME-TIME VIEWING HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Every Tuesday night, millions of households tune to ABC's "Home Improvement." 
In a typical week, the situation comedy about the host of a fix-it show is the 
most-watched program on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet one group of viewers is decidedly sparse among the masses of "Home 
Improvement" fans. In African American households, the program barely makes the 
top 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big network hits are even less popular: "Seinfeld" and "Frasier" don't 
even crack the top 90 with blacks despite consistently finishing in the top 10 
for viewers as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 The top show for black audiences this season: "Living Single," a Fox sitcom 
that ranks 69th among all audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives, as well as advertisers and their agencies, have known for 
years that blacks and whites have different viewing tastes. But, as the 
relative popularity of "Home Improvement" and "Living Single" illustrate, these 
once-small differences have begun to widen into a vast chasm during prime-time 
viewing hours. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1985-86 season, for example, 15 of the 20 shows most popular among 
blacks were also top 20 shows among all viewers. By last season, only three 
programs among the top 20 had "crossover" appeal among both black and non-black 
households: ABC's "Monday Night Football," NBC's Monday night movies and the 
comedy "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," also on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the racial trends among prime-time audiences are a natural result of 
a positive trend: the increasing number of network programs created by, for or 
about blacks. According to BBDO Worldwide Inc., a New York ad agency, there 
were 25 programs on the four networks with black performers in starring or 
major roles last year, up from 16 just two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV was pretty much a white medium for so many years; it was hard to find many 
black faces," said Doug Alligood, the BBDO vice president who conducted the 
agency's study. "This is a celebration of diversity, and it's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 To others, however, the fragmenting of the audience by race is evidence of 
increasing cultural separateness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is the general trend of race relations in this country," said 
Robert Johnson, chief executive of the Black Entertainment Television Network, 
which has become a national cable network by targeting black audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are a little bit more separate in their racial interaction than they 
were in the 1970s and '80s. People are identifying more with their own culture 
and ethnicity and feeling comfortable about doing so, without the pressure to 
integrate or amalgamate cultures," Johnson said. He added that "that's not 
necessarily a bad thing."

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: HUMBLE PIE: JAPANESE FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I n the wake of the disastrous results of Japanese companies in Hollywood, a 
fictitious memo about the future of media that should have circulated within 
Japan's influential Ministry of International Trade and Industry : 
</P>
<P>
 TO: MITI Task Force on New Media Futures 
</P>
<P>
 FROM: Subcommittee on Strategic Visions 
</P>
<P>
 RE: Hollywood Lessons 
</P>
<P>
 Morita- san now leaves his Sony stained with the legacy of multibillion-dollar 
losses in Hollywood. That is a tragedy. Matsushita and its MCA publicly battle 
in America's newspapers. That is embarrassing. The Americans are increasingly 
boastful and arrogant. That is annoying. 
</P>
<P>
 The past five years in Hollywood have made our electronics companies look like 
insular media bumpkins. Promises of synergy have yet to materialize, and it 
does not appear as if our substantial investments in American content have 
dramatically improved Japan's abilities to create profitable new markets. Our 
hardware companies seem structurally and culturally incapable of managing 
American software creativity or successfully integrating it into their 
technology strategy. They have lost face and credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, now is the time for MITI to offer administrative guidance to our 
media technology industries. The Hollywood lessons are bitter and expensive, 
but they give us the opportunity to propose more productive approaches for 
Japan's global media strategy. These suggestions should form the basis of a new 
strategic dialogue about Japanese media. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Discourage majority acquisitions of foreign media enterprises in favor of 
encouraging structured minority investments. 
</P>
<P>
 It is foolish to insist on owning software companies whose skill and expertise 
we do not know how to enhance. That's not strategy; that's self-indulgence. 
Recall Sumitomo Bank's $500-million investment for a 12.5% limited partnership 
in Goldman Sachs in the 1980s compared to General Electric's outright 
acquisition of Kidder Peabody. What has proven more valuable -- 12.5% of 
Goldman Sachs or all of Kidder? Ownership of software does not inherently 
confer added value any more than buying a factory inherently makes it more 
productive. Japanese companies must have the willingness and humility to learn; 
100% owners too often lose the desire to be humble and listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita and Sony should restructure their ownership of American software 
properties. But they must be encouraged to sell to companies that promise to be 
partners and not parasites. Our primary strategic intent should be to influence 
creativity, not simply own it. We would be wiser to encourage 50 $10-million 
investments in smaller American multimedia companies that we can learn from and 
influence than outright ownership of a $1-billion company that views us as 
little more than a wallet that also manufactures silicon chips. MITI must play 
a more active role in the diffusion and sharing of multimedia knowledge and 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Acquire Media Properties, not Media Companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Must we own Time Warner to own Superman? Must we own Toho Studios to own 
Godzilla? Must we own Sega to own Sonic the Hedgehog? Of course not. Owning the 
rights to intellectual property can be far more valuable than owning the means 
of their production. We need to pursue a strategy of licensing creative 
intellectual property much more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 Back when Sony was called Tokyo Telecommunications, Morita- san did not 
acquire technology companies -- he acquired licenses for technology. He 
procured licenses from Bell Telephone for the transistor and used them as seeds 
to grow Sony's technology. We should encourage Japanese companies to acquire 
intellectual property licenses to grow multimedia innovations. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, we could acquire the rights to create a Madonna CD-ROM for the 
Asian marketplace and bring it to an American CD-ROM developer we partly own. 
In essence, owning creative licenses offers a less expensive, less risky way to 
build relationships between hardware platforms and software products. Licensing 
offers a mechanism for both learning and profit. MITI can play a role in giving 
preferential treatment to foreign companies that are reasonable about licensing 
intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Insist that American middlemen become partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most American media companies, investment bankers and Hollywood 
agents have viewed deals with Japanese companies as a way of extracting maximum 
amounts of yen rather than creating productive long-term partnerships. We must 
not make those mistakes again. We should now politely -- but firmly -- insist 
that investment banks and Hollywood agents who bring us investment 
opportunities become co-investors in the deals they propose. To quote a popular 
Americanism, they must "put up or shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 4. Focus on Asia more than the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Demography is destiny. We've been too concerned with American media. Asia is 
growing far faster than either Europe or the Americas. To be sure, Japan must 
have a strong presence in the West, but exciting growth and cultural media 
compatibility will come from the East. Already, karaoke is a multibillion-yen 
business in Asia. This has been a successful cultural technology export for 
Japan. Japanese video games are also doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is strongly positioned to be a medium between American software and 
Asian markets. Our media sensibilities should be more Asian than global. Sell 
off portions of MCA and Columbia but retain all Asian rights? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Nintendo-Sega vs. Microsoft-Intel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo and Sega succeed not because they mimic the West but because their 
Japanese games have global appeal. In many respects, their game consoles have 
become global standards. Perhaps we should explore ways to encourage Sega and 
Nintendo to license their architectures to Sony, Matsushita, NEC, Fujitsu, NTT 
and other electronics companies -- much as Microsoft and Intel have created a 
common architecture for business computers. Many American software companies 
would be delighted to support such a platform. Again, the opportunity emerges 
to forge equity partnerships that make economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
 These are just preliminary discussion points -- but it is clear that Japan's 
new-media industries need to dramatically expand their strategic visions of the 
future. This is where tomorrow's policy debates should start.

ECONOMY EVEN ROSIER AT 2ND GLANCE; INDICATORS: REVISION IN THIRD-QUARTER 
FIGURES SHOWS THAT GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT INCREASED AT A 3.9% RATE, NOT 3.4%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strong business investment and hearty consumer spending drove the economy to a 
brisker pace of expansion during the third quarter than was previously thought, 
the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, increased at a 
3.9% annual rate from July through September, up from the department's estimate 
last month of 3.4% and nearly matching the second quarter's 4.1% growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The upward revision of 0.5 percentage point was greater than economists had 
predicted, and with Christmas sales expected to be strong, the economy is on 
target for its best yearly performance since it expanded 3.9% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows that the nation's economy is not only shrugging off the 
impact of this year's interest rate increases, but is also firmly underpinned 
for more expansion ahead. The Federal Reserve Board has raised interest rates 
six times this year in a bid to keep the economy from overheating and to ward 
off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, this data does not indicate that higher rates have had any 
meaningful impact in slowing the economy down," said economist Sung Won Sohn of 
Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. "The economy is humming along at a nice pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the central bank will probably forgo any additional moves in 
December and wait until policy-makers meet at the end of January before raising 
rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd like to give the economy a little while to react to the higher rates," 
said Kermit Baker of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. "I think they'll sit on 
their hands until the beginning of the new year." 
</P>
<P>
 An inflation gauge tied to GDP rose a mere 1.9% at an annual rate. While that 
was up from the 1.6% estimate a month ago, it is still below the 2.9% increase 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank wants to hold down inflation by slowing economic growth to 
about 2.5%. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the second quarter and a 3.3% 
rate in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said, "This is evidence that we 
continue to experience continued economic growth with low inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street took the report in stride, as the Dow Jones industrial average 
rallied for most of the day before closing up a fraction of a point. Bond 
prices were also up, pushing the yield on the key 30-year Treasury bond down to 
8% from 8.03% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of production going into inventories was less than originally 
thought -- leaving more room to keep assembly lines churning out goods -- and 
inflation seemed muted, with revised price rises still below those in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, most of the upward revision in GDP from the month-old estimate was due 
to a surge in business purchases of equipment that usually signal higher 
productivity. Capital spending soared at a 14.4% rate in the third quarter, 
more than double the original estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said the annual rate of growth for GDP was $50.9 billion in the 
third quarter, with consumer spending accounting for $28.6 billion, compared to 
$11.5 billion in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department also reported that after-tax profits of U.S. 
corporations rose 2.8% in the third quarter, compared to 7.3% the previous 
three months. The second-quarter figures were inflated by a recovery in 
California from the effects of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, the Fed said new calculations show the nation's industries 
are not operating quite as close to capacity as previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 The operating rate for factories, mines and utilities in October was 84.6% of 
capacity, the highest since April, 1989, when the rate was 84.8%, the Fed said. 
Previously, the agency had put the October rate at 84.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say an operating rate of about 85% can signal the start of 
bottlenecks and rising prices. The Fed also said that industrial production 
rose 0.6% in October, revised from a previous 0.7% estimate. Gross Domestic 
Product

PENTIUM CHIP REPLACEMENT OFFERED BY IBM; COMPUTERS: THE ACTION IS SEEN AS A 
BRILLIANT PUBLIC RELATIONS MOVE. INTEL DEFENDS ITS RESPONSE TO DISCOVERY OF 
FLAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seizing a public relations opportunity at Intel Corp.'s expense, IBM Corp. on 
Wednesday offered to replace flawed Pentium microprocessors for customers who 
fear their computations might be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's offer -- likely to prompt similar moves by other computer makers -- 
follows several days of concern among advanced-computer users since the 
widespread disclosure last week of a bug in Intel's popular Pentium computer 
chip. In rare instances, the glitch can produce errors in complex division 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 With speculation swirling that Intel might launch a recall of Pentium chips, 
shares of the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company, the world's leading 
manufacturer of chips, tumbled $2.375 on Wednesday to $63.125 in a late selloff 
on Nasdaq. The stock was the most active in U.S. composite trading, with 11.2 
million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Intel spokesman Howard High denied that the company has plans for a 
recall, and he said its campaign to work with individual customers "seems to be 
going reasonably well." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still handling it on a case-by-case basis," High said. Calls from 
concerned owners of Pentium machines, which have poured in by the thousands, 
peaked Tuesday, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 High said most customers are satisfied when Intel engineers explain that they 
are not likely to be affected. To date, the problem has manifested itself only 
in complex mathematical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 However, High said, in cases where customers do highly technical work or have 
an "emotional concern" that they might be plagued by the bug, Intel is working 
to arrange for replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, Intel Chief Executive Andrew Grove issued a statement on the 
Internet, apologizing for any anxiety and defending Intel's response. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, many computer users contend that Intel has handled the problem badly. 
A high level of dismay greeted Intel's revelation last week that it had known 
about the bug since June but had chosen not to announce it because it viewed as 
minute the chance that most users would encounter it. Intel began shipping 
corrected chips a couple of months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts viewed IBM's decision to deal directly with its customers as a 
brilliant public relations stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Banks, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose high-tech research 
firm, said it allows the computer maker to grab back some control of the market 
that Intel has snared with its high-profile "Intel Inside" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "IBM is saying, 'It's my box, I'm the person making it and selling it, I'll 
take care of you,' " Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gesture is also fairly low-risk for IBM. Of the millions of IBM computer 
systems installed or in the pipeline, a small fraction are based on the 
Pentium. Moreover, Intel will furnish new, debugged Pentiums to IBM free of 
charge. Still being negotiated is which company will pay for the service call 
required to replace the part. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its effort, IBM said it will establish special telephone lines to 
help customers determine whether they have a problem.

FOX CRIES FOUL OVER NBC BID TO HAVE IT PENALIZED; TELEVISION: NETWORK SAYS MOVE 
IS MERELY AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID COMPETITION. NBC SAYS ITS RIVAL ENJOYS UNFAIR 
ADVANTAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fox television network vowed Wednesday to fight what it called a shameless 
bid by rival NBC to get federal officials to penalize Fox on the grounds that 
its ownership structure is illegal.  
</P>
<P>
 In a 21-page petition filed Wednesday, NBC asked the Federal Communications 
Commission to declare the Fox TV network foreign-owned and thus in violation of 
a federal statute that generally limits foreigners to no more than a 25% 
interest in U.S. broadcast stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is simply a naked and shameless effort by NBC to hinder and delay the 
competition they don't want from Fox," said Preston Padden, Fox's president of 
network distribution. "We believe that our ownership structure is in complete 
compliance with the Communications Act." 
</P>
<P>
 The NBC petition is the second major challenge to Fox's ownership structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the NAACP also petitioned the FCC to impose sanctions on 
Fox, claiming the network misstated its true corporate structure and that its 
acquisition of U.S. TV stations denied broadcast ownership opportunities to 
African Americans and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The NAACP petition raised much the same question presented by NBC: Who owns 
the six big-city TV stations purchased in 1985 to form the core of the 
fledgling Fox network -- Rupert Murdoch, a naturalized U.S. citizen, or News 
Corp., the Australian company Murdoch runs? 
</P>
<P>
 NBC contends that Fox enjoys an unfair advantage because its initially smaller 
size won it exemptions from many FCC rules that apply to the other three major 
television networks. Its petition urges the agency to either force Murdoch to 
reduce Fox's foreign ownership or relax existing ownership limits for all TV 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying that Fox has enormous competitive advantages based on the 
existing regulatory scheme," said Richard Cotton, NBC's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 However the petition is decided, Fox's Padden said the "real danger is that 
NBC will succeed in causing delay in processing Fox (TV license) applications 
and create further uncertainty. . . . We can't stand a situation where sellers 
are afraid to conclude deals with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The NBC challenge comes as Time Warner and Paramount have announced plans to 
start their own TV networks and as Congress, the FCC and the Clinton 
Administration have been encouraging more telecommunications competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign-ownership law stands as one of the few remaining restrictions on 
communications ownership in an increasingly global communications age. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts say the provision was imposed more than half a century ago out 
of concern that foreigners might use American communications properties to 
spread propaganda in the United States. But today that attitude has changed 
among some key officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our overriding principles has been that having a fourth (TV) network 
is in the public interest," FCC Commissioner James H. Quello said. "We are 
trying to promote a multichannel, multifaceted world. In order to punish Fox, I 
think you bear a heavy burden of proof." 
</P>
<P>
 Any FCC action could have a huge impact on network television in general and 
on Fox particularly. Fox paid a breathtaking $1.6 billion earlier this year for 
four-year broadcast rights to National Football League games and has since been 
waging a furious battle to sign up new affiliate TV stations to make the deal 
pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 The aggressive campaign by Fox, which was launched in 1986 and developed such 
hit shows as "The Simpsons," "Melrose Place" "The X-Files" and "Beverly Hills 
90210," has forced NBC, ABC and CBS to renegotiate higher payments to their 
affiliates in order to keep them from defecting to Fox, industry officials say.

 Key Mortgage Rate Keeps Climbing: The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco 
said the 11th District cost of funds, the rate to which many adjustable-rate 
home mortgages are tied, rose to 4.187% in October from 4.039% in September. It 
was the seventh straight monthly increase in the rate, reflecting the general 
rise in interest rates during 1994. The rate measures the average cost of funds 
to the thrifts and financial institutions in the bank's 11th District, which 
covers California, Arizona and Nevada.

 CBS, NBC Unfazed by ABC-Dream Team Venture: Executives at the two networks 
broke their silence on the 2-day-old joint venture between ABC and Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen to create prime-time and 
syndicated television shows. Both networks said they do not feel threatened by 
the alliance."It's a lot of nice fairy dust for Wall Street," said NBC West 
Coast President Don Ohlmeyer. "I think all it is an extension of ABC 
Productions, with the three of them as program executives." CBS Entertainment 
President Peter Tortorici said: "Anything that has the potential of equitably 
distributing risk and reward is good and wise. Whether this is a good instance 
of this happening, I don't know. I don't know enough about the deal."

 Chrysler Voices Commitment to Build Cash Reserves: Chairman and Chief 
Executive Robert Eaton, facing a call from investor Kirk Kerkorian to reward 
stockholders, said it is "appropriate" for the No. 3 auto maker to share some 
of its growing cash reserves with shareholders. But he said the company's board 
will not change plans to stockpile $7.5 billion in cash to help it weather the 
next recession.Eaton declined to comment on what actions the board may take at 
today's regular meeting, where directors are to discuss Kerkorian's requests to 
raise the company's common-stock dividend, initiate a share buyback program, 
announce a stock split and eliminate the company's "poison pill" takeover 
defense. Chrysler's stock was $1 higher at $48.50 in late trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange.

agreement with Ford Motor Co. to sell a small car based on the Ford 
Fiesta.Mazda Motor Corp., which is 25%-owned by Ford, will buy about 25,000 of 
the cars annually and sell them through its European dealerships starting in 
the spring of 1996. After dropping a plan to set up its own production facility 
in Europe, Mazda said in October that it was in the final stages of 
negotiations to buy Ford-made cars in Europe. The vehicle will have Ford

 Genentech Should Drop Suits, Judge Says: The South San Francisco-based 
biotechnology firm, which is suing two companies for patent infringement, said 
it will appeal to the U.S. International Trade Commission. An administrative 
law judge who advises the commission saw evidence that Novo-Nordisk and 
Bio-Technology General Corp. improperly used Genentech's process for a 
recombinant human growth hormone but said Genentech should drop its suits 
because it did not promptly turn over documents.

 High Court Hears Arguments in Challenge to Securities Suits: The U.S. Supreme 
Court heard arguments in a high-stakes challenge to the validity of several 
hundred thousand securities fraud cases, with almost $4.6 billion in claims 
hanging on the outcome. The case, centering on the statute of limitations for 
fraud lawsuits, is a replay of an almost identical dispute that split the high 
court 4 to 4 during its last term.The controversy centers on a 1991 law that 
retroactively extended the statute of limitations on thousands of securities 
fraud cases that had already been dismissed by federal courts. The issue before 
the justices is whether Congress, by in effect ordering the courts to 
reconsider earlier decisions to dismiss the cases, violated the constitutional 
separation of powers.

 Ex-Kidder Trader Censured: The New York Stock Exchange said it took the action 
against government bond trader Joseph Jett and barred him from exchange 
membership.The NYSE said a hearing panel voted unanimously to bar Jett until he 
complies with a request to testify in connection with an investigation of 
Kidder Peabody activities. A Kidder internal investigation found in August that 
Jett knowingly manipulated Kidder systems to generate $350 million in false 
profits for its government bond trading desk. The NYSE said Jett was charged in 
April with failing to testify in connection with the exchange probe.

 FTC Challenges Tobacco Acquisition: The Federal Trade Commission followed 
through on its promise to challenge the proposed $1-billion purchase of 
American Brands Co.'s American Tobacco Co. by BAT Industries of London. The 
commission voted 3 to 0 to file an administrative complaint that alleges the 
buyout would reduce competition in the U.S. cigarette industry in violation of 
federal antitrust laws. That triggers a hearing before an administrative law 
judge on the antitrust implications of the merger.

 Hasbro Wins British Game Maker: The Pawtucket, R.I.-based company said it 
bought the games division of John Waddington, the British maker of the Monopoly 
board game, for $78 million cash. The deal comes four months after Hasbro Inc. 
lost out to El Segundo-based Mattel Inc. in a battle to take over JW Spear & 
Sons, the British company that held the rights to the game Scrabble outside the 
United States. Hasbro, which already owns the licensing rights to Monopoly, 
will also acquire the Cluedo and Subbuteo brand names as part of the deal.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS MIXED AS SHORT-TERM YIELDS ROCKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock market meandered to a mixed close Wednesday as short-term interest 
rates surged on new economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yields, meanwhile, eased slightly for the first time 
in three days, despite the rise in short rates. Municipal bonds rallied 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrials added just 0.68 point to 3,739.23 after 
rising more than 20 points early on. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said stock investors appeared confused by the bond market's split 
decision on the latest economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields initially rose across the board after the Commerce Department said the 
nation's gross domestic product rose at a 3.9% annual rate in the third 
quarter, 0.5 point higher than an earlier estimate. Inflation measures in the 
report were also revised upward. 
</P>
<P>
 But long-term bond yields fell back later, after the government revised its 
report on October factory capacity utilization to 84.6% from 84.9% originally. 
That suggested that the economy's strength may have ebbed somewhat as the 
fourth quarter began.  
</P>
<P>
 In response, the 30-year Treasury bond yield eased to 8.0% on Wednesday from 
Tuesday's 8.03%. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bonds also rallied. Analysts said insurance companies and other 
institutional buyers have been attracted by what they regard as abnormally high 
tax-free yields on long-term muni securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news Wednesday was in the market for shorter-term securities. 
Short-term Treasury yields reached new 3 1/2-year highs as investors in those 
securities appeared to bet that the Federal Reserve Board isn't yet finished 
raising short rates to restrain the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was bolstered by higher November inflation statistics in a 
Chicago-area survey of corporate purchasing managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The report "raises the odds the Fed is going to have to raise rates sooner 
rather than later," said Marco Frustaci, trader at Daiwa Securities America. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on three-month T-bills, 5.45% as recently as Nov. 21, soared to 
5.72% on Wednesday from 5.68% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One-year T-bill yields jumped to 6.89% from 6.80% on Tuesday, nearing the 7% 
mark. A year ago, the one-year yield was just 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stock traders said the equity market held up surprisingly well given the 
surge in short-term yields. Though broad market indexes were mixed, advancing 
issues led declines by 12 to 10 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 17 to 12 
on Nasdaq. Trading was active. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts say many investors are waiting for today's Senate vote on the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and on Friday's report on November 
employment, before making additional moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are just sitting back and waiting to see what Thursday and 
Friday are going to bring," said Alice Sadlo, first vice president at McDonald 
& Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrial issues rallied, which a few analysts attributed to optimism 
over GATT and future global sales prospects for large U.S. multinational firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners included Dow Chemical, up 1 to 64; Goodrich, up 3/4 to 44 1/2; 
Monsanto, up 1 1/8 to 72; Cummins Engine, up 1 1/8 to 43 1/2, and 
Georgia-Pacific, up 1 5/8 to 71 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the industrial area, Chrysler rose 1 to 48 1/2 amid expectations that 
its board will raise the dividend on its common stock at a meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks, the market's recent leaders, were mixed. Lotus Development 
leaped 3 to 44 3/4 on renewed market rumors that Oracle Systems may make a bid. 
Oracle fell 1 3/8 to 41 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Intel tumbled 2 3/8 to 63 1/8 on rising worries about glitches in its 
Pentium computer chip. Other falling tech issues included Compaq, down 1 1/4 to 
39 1/8; Apple, off 1 to 37 1/4, and Dell Computer, down 1 13/16 to 43 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Applied Materials dove 4 5/8 to 47 7/8 after its latest quarterly 
earnings failed to top expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Another loser was semiconductor maker Level One Communications. It plunged 4 
1/2 to 12 1/4 after analysts warned that the firm's bookings appear to be 
running behind expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the deals arena, Apache soared 2 7/8 to 28 after it agreed to buy more 
than 300 Texaco oil fields for $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei stock average closed at 19,075.62, up 
149.13 points. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average edged up 3.98 points to 
2,048.26 while London's FTSE 100 index gained 20.3 points to 3,081.4. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index closed 4.82 points lower at 2,591.34 after 
President-elect Ernesto Zedillo made some surprise Cabinet appointments that 
disappointed investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in U.S. commodities trading, silver futures hit their lowest level 
in nearly a year when a price slide linked to waning inflation fears steepened 
dramatically. Gold futures also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver for December delivery dropped 14.9 cents on the New York Merc to $4.90 
an ounce, the lowest since Dec. 7, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 December gold futures fell $1.30 to $380.70 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Weakness in a host of other commodities, including soybeans, heating oil, 
orange juice and coffee, drove down the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 
commodities 1.24 points to 229.34.

 Former Thrift Manager Wins Appeal: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw 
out an Office of Thrift Supervision order barring a former savings and loan 
president from the financial industry for life. The court said the conduct of 
Young Il Kim in managing Delta Savings Bank in Westminster in no way warranted 
severe sanctions under federal law. The OTS imposed the ban after an

LOTUS SHARES RISE 7.2% ON MERGER SPECULATION; TECHNOLOGY: LOTUS AND ORACLE CALL 
THE REPORTS 'RUMORS' AND PLAY DOWN CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Shares of Lotus Development Corp. rose 7.2% in heavy trading Wednesday on 
speculation that the software company is discussing a merger with Oracle Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials declined to comment directly on what they called "rumors" 
and played down the circumstantial evidence that fueled the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotus shares, which are traded on the Nasdaq, rose $3 to $44.75 on volume of 6 
million shares, well above the average daily volume of 1.6 million for the past 
three months. The shares had been up as much as 9.6% earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
 Oracle, also traded on the Nasdaq, fell $1.375 to $41.25 on volume of 1.7 
million shares, less than a daily average of 1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The report of a possible merger surfaced in Computer Reseller News, a trade 
journal, which noted that senior executives of both companies had been meeting 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The article quoted Jeff Matthews, an analyst with RAM Partners, as saying such 
a merger would give Oracle "the desktop operating system of the future," a 
reference to Lotus' Notes software. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation grew after Montgomery Securities announced that Lotus had 
withdrawn from the security firm's high technology stock conference next week. 
Companies sometimes withdraw from such conferences when they anticipate major 
announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotus officials, however, threw cold water on both reports. Kay Waxman, 
director of investor relations for Lotus, said the Cambridge, Mass., software 
company already has an agreement with Oracle to develop its Notes product to 
work with Oracle's database software. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how you can go about positioning these kinds of alliances 
without these kinds of meetings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman also said Lotus never agreed to participate in the Montgomery 
conference. She said Montgomery incorrectly put Lotus on a list of conference 
participants and that when the company pointed out the error, Montgomery 
wrongly said Lotus had withdrawn. Lotus had attended a Montgomery-sponsored 
conference in September and did not want to participate in two in the same 
year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oracle's investor relations director, Catherin Buan, noted that the Redwood 
City, Calif. company will attend the Montgomery conference next week. "We're 
getting the slides ready now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she declined to comment on the merger speculation directly, she did 
say that Oracle generally has a history of developing technology internally 
rather than through acquiring companies. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Oracle announced Nov. 17 that it would seek to double its authorized 
shares to 800 million, in part to pay for acquisitions.

FLUOR CORP.'S PROFIT UP 15% FOR FISCAL YEAR; EARNINGS: THE IRVINE BUILDER SEES 
REWARDS OF RECENT GLOBAL EMPHASIS AND INTERNAL COST CUTTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fluor Corp., demonstrating the benefits of aggressive expansion overseas and 
corporate restructuring at home, said Wednesday that it earned a record $192 
million on sales of $8.49 billion in its fiscal year ended Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings were 15% higher than last year's $167 million, and sales totaled 
8% more than the $7.85 billion generated in fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Les McCraw, chief executive of the Irvine-based engineering, construction and 
mining company, attributed the strong showing to Fluor's emphasis on doing 
business in the Pacific Rim and Latin America. It was a watershed year, he 
said, during which international pursuits for the first time outweighed 
domestic business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been on a strong globalization strategy and it is now paying off," 
McCraw said. "We are very optimistic about the opportunities we see . . . 
especially in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. . . . It's an 
incredibly large market." 
</P>
<P>
 A drive to "re-engineer" Fluor by developing cost-cutting procedures and 
improving flexibility by moving decision-making processes further down the 
management ranks also paid off. As much as 15% of the profit gain for the year 
can be traced to that internal effort, McCraw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expressed optimism about Fluor's prospects for the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Fluor works on projects with such long lead times, it can sustain 
earnings improvement like this for the foreseeable future," said Kemp Fuller, 
managing director of Commonwealth Associates, a New York investment bank and 
brokerage. He estimated Fluor's fiscal 1995 earnings at $220 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who works in global business sees greater growth opportunities in 
the international arena than nationally," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 For its fourth quarter, Fluor earned $52.4 million, up 16% from $45.2 million 
for the 1993 fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor had posted a gain of $3.1 million for the final quarter of fiscal 1993 
from a pension fund credit in its A.T. Massey Coal Co. mining unit. That 
boosted net income for the three months to $48.3 million. Revenue for the 
latest quarter climbed 9%, to $2.39 billion from $2.19 billion.

AMERICAN BRANDS WILL SELL OFF LIFE INSURANCE UNIT FOR CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American Brands Inc., acting on its plan to concentrate on its core 
businesses, said Wednesday it will sell its Franklin Life Insurance unit to 
American General Corp. for $1.17 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 American General, a Houston-based, diversified financial services holding 
company, has also been pursuing a $2.6-billion hostile takeover of another 
competitor, Unitrin Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Life, based in Springfield, Ill., focuses on the middle-income 
insurance market. It has more than $6 billion in assets, and some industry 
analysts have speculated that American General may want to use some of 
Franklin's excess capital to pay for the proposed Unitrin deal. 
</P>
<P>
 American Brands, owner of the American Tobacco Company, also makes Jim Beam 
whiskey, Master locks and other household and office products. It has agreed to 
sell its tobacco business to Britain's B.A.T. Industries for $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franklin deal, which is subject to antitrust and insurance regulatory 
approvals and other customary conditions, is expected to be closed during the 
first quarter of 1995 and will be tax-free, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Brands said that its board authorized the purchase in the open market 
and in privately negotiated transactions of up to 10 million shares of its 
common stock following the closing of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 American Brands gained 87.5 cents to $35.25 on the New York Stock Exchange and 
American General added 25 cents to $26.25. American Brands said that even 
though Franklin had been a strong income producer, the transaction will not 
affect American Brands' ability to pay dividends.

PRODUCTION FIRM FEELS SQUEEZE FROM O.J. SIMPSON TV SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what amounts to the first direct effect of the O.J. Simpson murder case on 
a corporate balance sheet, Hollywood film and TV producer Kushner-Locke Co. 
said Wednesday that it will report a $7.5-million write-down largely to devalue 
on its books a TV series starring the former football star. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and fiscal 
year as a result, said about 60% of the write-down involves devaluing the pay 
cable series "1st & 10," which originally aired on Home Box Office. 
</P>
<P>
 The series, in which Simpson played a coach, no longer airs on the cable 
network, but it had previously been sold to some stations through syndication. 
Simpson, who is charged with slaying his ex-wife, Nicole, and Ronald Goldman, 
also continues to hold a seat on Kushner-Locke's board. 
</P>
<P>
 The write-off in effect says that the series is being put on the shelf and 
that Kushner-Locke does not know its future value given the uncertainty over 
the outcome of the Simpson trial. The remaining part of the write-off involves 
the company's "Sweating Bullets" series, which formerly ran late at night on 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the non-cash charges do not reflect its current television 
and film projects. In addition to television shows, Kushner-Locke has been 
involved in producing films such as "Andre," released earlier this year by 
Paramount Pictures.

AMOUNT OF CHECK FRAUD ROSE SUBSTANTIALLY IN '93; CRIME: 'THE BANKING SYSTEM IS 
UNDER ATTACK,' AUTHORITIES SAY. DESKTOP PUBLISHING IS ONE REASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thieves, often working in gangs using relatively inexpensive equipment, passed 
twice as many bogus checks last year as in 1991, costing banks $815 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The banking system is under attack by organized crime," warned Bruce Brett, 
chairman of the American Bankers Assn.'s check fraud task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett told reporters Wednesday that the number of bogus checks jumped to 1.3 
million in 1993 from 536,000 two years earlier, when counterfeiting cost banks 
$247 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brett said the ABA figures understate the problem because they do not 
include losses by other financial institutions, such as savings and loans and 
credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
 And the $815 million in losses in 1993 probably would have doubled if failed 
attempts to pass fraudulent checks had been successful, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Dick, chief of the FBI's Financial Institution Fraud Unit, concurred, 
saying the "serious and growing problem" of check fraud has become the "crime 
of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty percent of the 8,000 complaints received by the FBI from financial 
institutions in September and October involved bogus checks, he said at the 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett said the proliferation of desktop publishing has made computer equipment 
and software used in check forgery more affordable. In addition, laser products 
are widely available for duplicating and printing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Washington organization representing major U.S. and Canadian 
check-printing companies announced voluntary guidelines designed to fight check 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The Financial Stationers Assn. said the guidelines include the use of tiny 
words and letters on the check front that, without a microscope, appear to be a 
solid line. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines also recommend printing a drawing of a padlock to the right of 
the word dollar on the front of a check to indicate it contains security 
features, and a warning box on the back listing the features. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABA survey of 309 representative banks found financial institutions in the 
Northeast and West to be among the hardest hit, although most participants 
experienced losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found the average fraudulent check totaled $643 in 1993, down from 
$1,058 in 1991. That relatively small amount, together with the volume of 
checks, made fraud more difficult to detect. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett said one of the most common forms of organized check fraud involves 
gangs that acquire a genuine payroll check and reproduce it. They then 
manufacture fake identification cards to match the payee's name and send 
cohorts to cash the bogus instruments at banks.

NORWEST CORP. REPORTEDLY WANTS DIRECTORS MORTGAGE OF RIVERSIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Norwest Corp. is negotiating to acquire Directors Mortgage Loan Corp., the 
nation's largest privately held mortgage company, according to a published 
report.  
</P>
<P>
 Citing industry sources, trade newspaper American Banker said in its Tuesday 
editions that Norwest was close to completing the deal and could pay up to $250 
million for the Riverside-based company, which put itself up for sale in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would give Norwest a large presence in California, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwest spokesman Larry Haeg declined to comment on the report. Ray Crebs, 
president of Directors Mortgage, could not be reached for comment. The company 
made $10 billion in loans last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Minneapolis-based Norwest is one of the nation's biggest mortgage lenders. The 
bank will have originated $25 billion in loans by year's end, Haeg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwest has been expanding its mortgage business through acquisitions. It 
announced plans in August to acquire the mortgage unit of Michigan National 
Corp., Haeg said.

JAPONICA PARTNERS PROPOSES TO BUY BORDEN FOR $2.4 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to derail a buyout of Borden Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Co., an 
investment firm led by Paul Kazarian said Wednesday that it wants to acquire 
the food and consumer products company for $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazarian's Japonica Partners, based in Rhode Island, said it proposes to 
acquire Borden for $2.4 billion, or $17 a share in cash and securities.That is 
$2.75 a share more than KKR has offered. 
</P>
<P>
 A KKR spokesman declined to comment on the Japonica proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 KKR said in September that it would take Borden private in a $2-billion stock 
swap for about half of KKR's RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. shares. KKR later 
amended its proposal after RJR Nabisco said it did not want to buy 20% of 
Borden, but KKR is proceeding with its exchange offer. 
</P>
<P>
 KKR affiliate Borden Acquisition Corp. began its exchange offer for all 
outstanding Borden shares last week. The KKR offer, in which each Borden share 
can be exchanged for RJR Nabisco shares worth about $14.25, expires Dec. 20.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; JARDINE PULLS FLAGSHIP AFFILIATES FROM HONG KONG STOCK 
MARKET; TRADING: FIRM'S LARGELY SYMBOLIC RETREAT, BEGUN A DECADE AGO, NEARS 
COMPLETION AS REVERSION TO CHINESE RULE LOOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAGGIE FARLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jardine Matheson, the powerful trading house that helped transform this colony 
into a jewel of the British Empire, moved closer Wednesday to completing a 
symbolic retreat begun a decade ago when Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine, which inspired James Clavell's novel "Noble House," removed two of 
its flagship affiliates -- Jardine Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic 
Holdings -- from the stock market here. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies will be traded on the Singapore stock market next year. Jardine 
also plans to list in Singapore three other affiliate companies currently 
traded in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine began pulling out in 1984, in part, it said, to protect itself from a 
hostile Beijing government. The moves are largely symbolic, however, because 
Jardine's headquarters will remain in Hong Kong and it has substantial 
operations in both Hong Kong and China. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 60 joint ventures on the mainland and almost 80,000 employees there. 
About 60% of our profits come from Hong Kong and China," said Neil McNamara, a 
Jardine spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine's first move in 1984 was to change its legal domicile to Bermuda. In 
1992, it removed its main listing from the Hong Kong market, which prompted 
other companies to follow suit. By next March, almost the entire Jardine 
Matheson group will be safely ensconced in Singapore and Bermuda. "All Jardine 
is doing is maintaining the status quo," McNamara said. "We are a British 
company operating in Hong Kong, and that will remain the same." 
</P>
<P>
 As the July 1, 1997, reversion to Chinese rule nears, Jardine fears it may 
become a target of Chinese-backed hostile takeovers, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The fears are not unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever Beijing wants to make Jardine uncomfortable, it brings up the 
company's "perfidious" origins. As the oldest British trading company, or hong 
, Jardine made its fortune trading opium for tea and silk in China, and it was 
influential in getting Britain to fight the Opium War, the 1840-41 clash in 
which the British took the island of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, China achieved some revenge by nationalizing Jardine's headquarters 
in Shanghai and its Chinese holdings. Recently, the basis of China's 
displeasure with Jardine has been the company's support of something China 
fears could be as addictive as opium: democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine was the only hong to condemn the Chinese government for its massacre 
of student demonstrators in Tian An Men Square in 1989. The company's 
executives have also backed Hong Kong Gov. Chris Patten's recent democratic 
reforms, which have riled Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The company protests that it has been made a scapegoat.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not involved in politics between Britain and China," McNamara said. 
"We're just in business." 
</P>
<P>
 But recent run-ins between Jardine and Beijing seem to show that in Hong Kong, 
politics and business aren't easily separated. Beijing has refused to approve a 
$1.6-billion container terminal project, complaining that Jardine received the 
contract as a reward for political support. Soon after, a Jardine-owned 
construction company came under fire after it was chosen to build China's naval 
base in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine may have anticipated such attacks when it took its main listing off 
the Hang Seng index in 1992 -- an action Beijing called irresponsible. Or, as 
some analysts suggest, the firm may have sealed its fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been caught up somewhat in a struggle in which we had no control," 
McNamara said. "We won't be released from that until the conflict is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's other hongs seem to be taking a different tack, convinced that 
change is the key to success in China's burgeoning market. The contrast is 
especially apparent with Swire Pacific, Jardine's sometime partner and longtime 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swire has changed their tune," said Gordon Crosbie-Walsh, a financial analyst 
at Nomura Research Institute. "They made a significant effort to improve their 
relationship with China, and it's paying off." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has traded its British image for a more Asian one, replacing the 
Union Jacks on the tails of its Cathay Pacific airplanes with a bird-like brush 
stroke of Chinese calligraphy. It formed partnerships with the mainland company 
Citic Pacific, whose head, Rong Yiren, is now vice president of China, and won 
the Coca-Cola bottling franchise for China's large and thirsty market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swire will be the winner in China, but not overall," Crosbie-Walsh said. 
"Jardine is capturing growth all over the world. Swire will have the growth 
from China, but also the risk."

VARY BUSINESS LOAN RATES, FED CHIEF URGES 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Wednesday urged the banking industry 
to revamp the way it prices loans to businesses. He suggested that banks vary 
the interest rates they charge according to companies' credit history. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan, in a speech at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, said that 
moving away from a one-price-fits-all lending policy would help banks retain 
their customers, would benefit borrowers and would work to make the economy 
more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed chief also called for a change in the way banks are supervised. He 
suggested that regulators should be ready to allow banks to take considerable 
risks with money, provided they have the sufficient capital and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, the majority of banks are playing a losing game with their 
current and potential competitors by employing only one interest rate per 
facility for borrowers of widely varying risk," the Fed chairman said in his 
prepared remarks, which were released here. 
</P>
<P>
 That means banks' best business customers are being overcharged for loans and 
could be tempted to look elsewhere for money in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some big corporations already are bypassing banks and borrowing directly from 
investors via commercial paper, a form of I.O.U. Or they are turning to finance 
companies and other non-bank lenders, such as General Electric Co.'s credit 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "If banks overcharge their better quality smaller borrowers in order to charge 
the same loan rate to their lower quality borrowers, we can expect the better 
quality smaller borrowers to follow in the footsteps of their large corporate 
brethren and seek credit elsewhere," Greenspan said.

 French Unemployment Rate Declines to 12.6%: The nation's jobless rate fell in 
October by 17,700 people, the largest monthly decline in six years, for a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.6%, the Labor Ministry said. The surprise 
drop, from 12.7% in September, still leaves France atop the jobless rate of the 
Group of Seven industrialized countries, ahead of Italy, whose unemployment 
rate is 11.9%. But the decline, coming after two consecutive months of rises, 
was a plus for the conservative government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
which is anxious to show its job-creation policies are delivering the goods 
ahead of May's presidential elections.

 Aid to Haiti Will Resume: The European Union and Haiti signed a $145-million 
aid program, marking the resumption of assistance after a three-year break. The 
EU suspended aid in 1991 following the military coup that ousted President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The aid will be used to restore government 
administration, infrastructure and the manufacturing sector.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; AIRLINE AMENITIES GET MORE AMBITIOUS; TECHNOLOGY: PASSENGERS 
WILL SOON SEE PERSONAL VIDEO SYSTEMS, SHOPPING PROGRAMS AND GAMBLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mile-high bibliophiles, beware. The world's commercial airlines are busily 
writing the next chapter in in-flight personal video systems that would offer 
movie channels, video games, shopping programs and even the chance to gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three dozen airlines -- including Delta, Northwest, United and USAir 
-- have launched at-seat systems on some longer flights or plan to do so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, all the airlines will offer multichannel networks that mimic 
home cable TV, with individual screens that fold out of either armrests or seat 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
 The more ambitious carriers -- among them Northwest, Virgin Atlantic, Qantas 
and British Airways -- plan to introduce interactive systems that allow 
passengers to send faxes, play video games, order items from catalogues and, on 
some international carriers, gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 United is one of 13 airlines with personal video systems in some of its 
first-class cabins, said Bob Ernst, United Airlines' director of on-board 
service planning. The devices function like individual videocassette recorders, 
with passengers selecting titles from libraries maintained by flight 
attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the airline plans to receive the first of 34 Boeing 777s, a new type 
of wide-body craft that will feature a fully interactive video entertainment 
system at every seat in all classes. In addition, Ernst said, United plans to 
install the technology in the first- and business-class sections of 54 aircraft 
that fly international routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point in time, the international fleets of the world will all have 
individual entertainment systems," he said. The big questions, he said, are 
what the systems will do and whether they will be at every seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent fliers already know that airlines are making more use of video. Not 
so long ago, movies were all a passenger could watch on a long flight. Today, 
the overhead screens are in use for most of the flight, showing safety videos, 
documentaries, sitcoms, news and commercials as well as feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines acknowledge that a desire for more revenue is the main reason 
behind the busier screens. Short programs "are all vehicles for advertising 
revenue," said Joe Crawley, a spokesman for American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of individual interactive multichannel systems, the 
opportunities for advertisers to reach captive audiences will be even greater, 
said Ona Burns, a New York-based advertising consultant to the airline 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The airlines want the revenue partly because the equipment is expensive. 
United is spending more than $1 million to outfit each new 777 with the 
personal systems, Ernst said, and retrofitting an existing plane costs twice as 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 As for gambling, four international carriers -- Virgin Atlantic, British 
Airways, Qantas and Singapore Airlines -- have said they will provide 
seat-based electronic games such as poker and blackjack. Passengers would buy 
gambling credits with cash or credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent U.S. law prohibits American carriers from providing in-air gambling. 
Among those who plan to lobby Congress to repeal the legislation is former 
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, who earlier this year formed a company to help 
finance in-flight entertainment systems.

FLUOR CORP. POSTS RECORD PROFIT FOR LATEST FISCAL YEAR; EARNINGS: OVERSEAS 
EXPANSION AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING ARE CREDITED FOR NET INCOME OF $192.4 
MILLION, UP 15% FROM 1993. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reaping the benefits of aggressive expansion overseas and a corporate 
restructuring at home, Fluor Corp. on Wednesday reported a record profit of 
$192.4 million for its latest fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based engineering, construction and mining company's 15% earnings 
increase for the year ended Oct. 31 equaled $2.32 a share and came on an 8% 
increase in revenue, to $8.49 billion. That compared to a profit of $166.8 
million, or $2.03 a share, on revenue of $7.85 billion for the previous fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Les G. McCraw, Fluor's chairman and chief executive officer, credited the 
strong showing to the company's increased emphasis on doing business in the 
Pacific Rim and in Latin America. It was a watershed year, he said, with 
international pursuits for the first time outweighing domestic business to make 
up 51% of the company's projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been on a strong globalization strategy, and it is now paying off," 
McCraw said. "We are very optimistic about the opportunities we see around the 
globe, especially in the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. . . . It's an 
incredibly large market." 
</P>
<P>
 A yearlong drive to "re-engineer" the giant company by developing cost-cutting 
procedures and increasing flexibility by moving the decision-making processes 
farther down the management ranks also paid off. As much as 15% of the profit 
gain for the year can be traced to that internal effort, McCraw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expressed optimism about Fluor's prospects for the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Fluor works on projects with such long lead times, it can sustain 
earnings improvement like this for the foreseeable future," said Kemp Fuller, 
managing director of New York investment bank and brokerage Commonwealth 
Associates. Fuller estimates a 14% earnings increase for Fluor in fiscal 1995, 
to $2.65 a share, or about $220 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who works in global business sees greater growth opportunities in 
the international arena than nationally," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 For its fourth quarter, Fluor reported a profit of $52.4 million, or 63 cents 
a share, a 16% rise from earnings of $45.2 million, or 55 cents a share, for 
the same period a year earlier. Fluor had posted a gain of $3.1 million, or 4 
cents a share, for the final quarter of fiscal 1993 from a pension fund credit 
in its A.T. Massey Coal Co. coal mining unit. That boosted net income for the 
three months to $48.3 million, or 59 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the latest quarter climbed 9%, to $2.39 billion from $2.19 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor said that despite the increase in business for the year, the value of 
new contracts logged in the final quarter dropped more than 22%, to $1.28 
billion from $1.65 billion. Spokeswoman Deborah Land said Fluor's decision to 
pursue larger projects means that such quarterly fluctuations are likely to 
continue because such contracts, while more valuable, take more time to 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Fluor's common stock 
rose 25 cents a share to close at $42.875. The day's trading volume of 498,700 
shares was more than half again the three-month average daily volume of 327,900 
shares. Fluor at a Glance

BAN ON FORMER S&L PRESIDENT OVERTURNED; FINANCE: CONDUCT BY HEAD OF DELTA 
THRIFT IN WESTMINSTER 'IN NO WAY' JUSTIFIED FEDERAL REGULATORS' HARSH MEASURES, 
PANEL RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case rife with government misconduct, a federal appeals court threw out 
an order that had banned a former Westminster savings and loan president from 
the financial industry for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the conduct of Young Il Kim 
in managing Delta Savings Bank "in no way" even approached the level of 
culpability required by federal law to impose such severe sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's conduct "certainly does not justify the imposition of such a Draconian 
measure" as a lifetime ban from the industry, the unanimous three-judge panel 
wrote in a decision filed Friday but released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got justice from the court and I'm very happy," said Kim, a certified 
public accountant in Los Angeles. "I have been suffering a lot for the past 
three years. When I was thinking the case over and over, I couldn't find 
anything that I did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Thrift Supervision, which ordered the ban, has two weeks to 
decide whether to seek a rehearing, appeal the decision or accept it, said 
William Fulwider, an OTS spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency seized an apparently healthy Delta Savings Bank three years ago and 
operated it until last spring, when it sold the deposits and closed the thrift. 
In seizing Delta, the agency accused Kim and three other directors of 
"egregious insider abuse," and two of the directors eventually settled with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The OTS brought its case against Kim and another director before an 
administrative law judge. But after six days of hearings two years ago, the 
judge, Arthur L. Shipe, found that the agency had failed to prove its case 
against them. That marked only the second time that the agency had ever lost a 
case before an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipe also concluded that an OTS examiner had blackmailed the thrift's 
executives into hiring her as chief operating officer at twice her agency 
salary and that she then gave the thrift bad advice, which led to the 
accusations against the executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing also uncovered evidence that federal examiners were racially 
biased against Kim and three other Korean-born owners of Delta. A California 
thrift examiner testified that one of the federal regulators, in a telephone 
call to his superior, said he was "banging up the Korean." Shipe, however, did 
not discuss possible bias in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 As for insider abuse, Shipe found that the executives had not knowingly done 
anything wrong and that Delta didn't lose money on four loans made to insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 But in April, 1993, Acting OTS Director Jonathan Fiechter overruled Shipe and 
ordered lifetime bans. Kim appealed, but the other director did not. 
</P>
<P>
 In finding that the OTS simply failed to support its action, the appellate 
panel sidestepped Shipe's highly charged findings. The panel instead concluded 
that Kim did not know he was violating any banking laws and that the agency 
couldn't prove that he was culpable of serious wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the OTS' vehement use of such colorful words as 'egregious' to 
describe Kim's conduct, the materials provided show only that Kim was one of 
several officers and directors who approved a few questionable loans . . . and 
that a few relatively minor and technical violations of certain banking 
regulations occurred," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has filed a lawsuit against the federal government, accusing it of racial 
motivations in seizing Delta and targeting him. The case, which is pending, 
seeks $100 million for Delta and $20 million for Kim.

THE BIG CHILL; NOVEMBER'S COLD NIPS SOME SALES, BUT OTHERS HEAT UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the current warm spell has melted memories of last month's brisk weather, 
Southern California residents will soon receive a chilling reminder of 
November's cold: monthly gas bills four to seven times higher than those for 
October, thanks to soaring usage. 
</P>
<P>
 From firewood to microwaveable neck warmers, last month's cooler-than-normal 
temperatures and rainy conditions prompted demand for a wide variety of 
cold-weather products and services that usually sell later in the season. In 
addition, the crisp weather helped jump-start sales of holiday-related 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Riffey, a supervisor at SGI Insulation in Garden Grove, said that he 
added a third crew to his retrofitting division in November as people with 
older, uninsulated homes called for quick service. The company blows new 
insulation into attics and walls to help block the chill. "Business was 
probably up 20%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Woodshed Firewood in Orange, owner Don Sayles said that last month was "the 
busiest November since we started keeping records in 1986. It was probably 40% 
busier than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodshed buys its hardwood from local suppliers and from commercial firewood 
cutters in Texas, Arizona and Northern California. Sayles said increased demand 
because of the cold snap "has meant we have had to order earlier and make more 
calls to get what we need." 
</P>
<P>
 But the cold also has hurt some businesses, forcing many restaurants to 
abandon or limit popular outdoor dining and sent shivering amusement park-goers 
home early. 
</P>
<P>
 "By 5 p.m., people are heading to the parking lot -- it's just too cold at 
night," said Bob Ochsner, spokesman for Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. On 
the Saturday after Thanksgiving, attendance was down by about 50% because of 
cold and rainy weather. It was so chilly that the park's Christmas crafts areas 
ran out of cocoa and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday should have been a big day, but it wasn't because of the cold," 
Ochsner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The long lines at espresso carts and the bursts of intense fall color attested 
to last month's chilly conditions. Until the weather warmed up this week, the 
daily high at the Los Angeles Civic Center exceeded 70 degrees on only seven 
November days, according to Curtis Brack, a meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., 
which provides forecasts and other information to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack says the path of winter storms, which normally roll south out of Canada 
across the Rocky Mountains, has shifted. Instead, most of the storms have been 
moving out of the Pacific and directly across the West Coast and California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's keeping things pretty cool in Southern California," said Brack, who 
predicted a return of the colder weather and possible showers by late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold drove monthly residential gas consumption up 50% over November, 1993, 
levels, according to Southern California Gas Co. spokeswoman Vicki Cho Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers certainly did turn up their heat to keep warm," Estrada said. "The 
temperatures that we saw in November were more like those in January and 
February." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mervyn's department store in Downey, sales of turtlenecks and thermal 
pajamas took off at the beginning of the month, store manager Kim Van Natta 
said. Then demand surged for holiday-themed socks -- complete with bells -- and 
other apparel that normally sells strongly after Thanksgiving. Customers also 
snapped up $11.99 neck warmers, which feature a plastic tube of gel that can be 
heated up in a microwave oven to keep the wearer warm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers got in the mood early and started shopping," Van Natta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold got residents thinking about winter vacations sooner than normal, 
said travel agent Kathy Traynor of Associated Travel in Monrovia. Instead of a 
typically slow November, "all of a sudden we have had a lot of inquiries on ski 
packages. Thanksgiving week we were really busy, and we have not started to 
slow down yet." 
</P>
<P>
 At Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning, November was much more like January 
as general manager Bob Wiseman and his 25 employees worked 12-hour days and 
Saturdays to repair and service home furnaces. Many customers have been turned 
away because Wiseman's business couldn't handle the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we have the initial cold wave, people start calling," Wiseman said. "We 
are obviously quite pleased with it."

IRVINE'S RAINBOW HOLDING THE KEY TO SAFE DRIVING ON INFO HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years the fear of software piracy has brought the giants of technology to 
the door of Rainbow Technologies Inc., which protects programs with 
matchbook-size devices that plug into the backs of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers such as Microsoft Corp., Borland International and Hewlett-Packard Co. 
include the keys with software programs that they sell, particularly those 
marketed in foreign countries where intellectual property standards are lower 
or are not enforced. Software codes can be written so they will not run unless 
one of Rainbow's keys is plugged into a computer's printer port. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're an insurance company," said Walter Straub, Rainbow's chief executive 
officer. "Customers will continue to buy insurance as long as they see a 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Rainbow, based in Irvine, is positioning itself as an arms merchant in the 
next data war: the fight over how much protection there should be for 
information transmitted between computers. In October, Rainbow signed a letter 
of intent to buy Mykotronx Inc., a privately held Torrance company that makes a 
controversial microprocessor known as the clipper chip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted as a procurement standard by the U.S. Department of Commerce earlier 
this year, the chip will allow police agencies to decode scrambled electronic 
signals to eavesdrop on digital communications sent by modems, fax machines and 
other telephone links. The decoding would be conducted under the same principle 
as legally authorized wiretaps of ordinary telephone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, acquiring Mykotronx would appear to be an excellent move for 
Rainbow. With on-line data transmission replacing many of the distribution 
functions that were once done by floppy disk, publicly traded Rainbow could 
position itself as an industry leader and respected voice in national debates 
about encryption standards and on-line privacy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street has not been kind recently to Rainbow's stock, driving it down 
in recent weeks from about $16 a share after the Mykotronx proposal was 
announced to a close of $12.25 in Wednesday's NASDAQ trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that the 23% decline probably has to do with uncertainty about if 
and when the deal will close. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's people discounting the acquisition as the days go by until it's finally 
announced," said Steve DeLuca, an analyst at investment bank Cruttenden & Co. 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLuca and other analysts are generally positive about a Rainbow-Mykotronx 
combination, which would broaden Rainbow's revenue base. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Rainbow also sells procedures to protect data on CD-ROMs, about 95% of 
its revenue comes from sale of its protection keys, Straub said. The company 
reported 1993 revenue of $35 million, while Mykotronx had revenue of about $9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Girton, an analyst at the San Francisco brokerage Van Kasper & Co., 
said Rainbow's recent stock slide may reflect some investors' doubts about 
whether Mykotronx's chip technology can be commercialized at competitive 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow is in a good position overall, however, said Girton, whose company 
co-managed a Rainbow stock offering in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been some concern about whether the deal is going to go through, but 
we think it's a long-term buy," he said of Rainbow's stock. "From our 
perspective, it doesn't matter if the deal goes through or not, since the 
stock's trading at what it was before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the clipper chip standard is voluntary, privacy advocates assert that 
government agencies are using it to pressure commercial suppliers of telephones 
and computer modems to implant the device in consumer goods as well as those 
sold to public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the fate of clipper, Mykotronx, as the sole supplier of the chip and 
other related encryption technologies, is well positioned to benefit as norms 
are established for the coding and decoding of data. The company now has 
contracts with the National Security Agency, including an agreement to supply 
equipment for spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Mykotronx President Ted Bettwy said this week that, if Rainbow follows through 
with the purchase, it will pay between $20 million and $25 million for the 
company. Straub and other Rainbow executives said they would not comment until 
the deal is closed. That could happen as soon as later this month or early 
January, Bettwy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow was founded in 1984 by Straub and others, and initially produced 
upgrade products for dot-matrix printers. The idea for software protection keys 
resulted from a collaboration with California Software Products Inc., a Santa 
Ana company seeking a way to safeguard a $3,500 software program it was selling 
that allowed small computers to mimic the functions of much larger machines. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its Irvine headquarters, which has about 40 engineers among its 
100 employees, Rainbow has manufacturing facilities in northern Thailand and in 
France, where it bought competitor Microphar SA in 1992. Worldwide, the company 
has about 160 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 California Software Products still buys about 8,000 protection devices from 
Rainbow each year, said Elizabeth Richell, a vice president of marketing there. 
</P>

 "It's not something you'd want to put out unprotected," Richell said of her 
company's software. "We've stayed with them," she said of Rainbow, "because 
their products are reliable. We've got systems in some very obscure, 
hard-to-reach places, so it's important that we can depend on their products." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as California Software that sell overseas often find that other 
countries do not have the intellectual property protections they have come to 
rely on in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade groups representing the major software companies estimate between $7 
billion to $12 billion in sales are lost worldwide each year to software 
piracy. That is a main reason for the inclusion of intellectual property 
protection agreements in many multinational trade pacts, including the massive 
Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT treaty, scheduled for a vote 
today in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that buy Rainbow's keys generally include them with software 
packages costing $250 for sale overseas and $500 or more in the United States, 
said Michael Emerson, the company's marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for data protection will only increase, Straub said, as electronic 
distribution becomes more popular. Rainbow Vision

 With its intention to buy Mykotronx Inc., Irvine's Rainbow Technologies makes 
a bid for a central position in the future of data transmission. A look at the

ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL SEEKS SPACE SHUTTLE PACT; AVIATION: CONTRACTOR WILL 
COMPETE WITH OTHER MAJOR PLAYERS TO DESIGN THE NEXT GENERATION OF CRAFT. DEAL 
COULD TOTAL $660 MILLION THROUGH FISCAL 1999.

 Rockwell International Corp. confirmed Wednesday that it will compete against 
Lockheed Corp. and the team of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. to design 
the successor to the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell has been the lead contractor for the space shuttle since the program 
began in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials have spoken with several major aerospace companies about 
teaming to bid on the program, said Alan Buis, a spokesman for Rockwell Space 
Systems in Downey. He would not identify the other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which initially calls for a 13-month contract, is potentially 
worth $660 million through fiscal 1999 if one space-launch vehicle is built, 
said Jim Cast, spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The X-33, NASA's code name for the project, is an effort to develop a 
less-expensive replacement for the space shuttle. The contract is to evaluate 
technologies and develop design concepts for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, rivals in the commercial jetliner 
market, announced that they will compete for the program together. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp. also said it will bid on the program, heading a team that 
includes Martin Marietta Corp., Rockwell's Rocketdyne division and Rohr 
Industries Inc. A proposed merger of Lockheed and Martin is pending federal 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rocketdyne division, which builds rocket engines, plans to bid both with 
Lockheed and Rockwell, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 If NASA continues with development and initial production awards, the X-33 
could be operating by about 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately Wednesday, Rockwell said it has won a contract worth as much as 
$200 million to supply the avionics systems for a new Czech fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will begin with a 33-month prototype phase valued at $20 million. 
A 72-aircraft production phase would follow. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prime contractor, Rockwell Aerospace will design and install the 
systems for the L-159 combat aircraft being developed by Aero Vodochody. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied Signal Inc. said it will produce some of the system's electronic parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the project will be performed at Rockwell's North American Aircraft 
Modification Division in Anaheim and at the Aero Vodochody plant in Vodochody, 
Czech Republic.

FIRM TAKES GOODS TO SUPERMARKET; ENVIRONMENT: SEVENTH GENERATION HOPES TO 
IMPROVE ITS FISCAL HEALTH BY EXPANDING ITS EARTH-FRIENDLY CLEANING PRODUCTS TO 
GROCERY STORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Made from recycled trash and vegetable oil, Seventh Generation's line of 
chlorine-free laundry products and nontoxic cleaners has saved an estimated 
35,000 trees and 14 million gallons of water the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the eco-product marketer is fighting to save its fiscal health. After 
persistent losses and a plunge in its stock price, the tiny company -- 
primarily a seller of products through catalogues and natural food stores -- is 
trying to expand into supermarkets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Colchester, Vt., company is little known to most Americans and 
dwarfed by today's conglomerates, its bid is being watched as a test of the 
mainstream's appetite for earth-friendly products -- which experts say has 
waned from the euphoria following the 20th anniversary of Earth Day in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gamble works, a dozen Seventh Generation products, from all-natural 
dishwashing detergent in quirky blue boxes to toilet paper made from 100% 
recycled trash, will pepper supermarket shelves nationwide within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media likes the little guy trying to make it big against the giants. It's 
a good story. But again, Seventh Generation isn't the only company with an 
alternative household cleaner or toilet paper or dishwasher detergent," said 
Joel Makower, editor of the Green Business Letter, a Washington-based 
environmental publication. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges facing Seventh Generation are daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh Generation's stock, traded on the Nasdaq stock market, is just above a 
low of $1.62 1/2 per share hit last month, when the company reported a $490,556 
third-quarter loss on $1.95 million in revenue. Two-thirds of $7 million in 
proceeds from the company's initial public offering late last year are gone, 
drained by unanticipated expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said in a third-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that it has enough cash to last through the end of March, when it 
will need to find new sources of funding or make significant reductions in its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeffrey Hollender, the company's ponytailed president, says he isn't too 
worried. Just turned 40, Hollender envisions turning a nation's preoccupation 
with cancer-causing dioxins and leaky landfills into a defiant challenge to the 
likes of Procter & Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a critical juncture for the company and certainly the risks are not 
ones we take lightly," Hollender said in a recent interview in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of 1995, "we're looking to get into thousands of stores, not 
hundreds of stores. I think that's a conservative objective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Seventh Generation's products are sold in regional supermarkets in 
Atlanta, Boston, Seattle and Buffalo, N.Y., but the company says it is taking 
longer than expected to reach agreement with major national chains. 
</P>
<P>
 To set itself apart, Seventh Generation is relying on an atypical strategy for 
eco-companies: slashing prices so it can directly compete with national brands. 
</P>
<P>
 A bottle of all-natural toilet bowl cleaner that used to go for $5.50 is now 
$2.98. Dishwashing liquid based on vegetable oil instead of petroleum went from 
$3.40 to $2.48. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh Generation reformulated its products to use less expensive ingredients 
that it says are still environmentally sound and work just as well as those 
based on synthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company's automatic dishwasher detergent contains a petroleum-based 
cleaning agent instead of vegetable oil, an admission that natural ingredients 
don't always perform best. The product still has no harmful phosphates or 
chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always making some compromises to achieve performance," said Martin 
Wolf, a scientist and chemist who helped formulate the products. 
</P>
<P>
 The packaging, replete with assertions about how the products help the 
environment, is clearly different from other consumer brands. Included is an 
explanation of the Seventh Generation name, which it says is derived from "the 
great law of the Iroquois confederacy." 
</P>
<P>
 "In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on 
the next seven generations," goes the explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hurdle is the cost of membership in the big leagues. Giant consumer 
products companies normally pay steep fees called slotting allowances to 
retailers for the privilege of displaying their brands on crowded shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh Generation wants supermarket chains to carry its products for free. It 
hopes to stimulate interest by offering coupons to existing catalogue customers 
and staging in-store demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is Hollander's optimism, worthy of an environmental activist, 
against conventional wisdom that shallow-pocketed companies can't make it in 
the national arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe we will go out of business if we don't succeed in the mass 
market," Hollender said. "The question we are asking is, 'Will Seventh 
Generation make it happen, or will someone else make it happen?' "

RED OCTOBER CONFECTIONER SEARCHES FOR RESPECT, INVESTORS IN RUSSIA; MARKETING: 
THE CANDY MAKER SURVIVED CZARS AND COMMUNISM. NOW IT FACES COMPETITION FROM 
GIANTS LIKE MARS AND SNICKERS, AND THE TASK OF MODERNIZING AND GETTING CAPITAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Don't ask folks at the Red October candy factory about the invasion of Mars. 
And don't mention Snickers or Bounty either. 
</P>
<P>
 These American sweets are so heavily advertised, so omnipresent in today's 
Russia that a whole generation of Mars, Snickers and Bounty jokes has appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one is laughing at Red October. A scowl darkens the face of Red October 
director Anatoly Daursky at the mere mention of a Mars bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "One hundred and fifty million people wanted to try some foreign chocolate. 
Well, it's been two years and everyone has had their taste! And we now say our 
confectionery is going to survive!" he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many big state enterprises, Red October has had a tough time since the 
Soviet collapse. But this 127-year-old confectioner isn't about to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the red-brick factory in the heart of Moscow will become the first 
former state company to sell shares to the general public, officials announced 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Money raised through the landmark stock offering -- part of a pilot program 
aimed at showing other Russian companies how such a thing is done -- will be 
used to modernize its plant and market its sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 Red October has, Daursky says with a certain understatement, "had its ups and 
downs" since it was founded in 1867 by a German master confectioner. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the Bolshevik Revolution, when the factory was nationalized. There 
was World War II, when hundreds of workers were sent to the front. There was 
the 20% tax on imported sugar levied this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Mars. And Snickers. And Bounty. 
</P>
<P>
 But Red October officials -- and their British advisers -- insist that the 
company's chocolates, toffees and caramels have a solid niche in the Russian 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Muscovites, Red October products like Mishka (Clumsy Bear) chocolates, 
Little Cow caramels, Romance bonbons and Kis-Kis toffees are tender reminders 
of childhood treats and family gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Red October sweets are savored, Daursky insists, not wolfed down on the run 
like an American candy bar. Red October seems at least equal in quality to 
American sweets, but buying the imported stuff is the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Red October cultivates its role as a national institution; the company museum 
is like a quick tour through Russian history. 
</P>
<P>
 It is crammed with memorabilia, from brocaded boxes from the days when the 
factory supplied sweets to the czar's household to red velvet flags emblazoned 
with the Communist hammer and sickle. 
</P>
<P>
 The $21.8-million stock offering could give Red October a new lease on life. 
Daursky says half the plant's equipment is obsolete. Packaging and distribution 
also need improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Red October will offer 3.5 million shares to Russian and foreign investors at 
20,000 rubles, about $6.25, a share for two weeks beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope that the stock offer will set an example for a nation still 
somewhat befuddled by the whole concept of investing. Millions of Russians 
seeking quick riches have been defrauded by fly-by-night funds and thinly 
disguised pyramid schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Red October, officials say, won't make anyone rich overnight. But it won't 
vanish overnight either. Red October posted a profit of $22.3 million in the 
first half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very strong company and it is well led," said Richard Oliver of the 
Samuel Montagu investment bank in London, an adviser to Red October. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Soviet Union started falling apart, Red October faced the collapse of 
the planned economy. What if there were no more imported nuts? What if the 
transport system collapsed? Daursky said he braced for every dire eventuality 
he could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 What he got was an onslaught from Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 Red October seems determined to fight back. "We want to compete with Mars," 
Daursky said. "We want to compete in the West."

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: TAKING A RIDE ON THE WILD SIDE OF THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Staff writer Jeff Meyers and photographer Alan Hagman have been a bit hard to 
live with since they returned from their trip to the Sespe Wilderness. Just 
because they went into the rugged outback and stared danger in the face without 
blinking, they figure that the rest of us are supposed to be really impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hear what Meyers had to say about his trip: "I hope readers come away 
from the story appreciating the Sespe for its natural treasures -- and also 
fearing it for its ever-present dangers. I think it's clear that the wilderness 
doesn't tolerate beginners. Trails are difficult to follow and weather can turn 
hostile in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 What does Meyers think, that the rest of us weren't meeting our own 
survivalist challenge? While he pranced through the wild, we were in heavy 
training -- stuffing down extra calories and hacking our way through malls -- 
getting ready for the serious competitive eating and shopping we'll need to do 
in the weeks ahead. Meyers and Hagman were just fighting the elements. How many 
cologne sprayers did they have to dodge? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to hit the Sespe's highlights in just three days was to take a 
whirlwind tour," Meyers said. "Guide Tony Alvis kept pushing the pace. He 
presided over a forced march that kept me in the saddle for hours at a time. I 
experienced embarrassing epidermal reactions to the constant pounding. The 
situation was not helped by my horse, a 12-year-old gelding named Pinto that 
insisted on breaking into a trot without any prodding from me." 
</P>
<P>
 But if you read his story, you'll also find out that the meals were catered by 
one of Ventura's best chefs, while back at the mall, most shoppers were forced 
to choose between a burger and a hot dog on a stick. And often we had to eat 
them standing or riding on packed escalators, while Meyers had nothing but 
solid ground and wide open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget the 2 1/2-hour journey back from Sespe Hot Springs on a 
moonless night," said Meyers. "Somehow, Pinto didn't walk off the edge of a 
sheer mountain trail and plunge a few hundred feet to our mutual death." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers may be fine teetering on a horse while the horse teeters on the edge of 
a cliff, but I'd like to see him at the after-holiday sales going one-on-one 
with a seasoned shopper. He may think that he's tough, but he's going to lose 
in the tussle over that half-price sweater. 
</P>
<P>
 And think about it: How much time will he actually be spending in the 
wilderness anyway? Then compare that to the time he'll spend fighting for 
parking and jostling for position at the gas pump and the checkout stand. Some 
people know nothing about real life skills.

SOUNDS: STILL UNPLUGGED AT 67; TONY BENNETT'S APPEARANCE AT THE CIVIC ARTS 
PLAZA ON SUNDAY COMES AMID A NEWFOUND POPULARITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much of the ongoing redefinition process of pop music -- and culture in 
general -- has to do with drawing lines, creating us versus them scenarios. And 
then, at some point, a sense of reason can creep in and old foes find a way to 
embrace. It's the way of the cultural world. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: The grand return of great American singer Tony Bennett, whose 
appearance at the Civic Arts Plaza on Sunday comes amid a newfound popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bennett was once displaced in the pop music scene by the machinations 
of rock 'n' roll, the last decade has been very good to him. Bennett, a 
crooning favorite in the '50s and early '60s, began his long disappearance from 
the big-time record industry scene in the late '60s but never stopped working. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked on the road, he started his own small label, Improv, and he 
sustained his status as one of the best singers alive. Then as now, Bennett's 
vocal style relies on a near-perfect balance of composure and spontaneous 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with his 1986 comeback album, "The Art of Excellence," Bennett has 
released a series of stellar recordings, including a retrospective album "Tony 
Bennett Jazz," "Bennett/Berlin," "Astoria: Portrait of the Artist," "Steppin' 
Out," and "Perfectly Frank," which he dedicated to Sinatra, his longtime 
colleague in the singing game. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, and now Tony Bennett has won a place in the heart of the post-grunge, 
alternarock scene. Who wudda thunk it? Does this mean that he has bitten the 
bullet of compromise on his latest album, "MTV Unplugged" -- a recording of his 
recent MTV special, with cameos by k.d. lang and Elvis Costello? 
</P>
<P>
 Just the opposite. Even the title has a little sting of irony: Bennett has 
been unplugged since before musicians starting plugging in, and his set list is 
strictly Bennettesque, celebrating the same pre-rock American songs that he has 
always sung. Suddenly, Bennett is in his prime again, wooing jazz and pop fans 
of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation, the silver-haired, 67-year-old Bennett is much like his 
singing presence -- gracious, sincere, optimistic and quietly but steadfastly 
resistant to giving an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest album of yours is really a celebration of archival American songs, 
and the fact that it was on MTV is startling in a way. Does that suggest that 
culture has cycled around? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things I found out is that the young people dislike what they've 
inherited. They don't like drugs. They want an education. They want honesty in 
a performer. They want quality. They want to save the environment. They really 
dislike politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The young people should be encouraged. They shouldn't be put down like the 
other group was, like they were morons or something. They shouldn't be treated 
like that. They should be encouraged that they're on the right kick. Bravo for 
you for going for an education and learning languages and wanting to become a 
professional person. 
</P>
<P>
 And having a desire to broaden their musical tastes? 
</P>
<P>
 They do. They love Pavarotti, they love Bartok. You'd be surprised. They love 
all kinds of music, and they gravitate toward anything that has quality to it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Unplugged album, you give credit to your pianist, Ralph Sharon, for 
scouting out songs for you. Is that entirely true? 
</P>
<P>
 That's entirely true. He's a jazz artist who happens to enjoy entertaining 
people, and he loves good popular songs. He loves to hear good tunes and always 
finds wonderful ones. He has found songs like "Nobody Else But Me." They 
weren't hits, but they were songs that all the other jazz artists picked up on 
and started playing. Songs like "Lazy Afternoon," "Sleeping Bee" -- so many 
songs that you would call pop art songs. There is an art to the way they were 
written. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph picked out many of the songs for me. He's a very educated guy, and he 
never flaunts it. He's a very understated type of guy, a wonderful accompanist. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to Elvis Costello singing alongside you, I notice he seems to have 
picked up some things from you -- that signature vibrato and phrasing -- that 
seem to nod in your direction. Have you noticed that? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, anything but the vibrato. I don't have that kind of vibrato. It's a 
little too wide. You're not supposed to wobble. But he does phrase a little 
like Sinatra. On "You Can't Take That Away From Me," he did this Sinatraesque 
phrase that was so obvious and it was fun. I'm thinking "Wait a minute; that's 
Sinatra . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 You and Sinatra have had this mutual admiration society for a long time, 
haven't you? 
</P>
<P>
 I was shocked at Radio City one time, I went to see him and he sat me down 
right next to his wife. It holds 6,000 and he was singing beautifully that 
night. He said, "There's a guy in the audience and he's my best friend not only 
in show business, but my best friend, period." He announced me that way. 
</P>
<P>
 He's always doing this to me, sometimes in remote places. I just got back from 
Buenos Aires, and the press there told me, "Did you hear what Sinatra said 
about you down here? He said 'Tony not only sings better than I do, but he 
paints better than I do.' " He's always throwing me wonderful accolades and 
embarrassing me, yet helping my box office like crazy. Everybody wants to look 
into me because of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a longstanding friendly competition between you two? 
</P>
<P>
 No competition whatsoever. It's been just a great warm friendship. He's been 
very thoughtful and nice through the years. One thing about Sinatra is, boy, 
when he's loyal, does he stick to that. He does not change his mind. He's been 
just beautiful to me right through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you make of the renewed popularity of the songs you do? Do you think 
maybe they dipped out of the public eye for a spell and are returning with 
tenacity now? 
</P>
<P>
 I knew Fred Astaire toward the end of his life, and he said something very 
brilliant to me. He said: "Look at it this way. On one side is Muzak. On the 
other side is this cacophonous sound. And in the center, there's a silver 
lining, and that will sustain." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else will just be thrown away like in a garbage pail. They'll just 
go by the wayside. The silver lining -- like Bunny Berrigan's "I Can't Get 
Started," Coleman Hawkins' "Body and Soul," Billie Holiday's "Good Morning 
Heartache," Miles Davis' "Miles Ahead," a Fred Astaire dance, a Frank Sinatra 
song, Mr. Paganini -- all these wonderful performances -- they stay. Everything 
else goes by the wayside. They're forgotten. That's how it works. The truth 
comes up to the top and stays there. Details

NIGHT LIFE: HARP-PLAYING MINSTREL EXPLORES BIG QUESTIONS; LOREENA MCKENNITT, 
WHO HAS RELEASED FIVE ALBUMS, DESCRIBES HER MUSIC AS 'ECLECTIC CELTIC.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She looks like she stepped off an Aubrey Beardsley illustration en route to 
provide the soundtrack for a Lord Dunsany or J.R.R. Tolkien musical. But no 
flash from the past, Loreena McKennitt will mesmerize her growing ranks of 
faithful with ethereal harmonies when she appears Saturday night at the Ventura 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 McKennitt originally planned to be a veterinarian, but discovered Celtic 
culture and became a street singer in Toronto, choosing wisely her locations 
during the winters. The harp-playing minstrel has since traveled widely, 
learning more about Celtic culture in Ireland as well Judeo-Christian and 
Islamic culture in Spain and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she has five albums to her credit and a Juno Award. Her first three albums 
were released on her own Quinlan Road label, the last two on Warner Bros. 
which, in an unusual arrangement, allows her to sell all of her work at her 
shows. The new one is "The Mask and the Mirror," which further explores the Big 
Questions of mysticism, religion, the meaning of it all and all that. 
</P>
<P>
 McKennitt discussed what's up during a recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Loreena, how's it goin'? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm doing well, and "The Mask and the Mirror" is doing well, considering the 
kind of music it is. It's already done 800,000 worldwide. I don't get a lot of 
media attention; it's mostly word of mouth. Things have grown in a very organic 
way since I began in 1985. Right now, I still have a lot of touring to do, but 
I'm already thinking about what the next record will be, and traveling to those 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 You've clearly found a niche for yourself and your particular style of music. 
OK, so what kind of music is it? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of different influences, not just cross-cultural. The musicians 
in my band came from World Beat, jazz and rock. I like to say it's eclectic 
Celtic music, but it's really hard to define. 
</P>
<P>
 When did you know you wanted to be a musician? 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't like I dreamed as a child of being a musician. Music chose me rather 
than the opposite. I came at it from a different direction, and I wasn't 
starry-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like being a street musician? 
</P>
<P>
 I got to meet a lot of people, plus I found confidence in myself and my music. 
I was actually making a good living selling my tapes on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 You already had a couple of albums before you signed on with Warner Bros. -- 
what's your arrangement with them? 
</P>
<P>
 I underwrite my own recordings and my own tours. It's not unusual for new 
bands to be $500,000 in the hole before they've ever played a show. When you 
travel with 17 people, it can be quite expensive, so merchandising can be very 
important. Some venues actually charge me up to 30% to sell my stuff at a 
concert. Since they didn't help me record my album or pay for my tour, I think 
that's too high and I tell them I'll remember them next tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Who goes to Loreena shows? 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently there are people whose ages span three generations. There's people 
who are into the whole Gothic thing, heavy metal fans, professionals, lawyers, 
archeology professors -- it goes right across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 What sparked your fascination with Irish culture? 
</P>
<P>
 I became interested in Ireland when I was in a folk club in the late '70s in 
Winnepeg. I later studied Irish history through a correspondence course. I felt 
I was instinctively drawn to the place and it became imperative to go there. 
Ireland is essentially a Third World country. I now own a very modest cottage 
in County Clare. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people hate history. Did you like history in school? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually I loathed it. I couldn't see the point of it. Certainly, since then I 
have become very interested in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Has being Big Time in Canada made it easier for you to be Big Time in America? 
</P>
<P>
 That's not really an issue for me. It's already far greater than I could ever 
imagine, and I like to think it happened for the right reasons. How big it may 
get, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>

 They definitely have a helluva temper. Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: SONGBIRD WINGS WAY TO SHOWS; ANNE MURRAY HAS HAD 11 GOLD AND 
SEVERAL PLATINUM RECORDS SINCE 'SNOWBIRD.' SHE WILL PERFORM IN THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In recent years, country music fans in the United States have welcomed female 
Canadian country crooners k. d. lang and Michelle Wright, among others. But 
nearly 25 years ago, it was Anne Murray, a former physical education teacher 
from Nova Scotia, who blazed a path across the border and hit Top 10 on the 
country and pop charts with her 1970 single "Snowbird." Murray scored another 
success in 1973 with "Danny's Song." And since then, her name has barely left 
the pop and country charts with hits including "Shadows in the Moonlight," 
"Could I Have This Dance" and "You Needed Me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian songbird has sold more than 26 million albums, won four Grammys 
and 28 Juno Awards -- the Canadian equivalent of the Grammy -- and brought home 
11 gold and several platinum records. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Murray's instantly recognizable caramel-alto voice earned her a 
place in Nashville's Walkway of Stars and countless Country Music Assn. and 
Academy of Country Music awards. Her "A Little Good News" was named both Single 
and Album of the Year by the Country Music Assn. in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to like hard-core country music to enjoy Murray's style. Her 
appeal crosses over many musical lines -- country, folk, pop and '50s 
standards, like those on her 29th Capitol album, "Croonin'." 
</P>
<P>
 So round up grandma, Uncle Bert and the kids for a concert with 
multi-generational appeal tonight and Friday at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts 
Plaza.

 In another first, the American Federation of Musicians Local 581 (Musicians' 
Union of Ventura County) has elected country singer Leti Morgan as its vice 
president. You can catch Morgan performing with her brother, Pino Sanchez, as 
the country duo Sibling Rivalry.

the dance floor at the club's semimonthly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunsinger reported that during a recent business trip to Asia, the couple -- 
who are the 1992 state waltz contest winners -- were taken to a country-Western 
club in Singapore where they encountered duded-up musicians -- and even a 
fiddle player -- who phonetically sang hits by Merle Haggard and George Strait 
without an understanding of English. "They learn the songs from the records," 
he explained. "A few people got up and tried a rough version of the two-step. 
But the idea of having a dance instructor hasn't reached the clubs yet -- 
they're more into the music. So Luana and I got up and put on a waltz demo for 
the locals." Details

THEATER REVIEW; 'HENRY V' IS A WINNER AGAIN IN LOCAL STAGING; THE MONARCH LEADS 
HIS 'BAND OF BROTHERS' TO VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA SHAKESPEARE COMPANY'S ASSURED 
PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henry V, the king who successfully led England to victory over the French to 
end the Hundred Years War, became the subject of one of the most popular of 
Shakespeare's historical dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a recent film version by Kenneth Branagh, the play is returned to 
the stage through Dec. 18 by the California Shakespeare Company under the 
direction of William H. Fisher. While Shakespeare's histories aren't generally 
as popular as his comedies or tragedies, "Henry V" is highly accessible and a 
lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The play might well have been written for the company's tiny and barren 
Moorpark storefront stage: it begins with a character explaining that no 
theater could hold the spectacle of a war, and imploring the patrons to use 
their imaginations to fill in the missing scenery and battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he promises the audience that if they imagine they're being transported 
from England to France on a ship, they won't get seasick. While packed with 
nobility and action, the play is not without humor. 
</P>
<P>
 A conversation between the Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of Ely provides 
what in the movie business is called "backstory," explaining what has gone on 
before the play begins. The action begins with the French Marquis sending Henry 
a "present" designed to insult and provoke him, and (so to speak) the game's 
afoot. 
</P>
<P>
 After dispatching a couple of would-be assassins, Henry and his troops sail 
for France to fight battles including the pivotal encounter at Agincourt, and 
Henry eventually collects booty including the hand of Princess Katharine. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that doubtless roused the English of Shakespeare's time. But today, 
certain individual scenes probably most appeal to audiences -- among them, the 
comic firebrand Pistol's (Brendan Averatt) encounter with a drunken and fearful 
French soldier (Alan August); Princess Katharine (Elyse Ashton) attempting to 
learn English from her lady-in-waiting, Alice (Lisa Antablian); and the 
climactic encounter between Henry (Dean Erickson), who speaks no French, and 
Katharine, who speaks no English. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson, whose Henry was a bit stiff on opening night (probably 
intentionally: the King had a lot on his royal mind), loosened up considerably 
and appealingly in his scenes with Katharine. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to those performances already noted, Jeff Wallach was impressive 
as the comically smug Dauphin; Steven A. Carver amusing and helpful as the 
chorus who opens and narrates the play; and Lisa Antablian shining, again, as 
Mistress Quickly. Typically for the California Shakespeare Company, even most 
of the players whose time on stage was relatively brief gave entirely 
acceptable performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The costumes are fine, and -- again as usual here -- the lack of scenery only 
causes the actors and audience to concentrate on the language. Which, of 
course, is what Shakespeare is all about. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Henry V." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday evenings at 8; Sunday afternoons at 3 p.m. through 
Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: California Shakespeare Company Theater, 6685 Princeton Ave., 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $12 general admission; $10 for students and seniors. 
</P>
<P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; MURRAY CALLS DECISION BY SCHOOL BOARD 'RACIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASUCAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compton school officials and a local assemblyman have exchanged heated 
comments in the wake of the school board's decision to select an African 
American businessman over a Latino to fill a vacant seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, the board voted by secret ballot to appoint Saul E. Lankster, 
a flower shop owner and former school board member. Lankster, who served on the 
board from 1977 to 1981, was convicted in 1985 on felony charges of selling 
false traffic-school diplomas to undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment has been put on hold, however, while state school officials 
determine whether the school board has the authority to appoint a new member 
and whether the vote by secret ballot was proper. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision was "myopic and racist," said Assemblyman Willard H. 
Murray (D-Paramount). "They continuously defend their ineptitude. They have a 
tendency to underestimate the intelligence or understanding of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray argued that the board should have chosen a Latino to fill the empty 
seat. More than 61% of the students in Compton schools are Latino, yet only one 
of the six board members, Gorgonio Sanchez, is Latino. Murray criticized the 
board for bypassing Martin Chavez, a Latino candidate who received the top 
rating from a screening committee that evaluated 13 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members defended their choice, saying Lankster spoke eloquently on the 
issues and was the only candidate with board experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter released last week, board President Michael Hopwood said Murray's 
comments were unfair. "He impugned everyone's integrity," Hopwood said. "He 
should apply the same logic that he's applying to the board to his own staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's eight-member staff in Sacramento and Paramount consists of four 
African Americans, one Latino and two whites, according to a staff member. 
Murray could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the state took control of the beleaguered school district, reducing 
the school board to an advisory role. Murray pushed through legislation that 
requires the district to remain under state control until students' academic 
performance improves. The state has appointed Jerome Harris to run the 
district. PSYCHE PASUCAL

 Tom and Chris Wilkinson, who transform their property into a "Christmas House" 
each year to raise money for charity, will light their display Sunday after two 
months of preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of onlookers are expected to show up Sunday to inspect the 
Wilkinsons' latest extravaganza, which includes about 70 Christmas trees, a 
sled with model reindeer, a miniature Ferris wheel, a miniature ski slope, a 
model train, a Nativity scene, dozens of model figures and 10,000 lights 
stretching from the front lawn to the roof of their home at 14371 Ramo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6 p.m. lighting also will feature carolers, a disc jockey and about a 
dozen children dressed as elves. 
</P>
<P>
 The event has proved so popular with residents in previous years that the city 
has rescheduled its own tree-lighting ceremony for Dec. 8 to avoid a conflict, 
said City Manager Gary Sloan. 
</P>
<P>
 A man dressed as Santa Claus will be stationed in the couple's garage nightly 
from Monday to Dec. 24 to pose for photographs with those who donate $5 to an 
organization that helps abused children. The Wilkinsons said they collected 
$5,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilkinsons have been decorating their home for 11 years and raising money 
for charity for the last eight years. The display will stand until Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't really care about each other, we would never make it through 
Christmas, because this is very, very stressful," Chris Wilkinson said. JOHN

THEATER REVIEW; MUSICAL 'RANSOM' HAS PAYOFF OF FAMILY FUN; IT'S FINE FARE FOR 
MELODRAMA FANS. BUT, THREE-HOUR LENGTH MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR KIDS. 
</P>

<P>
 It's two days before Christmas and Santa Claus' North Pole workshop is 
bustling even by Santa's two-days-before-Christmas standards. Three of the 
elves appear to be in some sort of romantic triangle -- that hussy Goldie 
trying to steal naive Stepp from his longtime fiancee, Patty -- and lead 
reindeer Rudolph is missing. Add a few songs, and this sounds like something 
that the Moorpark Melodrama might cook up -- and indeed it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by longtime Melodrama staffer Elaine Raleigh, who also directed, and 
her husband, Darren, "The Ransom of Rudolph" is specifically aimed at the 
Melodrama's audience, drawing from proven elements of past productions. At its 
packed day-after-Thanksgiving opening, the show drew the most consistently 
strong audience response heard in Moorpark in some time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Melodrama's holiday presentation brings in the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police to rescue Rudolph (Amy Mills) from kidnaper "Ugly Pierre" d'Escargot 
(Chris Carnicelli), a fur-trapper whose attitude is as bad as his French 
accent. The presence of Detective Inspector Lance Sterling (James MacDonald) 
allows a Nelson Eddy-Jeanette MacDonald parody, with Susan Burns returning 
Lance's Indian love calls as "Rosemarie MacDonald." 
</P>
<P>
 There are standard melodrama elements (with plenty to cheer for and boo at). 
Retired British Army officer Col. Saltlick (Bob Craig) is on hand, all too 
eager to share his reminiscences of helping to keep the Empire secure. The 
women include Sara Wilkey as Patty, Lucian Casselman as vampish Goldie, Linda 
Honeyman as dance-hall proprietress One-Eyed Sadie, and Amy Sullivan as Mrs. 
Claus. Sean Burns plays likable-but-dim elf Stepp; and rapping Latino reindeer 
Dancer and Prancer are both played by people named "Jason" -- Bishop and 
Rasmussen, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 As director, Raleigh keeps the show packed with amusing stage business, aided 
by Bonnie deGrood's choreography. And Mills is more physically expressive than 
anybody could expect from someone in a reindeer suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, the men's roles are broader -- and more amusingly played 
-- than the women's, but the only real weakness is in some voices' inability to 
reach the theater's back rows. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to recommend "The Ransom of Rudolph" for family audiences, but with 
one caveat: The show runs three hours even before the audience is asked to join 
in on "The Twelve Days of Christmas." And that's a pretty long time to expect a 
youngster's interest to keep up, no matter how colorful, tune-filled or funny a 
show may be. Details

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; POLICE CRACK DOWN ON THEFTS OF RECYCLABLES 
</P>

<P>
 Responding to citizen complaints, plainclothes police staked out several 
neighborhoods this week and cited seven people for scavenging through recycling 
bins. 
</P>
<P>
 The citations were part of an ongoing effort to curb the illegal practice.Each 
month, police typically issue between 70 and 80 citations. 
</P>
<P>
 James Kuhl, the city's recycling coordinator, said residents may become 
reluctant to recycle out of fear of the scavengers. Residents call to complain 
about the noise and mess, and say they are concerned that the intruders may 
actually be casing their property while searching for bottles and cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want people to stop recycling," Kuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
 His office routinely forwards five to 10 complaints a week to the police, who 
lie in wait for the scavengers and issue the misdemeanor citations, which carry 
a maximum penalty of a $500 fine and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the citations this week were issued in areas around downtown and 
central Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhl said the city collected 11,545 tons of glass, aluminum, plastic and 
newspaper in the first 10 months of the year, along with 37,389 gallons of 
motor oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The recycled materials are sold in the United States and abroad and have 
fostered the growth of local industries that process the materials, he said. In 
the past year, a number of companies that recycle residential waste have been 
founded in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's collection program is subsidized primarily by residents' fees. TY

COVER STORY; OVER A BARREL; OIL-DRILLING DAYS MAY BE NUMBERED ON ARTIFICIAL 
ISLANDS OFF LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Palms and banana trees rustling in the ocean breeze. Hibiscus and impatiens in 
bloom. White water tumbling into the sea. It's a perfect little tropical island 
-- in the middle of Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But step off the boat and you see that it's all a facade, propped up with 
struts and cable, like the television set of "Gilligan's Island." 
</P>
<P>
 This granite atoll -- one of four in the harbor -- isn't graced with grass 
shacks, it's gridlocked with pipelines and storage vats. Inside the fringe of 
palm trees, men and women in hard hats scoot around on forklifts or lug heavy 
pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone flips a switch and the waterfall dribbles to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The real reason for all of the hardware on Grissom, as this island is called, 
can be observed off to the edge, where a technician in a trailer studies a 
video monitor. The picture, supplied by a tiny television camera 5,200 feet 
beneath the surface, shows shiny black globules, clustering like grapes, 
skittering along the rim of a pipe toward the surface in an odd, bouncy motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil has been a part of Long Beach for more than 70 years -- a get-rich-quick 
medium, then a source of urban blight as messy oil derricks proliferated and a 
large swatch of Long Beach real estate began to sink alarmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost 800 million barrels later, it's a mostly clean, smooth-running 
operation on four "tropical" islands and a mainland platform, using a motivated 
crew of 200 ("Where else can you work on an island in the Pacific and go home 
at night?" said one engineer) and all the smart drilling technology. 
</P>
<P>
 But its days appear to be numbered. The so-called Long Beach unit, stretching 
from downtown Long Beach out into the harbor, was producing about 150,000 
barrels of oil a day in the 1960s. Now it turns out a lean 47,000 barrels with 
a host of new mining techniques to scour each nook and cranny for undiscovered 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still a lot of the black stuff down there, experts say, but some oil 
companies are thinking about the day they pack it in. Some already have. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, three companies looked at the balance sheet in Long Beach and 
decided they weren't going to pay any more royalties to the city's 13,000 
"townlotters," the individuals who own the mineral rights to the real estate 
properties sitting on top of a small portion of the oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was inevitable that there would come a time when the working interest 
owners (the oil companies) would start losing money," said Arco official Steve 
Freeman. "We're at that point now." 
</P>
<P>
 As lessors of the mineral rights, the oil companies, which have been paying as 
much as 49% of the profits to the townlotters, always had the prerogative to 
pull out when profits got skimpy. It was written into their leases, oil company 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco, owner of THUMS Long Beach Co., which manages the oil field, will 
continue to be involved in the production part of the business. But Phillips 
Petroleum will stay only as a minor investor, and Chevron is pulling out 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement sent the townlotters, most of them heirs and small investors 
who had been reaping an average of $350 a year, scrambling to their 
calculators. Starting this month, if the townlotters -- about 13,000 of them -- 
want to hold onto their claims, they'll have to ante up a proportionate share 
of the oil field's operating costs, just like any other investor hoping for 
profits. The townlotters' share of the operating costs would average about $92 
a year, according to oil company officials.  
</P>
<P>
 The so-called townlot, the portion of the oil field that lies under the city, 
represents about 8% of the Long Beach unit.  
</P>
<P>
 If townlotters stick around until the operation closes down, they'll have to 
bear a share of the multimillion-dollar shutdown costs, according to the terms 
of the lease agreements with the oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer you stay in, the more exposed you are to having to help pay for 
the abandonment of the field," said Mel Wright, whose wife, Jonine, shares the 
mineral rights to a small piece of property in the Belmont Shore area. "Every 
day that goes by, it gets a little closer." The alternative is to sell to other 
investors or just abandon their claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma of the townlotters highlights a $64,000 question being asked by 
everybody with a stake in the unique urban oil field, which is still studied by 
visiting oil technicians from around the world: How long can it continue to 
produce oil profitably? 
</P>
<P>
 Xenophon C. Colazas, the city's director of oil properties, thinks there are 
more than 10 good years left. "That's my opinion, of course," says Colazas, a 
petroleum engineer who has worked in the Long Beach unit for 34 years. "It all 
depends on economics." 
</P>
<P>
 One part of economics is the price of oil, which has been holding at a modest 
$13.50 a barrel for several months, but which dipped to a measly $8.50 last 
December. In 1990, as Iraq invaded Kuwait, Long Beach oil brought $24 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it goes the way it did in December," says Wright, a former oil company 
executive who works as a petroleum consultant, "they'll have to abandon the 
field. This is a business. People are in it to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, THUMS (an acronym for Texaco, Humble, Union, Mobil and Shell, 
the five companies that combined in 1964 to bid on leasing the field) continues 
to put money into the oil islands in an effort to sop up every sticky drop of 
crude down there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, for example, the company has begun using sophisticated 
drilling bits that can cut sideways into once-inaccessible pockets of oil. 
Technicians are using new solvents that dissolve crusty asphalts to free the 
flow of crude and are employing computer programs that monitor flows and 
pressure buildups in the wells. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these, along with an aggressive drilling program, increased 
productivity last year by 2,500 barrels a day, from about 44,500, THUMS 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Area supervisor Chris Hartman stands over a computer monitor in a little 
office and scans a graphic showing water pressure and production rates for the 
more than 300 wells on Grissom. (The islands are named for four astronauts who 
died in accidents in 1967, three in the notorious launch-pad fire of that year, 
including Virgil I. (Gus) Grissom.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have to go with a pressure gauge from well to well and write the 
data down by hand," Hartman says. "This frees you up to do something more 
productive." 
</P>
<P>
 But all the new techniques and equipment can't get around the increasingly 
watery mix that the wells are producing from the aging field. 
</P>
<P>
 When drill bits first cut into the Long Beach unit in 1965, THUMS wells 
brought up a rich, sludgy brew that was only 20% water. Lately, wells on the 
oil islands have been bringing up a thin gruel that is more than 92% water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water cut increases as the field gets older," Colazas says. 
</P>
<P>
 More water means more processing -- and higher power bills for a company that 
already spends more than $22 million a year for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The oil business has been very good to Long Beach, which technically owns the 
Long Beach unit, and to the state of California. City officials estimate that 
Long Beach has pulled in $433 million in revenue from the field in the past 55 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the city's profit, however, came before 1964, when the state 
Legislature, asserting that the city is only the state's trustee rather than 
sole beneficiary of the field, enacted legislation giving the state the lion's 
share of oil revenues. An earlier bill, using the same rationale, had allowed 
the state to seize $122 million in accumulated oil revenues from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1964, the state has drawn an estimated $4.3 billion from the Long Beach 
unit; the city has earned a relatively modest $246 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the city expects to get $1 million in tidelands oil revenues, plus 
about $3 million in interest from a fund set up to pay to prevent land above 
the field from sinking, an occurrence known as subsidence. The state stands to 
earn $41 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still remnants of the early oil business around town, but long gone 
are the black gushers, drilling towers and brawling roughnecks of the 1920s and 
1930s. Nowadays, the city's oil business apart from the Long Beach unit 
consists of a few fields around the city, such as those near Signal Hill, with 
seesawing oil pumps called rocking horses. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1921, an 80-foot-high black geyser, which took four days to cap, 
marked the first productive oil well in the city. By 1924, Signal Hill (which 
incorporated as a separate city that year) sported a Sherwood Forest of 
derricks, with enormous Erector Set towers bristling across the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first oil from the lucrative Wilmington field, which stretches from 
Wilmington to Seal Beach, wasn't drawn until 1939, when a wildcatter touched 
off a gusher on the west side of town, near the present Pacific Coast Highway. 
It was soon clear that this was a monumental field -- the third largest in the 
United States -- and that its richest part was under Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As rig operators rushed to exploit the field, however, the spongy layers of 
shale and sandstone on which Long Beach was built began to sink. By the late 
1950s, a bowl-like cavity, 29 feet deep at its lowest point, had appeared 
around Terminal Island in the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings cracked, subterranean pipelines snapped and railroad tracks twisted 
like paper clips. Removal of the oil was undermining the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists proposed injecting water into the subterranean cavities. An 
intensive program of injection quickly solved the problem, stabilizing the 
ground and, in some cases, raising it a few inches. Independent operators who 
had resisted the program, thinking it would dilute their returns, found that 
injection often loosened hard-to-retrieve seams of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other cities, Long Beach had resisted offshore drilling for aesthetic 
reasons. But in 1962, voters approved a highly restrictive drilling referendum 
to exploit the rich deposits under the harbor. The referendum permitted 
offshore drilling as long as it was done from a series of small islands, 
landscaped to "blend with the shoreline and add to the natural beauty of the 
offshore area." 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a Southern California solution to a messy problem. THUMS built 
an "ersatz archipelago," as one writer described the islands, complete with 
Tahitian-looking panels to muffle machine noise and pastel-paneled "condos" to 
disguise drilling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing the number of people who ask how they can stay in those hotels 
out there," says William Guerard, oil and gas supervisor for the state 
Department of Conservation and a former field inspector in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their unusual appearance aside, the islands were monumental engineering 
achievements. More than 640,000 tons of rock was barged in from Catalina Island 
to form outer rims, and 3.6 million cubic yards of sand was dredged up to fill 
the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1965, 1,305 offshore wells have been drilled, about a quarter of them 
injection wells to prevent subsidence. Oil, water and gas are separated in huge 
vats, then the petroleum products are funneled into a network of 140,000 feet 
of steel pipeline that carries them to mainland refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is filtered to remove minerals and bacteria that might gunk up the 
drilling equipment, and reinjected. 
</P>
<P>
 THUMS' engineers, geologists, riggers and roustabouts are ferried from a dock 
near the Queen Mary to their stations on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind one of those condo facades one recent day, workers guided 90-foot 
lengths of steel pipe, dangling from a winch, through a rotating platform. 
Thousands of feet below, a bit was drilling into the shale beneath the harbor, 
edging toward an untapped pocket of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's deceptively quiet," said Stephen J. Marsh, THUMS' community relations 
director. "Everything's two miles into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Other workers studied control panels, repaired equipment or tended to the 
island's tropical foliage. Working on an island becomes just part of the 
routine after a while, THUMS workers say.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's just one difference," said Terry Barber, production engineer on 
Grissom. "That old saying, 'If you miss the boat, you're in trouble,' is 
literally true here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company's 60-foot crew boat runs once an hour, except in bad weather, 
during which it has been known to shut down altogether. Veteran THUMS employees 
still reminisce about the storm of March, 1983, when waves rolled over the 
southernmost island and a handful of workers remained stranded overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 THUMS officials claim they run a squeaky-clean operation, with no oil or 
chemical spills. But some environmentalists think it may be too clean. 
</P>
<P>
 There is "circumstantial evidence" that detergents used to clean up minor oil 
leaks on the islands have been washing into the ocean and killing fish and 
other forms of life in the surrounding water, says Rimmon C. Fay, a marine 
biologist and longtime authority on marine life in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few miles away, in Alamitos Bay, there's an extraordinary diversity of 
marine life," Fay says. "Look around the oil islands, and it's just not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Oil investors worry about the costs of environmental requirements. When 
drilling operations stop, state conservation official Guerard says, the 
operators will be required to insert a series of cement plugs, to fill pipe 
casings with a kind of heavy mud used to lubricate drills and, finally, to weld 
steel caps over the mouth of the wells. 
</P>
<P>
 After equipment is dismantled, the asphalt covering will have to be peeled 
away and, if there's any oil in the island cores, the sand will have to be dug 
out and transported to landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost for all this: $145 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And long after drilling is shut down, Colazas adds, the city will have to 
monitor ground levels to ensure that subsidence does not begin again. 
</P>
<P>
 And then? Presumably the islands become city parks, says Ralph S. Cryder, 
parks and recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no task force planning for conversion of the islands, Cryder 
adds. "When we find out when they're going to cap all those things, we'll get 
busy and talk about it." The $64,000 question being asked by everybody with a 
stake in the unique urban oil field -- studied by visiting oil technicians from 
around the world -- is: How long can it continue to produce oil profitably?

CENTERPIECE: PROTECTED FOREVER; THE SESPE WILDERNESS IS A VAST SWEEP OF HILLS, 
MOUNTAINS, MEADOWS, GORGES AND THE HOTTEST NATURAL SPRING IN THE SOUTHLAND. 
</P>

<P>
 Angry storm clouds nip at distant peaks as an expedition embarks on a 
three-day journey into the dark regions of Los Padres National Forest. The 
mission: Explore the newly protected Sespe Wilderness, that mountainous, 
220,500-acre province occupying a large chunk of the national forest and most 
of northern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by a savvy professional guide, a procession of five horseback riders and 
three pack mules leaves Lion Campground on a seldom-used trail. Cork-screwing 
upward around steep, slate-colored mountains, they ride for several hours 
before piercing through the clouds on Topatopa Ridge, one of the highest spots 
in the county and a panoramic vantage point from which to view the enormity of 
the Sespe Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 On the lip of a thousand-foot cliff above Bear Canyon, they see nothing but 
untouched, unrelenting wilderness all the way to the horizon. Rippled, barren 
mountain tops preside over pine-studded hills and flinty gorges. Earth-tone 
canyons choked with chaparral yield to meadows carpeted in wild oats. And far 
below, as the sun emerges and paints shadows on canyon walls, Sespe Creek 
sparkles, a silver strand weaving through the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Sespe Wilderness, much of it unchanged since the first Chumash hunted 
and worshiped here several thousand years ago. Unlike much of California, it 
will never be paved and gouged and exploited; the 1992 Los Padres Wilderness 
Act forever protects the land from development and mechanized invasion. It also 
precludes dams along the 31 1/2 miles of Sespe Creek that curl through the 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County now boasts not only Southern California's last free-flowing 
river, Sespe Creek, but also the largest federal wilderness area from here to 
the Mexican border. (Compared to the Sespe, Los Angeles County's biggest 
wilderness is puny: 31,500 acres.) Covering an eighth of the 1.7-million-acre 
national forest, which runs from Ojai to Big Sur, the Sespe Wilderness is a 
whopping 18% of the county's land mass -- as immense as the area stretching 
from the Ventura Pier to Westlake in length and from Moorpark to the ocean in 
width. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, these 220,500 acres of scenic real estate managed to escape the 
ruthless march of suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really surprised it lasted so long," said Greg Kouns, one of two seasonal 
wilderness rangers assigned to the Sespe by the U.S. Forest Service's Ojai 
District. Kouns, who spends several days a week backpacking through the area, 
marveled at its size: "I look out and as far as the eye can see is wilderness. 
. . . It boggles my mind." THE FIGHT FOR THE SESPE 
</P>
<P>
 The preservation of the Sespe did not come without a fight. Environmental 
activists battled two forces: recreational users, motorcyclists, mountain 
bikers, RV enthusiasts, who wanted to maintain open access; and water 
interests, which wanted to keep Sespe Creek available for dams. When President 
Bush signed the law, which also set aside other large areas in the Los Padres, 
he said the government was furthering "the protection of unique and sensitive 
lands." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, the Sespe is slowly but surely shedding all reminders of 
human contact. Rutted fire roads that once carried off-road vehicles and even 
motor homes deep into the outback are being reclaimed by vegetation. Graffiti, 
old tires, rusted beer cans and other junk are being removed. The land is 
healing, but problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rugged, wonderful country," said Kouns, "but as wilderness, it has a 
long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service's goal of educating the public about the wilderness has 
been slowed by the agency's snail-pace bureaucracy. Maps delineating the area 
still have not been issued; trail-head signs at wilderness borders only began 
going up last spring, and many more signs are required. Even more urgently 
needed, said Kouns, are educational kiosks in Rose Valley listing not only the 
rules of the wilderness but also "the ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent to the wilderness area and right off California 33, Rose Valley is 
the county's inland camping hub -- and also a springboard for vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, the main source of trouble comes from Lion 
Campground on Sespe Creek, a summer weekend hangout for gang members. Last 
year, a new wooden sign dedicating a national trail was used for a bonfire at 
the campground. From now on, said Kouns, the Forest Service will be making as 
many of the Sespe Wilderness signs as possible from boilerplate. 
</P>
<P>
 Desecration of the wilderness by vandals doesn't extend very far into the 
Sespe. "Once you get five or six miles into the wilderness, you don't see any 
vandalism," said Kouns. 
</P>
<P>
 The wilderness discourages hooligans and slackers. Deep in the wilderness 
there are more encounters with slippery creek crossings, grinding uphill 
switchbacks and perilous trails. Easy routes that begin as wide fire roads 
usually disappear later up the trail, swallowed by dense brush. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sespe can also get ugly. A 70-degree morning in Rose Valley can turn into 
a frozen night below Topatopa Ridge. A blazing summer sun can disorient even an 
experienced hiker. And a strong winter rain can enrage Sespe Creek; its floods 
can cut off trails, swamp campsites along Sespe Gorge and strand visitors. 
Landslides are common -- one of them buried a half-mile section of Sespe Trail 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ban on mechanized vehicles effectively sealing the Sespe from massive 
waves of party animals, its remote interior is virtually inaccessible now to 
all but skilled backpackers and intrepid horsemen. Which is the way it should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need knowledge to go in there," Kouns said, "and it takes judgment to 
get out. The best way to learn is to go with someone who knows what they're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone like Tony Alvis. THE THRILL OF THE TRAIL 
</P>
<P>
 A tall, bearded mountain man who loves the land, Alvis is the only licensed 
guide in the Los Padres. Specializing in the Sespe, Alvis, 43, makes a living 
taking city slickers on safaris -- from one day to one week. He provides 
horses, food, expertise, information, leather chaps, toilet paper -- even 
cowboy hats because "they look good in photos." 
</P>
<P>
 What he doesn't provide is the mental and physical toughness required to 
penetrate the savage heart of the Sespe Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned by Life magazine to guide a reporter and photographer inside the 
Sespe, Alvis took to calling them "Lewis and Clark," although "Beavis and 
Butt-head" might have been more appropriate. Even though both were veteran 
hikers familiar with parts of the Sespe, they were caught by surprise by the 
spectacular roller-coaster terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 They often felt like a high-wire act, suffering heart palpitations whenever 
their horses tip-toed along the narrow, unstable ledges floating high above 
canyon floors; especially after dark, when only the horses could see the trail. 
Alvis' warning -- "If your horse falls, jump off to the high side" -- had 
become their mantra, keeping them in a constant state of anxious readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trip that included the writer and photographer of this story; Chang 
Liampetchakul, owner of Tipps Thai Cuisine in Ventura who was conscripted by 
Alvis to cook, and Ventura welder Mike Hauber, an experienced horseman Alvis 
drafted as a wrangler, Alvis addressed the expedition. He told them the journey 
would be hard, and he conveyed the feeling that he didn't like whiners. He told 
them the trails would be dangerous in places, so stay alert. But he reassured 
them that in more than 20 years as a guide, he had never lost a customer or a 
horse. THE DEATH OF THE GRIZZLY 
</P>
<P>
 The Sespe has stayed intact because it is just too hostile to be tamed. 
Although the Chumash took advantage of the area's abundant game and spiritual 
essence, they couldn't abide the mean mountains and harsh winters and chose not 
to live there permanently. The Spanish, too, apparently, had no interest in 
settling the back country. So after the United States took over California in 
1849, the Sespe, still unclaimed, was declared public land. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decades of the 19th Century, only a few brave homesteaders were 
able to survive the Sespe. These who did, raising cattle, farming and relying 
on their wits, were colorful characters like Ramon Ortega, a famed bear-hunter 
who caught his prey with a lariat; fugitive and killer Jeff Howard, who farmed 
the Sespe when he wasn't hiding out there, and William (Old Man) Mutau, a horse 
thief who settled what is now Mutau Flats. 
</P>
<P>
 By the turn of the century, most of the Sespe had been incorporated into a 
federal reserve that in 1938 would become the Los Padres National Forest. But 
until the 1992 law, the Sespe was always vulnerable to development, oil 
exploration, mining, logging and assault from motorized vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point probably occurred in the '30s, when a planned road that 
would have bisected the wilderness was shelved in favor of building California 
Highway 33 several miles beyond the wilderness' western border. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the turn of the century, the crystal-clear water of Sespe Creek 
teemed with speckled trout. Bear, deer, mountain lion, fox, quail, wild turkey 
and big horn sheep thrived in the wilderness, but the California condor, never 
numerous, was beginning its short flight to near extinction -- shot down as a 
nuisance by local farmers and cattlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 That endangered bird, of course, was briefly a resident of the Sespe Condor 
Sanctuary, a 53,000-acre preserve in the southeast corner of Sespe Wilderness. 
But three of the 13 giant vultures released into the sanctuary were killed in 
accidents involving power poles on the fringes of civilization, so the 
remaining condors were moved this year to a more remote sanctuary in Santa 
Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Sespe was revered for its wildlife, it was feared as the 'hood of 
Ursus arctos horribilis , the mighty grizzly. The creatures, which averaged 
eight feet in height and weighed nearly 800 pounds, were plentiful until the 
1870s, killing and maiming settlers and livestock and producing the legend of 
"Old Clubfoot," probably a mythical monster. Hunted relentlessly and 
accidentally poisoned by strychnine used in gold mining, grizzlies were last 
seen in the Sespe in 1913; since 1922, grizzlies have been extinct in 
California. THE NAMES IN THE TUNNEL 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller black bears, however, now rule the area, but Alvis isn't worried about 
them, his 3-year-old Australian shepherd being a reliable bear alarm. No, Alvis 
fears yellow jackets and rattlesnakes making sudden appearances and spooking 
the horses. And he fears ticks, ubiquitous specks of flesh-boring parasite that 
drop from overhanging limbs and blow through the air likes motes of dust. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ride across Topatopa Ridge, Alvis points out the recent trail-gashing 
tire tracks of a mountain bike. "Cyclists are nice people but they don't 
understand the consequences of what their tires are doing to the trail," Alvis 
said. While horses and hikers tamp down trails, mountain bikes can leave 
grooves that cause trails to wash out during rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvis decides to camp at Lady Bug, three miles down the Red Reef Trail, 
through a zone marked by mauve sandstone hills resembling giant dunes, past a 
dove resting atop a lonesome pine like "a Christmas ornament." 
</P>
<P>
 Night comes quickly in the Sespe, bringing a wet chill on the westerly wind. 
After a rough two-hour ride, the expedition arrives at Lady Bug in darkness. A 
fire warms them, and a heavy dinner of barbecued shrimp, steak burritos and 
pumpkin pie sedates them into slumber. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the sun doesn't make a direct hit on Red Reef Canyon until four 
or five hours after dawn. The campsite, which is in a thickly wooded glen by a 
stream, is bone-numbing damp. The storm that passed through the day before 
brought no rain but did drop temperatures enough to freeze canteen water. 
Still, a breakfast of eggs, bacon and biscuits, all pan-fried in bacon fat, 
adds a few ounces of insulation to the shivering bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Creature report: no bears, although their scat was found not far from camp; no 
yellow jackets or snakes; no lady bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 After breaking camp at Lady Bug, the expedition continues on the Red Reef 
Trail. Finally emerging from the shadows, they round a mountain and behold a 
stunning vista, different from anything they've seen: crumpled brown hills and 
vertical slabs of stratified red sandstone kneeling below the rose-tinted 
Topatopas. "It's like riding into a dream," Alvis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail leads once again to the canyon stream, where they must walk their 
horses around boulders and through a short, nine-foot-high tunnel. Chiseled on 
the tunnel wall are the names T.J. Harris and R.J. Harris and the date 1904. 
Alvis said they were brothers who made the trail possible by blasting through 
the sandstone -- and leaving behind the only graffiti the expedition would 
discover in the Sespe. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon the band is down from the mountains and at the confluence of the Red 
Reef and Sespe trails. They take Sespe Trail east, crossing Sespe Creek on a 
natural rock bridge. Tall cottonwoods line the banks, their yellow leaves 
tumbling to the ground in a light breeze. Despite little rainfall since last 
spring, Sespe Creek still hurries along, reaching depths of three feet at some 
crossings. For now, it behaves, staying within its main channel, but debris 12 
feet up in the trees testifies to the river's violent potential. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sandy banks of the Sespe, the trail suddenly vanishes. Alvis stops the 
procession and pushes through tangled underbrush until he finds his way. Trail 
maintenance, always problematic for the Forest Service, has become even more so 
with the Wilderness Act. The ban on motorized equipment includes chain saws; 
only hand tools can be used in the Sespe, making maintenance work long and 
difficult. THE CARESS TO THE FLESH 
</P>
<P>
 After setting up a base camp in a small canyon, Alvis takes the reporter and 
photographer on a punishing 2 1/2-hour ride to Sespe Hot Springs. One of the 
wonders of the wilderness, it is the hottest natural spring in Southern 
California, with 180-degree sulfur-heavy water at the source. It feeds a 
terraced stream that cascades downhill across granite for about two miles and 
flows into Sespe Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvis dips a finger into a shallow pool, a quarter of a mile downstream from 
the source, where the water caresses rather than melts flesh. The bone-weary 
riders spend the next 30 or 40 minutes soaking in the pure, therapeutic liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place, " Alvis said, sitting cross-legged in the stream, with Johnson 
Ridge towering above him, "keeps getting better and better." THE SONG OF THE 
POET 
</P>
<P>
 Three days, even on horseback, is in no way long enough to make contact with 
the entire wilderness -- it takes almost two days in a car to drive around the 
perimeter -- but members of the expedition are able to get a sense of the 
Sespe. As they make the long ride back to Lion Campground, they take with them 
the same wonderment that must have inspired Frank D. Felt, a homesteader known 
as "The Sage of the Sespe," to write: 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 'tis sunset in the Sespe , 
</P>
<P>
 and the day is nearly done.  
</P>
<P>
 Sands are sifting through the  
</P>
<P>
 hourglass,  
</P>
<P>
 each grain drops one by one.  
</P>
<P>
 And streams of flaming tinsel  
</P>
<P>
 add their mystery to the skies,  
</P>
<P>
 As fantastic colored billions  
</P>
<P>
 march before my wistful eyes. Sespe Wilderness Area 
</P>
<P>
 * Sespe Wilderness covers 220,500 acres, or about 18% of Ventura County's 
total land area. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Bush signed into law the protection of the Sespe and other large 
areas in the Los Padres National Forest on June 19, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Sespe has 200 miles of trails. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relatively speaking, the Sespe is dwarfed by the nation's largest wilderness 
area, the Frank Church River of No Return in Idaho, with 2.4 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
 * Each year, about 570,000 cubic yards of sand are washed down Sespe Creek to 
the beaches in Ventura.

<P>
 You can see what man has made from an automobile, but the only way to see what 
God has made is from the back of a horse.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Charles M. Russell 
</P>
<P>
 That quote by the late Western artist appears in the brochure for Los Padres 
Wilderness Outfitters, and neatly sums up Tony Alvis' attitude about the great 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvis, who is Los Padres Wilderness Outfitters, guides adventurous green horns 
into Ventura County backcountry. In fact, he's the county's only local packer 
making horseback trips into Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Conchita-based Alvis supplies provisions and horses. Day trips, 
including barbecued lunch, cost $125 per person. A three-day camping trip with 
meals is $325. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvis has taken as many as 20 riders on a trip, but he prefers smaller groups. 
Riding experience is preferred but not required. Riders over 200 pounds may not 
be approved by Alvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack trips will begin again in the spring. Information: 648-2113. JEFF MEYERS

 REMATCH 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada had little trouble defeating Duarte for the second time in its 56-12 
victory Friday night at home. The Southern Section Division VIII quarterfinal 
playoff game was a rematch of a nonleague game won by La Mirada, 48-6, in the 
third week of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate to play a team you've blown out already a second time," La Mirada 
Coach John Mele said about Duarte (6-5-1), which came into the game riding a 
five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the other team has the advantage because it fires their kids up." 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the case Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada (12-0) scored 22 consecutive second-quarter points to open a 29-12 
halftime lead. Mike Palumbo passed for three touchdowns, including two to Wyatt 
Boatright. Running backs Hugo Corral and Damon Cox also scored two touchdowns 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded La Mirada turns its attention to another familiar opponent, Notre 
Vista, in a semifinal game Friday at Valley View High. Norte Vista (8-4) 
knocked the Matadores out of the playoffs with a 25-20 first-round victory last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norte Vista is playing well but when you get this far, you're going to play a 
good team no matter who you play," Mele said. "Some of our kids are back and 
remember that loss." BETTER LUCK NEXT YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Jordan won its first playoff game since 1947 with its victory over 
Crespi in the first round. But the Panthers will have to wait until next season 
to win another postseason game after a 35-8 defeat to Trabuco Hills in a 
Division I quarterfinal game Friday at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are never satisfied until you get the big prize, a (Southern Section) 
title," Jordan Coach Mike Ono said. "But when you sit down and evaluate it, we 
have never gone to this level." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also been a long time since Jordan, which won a share of its first Moore 
League title since 1990, played past Thanksgiving. Two Jordan players missed 
the game because of holiday vacations and eight showed up late for the team's 
pregame meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmad Jackson rushed for 100 yards in 14 carries and LeJuan Gibbons had 91 
yards in nine carries for Jordan (8-4), which had 390 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers failed to score three times inside the Mustangs' 10 yard line. 
Jordan had four turnovers, including three fumbles, and was penalized 11 times 
for 126 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (10-2) built a 35-0 lead before Jordan scored on a 44-yard pass 
from Ortege Jenkins to Joe Hughes with 4 minutes, 27 seconds to play. The 
players also connected on the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one expected to go past Thanksgiving. It's a new thing for us," Ono said. 
"We weren't mentally prepared and had some mental breakdowns." CHANCES WERE 
HURT 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello quarterback Fred Montiel did not play in the Oilers' 31-14 loss to 
Ayala Friday night in a Division III playoff game. The senior, who also plays 
outside linebacker and punts, injured his knee in Montebello's first-round 
victory over Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello Coach Doug Rihn doesn't know if the presence of Montiel, the Almont 
League's Most Valuable Player, would have made a difference against 
fourth-seeded Ayala (11-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have made the game closer if we executed in some situations," Rihn 
said. "We would have had to play a flawless game without turning the ball over 
once to have any chance to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello (10-2) had four turnovers Friday night. Junior Jonathan Sandoval, 
playing in place of Montiel, completed 13 of 24 passes for 115 yards and a 
touchdown. Adolph Esqueda had six catches for 56 yards and Ulises Rios, who 
rushed for 43 yards in nine carries, had four receptions for 44 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jonathan did a really good job under the circumstances," Rihn said. "We saw 
Ayala play earlier in the year and we thought, 'We don't want to play them down 
the road.' They have a good chance to win it all." RUNNING UP THE SCORE 
</P>
<P>
 Artesia quarterback Jua Jackson rushed for 180 yards and three touchdowns in 
10 carries against Bloomington on Friday night. He also completed eight of 19 
passes for 207 yards and two touchdowns as the Pioneers piled up 556 yards and 
62 points in the Division VIII quarterfinal game at Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Artesia, though, still lost, 82-62. The Pioneers (9-3) set a state record for 
most points scored by a losing team, breaking the old record of 49 points by 
San Pasqual of Escondido in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The 144 combined points is the most for a California high school 11-man game. 
The old record was 141 set in 1924 by Santa Rosa and St. Helena in a game Santa 
Rosa won, 141-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for 1,106 yards and scored on 11 consecutive possessions in 
the second half after Bloomington (12-0) opened a 44-16 halftime lead. WET AND 
WILD 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Wilson water polo team won its first Southern Section title 
since 1981, defeating top-seeded Corona del Mar, 10-9, in the Division I final 
at Belmont Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied nine times, but Keith Feldman's second goal of the match 
gave the third-seeded Bruins a 10-9 lead with five minutes to play. The teams 
split four previous matches and three of the games were decided by a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Cochran scored three goals and Adam Wright had three goals and four 
assists. Matt Armato also had six steals for Wilson (24-4). RUNAWAYS 
</P>
<P>
 LaKeisha Backus of Long Beach Wilson and Michael Granville of Bell Gardens 
High have been selected to the Track & Field News magazine high school 
All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
 Backus, the state 200-meter champion, ran 23.21 seconds in the event for the 
nation's fastest high school mark. She also finished second in the World Junior 
championships in Lisbon, Portugal, in a wind-aided 22.86 -- the fourth fastest 
time by a high school runner under any conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson 400-meter relay team of Backus, Kinshasha Davis, Michelle Nelson 
and Mary Harris also were selected to the All-American team. The four, who 
timed a season-best 46.15, combined to win the event at the state meet in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville was selected to the All-American team in the 800 meters. He led the 
nation with a sophomore record 1:48.98. Granville also won the event at the 
state meet to become Bell Gardens' first state champion in any sport. BEACH 
FRONT 
</P>
<P>
 Nichelle Burton and Brian Gimmillaro of Cal State Long Beach have been chosen 
as Big West Conference player and coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, a 5-foot-10 senior outside hitter, averaged 4.45 kills a game, third 
best in the conference. She was also seventh in hitting percentage at .334 and 
fifth in digs with 336. 
</P>
<P>
 Gimmillaro, who has a record of 268-77 in 10 seasons and led Long Beach (25-5) 
to its fourth consecutive conference title, was selected as coach of the year 
for the third time in four seasons. KIRBY LEE

REEL LIFE; MORE MOVIE SCREENS POPPING UP ACROSS COUNTY; EDWARDS, UNITED ARTISTS 
AND WALLACE ARE UNVEILING OR PLANNING THEATERS IN THOUSAND OAKS, CAMARILLO AND 
SANTA PAULA.

 Although Santa Paula filmgoers have to wait a little longer for their new 
cinema to open, the long-promised theater boom is starting to roar across the 
county. United Artists reopened its renovated six-screen theater at The Oaks 
mall in Thousand Oaks two weeks ago and Edwards Cinemas will cut the ribbon on 
its new Camarillo Movie Palace early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got new carpets, new sound and nice new seats with those funky little 
cup holder armrests too," said Bill Quigley, vice president of United Artists 
Theaters, who spoke by phone from corporate offices in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Quigley said construction is going ahead on another UA theater complex in 
Ventura, an 11-screen movie house on Camarillo's east side near the 
intersection of Camino Ruiz and Adolfo Road. That one is slated to open in the 
spring. When it does, UA will be competing head to head with Edwards for the 
lucrative summer box office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, though, Edwards has the holiday season -- the second biggest 
next to summer -- all to itself. The 56,000-foot cinema will have wall-to-wall 
screens in all 12 of its theaters. The more modest 16,000-square-foot movie 
house originally slated to open this month in Santa Paula will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad weather delayed the construction," said Brett Havlik, general manager of 
Wallace Theater Corp., the Honolulu-based company that will operate the 
seven-screen theater in Santa Paula. "We're going to miss the holiday season, 
but we didn't want to rush it and have a bad opening for the residents of Santa 
Paula."

 Early sign-ups are being accepted for a seminar offered by the Ojai Film 
Society to study screenwriting with a well-known writing teacher. Katherine Ann 
Jones, an award-winning actress and writer, will lead a two-day intensive film 
and TV writing workshop on Jan. 14 and 15 at the Ojai Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The hands-on course, aimed at beginning and advanced writers, will cover such 
topics as how to choose a good story for a film or TV show, screenplay 
structure, plot and character development, constructing good dialogue, possible 
sources for stories, adapting from one medium to another and how to sell your 
screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Clips from well-known films will be used to illustrate specific points, and 
frequent round-table discussions will provide the student with feedback from 
the teacher and participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, an Ojai resident, is on the faculty of the USC Cinema and Television 
School, where she teaches advanced screenwriting for graduate students. The 
course costs $125 for those signing up before Dec. 15, and $150 after that 
date. Classes fill quickly. For more information call 646-8946.

PEOPLE: VETERAN OF SOUTH GATE'S WAR ON GRAFFITI FINDS HIS REWARD IN 'NICE, 
CLEAN' WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the advance guard of South Gate's 3-year-old war on graffiti, you'll find 
veteran "hydroblaster" and paint expert George Alcantar. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the city's orange-shirted Parks and Recreation anti-graffiti 
squad, Alcantar spends 10 hours a day, four days a week scrubbing tagger 
signatures and indecipherable scribbles off walls and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really rewarding work, especially when you drive past a nice, clean 
wall," Alcantar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people take it for granted that South Gate has some of the cleanest 
walls around, but we don't. We get out there and fight what taggers and 
gangbangers leave behind all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcantar and about 30 other South Gate residents, business owners and city 
employees have been honored for their participation in what is affectionately 
known as the city's WOG, or War on Graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the fighting is quite literal, said Alcantar, who recalled the time 
he and a partner spotted a dozen gang members spraying an MTA bus with tags -- 
the arcane, individual signatures left by thousands of city youths almost 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After Alcantar confronted the youths, they turned on him and surrounded the 
city pickup truck in which he and his partner were riding.  
</P>
<P>
 "They circled around us and started shaking the truck," said Alcantar, now 
laughing off the incident as just another facet of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcantar called police for help and six of the taggers were arrested, leaving 
Alcantar with a war story and the duty of clearing the bus of the signatures 
left behind. He said the most common methods of ridding surfaces of graffiti 
are "hydroblasting" -- which involves shooting a high-density spray of water 
and sand -- and simple paint removal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1991 at the urging of city residents shocked by an upsurge in 
graffiti activity, WOG emphasizes cooperation between the community and city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we started the WOG, there wasn't a building on Tweedy Boulevard that 
wasn't full of tags," said Police Chief Ron George in a speech detailing the 
history of the anti-graffiti program. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual residents and business owners are urged to "adopt a block" of 
property and either rid it of graffiti themselves or donate money and materials 
to the city so employees such as Alcantar can take care of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were doing research for what kind of program South Gate needed, we 
found that in most places the total responsibility for graffiti removal was 
placed on the city," George said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with $250,000 of city money being used to combat graffiti, combined with 
the efforts of individuals and business owners, city residents say South Gate 
has some of the cleanest walls in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Graffiti used to be our biggest problem," said Ana Pena, who manages a 
13-unit apartment complex. "But this program has cleaned things up a lot, made 
it a lot easier for us to keep our property looking attractive. Now we worry 
more about tenants who just don't pay their rent." 
</P>

 The League of United Latin American Citizens has honored several Southeast Los 
Angeles residents for community service. They are Jenny Oropeza, the first 
Latina elected to the Long Beach City Council; Margie Rodriguez-Diaz, Lakewood 
resident and community activist; Douglas X. Patino, Cal State University vice 
chancellor for university advancement, and Irma Archuleta, assistant director 
of the Cal State Long Beach Outreach program.

 Long Beach dentist E.B. Bush was honored by the Long Beach branch of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People for his contributions to 
civil rights. Bush is a deacon at Second Baptist Church in Long Beach. He has 
been chairman of the Long Beach Planning Commission since 1991 and is the 
panel's first African American chairman. Other local NAACP award winners 
include Long Beach resident Lillie Grigsby; Gene Lentzner, chairman of a local 
DARE program; Carmen O. Perez, president of the Long Beach Harbor Commission, 
and Melvina Luke, former member of the Long Beach Mayor's Task Force on AIDS.

JAUNTS; RETURN OF MONARCHS PROVIDES A ROYAL SIGHT; THE EPIC JOURNEYS OF THESE 
BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES TO THEIR WINTERING GROUNDS IS ONE OF THE GREAT WONDERS OF 
NATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They're here again. No, not the holidays -- the monarch butterflies. Those 
intrepid travelers that fly south for the winter have begun holing up in a few 
choice spots along Ventura County's coast. 
</P>
<P>
 They come every year, migrating from colder climates to the same groves of 
eucalyptus trees. There they wait out the winter, congregating by the hundreds 
in clusters of brilliant orange and black. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sight to see, and the story of their migration is the stuff of 
miracles. If you take a 90-minute walking tour sponsored by the city of 
Ventura, you can find out all about them. During December, the city has four 
walks scheduled. The first two are this weekend, on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The naturalist-led walks are in Ventura's Camino Real Park, one of a handful 
of spots along the coast that the butterflies come back to year after year. 
They laze away the winter there in the barranca that borders the park. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the park has attracted many thousands of monarchs, according to 
experts who study the butterflies. But the last couple of years the turnout has 
been slimmer. It's not much better this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about the same as it was last year, which is better than it was two 
years ago," said Walter Sakai, a Santa Monica College biology instructor who 
tracks butterfly colonies in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. In 1992, only 
10% of the usual migratory flock made the trek from colder climates. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure why the numbers have dipped here and elsewhere. Sakai 
thinks one possibility is that big storms in the spring the last few years may 
have wiped out a bunch of the monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason, he said, is that development has stripped away the milkweed 
plant which is the favored cuisine of the monarch caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting a word-of-mouth grass-roots movement," Sakai said, urging 
people to plant milkweed around their homes. A patch of 10 to 15 plants could 
attract 40 to 50 butterflies each October, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the survival skills of the monarchs are astounding. During the summer, 
the butterflies can be found all over the United States and even southern 
Canada. In late October or early November, they start their migratory trek, 
flying up to 80 miles a day at speeds that approach 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical year, millions flutter to Southern California and Baja. Those 
east of the Rocky Mountains head for a small spot of mountains in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 After the mating season in January and February, the monarchs begin the flight 
back. The miraculous part is this: Because they only live six to 10 months, 
they make the journey once, puzzling scientists who aren't sure how the 
offspring find the same wintering spots year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, there are about a dozen layover sites, but most are on 
private property. One of the best public viewing locations is Camino Real Park. 
Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Monarch butterfly walks. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday and Sunday, and Dec. 10 and 11; all walks are from 10 to 
11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Camino Real Park, Dean Drive and Varsity Street, Ventura. Group meets 
between the tennis courts and the barranca. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $3. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: 658-4726. Preregistration is required. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC: Children on the walk must be at least 6 years old. Children 12 and 
younger must be accompanied by an adult.

EARTHWATCH: NOW IS TIME TO DREAM OF A GREEN CHRISTMAS; SEEDS AND BULBS SOWED 
DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON WILL BLOSSOM IN EARLY SPRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Are you on the lookout for some gardening and landscaping tips for the 
holidays? Nature has decreed that this is the season to be sowing seeds, 
planting bulbs and fertilizing your lawn. Even if the custom in the "old 
country" -- those colder states -- decrees that it's time to be sitting around 
the hearth or TV set, in Southern California it's time to get into the sunshine 
and do something else. On the slope behind your house, plant some organic, 
drought-tolerant, native California wildflower seeds, or plant bulbs in your 
garden, bare-root roses along the walk or rye cover to nourish the soil where 
your summer veggies will go next year. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a growing selection of products available at Ventura County garden 
stores and nurseries that make it easy for gardeners to do the right thing at 
the right time and in the right way -- the environmentally friendly way. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo residents Holly and Doug Stone took over the former Jasmine Nursery 
in Ojai a few months ago and re-christened it Matilija Gardens. "Our goal is to 
have only organic products -- gradually," Holly said. Standing among racks of 
organically produced seeds, fertilizers and mulches, she gestured toward 
another side of the store festooned with containers of petrochemical sprays and 
plant foods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tearing down part of the 'Wall of Death,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 18 years in the nursery business and seven years as an employee at the 
location where she now runs the place, she's gotten to know her public, and she 
thinks they're ready for the change. "People say 'Oh, I'm so glad you're 
carrying these products,' and if we don't have exactly the native strains or 
organic products they want, we refer the business to other places that do." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Stones are not the only local source of products for 
environmentally conscious gardening. Green Thumb International, Armstrong 
Garden Centers, Baron Brothers Nursery and Home Depot are among the retailers 
selling such products. Evidently they have picked up on a trend reported 
recently in Organic Gardening magazine. To determine if they have a future in 
the business, the publishers annually poll gardeners around the nation. This 
year, for the first time, slightly more than half called themselves "organic 
gardeners." 
</P>
<P>
 So it's not surprising that Rubbermaid is selling composting bins and Sears 
Craftsmen water-miser soaker hoses made of recycled rubber. And some Long's 
Drug stores are carrying $12 items called PooPets, natural fertilizers molded 
in the form of bunnies, frogs and even a sleeping piglet. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * PLANT NOW: December is the month to plant native, drought-tolerant 
wildflowers for ground cover or decoration. Organically-grown brands to ask for 
at local stores are Shepherd's Garden Seeds (at Matilija Gardens in Ojai) or 
Seeds of Change (at Mrs. Gooch's in Thousand Oaks, or available by calling 
(800) 957-3337). 
</P>
<P>
 * SOURCES: Other Brands of California and Western plant seeds are Stover Seed 
Selection and Ferry Morse, (available at Baron Brothers' Nursery, Armstrong 
Garden Centers and Green Thumb International. These locations also have bulbs 
and bare-root roses, which are supposed to be planted this month.) 
</P>
<P>
 * COMPOSTING: Composting bins by Rubbermaid and by Ringer are available for 
$50 to $90. Nontoxic insecticidal soap-based sprays such as Safer Brand and 
Bio-NEEM are recommended for pest control and clean water-runoff. Whitney Farms 
and Gro-Power are organic enhancements and fertilizers to look for. 
</P>
<P>
 * THINK GREEN: For folks without a garden -- but still with the urge -- The 
West Ventura Community Pride Project will be breaking ground Saturday on a 
Community Garden Project. Volunteers and donations are needed. 648-1895. 
</P>
<P>
 * PLUGGED IN: For environmentally oriented home computer owners who want to 
transition into gardening this holiday season, there's a prize-winning CD-ROM, 
"The Forever Growing Garden," full of ecological tips. Available at software 
stores -- pricey at $50 -- but great family fun for condo-bound naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
 * READING: For the best organic-oriented California gardening guidance in book 
format, read "How To Grow More Vegetables" by John Jevins (Ten Speed Press; 
$16.)

FASHION; DESIGNER'S TINY MEDALS DRAW ON NATURE, FANTASY; ADRIANA RAPPAPORT SAYS 
SHE'S NEVER INSPIRED, BUT JUST KEEPS ON WORKING UNTIL THE PRECISE JEWELRY FORM 
EMERGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WILLIAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a small workshop in the greening hills above Ojai, Adriana Rappaport holds 
a thumbnail-size circle of wax, and considers a starfish-like figure on its 
surface. She has carved the design with tools sharp enough for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 But it falls short of her ideal, and is tossed aside, destined for meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not quite it," says the artist, whose workbench is piled with 
medallions cast from happier sessions with the wax. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny medals have been formed by molten silver, in shapes drawn from nature 
or fantasy. They range from motifs of Oriental simplicity to intricate 
snowflake-like designs and are used in creating earrings and necklaces. One 
motif the artist identifies as a pomegranate, a fruit that grows with vigor on 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of their size, the sculptures are commanding. Their filigree work is 
fine, almost ethereal, the details precise. Some are trimmed with pearls barely 
larger than a pinhead. Earrings are carved on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The lost wax method that produced them is engaging to Rappaport, who has 
designed in tile, ebony, leather and metal fabrication. She calls the wax 
technique a basic workshop craft, one she adopted at the turn of the decade, 
when restraint came to culture, to fashion -- and to her. 
</P>
<P>
 On the walls of the studio is a gallery of a bolder past. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast in design is like night and day, or perhaps a sun and a moon 
period. Here are great kaleidoscopic bronze and copper pieces that look like 
treasure from buried chests -- metal adorned with coins, chains and 
multicolored stones, heavy jeweled cuffs and grapefruit-sized belt buckles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the epitome of the '80s," says the artist wryly, "flashy, garish, 
opulent." 
</P>
<P>
 The period brought demand from upscale boutiques on Rodeo Drive and the San 
Fernando Valley. Rappaport could hardly keep up with orders, and hired 
assistants to help complete enough belts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A belt went for 150 bucks, and a store in Encino would sell it for $450. 
Those days are gone." Anyway, she says, "I'm in another kind of space now, 
living a simpler life." 
</P>
<P>
 The path to Ojai and simplicity was not short. It began in her native Buenos 
Aires, where she was expelled from architecture school for political activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure, had I stayed there I would not be alive today," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to London, where she did architectural drafting, then to Ibiza, off 
the coast of Spain ("where all the hippies went"), and to Santa Barbara to 
engage in routine work with the renowned Pandolfi, before settling here in the 
countryside a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She is married and has three children -- the youngest a 4-year old -- and she 
finds family life as important as art. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately she has concentrated on work in the studio, leaving marketing to a 
professional sales representative. The rep, Shirley de Marco of Long Beach, 
says the pieces are easy to place because their creator "puts so much of 
herself into them." 
</P>
<P>
 As before, the designs are in demand, now in more classic venues. Several 
museums are showing them, including the prestigious Laguna Museum of Art, as 
well as shops such as Objects in Montecito and Silk 'N Spice in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 This is rewarding to Rappaport, and it points to the next logical step for her 
art: outlets in New York. She contemplates this frontier, but so far her own 
ideals have kept her from crossing it. At her work table, she picks up a recent 
design, a pair of half-inch human torsos, one male, one female. 
</P>
<P>
 She is fond of them, but: "The man came out just a little smaller because of 
shrinkage, so it looks like the woman is a great Amazon thing," she says, 
lining up a nearly symmetrical pair for earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 These and other pieces are ready for finish work -- burnishing, antiquing, the 
adding of pearls or bits of shell. All of this Rappaport does herself. She 
likes being immersed in the process rather than having production workers -- 
but it steals time from creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventing a design might take hours or weeks of effort before she resolves to 
cast a piece. Such labor takes momentum, and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am never inspired," she says, "But I have a lot of work ethic. I just work, 
and then something happens, and you take off in a certain direction." 
</P>
<P>
 She describes a mystery that many artists have told before, but laymen always 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just let the wax speak -- you know?" she says. "The wax has its thing; it's 
a matter of slowing down enough to look."

 The holidays are here and so is "The Nutcracker" ballet, that venerable 
Christmas story of toys that come to life, a Sugar Plum Fairy and, of course, a 
dashing prince. 
</P>
<P>
 For kids, it's the ballet to see. And this year there are two productions of 
"The Nutcracker" with live music. For the 15th year, the Ventura County 
Symphony will join the Channel Islands Ballet Company for performances that 
open Friday at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the Conejo Symphony Orchestra will team up with the 
California Dance Theatre Festival Ballet later this month at the new Civic Arts 
Plaza in Thousands Oaks. Three performances Dec. 16 and 17 have already sold 
out, so a fourth was added Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 If youngsters are unfamiliar with the story, it's best to fill them in before 
the ballet so they'll know what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a story set on Christmas Eve at the Silberhaus home in Germany around the 
turn of the century. The family has a gala party with lots of friends and 
relatives. Young Clara receives a special gift -- a nutcracker doll -- from her 
uncle, the eccentric Herr Drosselmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 After the party, Clara falls asleep on the living room sofa and what she 
dreams becomes the heart of the ballet. The Nutcracker comes to life, 
protecting her from an attack by the Mouse King and his army. He turns into a 
prince and before Clara awakens, she has visited several exotic places. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have made the Oxnard production an annual tradition, there are 
some changes this year. The most stunning is the Christmas tree, the one that 
grows before the audience's eyes, dazzling children. This year, the tree is 
new. Three-dimensional, it rises from 10 feet in the beginning to 27 feet -- 
all by the use of pulleys and a busy back-stage crew. If that doesn't astound 
the kids, a cannon that goes off at one point in the ballet may. 
</P>
<P>
 The choreography is new this year too, according to Clarissa Boeiru, artistic 
director for the production, which features 96 dancers. It's a longer 
performance, more than two hours, but there is an intermission. The symphony is 
under the direction of Paul Paulevnik. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of Clara is shared by Sarah Grether, 12, and Haley Henderson, 11. 
Clara, as she appears in the dream, will be danced by Monica Galindo, an 
instructor at Ballet Ventura School, the official school of the Channel Islands 
Ballet Company. 
</P>
<P>
 Three professional dancers will perform. Anatoli Kucheruk, an internationally 
recognized principal with the Alabama Ballet, will be The Prince. Kirsten 
Oakley, a Ventura native now dancing with Et Toi Tu Danses in Milwaukee, will 
be the Sugar Plum Fairy. Karl Warkentien, who has danced with several ballet 
companies, will be Drosselmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 California Dance Theatre Festival Ballet, based in Agoura Hills, has put on 
"The Nutcracker" at local theaters for six seasons. This is the first season in 
the new Civic Arts Plaza, and the first teaming for a full-length production 
with the Conejo Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Elmer Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballet is choreographed and directed by Kim Maselli and Joyce Hurley. It 
features 140 dancers, including guest performers Diane Dickson in the role of 
the Sugar Plum Fairy and John Denniston as the cavalier and the Arabian. Both 
Dickson and Denniston danced with the former Los Angeles Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the kids, this production also has a dazzling Christmas tree that 
grows during the ballet. It was made by special-effects pros in Hollywood and 
rises to 18 feet. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jim Gamble will bring his puppet entourage to Thousand Oaks on Friday morning 
for a special Christmas show for kids. He'll be doing "The Night Bearfore 
Christmas" with his bear puppet helpers at 9:30 and 11 a.m. at the Forum 
Theatre in the Civic Arts Plaza. Tickets are $5.50. For information, call 
493-4348. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nutcracker" ballet will be performed with live music in two locations:

SHOPTALK; HOLIDAY GIFTS THAT SPEAK VOLUMES; BOOKS ARE A PLEASURE TO SELECT AND 
EASY ON THE WALLET. SEVERAL STORES IN THE AREA OFFER A WIDE SELECTION AT GOOD 
PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Some of our favorite gifts received over the years have been books. It isn't 
difficult to see why: They're a great bargain, they last a lifetime, they 
afford pleasure over and over again, and they do all this without taking up a 
lot of space. 
</P>
<P>
 We have books on our coffee table to greet and amuse guests, and keep them 
occupied while we prepare drinks or dinner. Sometimes, when the house is quiet, 
we pretend to be the guests and we travel through the pages of our own coffee 
table books. This activity never fails to give us pleasure, as we remember the 
friends or family members who carefully selected these lovely books. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday gift shopping is typically nightmarish. Fighting the crowds in the 
malls and in the stores is second in horror only to searching for a parking 
spot. Herein lies another wondrous feature of book shopping. Picture yourself 
in a quiet place. Classical music (or perhaps jazz) is playing. You are happily 
browsing through shelves and shelves of beautiful gifts. You are in a 
bookstore! 
</P>
<P>
 We perused several purveyors of books -- a couple of the discount places, a 
fine independent store, and even a warehouse -- for ideas and prices. We came 
home laden with gifts for our friends and ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The two discount bookstores had much to offer. Barnes & Noble and Crown Books 
both offer discounts and have large selections of books on sale. Crown's 
discounts are a bit deeper though. New York Times Bestseller hardcover fiction 
and nonfiction is 40% off at Crown. The same books are 30% off at Barnes & 
Noble. New York Times bestseller paperbacks are 25% off at Crown and 20% off at 
Barnes & Noble. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Crown nor Barnes & Noble offers gift wrapping. Barnes & Noble does, 
however, have a table where you can wrap your own purchases. The wrapping paper 
is complimentary (this can be a real lifesaver if you've stopped on route to a 
party to purchase a gift). The sale selection at both chain bookstores was 
similar. Take your pick of art books, cookbooks, books on sports or books on 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 No book-shopping experience beats going to a really great independent 
bookstore. Ventura Bookstore is just such a place. Gift wrapping, special 
orders and hard-to-find books are all included in the experience. UPS service 
is a terrific timesaver for shoppers sending gifts out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you can't remember a book title or an author's name, you might as well 
skip the discount and chain bookstores. The staff at an independent shop such 
as Ventura Bookstore is so well read that they almost always knows exactly what 
you're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 While the regular stock is not discounted here, the sale selection has the 
other stores beat. We found anthologies of great writers such as Wallace 
Stegner, Edith Wharton and Agatha Christie. Also art books on Edward Hopper, 
David Hockney, Henri Matisse and Georgia O'Keefe. A lot of these art books are 
published by first-rate houses such as Knopf and Rizzoli. We picked up a copy 
of "Illustrated Catwatching" by Desmond Morris for a cat fanatic friend of ours 
-- just $18.98 from the original $40 price. 
</P>
<P>
 There were quite a few autographed books scattered around the store, which 
make unbeatable gifts for collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The last stop on our book tour was Price-Costco. This warehouse store is not a 
bookstore and offers no amenities. But they do have quite a few new titles at 
really low prices. (Approximately 40% to 50% off list). We saw William J. 
Bennett's "Book of Virtues" for $16.99 from $30. "Crossing the Threshold of 
Hope" by John Paul II is $10.99 from $20. And "In the Kitchen With Rosie" 
(Oprah's favorite recipes) by Rosie Daley, is $8.49 from $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
 When books are selected carefully, they give pleasure that lasts for years and 
years. And the pleasure of shopping for them is all yours.

THEATER REVIEW; JOSEPH AND HIS DREAMCOAT ARE STILL AMAZING, STILL COLORFUL; IN 
THE LEAD, BRIAN LANE GREEN PARLAYS HIS LOOKS, SINGING AND SMILE INTO A 
THOROUGHLY SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You'd think the "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" market had been 
pretty well saturated on the Central Coast by this point. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, PCPA Theaterfest has revived its enormously popular fall production 
in Solvang three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera's current version may lack some of 
PCPA's inspired zaniness, it's nonetheless a wonderfully energetic production, 
with the right mix of good-natured fun, talented stars and handsome staging to 
warrant another trip back to Biblical times -- at least as envisioned in this 
first collaboration by lyricist Tim Rice and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Rice-Webber team went on to write "Jesus Christ Superstar" and 
"Evita," yet there's a refreshing, unpretentious abandon in "Joseph" that the 
creators never indulged when they began taking themselves more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is pure, unadulterated fun. 
</P>
<P>
 In the title role of the golden boy with a knack for dream interpretation that 
makes Freud look like a sideshow fortune teller, Brian Lane Green parlays 
matinee idol looks, strong singing and an engaging smile into a thoroughly 
successful performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sold into slavery by his jealous brothers, Joseph has a unique gift that 
catapults him to the No. 2 slot in the Egyptian government when he reveals the 
cycle of feast and famine prophesied in Pharaoh's dream ("All these things you 
saw in your pajamas / Are a long range forecast for your farmers"). 
</P>
<P>
 Whether festering in prison, groveling before Pharaoh or lording it over his 
repentant brothers, Lane wisely resists adding layers of self-conscious camp to 
his Joseph, instead letting the natural goofiness of the songs work their own 
peculiar brand of charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Also appealing is Cynthia Ferrer as the perky narrator who sings bubble-gum 
rock bridges between scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the appeal is the show's irreverent departure from the constraint of a 
clearly defined musical identity -- instead, Webber's free-roaming score 
parodies a wide range of musical styles, from rock to country-western to 
calypso to a hilarious French cabaret tribute as the brothers lift their berets 
to "Zose Canaan Days" of yesteryear. There's even a top-drawer Elvis spoof 
performed by the dream-plagued Pharaoh (Bob Simon) -- one Memphis King saluting 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Framing these contemporary elements with an Old Testament context sparked 
notable ingenuity in the staging. Director and choreographer Dennis Courtney 
invests the production numbers with wry touches (like the brothers using their 
staves as vaudeville-style canes) and sustains an engaging visual flair even 
though there's no mistaking his chorus lines for professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Michael Jagim's sets built around pyramid motifs are a step up from the 
usual rented backdrops, while Lawrence Oberman's multihued light displays even 
switch colors to match the lyrics where appropriate. The only technical glitch 
comes from an overzealous smoke machine, which sometimes creates the kind of 
atmosphere you can figuratively cut with a knife (more attention to air flow 
away from the audience is needed). 
</P>
<P>
 The other questionable choice was padding a thoroughly enjoyable 70-minute 
show (intended to be performed without a break) with an intermission nearly as 
long as the first act and an extended closing medley that dilutes the energy of 
the natural climax -- it's the kind of planning more in tune with a social 
event than an artistic one. Details

MUSIC; YOUTH BRIGADE MARCHES TO PUNK ROCK CADENCE; YOUNG-AT-HEART VETERANS WILL 
ANSWER THE MUSICAL CALL TO ARMS IN THEIR UNDERGROUND PERFORMANCE IN SANTA 
BARBARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Youth Brigade, with members in their 30s, may not be kids, but they 
certainly are closer to youth than the Beach Boys are to boyhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth may indeed by wasted on the young, but this Brigade will be wasting the 
ears of the young with a punk rock barrage of witty yet indecipherable songs on 
Wednesday night when they appear as the headline act at the Underground in 
Santa Barbara. Also on the bill are punk legends 7 Seconds and Youth Brigade 
label mates Bouncing Souls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Better Youth Organization, probably not the answer to every parent's 
dream, is an independent label run by the band, which has been releasing punk 
rock albums since 1982. The latest one, "Happy Hour," is by the Youth Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually composed of four members, this understrength Brigade features the 
three Stern brothers, who have thus far refrained from fratricide. Shawn 
(guitar), Mark (drums) and Adam (bass) formed BYO in 1979, then the Youth 
Brigade in 1982, thus being part of the blame for the L.A. punk rock explosion. 
During a band break, Mark and Adam formed the popular be-bop swing outfit, the 
Royal Crown Revue. In 1991, the band reformed and began touring again. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer/songwriter Shawn Stern discussed the band during a recent phone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 How can three brothers get along this long without killing each other? 
</P>
<P>
 We do fight all the time, but we're used to it. People that don't know us 
don't understand, but we yell at each other about going to lunch. By the time 
we get done with a tour, we don't want to see each other for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the difference between punk rock '82 and punk rock '94? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the old guys are doing quite well such as Jello Biafra at Alternative 
Tentacles, and Brett Gurewitz at Epitaph. The people that did it because they 
believed in what they were doing, are still doing it. I think we probably just 
took the wrong years off. The main difference was that the scene was new then; 
we sort of created it. I'm glad to see Green Day and Offspring make it, 
especially Offspring on an independent label. Punk rock is definitely getting 
bigger, but how similar it'll be to how it began remains to be seen. Now, it's 
big money, big business and big labels. 
</P>
<P>
 What got you started in all this? 
</P>
<P>
 When I was in high school in 1977, I was reading about the Sex Pistols, then I 
heard Elvis Costello and the Clash on the radio. Then in 1978, I saw the 
Dickies, and they totally blew me away. I went home and shaved off my hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Has Youth Brigade changed much since your '82 album? 
</P>
<P>
 We're pretty much doing the same thing we were doing when we started. We all 
like different kinds of music; you can tell that because two of my brothers 
were in a swing band. We play good, fast, loud, energetic songs that have 
something to say. 
</P>
<P>
 So you're up there wailing away, but no one can hear the witty lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why we put in a lyric sheet. Always. The Clash never did, that's why 
you hear people walking around mumbling their songs -- because they couldn't 
understand the words. I think the education system isn't doing a very good job 
with the kids today. A lot of them are street smart, but not book smart. They 
don't know what's going on in the rest of the world. They think America is the 
beginning and the end of the world. Some of them think Vietnam is one of the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the mosh pit gets too radical? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of testosterone at work out there, and if they don't meet a 
girl, they fight. It's totally stupid, but telling them it's totally stupid, is 
stupid. As long as they don't shoot each other in the face, we let it go. 
</P>
<P>
 What do people always get wrong about punk rock? 
</P>
<P>
 That it's all violent, mindless and stupid and that the lyrics are all 
nihilistic -- just surface things. 
</P>
<P>
 What's up with BYO? 
</P>
<P>
 BYO was formed as a reaction to violence at a 1979 Elk's Lodge gig in downtown 
L.A. with the Germs and the Go-Go's. . . . We just wanted to teach people about 
the positive aspects of our scene. This gradually turned into promoting shows 
-- we ran a place called Godzilla's -- and formed our own label. It was the 
whole punk rock do-it-yourself attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the best thing about having your own label? 
</P>
<P>
 You work for yourself. We get to travel around for three or four months a 
year, and hire some of your friends. If the surf's up, we take the day off. On 
the other hand, you become a workaholic and work late and work nights. Then 
your girlfriend gets mad at you because you don't spend enough time with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Your first album cost five bucks. Are you still keeping the prices down? 
</P>
<P>
 We keep the vinyl at six bucks and the CDs at ten bucks. I'd lower the prices, 
but I can't get them to charge less in the stores. The price of CDs is going 
down -- it's about $1.05 right now to make one -- so the mark-up is incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Youth Brigade still youthful? 
</P>
<P>
 "Youth" is an attitude, not an age. We'll always be kids at heart. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Youth Brigade, 7 Seconds, Bouncing Souls. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Wednesday night, 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Underground, 110 Santa Barbara St., Santa Barbara.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MENU THAT'S RICH IN HEALTHY CHOICES; LOCAL NOCHOL OFFERS 
APPEALING SOUPS AND SANDWICHES AND SUCH NUTRITIOUS DISHES AS TURKEY MEATLOAF 
AND UN-FRIED CHICKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORM CHANDLER FOX, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not so many years ago, I had to be forced to eat in health food restaurants. 
They were usually depressing places where people with a decidedly unhealthy 
pallor served strange mounds of food covered in sprouts. The cuisine was often 
crunchy, full of fiber and generally tasteless, leading me to believe it was 
similar to the fodder placed in feed bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for those of us today who are concerned about cutting back on fat, 
salt and sugar, we can choose a cheerful spot where the food is flavorful and 
healthy. LoCAL NoCHOL is a tiny, informal restaurant located in a Westlake 
Village strip mall. It has blond wood walls, accents of blue and yellow and 
about 20 tables. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a counter adjoining an open, sparkling-clean kitchen where customers 
order and pay for meals. Then you grab a table and wait to be served. Although 
it can get a little congested at the counter at peak times, I like the energy 
of this place, which attracts a wide spectrum of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The felicitous restaurant is the brainchild of Lauren Bell and Bob Bell, who 
were married and now work together as partners. High cholesterol caused Bob to 
have a massive heart attack at age 37, motivating Lauren to invent hundreds of 
heart-healthy recipes that helped him to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're like me -- a person who's never enjoyed food based on Nathan 
Pritikin's dietary precepts -- you'll be surprised at how tasty this 
cuisine-that's-good-for-you can be. A reminder: The menu is not necessarily 
geared to weight loss. But if you're feeling guilty about that Thanksgiving 
weekend pig-out, you can request a supplementary list that gives the exact 
calories, fat, sodium, etc., of each menu item. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, I like Ma Bell's rich chicken noodle soup ($1.75/$3.50) filled 
with minced chicken and vegetables, and a special soup du jour ($1.75/$3.50) of 
smooth pureed squash. A delightful turkey chili ($1.95/$3.75) is made with 
adzuki beans, ground turkey and fresh herbs, served over brown rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Salads are made from 17 varieties of delicious greens. Top choices are the 
Mediterranean ($5.50), flavored with grilled squash, eggplant and couscous, and 
the Caesar ($5.25), with a biting dressing and crunchy home-fried potato slices 
instead of croutons. The hot and cold chili salad ($6.50)is a fine meal, with 
the spicy warm chili, lentils and brown rice contrasting nicely with the cool 
greens and salsa. Unfortunately, the Chinese salad ($5.50), with its addition 
of rice noodles, almonds and mandarin oranges, suffers from the blahs. 
</P>
<P>
 Light eaters can make a meal around stuffed baked potatoes. One of my major 
gripes is that so many restaurants serve stale, rewarmed baked potatoes, 
assuming the customer can't taste the difference. Here, the spuds are baked 
fresh every hour, and my favorites include one filled with turkey chili 
($3.25), another stuffed with grilled vegetables and topped with tangy 
carrot-yogurt ($3.25), and a mouth-zinger with chili sauce, salsa, fire-roasted 
red peppers and a whole roasted jalapeno that seared my taste buds for hours 
($3.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the flavorful sandwiches offered on oat-bran buns, I prefer a grilled 
salmon burger ($4.50) with a tingling horseradish topping, a moist vegeburger 
($3.75), and a nice chicken breast topped with garlicky ranch dressing ($3.95). 
The turkey burger ($3.95) is well-seasoned but too dry for my taste. Two other 
winners, which are rolled up in paper-thin chapati bread, are the Mideast feast 
($4.50), dense with couscous, lentils, diced grilled peppers, red onions and a 
lemony tahini-hummus dressing, and a veggie roll ($3.95) filled with grilled 
zucchini and eggplant, brown rice, adzuki beans and piquant salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 After 5 p.m., I try the moist grilled turkey meatloaf studded with golden 
raisins and onions ($8.25) and topped with chili sauce. Pasta primavera ($7.95) 
with grilled vegetables is not exciting, but the un-fried chicken ($8.25) is 
sensational. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Bell bakes the skinless chicken breast with a crackling crust that 
tastes even better than the fat-filled super crunchy variety hailing from 
Kentucky. And it's served with fabulous roasted garlic potatoes ($2.50) -- 
mashed up, skins and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I like the creamy rice pudding ($2.50), I'm not impressed with the 
other desserts, which look tantalizing in the glass case at the counter. I'd 
rather finish my meal with another side of those dreamy garlic mashed potatoes.

 'Tis the season for sales, something that seems never to go unnoticed by the 
folks at Mandell's Liquor & Wine Shop in Ventura. As has been the case for many 
a holiday season, the shop's extensive wine selection has been discounted 
through Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Capper, general manger of the shop, said the sale tends to attract the 
wine connoisseurs in the area. "Our regulars just come in looking for 
high-quality, high-priced wines that are 20% off," she said. "We have people 
coming in spending hundreds of dollars. Sometimes people buy $1,500 or $1,600 
worth of wine." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the average customer, Capper said: "They come in, find out there's a 
sale, and say, 'Hey, I'll get some more.' " Mandell's is at 3915 Telegraph 
Road.

 Peruvian cuisine has arrived in Ojai, courtesy of the month-old Papagallo's 
restaurant, a sibling of the well-respected Santa Barbara establishment of the 
same name. The Ojai restaurant is adjacent to the Ojai Playhouse on Ojai 
Avenue, in the spot formerly occupied by the Cabo Grill, and MK's before that. 
</P>
<P>
 Husband-and-wife owners Laura and Jorge Ricci are featuring the same menu as 
at the Santa Barbara establishment. "A lot of typical dishes from Peru," Laura 
said. "Paellas, tamales, vegetarian dishes upon request. Everything is made 
from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is open 5 to 10 p.m. seven days a week, with music and dancing 
on the weekends. "We'll have South American, Brazilian and salsa" music, Laura 
said, "and maybe some ballroom dancing."

 If you're looking to do-it-yourself this holiday season, the Lov At First Bite 
chocolate shop in Simi Valley is holding a free candy-making class Tuesday at 
6:30 p.m. Students will learn chocolate molding and other candy basics. Class 
size is limited, so call 584-9108 to save a spot. The shop is at 5716 E. Los 
Angeles Ave.

HOME COOK; POP GOES THE PANCAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are like me, you probably cook your favorite dishes again and again. It 
is easy to get into a rut. But the other day, quite by accident, I had a 
breakthrough when I was making one of my old favorites -- pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 This basic pancake recipe is made with the plainest ingredients yet always 
produces the tenderest little puffy pancakes you can imagine. On a whim, I 
decided I would make another batch and try baking them in muffin cups . . . 
just to see what would happen. Amazingly, they turned out wonderful -- high, 
moist, golden little domes, a cross between popovers and pancakes. My daughter 
calls them "popcakes."  
</P>
<P>
 Curious, I went a step further and tried a variation with the popcakes, 
replacing several tablespoons of flour with an equal amount of masa harina . 
Try serving these Mexican popcakes with a guacamole omelet for a Sunday lunch 
or supper. POPCAKES 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup buttermilk 
</P>
<P>
 In mixing bowl combine flour, salt and baking soda. In small bowl, beat egg 
until well mixed. Add cooled butter to egg and stir again. Pour egg mixture and 
buttermilk into flour mixture. Stir briskly until well mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fill 6 greased muffin cups half full. Bake at 425 degrees about 12 to 15 
minutes, until popcakes brown on top. Remove from oven. Serve immediately. 
Makes 6 popcakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each popcake contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 133 calories; 191 mg sodium; 47 mg cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 17 grams 
carbohydrates; 4 grams protein; 0.06 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Variation: 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Popcakes -- Replace flour with mixture of 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon 
flour and 3 tablespoons masa harina. Proceed with recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancakes -- Follow Popcakes recipe, except barely stir ingredients together. 
Batter should look wet and shiny, like bowl of thick-curd cottage cheese. Don't 
worry about streaks of flour and lumps. Heat skillet and melt just enough oil 
or shortening to cover bottom. Drop batter by heaping tablespoon into skillet 
and gently pat each mound of batter down; don't flatten clumps of batter. Turn 
as soon as edges of pancake look dry; don't wait for bubbles to break over top 
before turning.

VANILLA ON SALMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people think of vanilla as a flavoring for pastries and ice cream. But 
many cooks use vanilla beans in roasted lobster and even steep the fragrant pod 
in cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
 To a generation of North Americans brought up on vanilla wafers and vanilla 
custard, this use of a tropical flavoring in savory dishes may seem outlandish. 
But it's common practice among French chefs around the world. The celebrated 
three-star French chef Michel Guerard has been known to add a few drops of 
vanilla to hollandaise sauce. Patrick Gateau, chef of the Carl Gustaf Hotel in 
St. Barthelmey, French West Indies, scrapes the tiny black vanilla seeds into a 
dulcet sauce for salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as vanilla has the ability to bring out chocolate's sweetness without 
making it seem cloying, so does it have a remarkable way of bringing out the 
natural sweetness of savory dishes, especially seafood.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important chemicals responsible for the bean's haunting aroma 
is vanillin, a compound that forms tiny white crystals on the pod's surface as 
the vanilla bean ferments. The French call these crystals givre (frost), and 
they are an important indicator of a high-quality vanilla bean.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of quality is length: The long, slender beans from Madagascar and 
Tahiti are considered superior to the short, stubby beans from the Caribbean. 
But fresh vanilla beans of any size will have more flavor than the bottled 
extract most of us grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla beans are generally sold by the piece in glass tubes or bottles. When 
buying them, seek out fat, flexible pods that feel heavy in your hand. Avoid 
dried-out or brittle beans. According to Gateau, the best vanilla comes from 
Taa in Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla beans aren't inexpensive (I recently paid $3 for a bottle of two 
pods), but a little can be made to go a long way. To use a vanilla bean, cut it 
in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Scrap the tiny black seeds with the 
point of the knife into the dish you're preparing. A half vanilla bean is 
sufficient to flavor two cups of custard, ice cream or applesauce. Place the 
bean in the milk over low heat and let it infuse for 20 minutes, then make your 
custard or ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The infused pod can be rinsed off, dried and placed in a jar of granulated or 
powdered sugar. In a few days, you'll have a wonderful vanilla-flavored 
sweetener. If you prefer the convenience of vanilla extract, you can make your 
own by steeping a few vanilla beans in a flask of vodka. Just store it away 
from light. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some people may be skeptical about adding vanilla to savory dishes. The 
following recipe, a specialty of the Carl Gustaf Hotel, is designed to make 
them believers. Save the vanilla pod for making flavored rum or sugar.  
</P>
<P>
 PATRICK GATEAU'S ROASTED SALMON WITH VANILLA SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, with skin 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound spinach, stemmed and rinsed 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Season salmon to taste with salt and pepper. Heat oil in non-stick oven-proof 
skillet and brown salmon pieces, skin side down, over high heat. Place skillet 
and fish in oven. Roast salmon at 400 degrees until cooked to taste, 10 
minutes. To test for doneness, press fish with finger. It should break into 
flakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Steam spinach in steamer or in covered pot with small amount of water until 
tender, about 2 minutes. Drain and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, arrange spinach in centers of 4 plates. Place 1 piece of fish on 
top. Spoon Vanilla Sauce around fish and serve at once. Makes 4 servings. 
Vanilla Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons minced shallots 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup fish stock or bottled clam juice 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1 scant tablespoon honey 
</P>
<P>
 1 vanilla bean 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in saucepan. Add shallots and cook over medium heat until tender 
but not brown, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to high. Add wine and boil until 
about 1 tablespoon liquid remains. Add fish stock and boil until about 2 
tablespoons liquid remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk in cream and honey and bring sauce to boil. Cut vanilla bean in half 
lengthwise with paring knife. Scrape tiny seeds into sauce with tip of knife. 
Discard vanilla pod. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

MARKETS; TEA AND COMFORT FOOD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A doorbell tinkles as you enter the Friar Tuck Shoppe. It signals that you're 
leaving behind the honking traffic on Burbank Boulevard for a world of tea and 
crumpets, and bangers and mash, a place where you could imagine Mary Poppins 
holding forth on the proper hasty pudding. The place has the aura of an 
old-fashioned provisions shop on a winding English country lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Friar Tuck, which got its name because its owners also own the Robin Hood Pub 
next door (and because tuck is British slang for food ), is the English 
comfort-food zone for expat Brits in the San Fernando Valley. When you browse 
through the kippers and pork pies, the meat puddings and the English cheeses, 
visions of Mrs. Hudson shopping for Holmes and Dr. Watson come to mind.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Mrs. Hudson would also find popular English supermarket 
products. Besides the English teas, some of Friar Tuck's more popular items, 
says shop manager Sharon Laslett, are the English-style Heinz canned tomato 
soup and baked beans. Laslett explains that the English-made versions taste 
entirely different from the American ones. "A lot of these foods are what every 
British kid grew up on, and from time to time the need for them just comes over 
you," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even nursery comforts have been considered. Friar Tuck carries Nurse Harvey's 
Gripe Mixture, an over-the-counter remedy for baby colic, and Farley's Rusks, 
biscuits for teething babies.  
</P>
<P>
 But what makes Friar Tuck outstanding are the bakery goods made at the rear of 
the shop. The flaky-crusted meat pies and Cornish pasties will erase the 
popular notion that British food is irredeemably stodgy. Friar Tuck's scones 
are downy-soft and filled with golden raisins. The rock cakes are crumbly and 
perfect for tea. There are also Eccles cakes, feathery rounds of puff pastry 
with a filling of currants, immersed in a buttery brown sugar coating.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of Friar Tuck's regular customers also patronize Robin Hood Pub for its 
Sunday roast dinners or the afternoon tea served with finger sandwiches, scones 
with cream and homemade Battenberg cake. Then they come next door to shop for 
their favorite bakery goods, staples and deli items, including the pub's Scotch 
eggs enrobed in a casing of coarse, well-seasoned sausage meat. "The pub and 
store are a good complement," says Lorraine Williams, who started the business 
11 years ago with her husband, Michael Williams.  
</P>
<P>
 The traditions of an English Christmas live on, even in Van Nuys, and Friar 
Tuck prepares for the holiday in a big way. They take orders for the rich mince 
pies they'll be baking. A huge shipment of traditional fruit cakes will arrive; 
the large dome-shaped or smaller rectangular cakes bear the customary covering 
of marzipan beneath a sugar glaze. Along with plum puddings, brandy butter and 
hard sauce are beautiful "crackers," the seasonal table decorations that pop 
open to reveal favors. More than any time of year, at Christmas, Friar Tuck 
lives up to its comforting image. Shopping List 
</P>
<P>
 FROM THE BAKERY 
</P>
<P>
 * Savory Pies: The meat pie, one of Britain's oldest traditions, was once a 
festival or fair food -- a rare treat for the poor who could buy them from 
pastelers and street vendors for a penny (thus the name penny pies). Friar 
Tuck's elegantly crafted pies have come a long way from this street-food fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The top of the line is the steak and mushroom pie, tightly packed with slices 
of round steak and mushrooms moistened with a juicy red wine sauce (not one of 
those gluey gravies that fill many commercial meat pies). Friar Tuck's cooks 
also put up chicken with vegetable pies, curried chicken pies and steak and 
kidney pies. Each is an extremely generous individual serving.  
</P>
<P>
 Friar Tuck likes to sell its pies unbaked because, says Lorraine Williams, 
they are so much better freshly baked than reheated. But the shop will bake 
pies for anyone who wants to order them ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cornish Pasties: The traditional noon meal of Cornish miners has always been 
the pasty, a pocket-sized pie usually filled with meat and vegetables. Friar 
Tuck's version is a gorgeous little football-shaped thing made from puff pastry 
with a subtly seasoned filling of vegetables and very lean ground beef. The 
pasties are sold uncooked and frozen but, as with the pies, one can order them 
baked. People often do so for special gatherings, baby showers, wakes and other 
get-togethers, says manager Laslett. Usually the pub will have some baked 
pasties on hand too. (By the way, this pasty is not the same word that means 
"like paste" -- it rhymes with nasty , not with hasty .) 
</P>
<P>
 * Sausage Rolls: These rolls of puff pastry formed around sausage meat are 
meant to be eaten out of hand like a pasty. They're also made on the premises, 
and you can either buy frozen, uncooked sausage rolls or order them already 
baked. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scotch Eggs: Hard-boiled eggs, encased in a generous layer of sausage meat 
and deep-fried, are frequently found on pub menus in England, but they're also 
sturdy enough, if accompanied by a slice of cottage loaf and pickled onions or 
Branston pickle, to make the main course of a meal. Friar Tuck's Scotch eggs 
are made next door at the Robin Hood and may be purchased at the shop to go. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tea Pastries: Friar Tuck's scones and rock cakes, barely sweetened and 
plentifully studded with golden raisins, are the best in the Valley -- perhaps 
anywhere in the L.A. area. Friar Tuck's also makes its own traditional vanilla 
slices. These flaky pastry rectangles layered with rich vanilla cream are 
cousins to the Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eccles Cakes: This pastry gets its name from the city of Eccles in 
northwestern Lancashire. It isn't what we call cake in this country; it's a 
currant-filled round of puff pastry. Friar Tuck's Eccles cakes have the perfect 
balance of sweet filling with savory pastry.  
</P>
<P>
 * Battenberg Cake: Think of it as a jellyroll arranged in a checkerboard 
pattern: pink and cream-colored strips of poundcake joined with strawberry jam 
and then wrapped in a thin sheet of marzipan. FROM THE SHELVES: 
</P>
<P>
 * Branston Pickle: This dark, sweet-and-sour condiment is made from finely cut 
fruits and vegetables. In effect it's a sort of chutney; the dates, lemons and 
spices that flavor it clearly point toward India. It's as common on tables in 
England as ketchup is here and is considered essential with cold meats, Scotch 
eggs and plowman's lunch (country bread and cheese). 
</P>
<P>
 * Baked Beans: "The consummate nursery food" -- meaning what English kids eat 
when they don't dine with their parents -- is how one expat describes Heinz 
canned baked beans: "Everyone ate them heated up and poured over toast; kids 
love them." 
</P>
<P>
 * Marmite: This is another nursery food, one every English person will tell 
you is highly nutritious. It's a viscous extract of yeast and vegetables that 
can be made into a broth by the addition of hot water. Just as often it is 
spread undiluted onto toast, which is cut into strips called Marmite soldiers, 
presumably to make it more amusing for children to eat. Marmite, and its 
Australian counterpart Vegemite, both carried here, fall into the category of 
acquired tastes, especially in their undiluted form. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marrowfat Peas and Mushy Peas: Marrowfats are large, starchy field peas (the 
split-pea type of pea, as against the fresh green pea) that readily lend 
themselves to being mashed or pureed. Friar Tuck sells dry marrowfats, canned 
whole marrowfats and canned "mushy peas," a puree of marrowfat peas that is a 
working man's staple in the North of England. The last contain a touch of sugar 
and butter that enhances the peas' subtly sweet flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sponge Pudding: Sweet puddings, cold puddings, meat puddings, pease puddings 
-- there are literally hundreds of puddings in England, where the name is 
applied to almost any mixture cooked in a water bath. Friar Tuck carries 
treacle sponge pudding, a dessert that comes in a can. You pierce the lid and 
place it upright in a pot of gently boiling water until it's done, and then 
invert it onto a plate. The resulting soft, light cake is anointed with a 
veneer of Golden Syrup, a slightly caramelized equivalent of corn syrup, and 
eaten warm with custard sauce. (Friar Tuck sells prepared custard if you don't 
want to make your own.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Heinz Salad Cream: While many British factory-made foods are worthy of a 
foodie's scorn, one item that isn't is Heinz Salad Cream. This smooth, creamy 
sauce, slightly less dense than commercial mayonnaise, gets its piquant flavor 
from vinegar and a touch of mustard powder. Salad cream makes sandwiches more 
luxurious and coleslaw addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hard Toffee: To eat Walker's English toffee, a rich, smooth caramel-like 
confection, you need to crack it into chunks, and to crack it, you need to 
chill it or freeze it first. So important is this ritual that Walker's includes 
a small but very sturdy metal hammer in every large box. For smaller toffee 
appetites they also offer the "crack pack," a 2x4-inch cellophane-wrapped 
package that you bang on a hard surface to crack. The toffees come plain, with 
nuts or with both fruit and nuts. FROZEN MEATS AND DELICACIES  
</P>
<P>
 * Sausages: Martin Lunt, the owner of Jolly Good, a California company that 
supplies Friar Tuck with excellent English-style sausages, says bangers got 
their name during hard times when some sausages were made with too much water 
and bread. They would expand and pop with a bang in the cooking pan. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good butcher would be offended if you called his sausages bangers," Lunt 
adds. "But we have to call ours bangers, because USDA insists that any sausage 
containing even a small amount of bread crumbs, which is how the British prefer 
them, cannot be called sausage."  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you call them, these links are delicious. Jolly Good's pork bangers 
come in two sizes: One is about the size of a fresh Italian sausage, the other, 
called chipolata, is breakfast-link size. There are beef sausages too, also 
made with a touch of bread crumbs. These, according to Jolly Good, are 
preferred by Scots. 
</P>
<P>
 * English and Irish Bacon: The British call American-style bacon "streaky 
bacon"; they consider it an ingredient for cooking with. For breakfast, they 
prefer middle back bacon, which comes from the back and sides of a bacon pig, 
rather than from the belly. It is sliced thin from lean, smoked meat bordered 
with a narrow ribbon of fat. Friar Tuck carries Danish bacon, which is the kind 
most commonly eaten in England these days. It is cut, cured and smoked in the 
English style. Irish bacon, prepared in much the same manner, is leaner and has 
a slightly different flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frozen Kippers: Cured cold-smoked herrings, known as kippers, don't do too 
well in cans; they lose their firm texture and their flavor suffers. But 
because herrings are oily fish, they freeze well. Frozen kippers are thoroughly 
acceptable, whether you grill them or cook them in their heat-proof plastic bag 
with butter (most kipper experts prefer the fish grilled). In England, kippers 
are a favorite breakfast food. A grilled ripe tomato, along with tea and good 
bread and butter, is its best accompaniment. CHEESES AND DAIRY GOODS 
</P>
<P>
 * Cheeses: Friar Tuck carries several English cheeses, including the 
blue-veined Stilton, often called the Roquefort of England.  
</P>
<P>
 After Cheddar, Cheshire is England's most popular cheese. Crumbly and 
moderately hard, Cheshire tastes best when "toasted" or slightly melted. In the 
North of England, an orange color is preferred in cheese, whereas people from 
farther south want their Cheshire in its natural off-white shade. So this 
cheese comes either as white Cheshire and "red" Cheshire (the official term 
name for the orange-colored version). Apart from color, they are identical. 
Friar Tuck carries both Cheshires to serve with fruit and "biscuits" (what we 
might call crackers) or broiled on toast. 
</P>
<P>
 Layers of mild, mellow double-Gloucester cheese sandwich a thick layer of the 
noble Stilton in the much-sought Huntsman cheese. Purists consider this 
"invented" cheese a sacrilege, but its fans love the contrast between the salty 
Stilton and the creamy double Gloucester. Huntsman is just as good with the 
traditional Port wine and walnuts as plain Stilton.  
</P>
<P>
 * Cream: For your tea-time scones, Friar Tuck imports true double cream, which 
is exceptionally thick. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Friar Tuck Shoppe and Bakery, 13638 Burbank Blvd., Van Nuys, (818) 
785-4814. Open 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily.

SHE STEWS TO CONQUER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCHUYLER INGLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By their very nature, the lead-weighted, low-slung clouds hanging over the 
land this time of year recommend foods of a substantial, ambrosial sort. Stews 
come to mind, the kind that cook slowly, exuding a complicated aroma that fills 
a house faster than laughter.  
</P>
<P>
 Good stews have the mysterious ability to ease aches in bones grown weary at 
the end of a cold, dark, rainy day. They are essentially simple dishes, yet 
this should not belie the way they taste, for the best stews have complex 
flavors that reach right into the blood, flavors that emerge from the heartiest 
ingredients in a cook's larder -- beef, onions, and especially mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The stews cooked by Marguerite Margason always seem to achieve this state of 
grace. She learned to cook them from her mother who, in turn, learned from her 
mother.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Marguerite grew up in Seattle, her parents immigrated from France. They 
were intellectuals who retained the better part of their culture, including the 
food on the table. Marguerite's grandmother had been a professional cook in 
turn-of-the-century Paris, preparing the meals for the household of Jean 
Jaures, the great French Socialist reformer. Grandmere saw to it that her own 
daughter knew the ways of the French kitchen, and Marguerite's mother drummed 
it into Marguerite's head as well, along with French verbs and piano scales.  
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say that Marguerite cooks only in the temple of Gallic 
tradition. Her tastes have become far more catholic than her mother could ever 
dream. She is as familiar with the foods of North Africa, North and South 
India, Thailand and various provinces of China as she is with the full breadth 
of the French culinary liturgy, let alone any of the other regional cuisines of 
Europe anyone might care to mention. Wherever she has traveled, she has shopped 
and cooked. Whatever she has learned, she has brought home with her, 
incorporating it into the regular meals of her house without a hint of 
pretension. She has about her a directness and honesty few other cooks ever 
seem to muster.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her pantry spills over with aloe wood, ras al hanout , green and red curry 
paste, edible camphor, ambergris and other exotica she has picked up here and 
there. The shelves bear up under the full weight of bottles, cans and jars of 
various condiments, spices and concoctions. But one container in particular 
stands apart on the shelf, and Marguerite has to climb up a short step stool to 
get it down.  
</P>
<P>
 It is an old, flat-sided tea tin with a hinged lid. Scenes of India have been 
embossed into the metal. The tin belonged to Marguerite's mother. It was to 
this tin that she consigned the mushrooms she picked and dried from spring to 
fall. After a heavy rain, young Marguerite and her mother could be seen in 
their Seattle neighborhood, proceeding from lawn to lawn, picking the small 
fairy ring mushrooms known as Marasmius oreades. They knew better than to 
confuse these with the somewhat similar-looking, though slightly poisonous, 
Clitocybe dealbata or Inocybe umbratica. The neighbors were convinced that 
mother and daughter would be dead by nightfall.  
</P>
<P>
 Marasmius oreades is a tiny mushroom that shrivels down to nothing when it 
dries. But the smell it leaves in an old tea tin is big enough to vote. When 
Marguerite makes a stew, say a boeuf a la Bourguignonne , she reaches for the 
mushroom tin and sprinkles some of its dried contents into warm water, then 
uses the revived mushrooms and soaking liquid as a flavor enhancement. As 
simple as that. Leave the dried mushrooms out of Marguerite's stew and the 
result simply isn't all that it could be.  
</P>
<P>
 It takes a diligent mushroom hunter to comb the forests at the right time and 
come home with enough wild mushrooms to dry for use in winter. It takes an 
exceedingly wealthy individual to buy enough wild mushrooms at the market to 
dry. Packages of dried porcini imported from Italy and other dried wild 
mushrooms are easily found in specialty shops and some supermarkets. They add 
wonderful dimensions to stews and to risotti and should not be overlooked. But 
they too are prohibitively expensive. A cook thinks twice before dipping his 
fingertips into such a mushroom package, which isn't the point.  
</P>
<P>
 By casually, but continually, harvesting wild mushrooms from lawns in her 
neighborhood, Marguerite is able to use dried mushrooms in her cooking with 
abandon.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This same possibility is available to anyone with a lawn or garden bed. 
Sunlight isn't an issue, though water certainly is. Fungi Perfecti, a mushroom 
grower's supply company in Shelton, Wash., sells various kinds of mushroom 
spawn. One kind, Stropharia rugosoannulata , when introduced to hardwood chips, 
colonizes the bed and within a year produces masses of enormous, mild-flavored 
mushrooms that can be used fresh or dried. Just add water to make them grow. As 
long as the mushroom colonies have ample sources of nourishment, they continue 
to grow and produce mushrooms. Segments of fairy rings that date back 600 years 
have been found in Western states. Mushrooms dry in a day or two in hot sun and 
store well in a jar. Or an old tea tin. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguerite uses beef chuck in her stew, cutting it into fairly large pieces. 
She trims the meat of any fat, then renders the fat in a large, heavy-bottomed 
pan over low heat until she has enough oil in the pan to sear and thoroughly 
brown the chunks of beef. Using the oil from beef fat (which she discards when 
she has obtained a suitable amount of oil) to brown the meat heightens the 
final flavor of the stew. She removes the browned meat to a dish, then adds 
chopped onion to the pot until it takes on a little color.  
</P>
<P>
 She returns the meat to the pot, then dusts everything with flour, stirring 
and scraping and allowing that to cook for a bit. Then she adds a little beef 
stock, a few tablespoons of tomato paste, a medium-sized can of tomato sauce, 
bay leaf, thyme, a clove or two of minced garlic, salt and pepper, the 
mushrooms and their soaking liquid, and enough red wine (a Burgundy is 
traditional) to cover the meat. Lid in place, all of that slowly cooks and 
blends and joins hands in the pot and fills the house with ambrosial scents. 
Remove the lid for the last hour or so to cook down the liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on her mood, Marguerite would serve this stew with scalloped 
potatoes, or just good crusty bread and a big salad. It is guaranteed to clear 
the gray, wet day out of any system. Sources

 Cooking with wild mushrooms is a lot less expensive when you grow the 
mushrooms yourself. One good source for mushroom spawn is Fungi Perfecti, a 
mushroom grower's supply company that sells its products by mail. Call (800)

THE CASE OF THE FOAMING ROOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DAVIDSON, Retired diplomat Davidson is the co-founder of the Oxford 
Symposium, the author of numerous books about fish and other foodstuffs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no warning, none at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon sun shone mildly through the windows of the secluded Chelsea 
apartment where I was working in the 19th year of my 20-year assignment to 
write "The Oxford Companion to Food." Then my collaborator, Helen J. Saberi, 
casually asked the fateful question: "Do you know what bois de Panama is?" 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing to suggest that she was opening a door through which both of 
us would be propelled into a nightmare world of stark white foams, rising out 
of bowl after bowl of macerated bark or root to enrobe an infinity of Lebanese 
and Egyptian sweetmeats; a scene which, for suave horror, outdoes any 
Breughelesque vision of Hell. There was no hint that I would become librarian 
of a newly formed international organization called INTERSPI (or International 
Spice Investigations, if you prefer), dedicated to hunting down those few rogue 
flavorings that eluded the attention of Vasco da Gama, Magellan and all the 
other spice-mad explorers of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
 In helping her friend Anissa Helou test recipes for a cookbook ("Lebanese 
Cuisine" Grub Street: London; 1994), Saberi had innocently become curious about 
the Middle Eastern habit of combining pastries with a non-dairy "cream" called 
natif (others have spelled it natife and naatiffe ), which calls for bois de 
Panama. Claudia Roden, in "A New Book of Middle Eastern Food" (Viking: 1985), 
described bois de Panama as "a pale, dry wood" that could be made to produce 
the foaming white sauce she knew as a child in Egypt. Helou had a stock of two 
sorts of bois de Panama her mother had bought in Lebanon -- one a root, the 
other a bark -- and though she could not give its botanical identity, she said 
she could make us natif from each kind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the nightmare began. Every five minutes, it seemed, Helou would bring yet 
another collection of aluminum trays full of foam, some made by herself and 
some by Lebanese confectioners in London. Foam enveloped us; not a light, 
frothy foam you could blow off your hands, but a thick, shiny, unctuous, 
marshmallow-like foam of an eerie whiteness that had nothing cream-like about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the containers piled up in our previously tranquil workroom, I searched 
through the 99 books in our library that have titles like "The Definitive, 
Comprehensive, Seek-No-Further, This-Time-We're-Not-Kidding, Really 
All-Inclusive Book on the World's Spices" and finding nothing on bois de Panama 
apart from a mention in an 1898 French book, Albert Seigneurie's "Dictionnaire 
Encyclopedique de l'Epicerie." Seigneurie wrote that b. de P. (as we now called 
it) was the bark of the Central American soap bark tree, Quillaja saponaria , 
which would foam when pulverized and mixed with water. It was sold as a sort of 
soap; no mention of any food use. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when INTERSPI was established. A trail that had gone cold in 1898 
called for more than uncoordinated amateur investigation. Saberi (now Detective 
Superintendent Saberi) assigned me, as librarian, to continue hunting through 
books (I am a bookish person) and tasting samples (I like Lebanese pastries) 
indefinitely, while she faxed queries around the world to chemists, botanists, 
linguists, food historians and pastry cooks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Colombian chemist working in Switzerland came up with the information that 
the majestic "Fenarolo's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients" (Cleveland: 1971) 
positively identified b. de P. as Quillaja saponaria and said reassuringly that 
the saponins that give it its foaming quality have "only low long-term 
toxicity." Saberi worried that certain investigators might be researching it in 
dangerous quantities. Happily, all but one have continued reporting back to HQ, 
the exception being Palo Alto food-science writer Harold McGee, who has not 
been heard from for weeks. (Henceforth we will include health warnings with all 
samples.) 
</P>
<P>
 We now believe there are not one or two but at least three plant substances 
that produce the b. de P. effect: 1) the Central American tree (now also being 
grown in North Africa, according to one U.S. source), though how it should have 
become a traditional ingredient in the Near East remains mysterious; 2) 
Saponaria officinalis , or common soapwort, a shrubby plant found in Europe, 
the Near East and elsewhere, the sap of which has been used as soap, and 3) 
Gypsophila paniculata , sometimes called soapwort root, which turns out to be 
an old friend -- it's one of the two plants florists call baby's breath. Two 
types of b. de P.-type plants are now undergoing long-term investigation by the 
Royal Botanic Garden at Kew, which has so far told us only that, whatever it 
is, b. de P. is one of the very few spices commonly used in fire extinguishers. 
</P>
<P>
 What will be the result of our quest for the true, authentic b. de P.? 
Inevitably, further growth in the size of INTERSPI. We have already had 
applications for admission from the likes of Prof. Arthur Tucker of Delaware 
State University and have committed ourselves to an annual dinner, a major 
international event at which Lebanese pastries will surely be on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But INTERSPI is not growing just because of the laws that cause the 
exponential growth of all new international organizations; it is growing 
because its subject matter, like a huge subterranean tide of white suds, has 
been soundlessly welling up and spreading. We have uneasy memories of the 
Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man in "Ghostbusters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have puzzled over the recipe for "naatiffe cream" in Claudia Roden's 
"A New Book of Middle Eastern Food" may feel like essaying a batch of natif, 
which has a texture a bit like seven-minute frosting and a curious, bittersweet 
flavor more like a tea than a spice. Of course, it requires finding soap bark, 
wort or root; your best bet is an herbalist or Latino botanica. We bought soap 
bark at Herbs of Mexico (3903 Whittier Blvd., East Los Angeles; (213) 
261-2521), which sells it already quite thoroughly chopped up.  
</P>
<P>
 We have found the recipe in Anissa Helou's book easier than Roden's, which 
calls for an unrealistically small amount of water. Unlike Roden's recipe, 
Helou's does not contain beaten egg white. It can be used as a sauce for the 
Arab molded butter cookies called maamoul. In Central Asian countries such as 
Uzbekistan, where natif (always including beaten egg white) is known as 
nishalla, it is eaten by itself as a sort of pudding.  
</P>
<P>
 BOIS DE PANAMA SAUCE (Natif) 
</P>
<P>
 2 ounces bois de Panama (soap bark), soap wort or soap wort root 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus Syrup 
</P>
<P>
 Chop bois de Panama small or pulverize. Rinse to remove any grit. Place in 
large saucepan, add water and boil until thickened and reduced to about 1/4 of 
original volume, about 10 minutes. Watch carefully. Mixture will foam and rise 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 Strain through cheesecloth into large mixing bowl. Beat at medium speed until 
mixture becomes very foamy, brilliant white and somewhat shiny, about 10 to 15 
minutes. Gradually add warm Citrus Syrup and fold in well to make elastic 
mousse. Leave to cool before refrigerating. Serve as dip with butter cookies. 
Makes about 10 cups, enough for 40-50 cookies. Citrus Syrup 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon rose or orange blossom water 
</P>
<P>
 Add sugar to water and cook over medium heat until dissolved. Then boil over 
high heat until temperature reaches 250 degrees, about 3 minutes. Stir in lemon 
juice and orange blossom water. Keep warm until use.

IN THE CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Glen Ellen Winery in 1983 began to make popular-priced Chardonnay, 
winemaker Bruce Rector knew he couldn't afford to buy new French oak barrels 
for the wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Such barrels were so expensive (today they run $600 each and may be used to 
full effect only three times) that they would have pushed the cost of the wine 
to such a level that it would no longer be popularly priced. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rector and Bob Rogers, co-owner of a Sonoma company called Innerstave, had 
already begun doing research into how to get wood flavor into wine without the 
excessive cost of new barrels. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to take oak chips, toast them to get a certain char smell, and 
then add them to the wine. This must be done carefully, but when it is, wine 
made from mediocre grapes is improved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Innerstave, which makes barrel inserts as its main business, 
says the money saved is significant. A new Innerstave, which would refresh an 
old barrel, costs about $103 installed. A pound of oak chips, which would 
flavor nearly two barrels of wine with oak aroma, costs $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done extensive research into the various toast levels (of the chips) 
for different wines," he says. "The flavor is a little different from what you 
get from a barrel, but it's close." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman said wineries use the chips in two ways, either floating them in 
the wine and stirring, or making a giant teabag out of cheesecloth and 
suspending the bag in the tank for 24 to 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Once used, oak chips may be used on a barbecue or discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources say the technique is widely used today in California by those 
who make low-priced wine, as well as by winemakers in Australia, Chile and 
Argentina. And at least two European firms, one in Germany and one in France, 
have bought charred oak chips for experiments. DAN BERGER

THE AMERICAN GRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIE SIMMONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wild rice is really not rice, nor is it as wild as it once was. So, how did it 
get its name? 
</P>
<P>
 One theory is that when the 17th-Century French explorers first encountered 
the grain in North America, they called it folle avoine , "crazy oats." It is 
speculated that this later became wild rice because of the similarity of the 
grain to common rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild rice is self-propagating in the lakes and rivers in the Northern Great 
Lakes region and is the only grain native to North America. Today, most of the 
wild rice found in the markets is cultivated in man-made paddies in Minnesota 
and California. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, throughout Minnesota and into Canada, original natural stands of wild 
rice continue to flourish. For Native American tribes of these regions, wild 
rice was once an important source of protein. Today, it is a necessary part of 
preserving the culture and heritage of the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been difficult to maintain the tradition of hand-harvested wild rice. 
But Dave Reinke, the manager of Manitok Wild Rice, a Native American-owned 
company in Callaway, Minn. that sells hand-harvested wild rice, reports: "Our 
1994 harvest has been excellent in both quality and quantity." 
</P>
<P>
 In and around the area of Callaway, the Ojibwa, also known as the Chippewa, 
gathered the rice as they guided their bark canoes between the rice stands, 
bending the stalks of rice with one short stick and threshing it with a second 
stick, causing the ripe grains to shower the bottom of the canoe. Today, the 
wild rice sold by Manitok is still gathered as it was long ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Rinse wild rice with cold water and drain well before cooking. To cook the 
rice, use three cups of liquid to one cup of rice. The full, nutty flavor of 
wild rice makes it possible to omit the salt without losing any flavor. It is 
wasteful to cook wild rice in enormous amounts of water and then throw away the 
excess since it is an extremely nutritious grain (much more so than common 
rice). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wild rice is cooked when most of the grains are cracked or opened, revealing 
the fluffy white interior, and the texture (taste it!) is just slightly chewy. 
Depending on the way the rice has been cured, this can take anywhere from 25 to 
50 minutes, so it is best to let your eye and taste be the final judge. If 
there is cooking water left in the pan, it will be absorbed by the rice when it 
stands, tightly covered, for 10 minutes before serving. Or, once the rice is 
done, uncover the pan and boil gently over medium heat until the water left in 
the bottom of the pan evaporates. One cup raw wild rice will yield 3 1/2 to 4 
cups cooked rice, depending on the quality of the rice. 
</P>

 With a big green salad, a piece of cheese, warm, crusty, whole-wheat rolls and 
a light dessert such as maple-flavored applesauce, the following soup makes a 
delicious supper on a chilly day. It can be prepared a day or two in advance 
and reheated just before serving.  
</P>
<P>
 BUTTERNUT SQUASH, APPLE AND WILD RICE SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 2 butternut or acorn squash, quartered and seeded 
</P>

stirring, until very tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger root and saute 1 
minute. Add apple juice and steamed squash and bring to boil. Cover and cook 
over low heat 10 minutes. Uncover and cool slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Puree liquids and solids together, in batches if necessary, in blender or food 
processor until smooth. Return soup to saucepan. Soup can be prepared up to 1 
day or several hours ahead to this point. Add wild rice, 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 
teaspoon salt (or to taste) and pepper. Add additional milk or broth to thin to 
desired consistency. (Thickness of soup will vary with amount of moisture in 
squash.) Reheat over low heat until steaming, but do not boil. Correct 
seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare garnish, melt 1 teaspoon butter in small skillet. Add nuts and 
saute until golden. Season to taste lightly with salt and cinnamon. Stir in 
parsley. Remove from heat.

WINE: QUERCUS CLOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there is any justice in this world, some day the government will require 
winemakers to label a varietal wine "Quercus Robur" and in smaller letters, 
"Grapes added for flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 Quercus robur is the Latin name for a French oak tree. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the flavor of barrels made from these trees that I am finding in such 
profusion in wines these days. The wood flavor is so dominant in so many wines 
that it's almost rare when a wine tastes like grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Call me old-fashioned, but if a wine is made from decent fruit, that is what 
I'd like to experience, not some tree. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The use of oak flavoring for wine is not new, but it has become a 
near-obsession for many in the California wine trade. The notion that oak -- 
notably barrels whose innards have been slightly charred -- is an essential 
part of fine wine is fostered by a few powerful wine writers who like this 
smell and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 This only encourages winemakers to pander to the tastes of these people and 
make wines that are ever oakier. One example: the 1985 Groth Vineyards Cabernet 
Sauvignon "Reserve" was an extremely oaky wine that received high marks from 
some wine reviewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, a Napa Valley winemaker complained to me: "Hey, if you guys like 
that kind of thing, I can do it too. You want oak? You'll get oak. It's a lot 
cheaper than grapes." 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, the practice of over-oaking wines began to infect Europe, 
even to the finest producers. In the last few vintages I have noted that 
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, tasted on release, has been more oaky than young 
Moutons I recall from the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, Mouton is a powerfully built wine that needs years -- often decades 
-- to become great, and whether this apparent trend toward more oak flavor will 
be a detriment down the road remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 As I see it, the problem with oak is most egregious in fine-quality white 
wines. Most of these wines are not made for aging. In particular, Chardonnays, 
white Burgundies, and now even Sauvignon Blancs are routinely being dumped into 
new French oak barrels and left to absorb enough of the barrels' smells to 
obliterate the delicate nuances of character that should be a part of the 
wine's essential offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst examples are wines that carry the word "reserve" on their label and 
cost $15 or more a bottle. More often than not, the same winery's regular, 
"non-reserve" bottling of the same grape variety is a better wine. (My guess is 
that winemakers figure if they're going to charge more for a wine, it has to 
have more oak to justify the higher price.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tasting through literally hundreds of white wines this year on a double-blind 
basis, I have found any number of high-priced wines that were too oaky. Were 
they bad? No, not if you like oak. But I prefer varietal character, and as the 
late winemaker Andre Tchelistcheff said, "If you taste the oak, it's not wine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chardonnay has become such a sledge hammer in terms of oak flavoring that I 
can't bear to drink many of them, which has driven me (happily) to Sauvignon 
Blanc. Unfortunately, even here the oak jockeys are at it. 
</P>
<P>
 The following wines once might have been at the top of anyone's list of great 
Sauvignon Blancs. Today they smell more like a sawmill: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Ferrari-Carano Fume Blanc "Reserve" ($14.50) -- Sweet honeyed scents 
with a toasty note, more like a dessert wine than a serious table wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Kendall-Jackson Winery Sauvignon Blanc "Proprietor's Grand Reserve" 
($14) -- More smoke and butterscotch than fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Matanzas Creek Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc ($13.75) -- Fresh melons and 
spice, but the oaky nuttiness dominates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Signorello Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc "Reserve" ($17) -- Mostly oak 
flavors, little if any fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Murphy-Goode Fume Blanc "Reserve" ($16) -- Pretty hard to know what 
grape made this wine, there is so much smoke in the aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong, I like oak flavoring when it is but a nuance, a trace to 
round out an otherwise fruity and complete wine. But there are far too few of 
these wines. 
</P>
<P>
 One wine that has this nuance as well as grand, complete Sauvignon Blanc fruit 
character is 1993 Napa Ridge ($4). You may think I'm kidding. A $4 wine is 
better than a $17 wine? Look, I tasted these wines double-blind. I tasted them 
a second time days later to verify what I was tasting, and the Napa Ridge wine 
is more definitively a Sauvignon Blanc than any of the five prior wines. 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for 1993 Sauvignon Blancs from Canyon Road ($6), Seghesio 
($7.50), J. Pedroncelli ($7.50), Kendall-Jackson Vintner's ($9.50) and a dozen 
more.

49ERS COVER ALL THE ANGLES; BASKETBALL: FROM THE LASER SHOW TO LONG BEACH 
STATE'S 71-64 VICTORY OVER DETROIT MERCY, OPENING NIGHT AT THE PYRAMID IS A 
HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When they wax nostalgic about the evening at Long Beach State -- they will, 
count on it -- anyone who had anything to do with the opening of The Pyramid 
can smile a smile of success. 
</P>
<P>
 They earned it. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited opening of the university's new arena was a smash, as Long 
Beach defeated Detroit Mercy, 71-64, Wednesday night in front of 5,021, the 
largest on-campus athletic crowd in Long Beach history. 
</P>
<P>
 A pregame laser show got the crowd in the mood -- and the basketball game kept 
it that way. Long Beach built a 12-point first-half lead, watched it shrink to 
three and then turned on the talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, senior forward Mike Atkinson led the way in the 49ers' season 
opener. Atkinson scored 21 points on seven of 11 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed some senior leadership tonight," Atkinson said. "I had the jitters 
early on, but as soon as that first shot went down, I felt great. After that, I 
was looking for my shot all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Seth Greenberg: "Mike was Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Mercy (1-1) was led by senior point guard Michael Jackson. Jackson 
scored 14 points and thoroughly impressed Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackson is a very good player," Greenberg said. "I thought we guarded the 
ball pretty well, but he made things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing by 12 in the first half, Detroit Mercy cut the lead to three, 
44-41, when Iyapo Montgomery made two free throws with 16 minutes 34 seconds to 
play in the game. But the 49ers picked up their defensive intensity, and pushed 
the lead to 52-45 on a basket by Atkinson with 14 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach regained command with 8:59 to play. An acrobatic shot under the 
basket by guard Jamie Davis gave the 49ers a 58-50 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then point guard Rasul Salahuddin, who had 10 points and three assists, 
brought the crowd to its feet. With 8:27 to play, Salahuddin drove the baseline 
and threw down a one-handed dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson was outstanding in the first half, scoring 13 points as the 49ers' 
led, 42-32, entering halftime. Atkinson gave Long Beach its first lead in The 
Pyramid, 20-19, by making two free throws with 9:33 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Atkinson, who led the nation in field-goal percentage last season, 
was at his best near the basket. His teammates got him the ball in the post and 
Atkinson made four of his five shots. He also was five of seven from the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach led by as many as 12 points. Two free throws by reserve forward 
Brian Yankelevitz put the 49ers ahead, 36-24, with 3:56 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Juaquin Hawkins also played well in the first 20 minutes, leading the 49ers 
with five rebounds, two blocked shots and scoring seven points. Long Beach shot 
50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson caused the 49ers many first-half problems. The speedy point guard 
scored the first points in The Pyramid's history, making a three-pointer at 
19:25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans' best outside shooter, Jackson made three three-pointers in the 
first half and led Detroit Mercy with 11 points. Fortunately for Long Beach, 
Salahuddinlimited Jackson's drives to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who usually penetrates whenever he feels like it, was limited in 
setting up teammates for open shots. With Jackson controlling the tempo, 
Detroit Mercy took an early 15-10 lead on Jackson's third three-pointer at 
15:40. But the Titans went cold. Over the next 10 minutes, Long Beach outscored 
Detroit Mercy, 26-9. The Titans shot only 41% for the half.

UCI LOSES; ANTEATERS: HALFTIME ADJUSTMENT ISN'T ENOUGH TO SLOW OKLAHOMA, WHICH 
CRUISES TO 99-77 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The No. 1 three-point shooter in the nation last season made his return home 
to Oklahoma Wednesday night, but it certainly wasn't a victory tour. Cancel the 
ticker-tape parade. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the long-range bombs of UC Irvine's Chris Brown that wowed the crowd 
of 6,485 in the Lloyd Noble Center. It was Oklahoma forward Ryan Minor who made 
his first 10 shots, including five three-pointers, and had tied his career-high 
with 30 points . . . in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters made a Minor adjustment at halftime, but it wasn't enough to 
offset the Sooners' major advantage -- 52-35 at halftime -- and Oklahoma (2-0) 
cruised to a 99-77 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys just got me the ball when I was open . . . and I was open a lot," 
said Minor, who finished with 15 rebounds and 36 points after making 13 of 21 
shots from the floor. His 10-for-10 start set a Big Eight record, eclipsing the 
eight in a row made by Kansas' Danny Manning in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan is both a shooter and a scorer," said Oklahoma's first-year coach, 
Kelvin Sampson, "but what pleased me most was that every one of his shots came 
out of our offense. He didn't force anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who grew up in Muskogee, Okla., and had about 100 family members and 
friends in the crowd, was totally frustrated by the belly-to-belly defense of 
Sooner guard John Ontjes. Brown gave his personal cheering section very little 
to applaud, scoring nine points after making one of six three-pointers and six 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really up for coming home and having a great game, really tearing it 
up," Brown said. "But they played me really well and just took me out of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Irvine Coach Rod Baker took him out of the game. Brown played only 25 
minutes. "I would've put me on the bench too, if I was coaching," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontjes, who "did exactly what we asked him to," according to Sampson, not only 
stopped Brown, but scored 18 points, which included 10 of 10 free throws. He 
also had 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (0-1) were pretty much out of it midway through the first half 
when Minor hit his fourth three-pointer to give the Sooners a 33-18 lead. 
Irvine managed to crawl back to within 11 when freshman Kevin Simmons scored on 
a layup to cut Oklahoma's lead to 60-49, but Minor, who had been held scoreless 
for the first 12 minutes of the second half, made two free throws and a 
baseline jumper and the Sooners were rolling again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had any rhythm tonight," Baker said, "especially in the first half. 
We just never got it going for two or three possessions in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shot the ball extremely well, but we can't allow 50 points in a half and 
expect to do very well." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a physical game and, because of the Anteaters' frustration level, 
filled with technical fouls. Irvine forward Shaun Battle was ejected in the 
first half for allegedly throwing a punch at Minor and Irvine forward Michael 
Tate and Sooner forward Antonio Bobo were each assessed technicals after a 
second-half scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we caught a break on the call (on Battle)," Baker said. "That was a 
stupid thing for a junior to do and he could have been out for two games for 
it. I didn't see it, but I believe the official who told me he threw a punch." 
</P>
<P>
 Battle said he was "just trying to establish position," and at no time 
resorted to fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the Anteaters, who had three and sometimes four new players on the 
floor most of the night, are still a long way from becoming a cohesive unit. 
They played decent defense in the second half, holding Oklahoma to only six 
points in the first seven minutes, but couldn't string together enough offense 
to get back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can play much better," said Simmons, who made seven of 10 shots from the 
field and scored 16 points. "We just have to work on getting better every game 
as the season goes on."

 Ron Shelton, who wrote and produced the film "Bull Durham," told Peter Gammons 
of the Boston Globe that he got the name, Crash Davis, played by Kevin Costner, 
out of a minor league encyclopedia.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the film was released, the real Crash Davis called Shelton and 
assured him he wouldn't sue for the use of his name. 
</P>
<P>
 But he asked, "Do I get the girl?" 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Shelton: "Not only do you get the girl, but you get Susan Sarandon." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Davis: Gammons writes that Davis later became friends with the filmmaker. 
In Shelton's latest film, "Cobb," the man who plays Wahoo Sam Crawford is 
Lawrence Columbus (Crash) Davis, who once played for Connie Mack's Philadelphia 
Athletics before setting a doubles record with the Durham (N.C.) Bulls.

 Trivia time: Who holds the NCAA Division I basketball record for points in a

 Ultra hype: Raymont Harris, Chicago Bear rookie running back, wants to be 
known as "Ultra Back."

<P>
 "See, the way I'm constructed at six feet and 225 pounds, I'm not a halfback. 
But I'm not a fullback either because I can do more things than a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an ultra back. I can run the ball, catch the ball, block, do everything. 
An ultra back does it all." 
</P>

"He's like Tony Dorsett. He goes from 0 to 60 with no gears. He's here, right

 War of 1994: The British Columbia Lions' 26-23 victory over Baltimore on 
Sunday in the Grey Cup game for the Canadian Football League championship 
sparked a war of words: 
</P>
<P>
 From Pete McMartin of the Vancouver Sun: "This is not the first time a 
Baltimore team has met a Canadian team in a championship. They met once before. 
It was for the championship of North America, in a series known as the War of 
1812. The best Baltimore managed -- even with the home-field advantage -- was a 
draw. Baltimore played a defensive game. We were on offence." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Ray Frager of the Baltimore Sun: "A draw? Oh, yeah, Mr. Big Shot 
Historian Pete McMartin, you don't even know how to spell offense. And you had 
to steal from Baltimore to get a name for your newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Different tempo: C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle on the resignation 
of Stanford Coach Bill Walsh:  
</P>
<P>
 "When (Stanford) had the ball, Walsh's teams have quick-stepped up and down 
the field with the snap and precision of the USC drum and bugle corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, on defense they looked more like the Stanford band."

NEWSWIRE: ANGELS GO A BIT WILD, ADD MITCH WILLIAMS

<P>
 Mitch Williams, the relief pitcher nicknamed "Wild Thing," signed a one-year, 
$500,000 non-guaranteed contract with the Angels on Wednesday. Williams could 
earn as much as $2 million in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think he's going to help our ballclub, but certainly a byproduct of 
signing Mitch Williams is that he has personality," Angel President Richard 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who has had control problems throughout his career, is being brought 
to the Angels to be their left-handed setup man. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still are pursuing free agent Lee Smith or John Wetteland of 
Montreal to be their closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams led the National League with 43 saves for the Philadelphia Phillies 
in 1993, but blew two saves during the National League playoffs and two more 
during the World Series against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies traded him to Houston for reliever Doug Jones, and by May 31, the 
Astros released him. BOB NIGHTENGALE

defraud the French bank Credit Lyonnais, Bank of America, First Los Angeles 
Bank and Union Bank of $135.5 million.She is the seventh individual to have 
been charged in the government's investigation into McNall's businesses. McNall

KEEPING TRACK / JASON REID: STANFORD'S MCLAREN FINDS HERSELF IN AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's definitely something to be said for occasionally getting away from it 
all, Stanford junior Maureen McLaren believes, especially when it becomes 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 A key member of Stanford's powerful women's volleyball and swimming teams, 
McLaren needed a boost -- in a big way -- after her sophomore year. So during 
summer break, McLaren bolted from pristine Palo Alto for 2 1/2 weeks in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaren's perspective has improved -- and not only about sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an amazing thing," said McLaren, a former volleyball, swimming and 
basketball standout at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you grow up in Newport Beach and go to (college) in Palo Alto, you 
really don't get to see where other people are coming from . . . how other 
people live. Obviously, it's something I don't think I'll ever forget." 
</P>
<P>
 McLaren traveled in the east African nation of Tanzania, a member of the 
British Commonwealth, researching epic folklore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to people tell stories, saw dances and other performances," 
McLaren said. "I got to see so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 She was part of a program in which individuals pay to join scholars studying 
abroad and assist in their research. McLaren studies American history and 
culture at Stanford and could have received college credit for the endeavor, 
but that wasn't her focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a real eye-opener for me as far as race and people's conception of 
race," she said. "It was weird to have people looking at me because I (am) 
white, to see how that feels." 
</P>
<P>
 Time away from pools and volleyball courts helped McLaren clear her head and 
charge her batteries. She maintained an intense schedule for two years, and the 
effects of the constant rush were catching up with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets brutal sometimes," she said. "During the spring quarter, both sports 
overlap. I (practice) volleyball in the morning and swimming in the afternoon, 
and last year it got to me." 
</P>
<P>
 McLaren (6 feet 1) started at outside hitter and middle blocker for the 
Cardinal as a sophomore after being a reserve as a freshman on the 1992 NCAA 
championship team. She swims the 100 and 200 backstroke, helping the swim team 
win national championships as a freshman and sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 She's the first Cardinal woman to win two national titles in one year. 
However, the grind of the last two seasons left her wondering if the 
accomplishments were worth her frantic pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time off just changed my whole outlook on why I play sports," McLaren 
said. "It's not about the winning, it's about getting up everyday and 
practicing with the best people, having amazing people as friends, having great 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why it's all worth it. So many people wish they could do this and 
never get a chance. I look back and think, 'How could I be so selfish?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her improved outlook arrived just in time. McLaren was beaten out for a 
starting position at both middle blocker and outside hitter this season. 
</P>
<P>
 She has played in 18 of Stanford's 28 matches and has only 48 kills after 112 
last season. But Stanford (27-1) won the Pacific 10 Conference and is ranked 
second in the nation behind Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal is seeded No. 1 in the NCAA tournament's West Region, and McLaren 
has an excellent shot at winning her fourth national championship. Cardinal 
Coach Don Shaw said McLaren is a great influence on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been successful and she knows what team success is and how to achieve 
it," Shaw said.  
</P>
<P>

 Craig Thomas deftly handled the 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, impromptu history tests, 
mopping, scrubbing and hours of in-his-face intimidation by older, bigger guys. 
So juggling 21.5 units and starting at goalkeeper for the Air Force Academy is 
a breeze, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah, it's still kind of rough," said Thomas, a sophomore. "But you learn to 
adjust. I'm thinking about my future when I get out of here, and I think I'll 
have a pretty solid future ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section Division II player of the year as a senior at Esperanza, 
Thomas took off for Colorado Springs, Colo.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas (6-1, 180) was a key to the Falcons' Western Water Polo Assn. 
championship. In 30 games, he averaged 9.5 saves and only gave up 7.8 goals. 
Air Force was 19-11 and finished seventh in the NCAA championships won by 
Stanford on Sunday at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. A civil engineering major, 
Thomas said he has maintained a 2.83 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenge was coping with being a cadet fourth class, known to 
those outside the military as a freshman. Upperclassmen routinely quiz freshmen 
on Air Force knowledge and freshmen are required to clean up after their more 
experienced classmates. Throw in mandatory 5:30 a.m. wake-up and marching to 
meals, and that's a tough first year.

SANTA ANA VALLEY IS TOO QUICK FOR SONORA IN 61-45 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ike Harmon led all scorers with 24 points and the Santa Ana Valley used 
superior quickness to run past Sonora, 61-45, Wednesday at Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
 Backing Harmon was Michael Riggins, who scored eight of his 11 points in the 
fourth quarter, and Olujimi Mann, who had 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team shot especially well -- the Falcons (1-0) were 22 of 61, the 
Raiders (0-1) 19 of 57 -- but Santa Ana Valley made seven three-pointers and 
forced 18 turnovers in the nonleague game in front of about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't stick to the game plan at all," Sonora Coach Mike Murphy said. "If 
we play the half-court game, we're in it. But as soon as we get into the 
transition game and start running with them, that was the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora center Craig Clark had 21 points, 17 rebounds and six of Sonora's seven 
blocked shots -- including a spectacular stuff of a Harmon dunk attempt in the 
third quarter. Nonetheless, the Falcons' fronting, rotating zone defense kept 
Clark scoreless in the fourth quarter until there was only 2 minutes 8 seconds 
left in game. By that time, Santa Ana Valley was ahead, 58-38. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora's last lead was 19-18 in the second quarter, but Santa Ana Valley ran 
off 10 consecutive points and took a 28-21 halftime lead. The Falcons blew open 
the game with an 8-2 run to start the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora never got closer than 10 points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley was missing three players -- Jermaine Robinson was ill and at 
home, Robert Martin was declared ineligible and Virgil Forbin had an injured 
ankle.

CAL LUTHERAN CAN'T HOLD COURT, 90-81; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AZUSA PACIFIC PUTS AN 
END TO THE KINGSMEN'S 18-GAME HOME WINNING STREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cal Lutheran faced crises at the midpoint of each half against Azusa Pacific 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen rallied with three-point shooting to erase an eight-point deficit 
in the first half. But when faced with a similar scenario in the second half, 
turnovers and second opportunities for Azusa Pacific resulted in a 90-81 
nonconference men's basketball defeat for the Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss broke an 18-game home-court winning streak for the Kingsmen (3-1) 
dating to last February. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Clark had 27 points and seven rebounds for Cal Lutheran but 11 
second-half turnovers and a 45-29 rebounding margin for Azusa Pacific (4-2) 
offset Clark's contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a tough period with the turnovers; it was an uphill battle we had to 
fight the rest of the game," Clark said. "And we couldn't get on a run at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen lost the lead for good two minutes into the second half and 
quickly fell behind, 52-45. Cal Lutheran couldn't get closer than four points 
the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Tutt, who scored 32 points, and former Santa Clara High and Ventura 
College standout Steve Amar, who added 12, kept the Cougars in front down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific's lead grew to 87-73 with just over a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Ulloa scored 15 points and Mark Heerema added 14 for Cal Lutheran but 
Ulloa made only five of 20 shots, including two of 10 from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually our shots fall -- in the first half they did, in the second they 
didn't," Cal Lutheran Coach Rich Rider said. "Not when we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran's shooting percentage actually improved in the second half from 
42.9% to 50.0% but the Kingsmen made only one of seven three-point shots after 
intermission. Heerema hit from long range in the final minute after the outcome 
had been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacifc stayed close in the opening minutes with a powerful inside game. 
Paul Perkins, who had 14 points and eight rebounds, scored six points as the 
Cougars missed just one of nine two-point attempts in the first six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark was the Kingsmen offense with 11 early points before picking up his 
second foul. Azusa Pacific turned a 19-17 deficit into a 30-22 lead with Clark 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran responded with a 14-2 run and built a 43-40 halftime lead.

DALY SAYS HE HASN'T GIVEN UP ON RAMS; FOOTBALL: ANAHEIM MAYOR TELLS JOHN SHAW 
THAT CITY IS SERIOUS ABOUT KEEPING TEAM, EVEN IF A NEW STADIUM IS NECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly assured Ram President John Shaw on Wednesday that the city is 
serious about keeping the Rams in Orange County, even if that means building a 
stadium for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly's presence at a meeting with Shaw and sports agent Leigh Steinberg, 
co-chairman of the Save the Rams task force, was the city's most public gesture 
toward the team since they invoked their escape clause on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make sure it was clear that Anaheim will keep working to try and 
find a package and formula that makes sense," said Daly, who also promoted the 
city's vision for a sports complex that would surround the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams' latest plan is to build a football stadium on the Anaheim 
Stadium parking lot and demolish the old stadium. This is a dramatic shift from 
the group's original offer, which involved a $60 million renovation of Anaheim 
Stadium, converting it to a football-only facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium proposal would require funding from the city of Anaheim, the 
county, the private sector and the Rams. Shaw said the Rams would "consider any 
deal that's competitive with any of the other cities" courting the team, but 
groups in St. Louis and Baltimore aren't asking the Rams to help with stadium 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think it's fair to them (Save the Rams) to attack their 
proposal without having some more details," Shaw said. "We have said 
continually that any situation that can provide the franchise to be competitive 
in the future and acquire talent, is something we're interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the idea of a new stadium was discussed only conceptually and it 
could be several weeks before more details are available and any type of 
timetable is set. But Daly said he thinks such an idea is realistic given 
Anaheim's track record with sports venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a city which found a way to build a beautiful new arena when a lot of 
people said it couldn't be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a deadline for the Rams' decision to stay or go was believed to be 
imminent, Save the Rams might have more time to work on its proposal. In St. 
Louis, former U.S. Senator Thomas Eagleton, who heads the group attempting to 
bring the Rams to a 70,000-seat domed stadium being built in that city, has 
backed off his Dec. 1 target date for completion of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the best efforts of all concerned, the Dec. 1 target date will not be 
met," Eagleton said in a prepared statement. "Some vital issues remain, which 
will take additional time to resolve. We will not now set a new target date. We 
shall simply pledge to give our full attention to resolve these vital issues as 
best we can in a timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 1 and Dec. 15 have been mentioned as target dates for a decision by the 
Rams. But Shaw said Wednesday that a decision would only have to be made by 30 
days before the league meetings March 12-17 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said the Orange County group will "move rapidly" to work out details 
of their stadium proposal and hopes it will come in time to dissuade the team 
from accepting another offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to keep the team or want to attract another NFL team, it's going 
to take a new stadium," Steinberg said. "Hopefully, if we build it, they will 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Wednesday there are still "a whole bunch of open issues" with the 
St. Louis proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that deal was acceptable to us, it would have been executed by now," Shaw 
said. "We've been negotiating with St. Louis and continue to do so. We haven't 
reached the point where I feel I can take a completed transaction for 
approval."

CEBALLOS AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN IT; LAKERS: AFTER CLEVELAND WINS BY 38, FORWARD 
WONDERS WHY HE'S NOT MORE INVOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Near the end, which, mercifully, came quickly for the Lakers, he sat at his 
customary spot for a timeout, right next to the bench on the edge of the 
scorer's table. And even when play resumed and he had been replaced for garbage 
time, Cedric Ceballos stayed there for a moment and wondered if he should say 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 Should he say something about not being a big enough part of the offense? 
Should he demand the ball more, as some teammates have encouraged him to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos decided to remain silent, much the way the Lakers had been silenced 
Wednesday night in a 117-79 trouncing by the Cleveland Cavaliers at Gund Arena 
that halted the winning streak at five games and marked the third-worst defeat 
in franchise history. Their fastest game of the season, one hour 58 minutes, 
only seemed to drag on for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Ceballos played 31 minutes but got only 11 shots, making five, 
while contributing 11 points and seven rebounds. The night before, he scored 18 
points in the first quarter, but had only five shots over the final 17:22 as 
the Lakers rallied from a 16-point deficit with eight minutes left in the 
fourth quarter for a double-overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not only recent history, either. He had only three shots in the fourth 
quarter of a one-point loss the first week at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The supposed go-to guy is leading the team with a 19.7 scoring average and is 
second only to Vlade Divac with 8.8 rebounds. But the supposed go-to guy is 
also wondering if he really is the primary option in the offense, the role he 
was supposed to assume after being acquired from the Phoenix Suns in late 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Point: He has taken 48 more shots than any other Laker. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterpoint: He is averaging 16.2 shots a game, barely more than the 15 he 
got last season while playing with Charles Barkley, Kevin Johnson and Dan 
Majerle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really frustrating," Ceballos said after the Lakers' biggest loss 
since April 22, 1990, when Pat Riley benched three starters at Portland to rest 
for the playoffs. "I know I have a knack for fighting inside and getting loose 
balls. But it's just a situation where you tell me how it's going to be and 
then it doesn't happen, and that kind of clicks in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go to the coach and say I want this. I can't go to the point guard 
and say I want this. I think it's too frustrating to everyone to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like doing it a lot of times," he said. "I always cry wolf about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though tempted, he hasn't spoken up about the lighter-than-expected load 
because he is concerned in the early going about fitting in as the newcomer, 
or, as he calls it, the outcast. Besides, he doesn't want to rock the boat as 
the Lakers goes through one of their best stretches in about two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days, I get lucky and guys pass me the ball and I get opportunities," he 
said. "Other times, it's like day and night." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran teammates like Sedale Threatt and Sam Bowie and assistant coach 
Michael Cooper have urged him to step forward and demand the ball more. 
Ceballos hasn't felt comfortable enough to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crunch time is what he's missing," Threatt said. "That'll come in time. This 
is a new team. We'll get 25 or 30 games together and things like that should 
come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers only wish there would have been such a thing as crunch time against 
the Cavaliers. There wasn't much of anything after early in the second quarter, 
when Cleveland broke the game open with a 15-4 run sparked by Danny Ferry and 
then continued to pour it on. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors never got closer than 13 points in the third quarter and went 
into the final period trailing by 19. A second consecutive monster comeback 
never materialized for the Lakers, who were outrebounded, 59-30, and 
surrendered 30 offensive boards to a Cleveland team coming off a four-day rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very precise and put on a clinic," Coach Del Harris said of the 
Cavaliers, who shot 52.1% and got 16 points from three players. "They beat our 
butts really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad enough to break -- obliterate is more like it -- the Lakers' four-game 
road winning streak, their longest since Jan. 17-Feb. 1, 1991. Now they need a 
quick recovery. Houston comes to the Forum on Friday.

<P>
 Oh, dear! Now I can't go to Oregon anymore! 
</P>
<P>
 I'm running out of places. I'll be reduced to Skaneateles, N.Y., next thing 
you know. 
</P>
<P>
 What did I do? Knock Mt. Hood? Hell, no! I wouldn't be that stupid! Pooh-pooh 
Crater Lake? Naw! Love Crater Lake. Sneer at Coos Bay? Not me! 
</P>
<P>
 All I did was suggest maybe their college football team was a little 
overmatched in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, all right, a lot overmatched. But, shoot, that's what I'm paid for. No 
need to get mad at a little honest journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I did suggest if sadism was your bag, you go to Pasadena on Jan. 2. That 
it was better than watching them club baby seals. But that was just a little 
journalistic excess. I always get carried away like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Gang Green (that's what Oregon calls itself) fights back. These Donald 
Ducks make the original seem even-tempered. Here are a few of their salvos. 
Stand back so you won't get any on you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Murray,

 The article you released today is the poorest example of journalism I have 
ever had the misfortune of reading!"

 Disrespectfully yours,

 Moody Larson, Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoot, Moods, you should read me more often! I've been a lot poorer than that. 
"Jim Murray, 
</P>
<P>
 When travelers on the Oregon Trail got to the point where they could either go 
straight or veer off and go to California, the legend states that those who 
could read went to Oregon. The rest went. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Cosgrove 
</P>
<P>
 Naw, Bryan. The ones who had umbrellas went to Oregon. "Sirs, 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Murray has offended our entire state, the University of Oregon, and its 
coaches and players. Mr. Murray could have made his points without relying on 
this type of bush-league commentary. We demand his apology for a very 
inappropriate editorial. We would appreciate seeing Mr. Murray's reaction in 
one of his future columns." 
</P>
<P>
 Unsigned 
</P>
<P>
 My first city editor told me "Never apologize, never explain." He'd roll 
around in his grave if I were to start now. Maybe, so would I. "Mr. Murray, 
</P>
<P>
 After reading your ignorant, irresponsible and offensive article, I found it 
to be written by an uninformed and extremely biased commentator. The facts are 
that both schools have two common opponents: USC and Iowa. Penn State beat USC 
at home, 38-14; Oregon went on the road without its starting quarterback, 
running back, two offensive linemen and two additional starting defensive backs 
and beat USC, 22-7. Penn State destroyed Iowa, 61-21; Oregon easily handled 
them, 40-18, the week before. I do not think the game will be a blowout." 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for your time, 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey M. Gray 
</P>
<P>
 You're welcome, Jeffrey. But I can prove anything by comparative scores. That 
Harvard would beat Notre Dame, maybe. Or Grenada would beat the United States 
of America. "Sirs, 
</P>
<P>
 I believe Jim Murray owes the people of the state of Oregon, the University of 
Oregon athletic department and, most importantly, the U of O football team an 
abject apology." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Cole, 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa, Charlie! Abject?! Webster defines "abject" as "sunk to low condition, 
cast down in spirit, servile, showing utter resignation." Not my style, 
Charlie. If I were given to abject, I'd be a butler. "Attn. Jim Murray, 
</P>
<P>
 Hello, is anybody home? I heard you were blind, but deaf and dumb? Come on, 
where have you been for the last two months? In a fancy, posh, pampered L.A. 
health club getting colonics by the hour?"

 I guess a reservation at the cafe for Saturday night is completely out of the

<P>
 You are a pompous, arrogant jerk!" 
</P>
<P>
 A disgruntled Oregonian 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you think I know that?  
</P>
<P>
 "To Jim Murray, 
</P>
<P>
 Your attitude toward the University of Oregon football team and their ability 
to compete is the absolute epitome of ignorance and arrogance! The strength and 
character (not to mention talent) it takes to accomplish what the Ducks have 
this season simply cannot be overlooked -- even by someone that wears 
three-inch-thick eyeglasses! Your failure to mention anything positive about 
the U of O team is the worst display of journalism imaginable. Whatever 
happened to objectivity?" 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. McCallum 
</P>
<P>
 It died about 1944 or thereabouts, Mac. Done in by a football fan, I believe. 
"Mr. Murray, 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to plagiarize a recent comment from Jessy (sic) Helms to 
President Clinton: 'If you come to Oregon, you better bring a bodyguard.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Whisman 
</P>
<P>
 And an umbrella. "Jim, 
</P>
<P>
 Please explain to your marginally literate readers outside of Oregon that 
there is a whole entire state between California and Washington! And its Pac-10 
teams began their rivalry 100 years ago, well before others on the West Coast. 
We Oregonians will rest easy knowing our inferiors lack the attention span 
necessary to find Oregon and move there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Weber 
</P>
<P>
 We know there's a state there, Dan. We see all those Oregon license plates on 
I-5 driving down to Palm Springs to spend the winter. Who do they leave in 
charge up there, Bob Packwood? "Murray, 
</P>
<P>
 Self-centered, egotistical, Southern California trash! Southern California 
schools went 1-2 vs. Oregon schools. And do we have to remind you of the USC 
loss to the Ducks? Take your smoggy, overpopulated, filth-ridden metropolis and 
shove it."

USC ASSISTANT LINDSEY QUITS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR HAD 'A 
KIND OF CLASH' WITH ROBINSON AT END OF SEASON.

<P>
 Don Lindsey, apparently at odds with Coach John Robinson, abruptly resigned 
Wednesday as USC's defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey, 51, whose defense has been criticized recently, left after a meeting 
with Robinson Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Said a team source, "It was kind of a clash, toward the end of the season. 
John has his own philosophy of defense, and Lindsey is kind of a 'it's my way 
or the highway' kind of guy, and it came to a head." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey could not be reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision was reached mutually between Don and I and is effective 
immediately," said Robinson, in a brief USC news release.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has been released from his responsibilities now so he can pursue other 
coaching opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 USC completed a 7-3-1 regular season and will play Texas Tech in the Cotton 
Bowl on Jan. 2. Lindsey, who has worked for some of the most prominent head 
coaches in modern American football, had completed his second season under 
Robinson and, like Robinson, was in his second term as a USC coach.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojan defense has been under criticism of late, and Robinson was one of 
the critics.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 31-19 loss to UCLA on Nov. 19, Robinson was visibly unhappy afterward 
that UCLA had rushed for 232 yards against the Trojans. And Notre Dame netted 
226 yards on the ground in the Irish-Trojan tie last Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that disappoints me more than anything is how they were able to run 
on us," said Robinson, moments after the loss to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that UCLA's offensive line overpowered USC's defensive front in 
the second half, a fact commented upon by USC players afterward. In the Notre 
Dame game, the Irish netted 341 total yards and had the ball 38 minutes 30 
seconds, to USC's 21:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey's defense played most of the season with a core of four seniors, all 
at linebacker and in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 All his defensive front starters at season's end were freshmen and sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior linebackers Brian Williams and Jeff Kopp led the team in tackles. 
Remaining senior starters were linebackers Errol Small and Donn Cunnigan and 
cornerback John Herpin. 
</P>
<P>
 During USC's late-season, five-game winning streak, Lindsey worried about 
mental fatigue on the part of his players, particularly after the hard-fought 
victories over Washington State (23-10) and Arizona (45-28). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're giving up yards, but we're hanging in there on giving up points," he 
had said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been scratching and clawing, every down. Are they (the players) 
mentally tired? I don't know. That's a hard thing to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey coached under John McKay at USC from 1971-75.  
</P>
<P>
 Never a head coach, Lindsey worked on staffs led by Bear Bryant (Alabama, 
1965-66); Jim Sweeney (Montana State and Washington State, 1967-69); Frank 
Broyles (Arkansas, 1970); McKay, Robinson (1976-80); Lou Holtz (Arkansas, 
1981-83); Bill Curry (Georgia Tech, Alabama, 1984-90) and Bob Stull (Missouri, 
1992).  
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, speaking of his second USC stint under Robinson, Lindsey said: "I 
never in my career enjoyed coaching football as much as I did in my years with 
Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes sure the game is fun for everyone around him. I just enjoy sitting 
around with him and talking about football." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lindsey may not have had much fun lately.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey was Robinson's first hire in January 1993, after he was hired for a 
second term as USC's head coach. In fact, Robinson said later his first 
football call upon getting the job was to Lindsey.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson hired Lindsey as offensive coordinator, but that lasted one week. 
Mike Nolan had joined Robinson as defensive coordinator but left after a week 
to take a job with the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said at USC's football awards banquet Wednesday night that he would 
not discuss the matter until today. 
</P>
<P>
 The move stunned some players. Matt Keneley, starting defensive tackle, said, 
"I was surprised, all of us were surprised. I was coming out of class and John 
Herpin and Scott Fields told me. I was totally surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Said linebacker Israel Ifeanyi: "I was shocked. When I heard it, I thought it 
was just a rumor."

WRECKING BALL; RAIDER NOSE GUARD A BRIGHT SPOT AS THE NEWEST FORCE IN THE 
MIDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no question that Raider nose guard Jerry Ball is a force in the 
middle. Just ask the offensive linemen around the NFL who have gone up against 
him over the last eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry Ball is the man ," New Orleans Saint guard Jim Dombrowski said. "When 
he gets in the middle, he's a load to move." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 1 and several late-night meals over his listed 300 pounds, Ball has 
been a pleasant surprise this season for the Raiders after signing as a free 
agent from the Cleveland Browns during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said all along that he's a player," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "He's 
done everything we expected from him this season." 
</P>
<P>
 After the retirement of Howie Long and the release of Greg Townsend, other 
players turned to Ball as a veteran leader of the Raiders' defensive line. In 
their traditional 4-3 scheme, Ball began training camp as a reserve defensive 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the season started, it did not take long for the Raiders to realize 
that Ball's best role is as a starter creating havoc by lining up over opposing 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball can dominate an opponent's rushing attack with quickness and strength. 
Since his arrival, the Raiders' run defense has become the most improved area 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Pittsburgh Steelers ran for 175 yards last Sunday, the Raiders had 
the best run-stopping defense in the AFC, thanks to Ball and his fellow 
linemen, Chester McGlockton, Nolan Harrison and Anthony Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you follow my career, you'd notice that wherever I played, no one ran up 
the middle," Ball said. "I've always been the man in the middle. Even when I 
was playing in the Pro Bowl, I never had too many sacks. My specialty is 
stopping the run and making the people around me better." 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, who will turn 30 in two weeks, is still relatively young for a defensive 
lineman. But word around the league last summer was that he was washed up. 
</P>
<P>
 After being the 63rd pick in the third round of the 1987 draft by Detroit, 
Ball was a three-time Pro Bowl player with the Lions. But he was sidelined 
because of a knee injury at the end of the 1991 season by a chop-block by New 
York Jet running back Brad Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Baxter's block was legal. But the next year, the NFL instituted 
the so-called Jerry Ball Rule, which outlawed the type of block that had 
injured him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, who sat out the playoffs because of the injury, got off to slow start in 
1992 and soon was labeled a clubhouse lawyer who no longer could dominate a 
game because he was overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the start of the 1993 season, Ball was traded to Cleveland for a 
third-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what really happened in Detroit, and it did not concern what I did on 
the field," said Ball, a popular player who wrote a column for local newspapers 
during his career with the Lions. "In Detroit, I guess you can say that I was a 
little bit more involved in areas they really didn't want players involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 One person who did not care for Ball's outspokenness was Chuck Schmidt, the 
club's executive vice president who spearheaded the trade to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "My last year there, I was told by the coaches that I should just worry about 
playing," Ball said. "So I just stepped aside and did my job and did what I was 
asked to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ball's frustration with Detroit's losing led him to join the Browns.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of putting up with things that were not conducive for winning at 
Detroit," he said. "I felt that I was being asked to sacrifice my body for an 
organization that did not have a clear agenda for winning. They didn't really 
want to attack the problems and correct them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns thought they had a steal with Ball as they teamed him with Pro Bowl 
defensive tackle Michael Dean Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems with Cleveland surfaced at contract time. After helping the 
Browns to a 3-0 start, Ball had his agent, David Ware, approach the team for a 
contract extension before the midseason signing deadline since he was in the 
final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns reportedly offered Ball a three-year deal worth about $1.6 million 
per year; Ball was asking for $2 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it became clear that Ball was not going to back down, the Browns began 
questioning his weight and work habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Perry signed a three-year deal worth about $3.16 million a year last 
December, Ball knew it was time to move on. That's when the Raiders entered the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball signed a one-year contract with the Raiders for much less than what he 
would have received from Cleveland because of championship potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to retire, but I made an investment in myself," said Ball, who 
owns an NFL-licensed sportswear company. "My first conversation I had with 
(Shell), I took his hand and I told him to touch me and said, 'I'm a big 
person. I'm not going to disappear, you understand? It's not much more that I 
can do.' And he told me, 'Hey, you're talking to a big guy. I understand.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In a disappointing season, Ball has been a Raider bright spot. In 12 games, he 
has 38 tackles and two sacks. He is tied among defensive linemen for the lead 
in pass deflections with four. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Ball surprised with his success this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand economics and I understand this business probably better than 
99% of the players in this league," Ball said. "I know how to function in this 
system. I turned down a lot more money to stay with Cleveland. It wasn't 
because of the dollar, it was because of principle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only a surprise to people who buy into the things that are inconsistent 
with the truth. Those are the only people that are surprised. Jerry Ball the 
man is not surprised because I'm doing the same things that I did in Cleveland. 
I'm just a person who's very comfortable with who he is."

FOX WILL KEEP EYE ON GOLF BATTLE; TELEVISION: NETWORK WON'T TAKE PART IN LEGAL 
CONFLICTS BETWEEN PGA TOUR AND WORLD TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fox Television is not the bad guy in the World Golf Tour's conflict with the 
PGA Tour, said David Evans, the network's president and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to say Rupert Murdoch has thrown his money around and he and Greg 
Norman have tried to take over golf, but that's not the case," Evans told The 
Times. "Fox came in and upset everything, that's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Although PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said the World Tour is not in the 
best interests of golf, Evans said Finchem is mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Tour idea came to us from Greg Norman," said Evans, speaking 
publicly for the first time on the World Tour. "It was and still is an 
extremely interesting idea. I know it would be good for golf, the best players 
playing against the best. It's like Greg Norman said. We both hope to see it 
happen through the right channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why wouldn't (the PGA Tour) do something about it? It's a bloody good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, who signed a contract for Fox to own the television rights to the tour, 
said he isn't sure how far the World Tour will go to stage its events in 1995. 
Evans said the World Tour could sue the PGA Tour over the control of players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether they will try to take on the PGA Tour in the courts or 
whether that's a good idea," Evans said. "But we at Fox are going to wait and 
see. That's all we can do. We're not about to engage in pro-active legal 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem said in a statement that he would enforce the tour's conflicting event 
and television release rules to prevent players from playing on the World Tour. 
After a meeting of the PGA Tour policy board, he also said in a later 
conference call that he would suspend or fine players who violate the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the PGA Tour is getting ready for court action on some front. 
In his statement, Finchem said the PGA Tour "welcomes the opportunity" to 
defend in court its conflicting event and television release policies, should a 
Federal Trade Commission task force looking into their merit find against the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said Finchem might not be able to avoid a world tour concept of some 
kind at some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt he's just had his wake-up call," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said Fox Television's role in the conflict between the World Tour and 
golf's Establishment will be as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to get into the golf business," he said. "We are broadcasters." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Tour, which Norman helped launch two weeks ago at a news conference 
during the Franklin Funds Shark Shootout, is a $25-million venture featuring 
eight $3-million tournaments with $600,000 for each winner and a $1-million 
bonus to the top player at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's financial stake in the World Tour extends only to the rights fees it 
paid, said Evans, who would not disclose the amount. He said the World Tour 
hopes sponsors will make up the difference between the rights fees from Fox and 
the $3-million prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Tour might take place before or after the four major tournaments, 
according to organizers. No sites, dates, sponsors or players have been 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman has backed off his vow that the World Tour would begin on schedule in 
1995, regardless of opposition from the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will happen," Norman told the Associated Press in Melbourne, Australia. 
"Whether it happens in 1995, 1996 or 2006, it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem said Norman is the only player behind the World Tour and that all the 
other PGA Tour members are outspoken in their support of the U.S. tour. Evans 
said Finchem is only half right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, the talk of most of the golfers is that they would do nothing to 
jeopardize the PGA Tour, but also that they love the world tour," Evans said. 
"(Finchem) is leaving off that one piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-tournament plan for 1995 was cut down to six by World Tour executive 
John Montgomery Jr. at a meeting with the PGA Tour policy board. A further 
reduction of tournaments to as few as one event in 1995, such as a revamped 
Shark Shootout in mid-November, would not fall under Fox's contract with the 
World Tour.

CHARGING THE NYET; PLAYERS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT CARS THAN PATRIOTISM AS RUSSIA 
GOES AFTER ITS FIRST DAVIS CUP CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK WINTERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia is preparing for its first appearance in the final round of the Davis 
Cup in difficult times. The nation is stumbling in its efforts to make sense of 
new-found freedom. The economy is in a hyper-inflation spiral. Zhirinovsky 
nationalism is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the snowdrifts and freezing temperatures, people are looking for 
something to lift their spirits. Ordinarily, a first showing in the battle for 
the Davis Cup would provide let's-come-together impetus. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Russian team, which will play Sweden Friday through Sunday on the 
fast, pale blue carpet at Moscow's Olympisky Stadium, is a team in name only. 
Confusion, dissension, suspicion and mistrust abound. 
</P>
<P>
 "All's not happy in the dovecote," Gene Scott, a U.S. Davis Cup player in the 
1960s, said during the Kremlin Cup in early November. "There seems to be a 
number of things distracting the team as it gets ready for the final." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, tournament director of the Kremlin Cup, watched the Russian national 
team -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Alexander Volkov, Andrei Olhovskiy and Andrei 
Cherkasov are also the Davis Cup team -- compete in the season-ending ATP Tour 
event at Olympisky. Scott is also a member of the USTA Davis Cup Committee and 
was in Goteborg when the United States was upset by Sweden in this year's 
semifinals. Russia defeated Germany in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Davis Cup means everything," said Vadim Borisov, Russian Davis Cup 
captain, as he watched his players at the Kremlin Cup. "Maybe it's wrong to 
make it so important. Maybe there should not be such emphasis. But for us it's 
historic. We have reached the first final for either the USSR or Russia. It's a 
step, a chance to show what Russia can do. When the younger generation looks at 
our players and sees what has happened, they have hope."  
</P>
<P>
 Russia's astounding 4-1 victory in Germany, largely the result of Kafelnikov's 
play, should have left Kafelnikov, the talented 20-year-old, on a career high. 
It didn't. Before naming his team Nov. 22, Borisov had done little to dispel 
rumors that the 11th-ranked player in the world would not be involved in the 
match against Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speaking about the Davis Cup, I've heard rumors I'm not going to play," 
Kafelnikov said during the Kremlin Cup. "I'm revealing a secret here, I do not 
have a real good relationship with the team captain." 
</P>
<P>
 Friction between Davis Cup players and captains is nothing new, but this 
situation has two additional twists. Borisov has also gone a few rounds with 
the team's No. 2 player, Volkov, ranked 25th in the world. He is also the 
personal coach of Cherkasov (who is on the team but doesn't play). Many say 
that Davis Cup veteran Andrei Chesnokov, ranked No. 32, was more deserving of 
that fourth spot on the team than Cherkasov, No. 184. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always saying something," Borisov said. "Last year it was about 
Volkov, then (Volkov) and I got to be friends. I do not know what I would have 
done in Germany without his help. Yevgeny is very good and has been a big part 
of our success, but it is my team, my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, Borisov was fiery, passionate. He used emotion to lift his 
performance level. He said, "It was a dream to become captain after I finished 
my career," and is passionately crafting a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "As captain you must be ready for everything," he said. "You decide 
everything. You have it in your hands. It's your team, your life. For all the 
captains it is like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one expected the U.S. to lose to Sweden. (Tom) Gullikson made the decision 
to play Sampras. It was his team. He did not know Sampras would injure his leg. 
Being Davis Cup captain is a very difficult position. If the team wins it's 
because the players did a good job. If the team loses it's because of the 
captain. For the captain it's a very dangerous job." 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between Kafelnikov and Volkov are as edgy as their status is with 
the captain. Matters were further confounded when Volkov, who at the start of 
the tournament said, "I always play with difficulty in Moscow," defeated Chuck 
Adams of Pacific Palisades, 6-2, 6-4, to win the $156,000 first prize at the 
Kremlin Cup. Kafelnikov lost to Marc Rosset, the defending champion, in three 
sets in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I made it to the national team, some people didn't feel I fit in," 
Kafelnikov said. "When I became No. 1, it was the same. For the last six 
months, I think my rating has gone up in Volkov's eyes. It seems like he is 
beginning to respect me." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's his erratic point-by-point or match-by-match approach to playing 
or the honesty with which he expresses his thoughts, Volkov is rarely far from 
controversy. During the Kremlin Cup, after being asked by Russian journalists 
if he would be playing for home and country, Volkov said, "I'm playing for 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 The comment primed the pump for questions about the BMWs that had been 
promised the Davis Cup team after the victory in Germany. At the closing 
dinner, an official with the Russian delegation made it known that BMWs would 
be awaiting the victors in Moscow when they played the Kremlin Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little premature to make conclusions," said Volkov, who like his 
teammates was without a new automobile at the conclusion of the tournament. "I 
just want to wait and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 This is what Moscow, in general, and the nation, as a whole, are doing with 
regard to the Davis Cup. Having had the media cover the personality conflicts, 
the team makeup and the bonus structure (either money or cars) with great 
interest, the public is waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this year's Davis Cup campaign, Borisov has made a point about 
tennis lacking financial support from the state. There is no money for travel. 
The only reason Borisov sees national team members play ATP Tour events is 
because Cherkasov and Olhovskiy cover his expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Fund of Sports now finances all sports teams in the country, 
soliciting businesses from outside Russia by offering special incentives. The 
fund's involvement helped increase the prize money in the Kremlin Cup from 
$350,000 in 1993 to $1,125,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting the issues of players and financing aside, Borisov's goal is to leave 
a mark. The only way to do it is by winning.  
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to create something," Borisov said. "Results tell 
you what you have created. Results mean history."  
</P>
<P>
 Can the Russians win the Davis Cup for the first time in the event's 94-year 
history? 
</P>
<P>
 "I see our chances at 50-50," Borisov said. "(Magnus) Larsson played a 
fantastic match against (Todd) Martin. He is always dangerous. While some say 
he is in decline, (Stefan) Edberg can still make surprises. Edberg is still 
Edberg." Edberg is ranked No. 17 in the world, Larsson No. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 To win, Kafelnikov will have to put aside the slights and overlook the 
pressure of playing in Moscow. "It gives me added responsibility playing in 
front of so many people," he said. He will play two singles matches and, more 
likely than not, doubles with Olhovskiy against Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman. 
Volkov will play the other two singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians will play before expected capacity crowds of about 13,000. "The 
crowd will not be a factor," said Olhovskiy, who said he thinks the match will 
hinge on the doubles. "We are professionals. If you put all your emotion in one 
contest and lose, you are zero. A professional cannot do that." 
</P>
<P>
 For Russia, it's not a matter of people, feelings or bonuses. It's a 
first-time appearance in the final. "It will be the first, last and only time 
Russia can win the Davis Cup," Gene Scott said. "The circumstance that led to 
this year's final will not be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "On paper, Russia is not favored. Edberg should win two singles and 
Apell-Bjorkman should take the doubles. Having said that, Russia will win 3-2."

 The Angels, intent on drumming up fan interest, on Wednesday took a step 
toward making their games, well, a bit more melodramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch (Wild Thing) Williams, 30, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract 
Wednesday with the Angels. Williams also could earn as much as $2 million from 
incentives in the contract, which is not guaranteed. He will receive bonuses 
for games he finishes, beginning with his 30th of the season, according to a 
source. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would anticipate that we'll be playing the song, 'Wild Thing,' when he 
comes into games," Angel President Richard Brown said. "Maybe we'll even have 
(actor) Charlie Sheen come to a ballgame. We don't want to embarrass the guy, 
but with his permission, that's what we'd like to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think he's going to help our ballclub, but certainly a byproduct of 
signing Mitch Williams is that he has personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, whose control problems have reduced managers to tears, is being 
brought to the Angels to be their left-handed setup man. Left-handed hitters 
had a combined .217 batting average against Williams the last five years, and 
hit just .148 against him last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still are targeting either free agent Lee Smith or John Wetteland 
of Montreal to be their closer. Williams, who knows all of this, still desires 
to be a closer again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'd like to close," said Williams from his ranch in Hico, Tex. "But 
I'll let my abilities speak for me. If they tell me I'm a setup man, I'm a 
setup man. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first two years I was a setup guy, so for me, this is like starting over." 
</P>
<P>
 So no problem if Lee Smith joins the team too? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not at all," Williams said. "I'm a big fan of the big ol' dope." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who was born in Santa Ana, saved a team-record 43 games for the 
Philadelphia Phillies in 1993 but will forever be remembered for his playoff 
exploits. He blew two saves during the National League playoffs, two more 
during the World Series that ended in Toronto outfielder Joe Carter's clinching 
home run, and returned home to death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies traded him to Houston for reliever Doug Jones, and by May 31, the 
Astros gave up on him too, and released him. Williams retreated to his 600-acre 
ranch, and despite the Angels' attempts to coax him out west, Williams 
announced he was finished for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mentally, I think, was the biggest problem I had," said Williams, 1-4 with a 
7.65 earned-run average in 25 appearances last season. "I know I don't throw 
the ball as hard as I used to, but I can still get people out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wanted to join the Texas Rangers, or perhaps the Phillies, but there 
was no interest. The only team that kept calling was the Angels, including 
Manager Marcel Lachemann, and he finally relented Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we have a guy who can help us quite a bit," Angel General Manager 
Bill Bavasi said. "He fell on some hard times. But it's tough to go from a guy 
who did what he did for Philadelphia, and in a blink of an eye, go to a goat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we're taking a shot, but we're not guaranteeing anything, and the 
contract reflects that. As of today, we still don't have a closer, but he has a 
shot for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he wants to come here and prove something." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Alan Hendricks, Williams' agent: "Hey, he may just be the Mitch Williams 
of '93. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minus, Joe Carter."

OWNERS DELAY IMPLEMENTATION; BASEBALL: MEDIATOR GETS THEM TO DELAY DECISION ON 
SALARY CAP PROPOSAL UNTIL MID-DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major league baseball owners, bowing to pressure from special mediator William 
J. Usery, agreed Wednesday to cancel a Monday meeting in Chicago at which they 
were expected to declare an impasse in the collective bargaining and approve 
unilateral implementation of their salary cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked the owners to withdraw their threat of implementation and they agreed 
to do that," Usery said after recessing three days of contentious talks in 
Leesburg, Va. The decision did not herald a breakthrough, but it frees the 
union from the threat of implementation while it conducts a three-day executive 
board meeting in Atlanta starting Monday and formulates a counterproposal to 
the tax plan submitted by the owners Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Usery, according to sources, came down hard on the union for failing to make 
that proposal in Leesburg, but union officials said they required more 
information on how the tax works and wanted their constituency to approve the 
response in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our intention to take everything we've learned and hopefully produce the 
framework for a settlement," union leader Donald Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a very bad sign if in the face of our expressed desire to 
discuss it at the board meetings next week (the owners) would have taken action 
to cut that off." 
</P>
<P>
 Bargaining talks will resume Dec. 9 in Rye Brook, N.Y. The owners' vote on 
implementation has been rescheduled for Dec. 15 or 16. The Dec. 7 deadline for 
clubs to offer arbitration to their own free agents, a process that would be 
eliminated by the salary cap system, has been moved to Dec. 17, with responses 
to the arbitration offer due Dec. 23 instead of Dec. 19. The Dec. 20 deadline 
for tendering 1995 contracts remains in place. 
</P>
<P>
 It is problematical whether the sides can resolve their significant 
differences before the owners' calendar on flexibility runs out in 
mid-December. The union considers management's tax proposal a cap in disguise. 
It places a ceiling on payrolls with a tax escalating to more than 100%. A 
union proposal submitted on Sept. 8 called for a tax of 1.6% with no ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Said acting commissioner Bud Selig, who approved the implementation delay from 
his Milwaukee office: "I've said often that the place to solve this is not in 
the courts or Congress but at the bargaining table. We have to be hopeful this 
contributes to the process. Time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chances for congressional intervention in the baseball strike decreased 
Wednesday when the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said the 
government shouldn't get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican, stated his view as part of the dissenting 
report filed with the House of Representatives on the final day of this 
session.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; BROSTEK SIGNS 4-YEAR EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Center Bern Brostek signed a four-year contract extension worth approximately 
$1.5 million Wednesday and returned to the starting lineup after missing the 
last six games because of a broken bone in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Brostek said he wanted to strike a deal early with the Rams rather than test 
the free-agent market.Brostek, a fifth-year pro, would have been an 
unrestricted free agent and could have signed with any team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real good deal," Brostek said of his new contract. "Plus, it's nice to 
know where I will be the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
 But will he be playing in Anaheim, St. Louis or Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what city, I still don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brostek's return to the starting lineup should boost the Rams' running game, 
which is in desperate need of help. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jerome Bettis has gained only 80 yards in 35 carries in the last 
three games and hasn't cracked 100 yards rushing in a game since Brostek was 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Brostek's return also means Tom Newberry, who has been starting at center, 
will return to his old position of left guard, moving second-year player Chuck 
Belin to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides re-signing Brostek, the Rams signed backup linebacker and special 
teams player Tom Homco to a three-year contract extension and promoted wide 
receiver Jermaine Ross from the practice squad to the active roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing Brostek leaves the Rams with 11 players who will become unrestricted 
at the end of the season, including four starters -- cornerback Darryl Henley, 
wide receiver Flipper Anderson, linebacker Roman Phifer and Newberry -- and 
backup quarterback Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Ram injury report: cornerback Wymon Henderson (groin) and offensive tackle 
Jackie Slater (elbow) are questionable. Tailback Johnny Bailey (abdomen 
strain), quarterback Chandler (ankle) and defensive tackle Jimmie Jones (ankle) 
are probable. MIKE REILLEY

BATTLE FOR NFC CENTRAL FEATURES SURGING BEARS, SLUMPING VIKINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The surging Chicago Bears visit the slumping Minnesota Vikings tonight in a 
fight for the NFC Central lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a remarkable season for quarterback Steve Walsh and Chicago (8-4), 
the surprising Central Division leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissed by many after losing to the Vikings, 42-14, in the third game with 
Erik Kramer at quarterback, the Bears have won seven of nine since then and 
four in a row. Walsh has been the starter in each victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (7-5) will need a better performance from Warren Moon to rescue 
their playoff hopes. The 38-year-old quarterback carried the Vikings for two 
months, but has sagged during a three-game losing streak. He was intercepted 
four times by the Jets and was sacked five times in Sunday's overtime loss to 
Tampa Bay.

MILLER TRIES TO SOFTEN HIS LATEST CRITIQUE; RAMS: QUARTERBACK, WHO MET WITH A 
SMALL GROUP OF TEAMMATES, INCLUDING HESTER, SAYS HE WAS MISQUOTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller tried to clear the air with Ram players Wednesday 
after his critical comments about wide receiver Jessie Hester angered some 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Monday, Miller targeted Hester for dropping two passes and 
running the wrong route in Sunday's 31-17 loss to the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who was intercepted four times Sunday, was asked Wednesday about the 
team's reaction to his comments, and he pointed a finger at the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just leave it alone," he said. "I should probably be a little more 
careful what I say to y'all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hester, who accepted responsibility for the mistakes, said he and a small 
group of players met with Miller about the comments on Wednesday. Hester said 
Miller told them he was misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't take it that hard, personally," Hester said. "I came out in the 
second half and ran a couple routes too deep and made a couple wrong turns. I 
made some mistakes, and I can step up to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris just wanted me to know. We don't want any finger-pointing here, we want 
a tight-knit family." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox refused to comment on Miller's remarks, but defensive end 
Robert Young called the finger-pointing "immature." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that, as teammates, we're pointing fingers at each other in the 
paper," Young said. "We don't need that. Everything else is going against us, 
why should we go against each other?" 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has criticized teammates before, blaming center Bern Brostek's wet 
pants for his errant passes and saying rookie offensive tackle Wayne Gandy 
"wasn't ready yet" before his first start. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Rams 4-8 after losing three consecutive games, tensions are 
running high among the players. On Wednesday, Miller backpedaled on his 
comments about Hester after at least three Southland newspapers published his 
comments from tape-recorded interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Miller saying he was misquoted by every reporter? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take what you want from the person who wrote that stuff," Miller 
said. "I'll just leave it at that. I'm just concentrating on getting ready for 
New Orleans, and the team understands who we're dealing with (in the media)." 
</P>
<P>
 Young referred to the team's record, losing streak and uncertainty about where 
the franchise will be playing next season as reasons for the players' 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're losing and there's talk about the team moving, and it's easy 
for people to point fingers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play together as a team, and we shouldn't worry about what other people 
think about us. We should stick together. You just can't sit there and say this 
person or that person is the reason we lost the game. You can't do that. It's 
an effort by the whole team."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; GROGGY HOSTETLER EXPECTS TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler knew the signs all too well -- the migraine headache, the 
blurred vision, the flashing lights, the foggy memory and the nausea. So when 
the Raider quarterback got hit in the head by Pittsburgh Steeler linebacker 
Chad Brown on Sunday at the Coliseum late in the first half, he realized he 
might have a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, who sat out practice Wednesday but is confident he'll play Monday 
night against the San Diego Chargers, has had five previous concussions. The 
worst, suffered in his days as a New York Giant, landed Hostetler in a hospital 
for several days in 1992 and cost him three games. Another, suffered in 
sub-zero temperatures last year in Green Bay, left Hostetler without much 
memory of that game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when Coach Art Shell asked Hostetler on Sunday if he knew where he was, 
the quarterback replied, without hesitation, "The L.A. Coliseum." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler stayed in for seven more plays, was pulled for the final series of 
the half, and then was examined at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Evans started the second half, but Hostetler kept lobbying to go back 
in, sending both players and coaches over to Shell to argue his case. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Shell relented for one series in the fourth quarter of a game the 
Raiders lost, 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler's symptoms have gradually subsided. He will get checked again this 
morning and hopes to return to practice today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after questioning a game plan that enabled him to catch only three 
passes in a 21-3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, receiver Tim Brown was ready 
to put the controversy behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happened last week, whether they (the coaches) agree with me or not, 
it was my feelings on it," Brown said, "so I had to express how I felt. But I 
know the coaching staff can't be happy because we lost the game. If we would 
have won the game and I would have been saying that, then they would be looking 
at me like I'm crazy. I know none of my teammates is happy that we lost the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the important thing. That's what I was upset about was the fact we 
lost a real big game at home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said cornerback Albert Lewis will return to the starting lineup this 
week if his sprained right knee is sufficiently healed. Cornerback Lionel 
Washington, who missed two games because of a bruised calf muscle, practiced 
Wednesday. STEVE SPRINGER

ANOTHER AIDE TO MCNALL SET TO PLEAD GUILTY 
</P>

 Nora J. Rothrock, a former vice president of Bruce McNall's main company, will 
plead guilty to single counts of bank fraud and conspiracy in connection with 
the continuing federal investigation into the King president's banking 
practices, according to her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothrock, 35, was charged Wednesday by prosecutors of engaging in a scheme to 
defraud the French bank Credit Lyonnais, Bank of America, First Los Angeles 
Bank and Union Bank of $135.5 million.She is the seventh individual to have 
been charged in the government's investigation into McNall's businesses. McNall 
will plead guilty to four criminal counts Wednesday before U.S. District Judge 
Richard Paez. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothrock will appear at an arraignment on Monday. She faces a maximum prison 
term of 35 years and a fine of no less than $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was in her 20s when this started and new in the accounting world and was 
asked to do things -- told it was all right and was too young to exercise her 
best judgment," said Rothrock's lawyer, Janet I. Levine. "I want to make it 
clear it was never her idea." 
</P>
<P>
 One former McNall employee said Rothrock and others were around to help deal 
with the banks, saying: "It takes a lot of people to keep the stories straight. 
That's what one or two people did full time. With 10 banks, there are a lot of 
stories to keep straight."

bare-metal geodesic main frame that holds the thing up. 
</P>
<P>
 The design is early 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN Big Wednesday hoops, inside Biosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ceiling's the most amazing thing about the place," Greenberg says, neck 
fully craned. "It looks like a huge Tinker Toy. You could have some 
action-packed thrills if you sent a few people to climb up in there." 
</P>
<P>
 It is 65 minutes before tip-off and Don Dyer, executive director of the 
Pyramid, is standing on the concourse level, accepting handshakes, kisses and 
back slaps from gawking friends wandering into the building for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awesome," someone tells him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better than our wildest dreams," says another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations. You got it open." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you happy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer smiles, squeezes a hand and replies drolly, "Yeah, I'm lovely." 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer and staff got it open by working 16-hour days all the way till D-Day -- 
Opening Wednesday -- "testing the lights, testing the seats, testing everything 
we know how to test." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the final exam, with hoopheads all over the country staying up late, 
eyewitness to any hitches or glitches the debut of the Pyramid may bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we're gonna have a game," Dyer says. "And we know we're gonna have a 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we just hope we don't break something." 
</P>
<P>
 It is 45 minutes before tip-off and Dave O'Brien, Long Beach athletic 
director, is standing at courtside, but he should be dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The line! Did you see the line?" O'Brien says, bubbling and all but bursting 
at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually had a line of people trying to get in tonight. Not a line trying 
to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 A thousand strong, it must have been, in O'Brien's estimation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out there at 6:15 (the game was to start at 9:10) and the line went 
from the Pyramid all the way to the business school," O'Brien says. "Some of 
them said they got there at 1:30. One-thirty!" 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien is overcome by a giggling fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never had anybody wait for anything at Long Beach State," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And: "This is the first time in 20 years tickets have been scalped at Long 
Beach State." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "I think we could have sold out twice as many, 10,000, if we had the 
seats. I've been saying 'No' for the last five days." 
</P>
<P>
 The beechwood floor was painted and varnished, the hydraulically cantilevered 
seats lowered into place the way they were supposed to, the restrooms were 
fully functional, the electricity worked . . . and, still, the air was 
crackling with disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 What was something this sleek, this high-tech, this nice doing on the property 
of Cal State Longing To Be? 
</P>
<P>
 All right, when is the PA announcement that tells everybody this has been an 
elaborate practical joke, hope you enjoyed it, will you now leave leave your 
seats, walk outside and cram your torsos uncomfortably one more time on those 
creaking wooden Gold Mine bleachers? 
</P>
<P>
 For awhile, Greenberg had to have wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 "A week ago," Greenberg says, "I didn't think they could pull this off. It was 
a mess out here. Amazing, really. The place was half-done. There were no seats 
here (Greenberg points to the stands behind the west basket), speakers were 
laying on the floor, upstairs was filthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it looks like we've been playing in the place for a year. Let me tell 
you, it took a great team effort to get this thing open on time." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, a bit of sleight of hand was involved. Everything that had to be 
ready in time for Wednesday night's Long Beach-Detroit Mercy basketball game -- 
court, stands, the bare necessities -- got done. Everything that could wait -- 
the coaches offices and exercise rooms under the seats, permanent concession 
stands -- were pushed back on the docket. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,000 fans present may not have known it, but behind the basketball facade 
in front of them were dozens of unpainted walls, bare cement and piles of 
sawdust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 500 people working on this building today," O'Brien says. "People were 
sweeping, painting, spackling and dusting. It almost looked like they were 
working in fast motion, fast-forward." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dyer, "everything essentially went down to the wire. Whatever 
needed to be done Wednesday by 9 got done. What isn't done can't be seen. But 
on television, people will see a full house and a professional facility." 
</P>
<P>
 It all went off, smooth as smooth can be, although O'Brien was still mopping a 
moist brow 30 minutes before tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to turn off the lights for the pregame laser show," O'Brien said, 
"and we still have to find out if the lights are going to come back on." 
</P>
<P>
 The lights came back on, and, more than that, they stayed on. 
</P>
<P>
 If Long Beach doesn't watch out, this Pyramid thing is going to run its 
reputation right into the ground.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; TRAINER LUKAS, HOLY BULL PICKS TO WIN ECLIPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking to beat the Christmas rush, here is one man's opinion on the Eclipse 
Awards for 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 2-Year-Old Colt or Gelding -- Timber Country. Jockey Alex Solis raved about 
the son of Woodman after working him during the summer, and trainer Wayne Lukas 
also told anyone who would listen that the chestnut would make some noise 
before the year was out. Timber Country certainly did, completing the year with 
victories in the Champagne at Belmont Park and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. 
Unquestionably, he was the most impressive winner on the Breeders' Cup card. 
</P>
<P>
 2-Year-Old Filly -- Flanders. A clean sweep for Lukas in this division. The 
daughter of Seeking The Gold was awesome in her 21-length victory in the 
Frizette, then showed grit when winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies 
despite an injury that has put her career on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 3-Year-Colt or Gelding -- Holy Bull. He didn't win the Kentucky Derby after 
being eliminated at the start, and he didn't run in the Preakness, Belmont 
Stakes or Breeders' Cup Classic. So what? Jimmy Croll's superstar proved his 
superiority in several other races and is simply the best horse America has had 
since Sunday Silence. A strong case can be made for Tabasco Cat, but he 
finished about 17 lengths behind Holy Bull in the Travers. Please, no mention 
of Go For Gin, another of many mediocre horses who have won the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 3-Year-Old Filly -- Lakeway. The daughter of Seattle Slew hasn't been seen 
since August, so her accomplishments might be forgotten by some, but she was 
brilliant earlier this year. She won in New York and California, breaking 
stakes records in the Las Virgenes, Hollywood Oaks and Mother Goose. Heavenly 
Prize did beat her at Saratoga in the Alabama, but Lakeway came out of the race 
with a severe infection and nearly died. 
</P>
<P>
 Older Horse -- Devil His Due. Somebody has to win this award, and why not the 
most consistent of a rather lackluster division. The recently retired 
5-year-old won three times in 12 starts this year but was worse than third only 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Older Filly or Mare -- One Dreamer. Besides her stunning upset in the 
Breeders' Cup Distaff, One Dreamer won three other races this year and was 
beaten by only 1 1/2 lengths by Hatoof in the Beverly D. Perhaps Sky Beauty, 
Hollywood Wildcat and Exchange all didn't like the track at Churchill Downs on 
Nov. 5, but the bottom line is that when they all got together, One Dreamer was 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Male Grass Horse -- Paradise Creek. He closed out his career with two losses, 
but both of those races -- the Breeders' Cup Turf and Japan Cup -- were at 1 
1/2 miles, and that's not his best distance. Before that, he won eight of nine 
and was second to Lure in his only loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Female Grass Horse -- Hatoof. Flawlessly won only once before being retired 
and, on turf, the same held true for Hollywood Wildcat. Hatoof also had only 
one victory in America, but she made her two races here count. She beat 
Flawlessly and One Dreamer in the Beverly D., then finished second to Tikkanen 
in the Breeders' Cup Turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinter -- Cherokee Run. No one could argue with the selection of Soviet 
Problem in this category, but the fact is that the California-bred filly got 
together once with Cherokee Run, and the 4-year-old Runaway Groom colt beat her 
in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer -- Wayne Lukas. He has bounced back in a big way this year, having 
again assumed his perennial place on top of the money standings, and he came 
within a neck of winning three Breeders' Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey -- Mike Smith. The regular rider of Holy Bull leads the money standings 
and is approaching 70 stakes victories for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic Gold, third in the Breeders' Cup Classic, will pass Sunday's Native 
Diver Handicap and wait for the San Fernando Stakes next month at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer David Hofmans decided to give the 3-year-old, who would have been 
favored in the 1 1/8-mile Native Diver, a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing great, but he's had a long campaign and we decided to give him 
some time off until January," Hofmans said. "We'll look at the Strub Series, 
and he'll probably come back in the second leg (the San Fernando)." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North had his first work since undergoing surgery on his right 
ankle in July. The 5-year-old went three furlongs in 36 3/5 Monday at Santa 
Anita. "I'm extremely encouraged," said trainer David Bernstein. "He's doing 
very well." The Wicked North could return in the San Antonio Handicap on Feb. 
14. . . . Kent Desormeaux, who leads the Hollywood Park rider standings, was 
off his mounts Wednesday because of flu. . . . Justin Vitek's final day as an 
apprentice is Friday. . . . Afternoon Deelites, the probable favorite for the 
Hollywood Futurity on Dec. 18, worked five furlongs in 1:01 Wednesday morning.

GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL; COOPER'S SUMMER VACATION WAS NO DAY AT THE 
BEACH; SIMI VALLEY FORWARD'S HARD WORK MIGHT LEAD TO SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most students, the happiest day of the school year is the last one. The 
beach, movies and amusement parks all beckon. 
</P>
<P>
 The routine moves from the three R's of academia to the three R's of 
summertime -- rest, relaxation and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tawnee Cooper was working from a different playbook last June. Running, 
rebounding and rope-jumping occupied her summer days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of dedication to get where you want to go," explained Cooper, 
the newest forward on the girls' basketball team at Simi Valley High. The 
junior transfer from Royal has her sights set on college. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, her father and stepmother gained custody of then-12-year-old 
Tawnee, but had no money saved for her college education. Thus, she toils for a 
scholarship, one many area coaches believe she is destined to earn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she has a lot to offer," Buena Coach Joe Vaughan said. "She's a 
definite Division I player." 
</P>
<P>
 Said North Hollywood Coach Rich Allen: "She's sensational. The things she does 
well, you just can't coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper gained attention last season when she led Ventura County in scoring, 
averaging 19.6 points while leading Royal to a 14-9 record -- its first winning 
mark in seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 She received even more attention when she announced last school year that she 
would transfer to rival Simi Valley the following September. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley area, that kind of bombshell is like J.J. Stokes announcing 
his transfer from UCLA to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cooper still had two months left in the school year at Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those months were hard," she said. "It was very different. Some people came 
up to me and called me a traitor." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper escaped the stress by continuing to train under the watchful eye of her 
father, Julius. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour daily workouts would start with a two-mile run followed by 
endless jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my dad saw me getting tired shooting, he'd have me do sit-ups," she 
said. "Then I'd get up and work on rebounding and sprinting up and down the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't feel sorry for Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love basketball," she said. "It's my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's stepmother, Jeanne, also has played a part in the 16-year-old's drive 
down the lane toward college. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the school year, I'm the one who says, 'You're going nowhere with that 
basketball until you get your school work done,' " Jeanne Cooper said. "I play 
the typical mom role." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a 3.4 grade-point average. And don't look for a glut of shop 
classes on Cooper's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's definitely following the college prep program so she will have the 
qualifications to go to any college she wants," her stepmother said. 
</P>
<P>
 These investments in Cooper's future should pay dividends for Simi Valley this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the transfer, the Pioneers were expected to improve on last season's 
fourth-place finish in the Marmonte League. Three starters returned from a 
15-12 team and Coach Dave Murphy was confident Simi Valley would contend for 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Tawnee, we thought we had a pretty darn good team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And with her? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a jigsaw puzzle," Coach Nori Parvin of Newbury Park said. "She was 
the one missing piece." 
</P>
<P>
 And Murphy knew right where to put her, once he got over the giddiness of 
landing one of the best players in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty happy, let's be honest here," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9 Cooper, who probably will play guard in college, will play 
forward for the talented but somewhat small Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's definitely a go-to scorer," said former Royal coach Paula 
Getty-Shearer, now at Louisville. "She can hit the outside shot, but she is 
also real strong down low." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper already has impressed one team in the area. She scored 20 points in a 
preseason scrimmage against an Alemany team that begins the season ranked 
second in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a huge factor for them," Alemany Coach Melissa Hearlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
 When a transfer takes over a starting job, it can lead to bitterness among 
teammates, especially those losing playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could have been a problem," Murphy said. "But with this particular team, 
they see what she can do for us." 
</P>
<P>
 That makes acclimation to new surroundings somewhat easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the adjustment has gone just fine," Cooper said. "The team has 
welcomed me with open arms." 
</P>
<P>
 And those arms may be a perfect match for the considerable helping hand Cooper 
should lend the Pioneers this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "In situations like this, some kids fit and some kids don't fit," Murphy said. 
"Tawnee fits."

MONTCLAIR PREP GIRLS' TEAM ALIGNS WITH WESTSIDE LEAGUE; BASKETBALL: GROUPING 
ALSO INCLUDES HIGHLAND HALL, WISE COMMUNITY AND WEST VALLEY CHRISTIAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Montclair Prep girls' basketball team has become the fourth school sport 
program to join a league since the Mounties were ousted from the Alpha League 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls have been added to the Westside League, joining Highland Hall, Wise 
Community and West Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf and boys' tennis teams are members of the Prep League, and the 
wrestling team has joined the newly formed Mission League with Alemany, 
Chaminade and Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven programs at Montclair Prep that remain independent and compete on a 
free-lance basis are football, baseball, boys' basketball, boys' soccer, 
softball and boys' and girls' volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy to have Montclair Prep," said Westside League President 
Humberto Ramirez, the athletic director at Highland Hall. "The main emphasis 
for us was to find a school to complete our league." 
</P>
<P>
 Leagues must field four teams to be officially recognized by the Southern 
Section and receive automatic playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it helps both sides," Montclair Prep Athletic Director Greg Reece 
said. "We needed a league and, with us in, it helps the other teams get into 
the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Two Westside teams are guaranteed berths in the girls' basketball playoffs, a 
Southern Section spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep was voted out of the Alpha League after the Southern Section 
placed the school on three years' probation and banned the Mounties from the 
playoffs in all sports during the 1991-92 school year. The ban followed an 
investigation into allegations of illegal recruiting in the football program as 
well as grade-tampering. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the school has scrambled for league affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if I have to cross-league every team," Reece said of his 
efforts. "That means 22 league meetings for me, but it gives our athletes the 
opportunity to be named to all-league teams." 
</P>
<P>
 And make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the boys' basketball team posted a 15-6 record but failed to 
receive a bid to the 20-team IV-A Division bracket. Montclair Prep had a better 
record than seven of the teams competing in the divisional playoffs, but bids 
were awarded to teams with guaranteed spots based on league play. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep, with an enrollment of 350 students, has a larger student base 
than the three other Westside League schools combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland Hall, West Valley Christian and Wise Community have a composite 
enrollment of 339.

IN DRIVER'S SEAT; HAWKING ON THE ROAD TO SUCCESS AT CS FULLERTON, SUPPORTERS 
SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is early morning and Bob Hawking will have a hurried breakfast before 
guiding his car out of his driveway on Bianca Circle in Simi Valley. He will 
drop off his 12-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter at school. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts him on the Simi Valley Freeway early enough that the sun still is a 
near-blinding glare from the east on the grade up the rugged Santa Susana 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking had less than a 10-minute drive to work when he was basketball coach 
at Simi Valley High for 14 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. Now he joins the legion of commuters who spill onto the freeway each 
morning on their way to their jobs in the Los Angeles sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking travels farther than most. Depending on the traffic and the freeway he 
finds most desirable that day, it is between 70 and 80 miles to Cal State 
Fullerton. He's been making the 1-hour 15-plus-minute drive mostly six -- and 
sometimes seven -- days a week since he became Brad Holland's top assistant two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not been easy, especially with the grinding schedule college basketball 
coaches keep. But today Hawking, never lacking in ambition, is where he always 
wanted to be professionally. He's the head coach at a Division I program . . . 
even if that program survives on a shoestring budget, has a badly outdated 
playing facility and its team is picked to finish last in the Big West 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, even if Hawking, who has a 1-0 record after Fullerton's 80-71 
victory over Cal State Northridge -- his alma mater -- on Tuesday night, has 
all the security that comes with a one-year contract as an "interim coach." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Holland took the University of San Diego job only 21 days before the 
start of practice, Hawking jumped at the opportunity to succeed him. It's the 
type of job he's been seeking since he became a part-time assistant at 
Pepperdine five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave up a situation where I pretty much had control of my own destiny at 
Simi Valley," Hawking said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But, after several years in high school, I decided I wanted to do something 
different. I knew it was a volatile business on the college level. But it's 
always a risk when you change jobs. I just didn't want to take the safe route 
anymore. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking's success as a coach and his tenure as a teacher at Simi Valley High 
gave him and his family a secure, comfortable lifestyle. His wife, Jeannie, 
also had a good job working in marketing for a residential builder. 
</P>
<P>
 He gained the kind of respect that comes from coaching teams that were 230-119 
and won five Marmonte League championships.  
</P>
<P>
 And there were those three seasons from 1985 through 1988 when Don MacLean, 
Shawn DeLaittre and Hawking's son, Butch, led Simi Valley High to 81 victories 
in 90 games. When they were seniors in 1988, Simi Valley won the Southern 
Section 4-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But when MacLean went to UCLA and Hawking's son left to play for the Air Force 
Academy, the time seemed right for a change. He took what amounted to an 
entry-level job as a restricted-earnings coach at Pepperdine under Tom Asbury, 
but he still was able to teach four classes a day at Simi Valley High, 
retaining most of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking had been offered a full-time assistant job at Pepperdine by Jim 
Harrick five years earlier, but decided to remain at Simi Valley. It was not a 
lack of ambition, as much as wanting to coach MacLean, his son and the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking stayed only one year at Pepperdine, moving into a full-time position 
at UC Davis, where he could be a top assistant, if not a head coach, albeit at 
a Division II program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out to be a devastating move for us economically," Jeannie Hawking 
said. "We moved as a family, even bought a house there, although we didn't sell 
the one in Simi. I'm the one who pushed for Davis because I thought it would be 
good for him. Then when we got up there, I couldn't find a job for a while, and 
both of us ended up taking 50% pay cuts. We were making house payments at both 
places. It was a tough two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the family was delighted when Hawking landed the assistant job at 
Fullerton. The family returned home to Simi Valley and Hawking returned to 
Division I with a full-time coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Northridge earthquake hit in January, resulting in damages to the 
Hawking home estimated at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had earthquake insurance before, but that was one of the things we cut 
when our salaries went down," Hawking's wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the house still is red-tagged as unsafe, and the family remains 
uncertain about the next step. Much, of course, depends on what happens with 
Fullerton basketball this season. If Hawking is hired permanently, the family 
will move to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannie Hawking hopes the move into the head-coaching position is a sign of 
better times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife has been a warrior through all this," Hawking said. "She's been very 
resilient and very supportive. We got married when I was still playing college 
basketball, so she's accustomed to the time the game takes. The marriages of a 
lot of guys in this business don't survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking has no regrets about not moving to the college ranks earlier. The 
biggest difference between coaching in college and in high school is mostly 
personal, Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had the time to spend with my family that I did when I was in high 
school," he said. "My younger son, Quinn, has had to do a lot more from a 
basketball standpoint because I haven't been around as much. It's not that he 
hasn't had attention, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking's daughter, Kristin, is a standout runner in track and cross-country 
for Simi Valley High, and her father adjusts his schedule when he can to see 
her run. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking is happy he had the chance to coach one son. Butch wouldn't trade that 
opportunity he had to play for his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was tough, and I think he was even tougher on me because of how badly 
he wanted me to succeed," said Butch, who plans to follow in his father's 
footsteps as a coach when his commitment as an Air Force flight officer ends. 
"But he doesn't demand that anyone work any harder than he's willing to work 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the things his former Simi Valley players remember most. 
</P>
<P>
 "His own work ethic was unbelievable," said MacLean, who became an 
All-American at UCLA and now is with the Washington Bullets of the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was always one step ahead of the other coaches. I mean he would put out a 
press guide and get sponsors for the program and do all kinds of things like 
that in addition to coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean particularly remembers Hawking's emphasis on the game's fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got me headed in the right direction when I was just a kid playing with 
Butch," MacLean said. "The games are different at each level, of course, and 
it's hard to compare, but he's probably the best coach I've played for. I 
probably learned the most about the game from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets so much out of guys, and not just the people who are playing 
regularly. He gets a lot out of the guys who are eighth through 12." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Wilson played for Hawking at Simi Valley in the mid-1980s, was a 
starting guard at Pepperdine and now is an assistant coach for the Waves. He 
especially liked Hawking's caring attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of coaches care about their players, but Hawk shows he cares about his 
players," Wilson said. "He'd come in early and he'd leave late if you wanted 
him to help you with something." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know him well also talk about his fiery competitive nature. Larry 
DeLaittre, whose son played for Hawking at Simi Valley, squared off against 
Hawking in high school and junior college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played against him in high school when he was at Alemany and I was at Simi, 
then I played against him when he was at Pierce and I was at Moorpark College, 
and every time we played I came away thinking how competitive he was," 
DeLaittre said. 
</P>
<P>
 That competitiveness would even carry over to the games he used to challenge 
the players to when they were riding with him in his car.  
</P>
<P>
 A favorite, DeLaittre recalls, was his version of "Name That Tune." Hawking 
would spin the radio dial, then try to be the first to name the song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," said MacLean, with a laugh. "Butch and I knew all the Top 40 music and 
we'd get him on those, but he'd keep the radio going to the 'oldie' stations. 
We'd never be able to beat him because he always controlled the radio dial." 
</P>
<P>
 But now Hawking faces the most daunting challenge of his career as he tries to 
prove himself on the college level in only one season. And he must do it with a 
team Big West coaches ranked last in their preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking has made it evident that he wants the job on a permanent basis. He 
says the instability of the Fullerton program has been one of its biggest 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a career job for me," he said. "I'm not looking at it as a 
steppingstone to go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland was criticized for looking toward his next job, and recruiters used 
that against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been a lot of instability in the program at Simi when I took over 
there, too," Hawking said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was their fourth coach in six years. Several people told me to not take the 
job for that reason. But I was stubborn enough to think I could help the 
situation, given the right chemistry and work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking seems to have the support of Fullerton's players. A group of them 
spoke in his behalf with Athletic Director John Easterbrook when Holland 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 But, if Hawking does not succeed, no one expects it to be because of his own 
lack of effort. He has shown again that he is a tireless worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always remember Hawk's favorite line," Wilson said. "It was the one he'd 
say when he knew he was putting us through a really tough practice. I can still 
hear him. He'd lean over and look you in the eye and say, 'You've got to love 
it . . . you've got to want it." 
</P>
<P>
 For Bob Hawking, there is no doubt about that.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL '94-'95: SUNSET LEAGUE; ROBBINS GROWS INTO HER LEADERSHIP 
ROLE; BASKETBALL: MARINA SENIOR POST PLAYER HAS MATURED IN TIME TO HANDLE THE 
PRESSURE OF BEING THE STAR ON A TALENTED VIKING SQUAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first recruiting letter, from Eastern Kentucky, arrived the summer before 
Shandy Robbins' freshman year, when she was still a shy, giggly 13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really excited," Robbins recalled. "Now, when I think back, a college 
letter is not that big of a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not to someone who received them steadily after Eastern Kentucky first 
wrote. But that's life among America's Most Wanted, where high school athletes 
pick and choose in the high stakes world of NCAA athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon finally won the Shandy Robbins Sweepstakes. Though the Ducks aren't 
sure whether they got a fine arts or business major, they do know they got a 
versatile shooter and rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins is a 6-foot senior, a post player who averaged 16.9 points and 11.6 
rebounds last season. She has a soft touch around the basket and is one of the 
county's best shooters, even from three-point range. She has won games in the 
final seconds with both her offense and her defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And make no mistake about it, she is the leader on a team that matches up to 
any in the county, from Woodbridge to Mater Dei to Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 This Marina team -- maybe the school's best -- is Shandy's Team, no matter how 
talented her supporting cast, which includes Academy League most valuable 
player Kirsten Cappel, a transfer from Connelly, and Sonya Bryant, who averaged 
eight points and seven rebounds as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (opponents) double-team Shandy, they'll be in trouble," Marina Coach Pete 
Bonny said. "Her numbers may not even go up, but we've got a lot more people 
who can put the ball in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a year where we can upset a big gun like Ventura Buena or 
Thousand Oaks, I think this is the year." " 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be able to carry our team to the finals," she said. "We've talked 
about it, and I think we have the potential to get to the finals, but it's 
going to be up to everyone because one person can't win a game for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be able to help lead them, be a good team leader, get my job done 
to help our team win." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that job involves communication, an area Bonny says Robbins has 
improved greatly in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she realized how she was coming across to the other players," 
Bonny said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She might say, 'Hey, give me the ball because we're going to win (because I'm 
going to score),' but it didn't come across like that. The older you get, the 
more you find out what works. I told her, 'There's different ways of saying 
what you want to say.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a small thing, but it can affect the team. There wasn't a good 
congruence between the guards and the post last year." 
</P>
<P>
 That shouldn't be a problem this season. Robbins, who was elected co-captain, 
is thinking more and more like a coach. If she cuts down on senseless fouls -- 
"I just went out there and hacked everyone" -- she should have the kind of 
season everyone expects of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten stronger in my mind," Robbins said. "I've gradually gotten 
stronger physically, too, but I'm tougher on the court mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 It's that sign of maturity that has impressed Bonny the most as he watched 
Robbins lose some of her giggly immaturity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where it came from," Bonny said, "but if you're being recruited 
by all those colleges, you can't be a little girl having fun; you've got to be 
pretty mature." 
</P>
<P>
 But Robbins disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to make my younger years fun," she said. "I still giggle."

Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a game day passed without the Sunset League providing a game of the 
week. At one point, four teams were ranked among Orange County's top 10; 
another time, Marina, Ocean View and Fountain Valley were ranked fifth, sixth 
and seventh. In all, five teams reached the top 10, including Rosary. Ocean 
View got a terrific blue-collar effort from post players Becky Fraser and 
Farrah Magee (12.7 points, 11.4 rebounds), and outstanding guard play from 
Dustine Yamamoto and impact freshman Jennifer Tuiolosega; the Seahawks reached 
the Division II-AA semifinals before losing to eventual State finalist 
Woodbridge. Marina won a share of its fourth consecutive league title behind 
the play of Shandy Robbins (16.9 points, 11.6 rebounds) and unheralded guards 
Martita Emde (12.5 points) and Traci Nakamura (4.7 assists), but lost a 
controversial second-round playoff game to Corona. The league's player of the 
year was Edison's Marie Philman, who averaged 27.0 points and 14.3 rebounds on 
a one-dimensional Charger team; she scored 40 or more four times, and 30 or 
more 10 times. Fountain Valley gelled at a holiday tournament, reached No. 5 in 
the county rankings, made a run at the league title, and then played 
disappointing .500 ball the last half of the season.

<P>
 Any team with Philman can win on any given night. The all-county and Southern 
Section player averaged 27 points last season, second in the county, and her 
14.3 rebounds ranked her third. A physical force, she should again have her way 
on most nights, but the challenge is for Edison to complement Philman instead 
of relying on her. With five starters returning, the Chargers have plenty of 
experience and leadership. Height and inside play won't be a problem, either. 
But of concern is the perimeter game--outside shooting is a question mark. The 
returning starters collectively averaged 49 points last season, but only 
Philman averaged more than 7.4. Edison's goals include reaching the section 
quarterfinals. The task of getting the Chargers there falls on White, who 
coached them to a section title in 1987, then left the program. After a 
seven-year hiatus, he is back; question is, are the glory days back with him?

 The Oilers lack the size they need to be considered a threat, but they show 
great chemistry and excel at defense. Bartlett thinks it might be the best team 
he's had, including the 23-4 team of two years ago that featured Clare Walker. 
This season will be different because there is no dominant player like Walker, 
though Castro (11.3 points) is likely to emerge as a scoring talent. The Oilers 
will employ an aggressive defense designed to take opposing teams out of their 
game plans. Huntington Beach also expects to score baskets created by its 
up-tempo style of play. Huntington Beach can't afford to get stuck in a 
half-court game. Because of the frenetic pace, the freshmen will be counted on 
heavily to spell the starters. The Oilers' good free-throw shooting skills will 
help them in close games. SCHEDULE

 The Barons were one of the county's great success stories last season when 
they came together during the Marina tournament without their coach, 
Strausburg, who was attending her mother's funeral services in Ohio. Fountain 
Valley won the tournament and soon reached fifth in the county's top 10 poll, 
but flamed out by season's end to a disappointing conclusion; after a 12-4 
start--eight games over .500--the Barons finished 17-10. A similar flameout 
would be surprising with two of the county's best juniors, Ludwicki (11-point 
average) and Strange (11.7), a year older, and their supporting players more 
mature and experienced. With four starters back, including Avila, the Barons 
should be one of the county's elite teams; they move the ball and run the court 
well, and Strausburg said the group developed more confidence over the summer.

 The Aztecs, moving from the Empire League, are hoping a good summer will carry 
over into league play. Their strength should be their balance--they have good 
height, strength and quickness. They do lack varsity experience, and with 
Marina and Fountain Valley in the league, that's a glaring weakness. They will 
be without Kristy Kierulff, their best athlete, who decided to skip basketball 
and concentrate on club volleyball and track. Foss was an All-Empire League 
selection, and Gethins is coming back from a knee cartilage tear that forced 
her out at midseason. Severinsen was the junior varsity most valuable player, 
and Binkley was that team's most improved player. Studer played in Europe last 
year as a foreign-exchange student. Studer could play an important role in 
Esperanza's success: the Aztecs must develop a consistent inside game to be a 
league force. SCHEDULE

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: SWINTON STAYING PUT AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He arrived at Stanford with high expectations, but two losing seasons, a 
sophomore campaign marked by turmoil and injury, and this week's resignation of 
Coach Bill Walsh have ravaged those hopes for Eliel Swinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the defensive back from Montclair Prep has no intention of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford players talked among themselves about transferring after Walsh's 
announcement Monday. Under Walsh, winner of three Super Bowls in the 1980s as 
coach of the 49ers, the Cardinal finished 4-7 and 3-7-1 the past two seasons. 
This could be a perfect time for Swinton to move too, but he's staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a quitter," he said. "My teammates are my family. I've got a tattoo 
on my right arm that says Stanford. But I expected to be more successful here." 
</P>
<P>
 Swinton, a starter since the middle of his freshman year in 1993, figured to 
have lots of success this season, but he missed four games because of a thigh 
bruise and was limited to 34 tackles (23 unassisted), one fumble recovery and 
three pass deflections in seven games. Then, in a season-ending, 24-23 loss at 
rival California, Swinton was beaten for a touchdown by former Harvard-Westlake 
receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a midseason story in a local newspaper appeared to pit Swinton 
against Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Swinton had criticized Walsh for failing to motivate players but said this 
week he appreciated being part of Walsh's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "That whole article was horrible," he said. "Yes, I did mention all the bad 
things. But I also said positive stuff, like we had the talent to challenge for 
a national championship. None of the positive stuff got in." 
</P>
<P>
 Swinton located Walsh on a tennis court the day the story was published, 
interrupted the match, apologized and explained. Walsh said the writer had been 
a longtime critic and told Swinton to stick with the positives. 
</P>
<P>
 Swinton was one of a host of top recruits who flocked to Stanford in 1993 to 
play for Walsh, who won three Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers after 
they hired him away from Stanford in 1978. Walsh was inducted into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame in 1992, the year he returned to Stanford and went 10-3 
and the year Swinton signed his letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walsh took less of a hands-on approach in his second tenure at Stanford, 
frequently stumbling over the names of his own players during press 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably is tired," Swinton said of Walsh. "He's been coaching for a 
while. I expected to come in and not lose a game -- like high school -- go to 
the Rose Bowl my freshman year. Maybe contend for a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Coach Walsh is Coach Walsh. He's the master. He's like Yoda (the Star 
Wars character). I learned from the best." 
</P>

 Neuheisel supporters: UCLA Coach Terry Donahue decided that Rick Neuheisel 
wasn't ready to be the Bruin offensive coordinator after Homer Smith's 
resignation last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But fifth-ranked Colorado on Monday decided the former Bruin quarterback and 
assistant was good enough to be its head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuheisel, whose recruiting territory at UCLA included the Valley, coached 
quarterbacks and receivers this season at Colorado and will replace Bill 
McCartney (92-55-5 in 13 seasons) after the Buffaloes play Notre Dame in the 
Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a different kind of spirit in him," said Colorado senior tight end 
Christian Fauria, an All-American candidate from Crespi High. "A lot of young 
guys relate to him. I'm sure in the long run he's going to bring this program 
to another level." 
</P>
<P>
 Does UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook agree? 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck yeah," said Cook, a senior from Newbury Park. "He's going to do a great 
job. I don't know how a talented player won't want to play for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue was concerned about Neuheisel's age (33) and lack of experience a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have paid to hear what was said between those guys (when Donahue 
turned down Neuheisel and hired Bob Toledo)," Cook said. "Rick knows as much 
about football as anybody -- even Homer. He knows his stuff. Who determines 
what age is too young anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maturity-wise, he can handle it. He's done so much with his life. He's passed 
the bar exam. He was a walk-on quarterback (at UCLA) who won a Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook agrees with Fauria: Neuheisel's attitude sets him apart from other 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fauria: "He's always talking, teaching and encouraging. He's got a lot of 
charisma. In practice, he stood out right away. The players are excited." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On McCartney: Fauria believes the Colorado coach's surprise resignation after 
a Nov. 19 victory over Iowa State came partly as a result of his Christian 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believes so much in his faith," Fauria said. "I think he wants to pursue 
this aspect of his life a lot more. But I'm almost positive he'll return to 
coaching. It'll be a team that's not very good, and he'll rebuild it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Fauria said he has turned down offers to play in the Hula 
Bowl and the Senior Bowl but will play in the East-West Shrine game. 
</P>

 In basketball, G.C. Marcaccini (Notre Dame) had 12 points and five rebounds 
and Pharoah Davis (Highland) added six points and five rebounds in George 
Mason's season-opening 97-95 victory over Charleston Southern. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 David Langley (College of the Canyons) is averaging 20.5 points and 4.3 
rebounds and Rasaan Hall (Crespi) 11.3 points and 5.5 rebounds at Quincy (Ill.) 
University. . . . Washington freshman Jason Hartman (Thousand Oaks) had six 
points and one rebound in nine minutes in his college basketball debut. The 
Huskies beat Eastern Washington, 68-48. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's volleyball, Cal State Bakersfield junior outside hitter Christy 
Wieneke (Agoura) is third in Division II in kills (556), and senior setter 
Jennifer Streltzoff (Thousand Oaks) leads the nation in assists per game 
(13.04). Senior outside hitter Erikka Gulbranson (Thousand Oaks) is second on 
the team with 329 digs. The top-seeded Roadrunners (39-2) will play Edinboro 
(Pa.) Saturday at home in the first round of the NCAA Division II tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 George Mason senior outside hitter Jessica Dinaberg (El Camino Real) was 
selected for the University Division GTE District III Academic All-American 
team. She carries a 3.78 grade-point average in accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's basketball, sophomore guard Marion Jones (Thousand Oaks) scored 23 
points in seventh-ranked North Carolina's 79-72 victory over No. 15 Florida in 
the championship game of the Rainbow Wahine Classic in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's soccer, San Diego sophomore defender Michelle Bush (Alemany) was 
named to the All-West Coast Conference first team. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's cross-country, brothers Peter (Granada Hills) and Paul De La Cerda 
(Hart) of Adams State (Colo.) placed 12th and 26th in the NCAA Division II 
championships in Kearney, Neb., on Nov. 19 to help the Indians to their third 
consecutive title.

THE COLLEGES / IRENE GARCIA; A STATELY FINISH FOR MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no secret that soccer isn't this country's most-popular sport and the 
infrequent media coverage it receives proves it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there was ample hype for a brief period during the summer while the 
World Cup was played in the United States, but that kind of exposure is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional, semipro and college soccer teams don't receive nearly as much 
attention as football, basketball and baseball programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the Moorpark College women's soccer team, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Successful as it has been, the program will live in the shadow of the equally 
successful football team each fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case again this year. But enough is enough. The women must be 
commended for another remarkable season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, seeded fourth in Southern California, upset top-seeded Cypress, 
3-2, on Saturday and earned a spot in this weekend's state tournament in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 It will mark the program's second trip to the final four since 1991. The 
Raiders beat De Anza that year for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark team that will travel by bus to Cosumnes River College and face 
defending champion De Anza on Saturday at 2 p.m. could be just as good. The 
Raiders placed second to another final four team, Bakersfield, in the powerful 
Western State Conference and looked impressive at Cypress against what was 
supposed to be a tougher, more experienced opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit, we're not technically as talented as other teams," Moorpark 
first-year Coach Ken Dale said. "But we hustle a lot and we scrap for the ball. 
We also fight back hard if we're down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have rebounded after a disappointing 3-6-3 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a disheartening finish for a group of athletes who came primarily from 
successful area high school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case (last year), being overshadowed by other sports was a blessing," 
Dale said. "Last season was tough for those players because most of them were 
used to winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Many enrolled at Moorpark because of the school's past triumphs in women's 
soccer. Seems like the program is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 This season Moorpark (11-3-3) has three All-WSC first-team picks -- defender 
Summer Salvatera, forward Vanessa Macen and midfielder Heather Heit -- and 
three second-team selections -- forward Christy McGowan, midfielder Mariah 
Ventre and striker Danika Molyneux . 
</P>
<P>
 Macen is the Raiders' top scorer with 12 goals. Goalkeepers Amy Fisher and 
Shannon Henry have been the team's most-impressive performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who had 26 saves against Cypress, has 73 this season and six shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry has 36 saves and four shutouts. In 14 conference games, Fisher and Henry 
allowed a total of seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt, they've been a big reason for our success," Dale said. "Amy has 
been absolutely brilliant this year. There's no other way to describe it." 
</P>
<P>
 After the team struggles of 1993, even some of Moorpark's returning players 
have been surprised by the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
 One key player, Shannon Henry, missed the regional playoff game against 
Cypress because she scheduled an Alaskan vacation months earlier. She was among 
a handful of players, Dale says, who doubted the team's ability to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said it really never occurred to her that we would make the playoffs," 
Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry's Alaskan jaunt will end in time for her to rejoin the Raiders in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing because we're going to need her," Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale was hired at Moorpark in August. He was the boys' soccer coach at Simi 
Valley High last season and was an assistant women's coach at Pepperdine 
University the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was a men's assistant at Radford University in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Arizona, Dale played at Kennesaw College in Georgia and in a 
Tucson semipro league for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I interviewed for jobs in Texas and Kansas over the summer, but they didn't 
work out," Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bet he's really glad now. Moorpark is not such a bad place to be, even if the 
soccer program doesn't sit in the limelight.

 The Griffins struggled last season in the Empire League and now move into the 
county's toughest league. There's no telling if Los Alamitos will be able to 
make a dent in its new schedule, but the Griffins will be one of the league's 
tallest teams--they have six players over 5-10--and might provide an upset 
along the way. Los Alamitos should be bolstered by the return of Fulp, who 
missed last season because of a broken foot, and the arrival of Nunley, who 
transferred from Long Beach St. Anthony; together, they should provide some 
much-needed experience and talent to go with Nichols (5.0 points per game) and 
Katie Ensley (6.0 points, 5.0 rebounds). Appleby and Amy Ensley improved 
greatly over the summer and the 6-4 Geoffroy should develop into a defensive 
force. The team is missing an important cog in its structure: a point guard who 
can get the ball inside. Donberg--the most valuable player on the junior 
varsity team last season--is one candidate. SCHEDULE

SADDLEBACK PICKS CUNERTY TO COACH FOOTBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Cunerty, an assistant at Saddleback College for 14 years, has been 
selected as the college's football coach, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunerty, 48, started at Saddleback in 1980 coaching the quarterbacks and later 
became the offensive coordinator.He takes over for Ken Swearingen, who retired 
after this season as the winningest football coach in community college 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunerty has been on staff for both of Saddleback's national championship 
seasons (1985 and 1992). While on sabbatical last fall, he visited 12 college 
and four professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really recharged my batteries," Cunerty said. "I can't wait to get 
started. In fact, I visited seven high schools already." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunerty played football and baseball at USC, then went on to Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, where he earned master's degrees in physical education and 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the head coach at North Torrance High from 1969-1973, Dana Hills 
(1974-76) and Capistrano Valley (1977-79) before moving to Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is the golf coach at Saddleback, and his teams have won 12 conference 
titles and four State titles, including last season's championship. STEVE

MATER DEI-LOS ALAMITOS TICKETS GOING QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei has sold 7,000 tickets for Friday's Southern Section Division I 
semifinal game at Anaheim Stadium, according to Athletic Director Gary 
McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Halpin, Los Alamitos activities director, said the school had sold 
approximately 4,100 tickets as of Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets remain on sale at the school and at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight said the game will remain at Anaheim Stadium no matter the weather. 
Stadium officials usually won't allow for a game to be played in the rain on 
the same weekend of a Ram home game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams play the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. But McKnight said stadium 
officials agreed to waive the rain clause. As of Wednesday, no rain has been 
forecast for Friday.

 The Village Christian High girls' basketball team was bolstered Wednesday by 
the transfer of point guard Jennifer Smith from Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will be eligible to play for the Crusaders when they open play in the 
L.A. Baptist tournament today, Village Christian Coach John Domke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just got some major help," Domke said. "She has the ability to control the 
game for us. She's a real natural for that position."

 Smith, a freshman, attended her first classes Wednesday and practiced with the 
team after school. DAVE DESMOND

COMMITTEE TO STUDY CSUN FUNDING OPTIONS; BUDGET: THREE ADMINISTRATORS WITH NO 
TIES TO ATHLETICS WILL COMPLETE LIST OF SCENARIOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge officials, seeking a detached perspective, have 
established a committee to address the school's looming athletic funding 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, three school administrators with no ties to athletics, hopes 
this month to complete a manageable list of funding scenarios to be presented 
to the campus community. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee includes Mary Ann Cummins Prager, who is an administrator in 
student services, Ronald Clouse, a school budget officer, and Erik Blaine, a 
campus housing director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got their feet to the fire," said the school's dean of students, Ron 
Kopita, who selected the committee members. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will be responsible for paring down a lengthy list of funding 
options, which will be presented to President Blenda J. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge athletics, facing a budget shortfall for 1995-96, could lose 
programs depending on the severity of the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Feedback from the campus community, submitted to Kopita and Wilson through 
letters and electronic mail, has been supportive of athletics, Kopita said. 
However, the feedback has been split 50-50 on whether to keep the school's 
Division I-AA football program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita said a decision on Northridge's athletic future could come before the 
fall semester ends Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God for computers," Cummins Prager said. "We can plug in the numbers 
and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will outline the possible "configuration of programs" in terms 
of benefits and costs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cummins Prager said the committee has not been given a target budget 
figure, complicating the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita said the group will address cuts as they relate to maintaining NCAA 
Division I membership and Cal State University gender-equity provisions, set to 
take effect in two years.

 Two Porter Valley Country Club members advanced to the round of 16 with 
first-round match-play victories Wednesday in the Women's State Amateur 
Championship at The Golf Club at Quail Lodge in Carmel, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Andrea Gaston of Chatsworth routed Nancy Markey of San 
Francisco, 6 and 5.Gaston will face Amanda Nealy of Grant's Pass, Ore., today 
at 7:35 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Chen Olsen of Granada Hills, who during stroke play Tuesday shot 75 and 
earned co-medalist honors, defeated Arlene Yost of San Luis Obispo, 6 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen will face Yukari Horikoshi of Santa Ana today at 7:30 a.m. If Olsen and 
Gaston win today, they will meet in the quarterfinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston rebounded after shooting a disappointing 12-over-par 83 in qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess in defending the title there's a little more pressure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other area players fell in the first round. Jody Duclos of Moorpark, a 
finalist last year, was beaten by Lynne Cowan of Hollister, 4 and 2. Cheryl 
Musser of West Hills was edged by Diane Irvin of Pacific Palisades, 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>

 The Indians begin the season rated second in the state by Cal-Hi Sports. 
Rigley, McKay, Funicello and Stoughton were starters on last season's team that 
won the Southern Section Division II-A championship and advanced to the state 
semifinals. How can Alemany top a season like that? "We're gonna run, we're 
gonna run and we're gonna run," Hearlihy said. "I just want to up-tempo our 
game to have more fun. The girls' game needs to do something to draw a crowd, 
and we can't slam dunk." Rigley, the Valley player of the year last season, has 
signed with Pepperdine. Buena 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 25-3

 The Bulldogs appear ready to defend their Southern Section Division I-A 
championship. Ranked fifth in the state, Buena dominated during the off-season, 
marching undefeated through three summer leagues. "I think we are capable of 
being one of the best teams in the (Southern Section)," Vaughan said. "We 
expect a lot out of ourselves." Vaughan's teams have won four section titles 
and advanced to a section final 10 times, including the last five. Hart

 Hart will attempt to win its third consecutive Foothill League title behind 
point guard Clarke, the league's most valuable player last season. "When you 
have a good point guard, she can make you look very good," Munroe said. "She 
can single-handedly break the press." Once she does, she will look to Broneer 
and Kuptz to provide scoring. Clarke should contribute in all areas. As a 
junior, she averaged nine points, led the team in assists and was second in 
rebounding. Newbury Park 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 21-6 12-2 2nd

</P>
<P>
 Parvin has been at Newbury Park for more than two decades, so it means 
something when she says, "Talent-wise, this is the best we've ever been." 
Wastell, McKeown, Thorpe and Arguijo have played on the varsity for three 
seasons. Add to that nucleus an impact player such as Intlekofer, a transfer 
from Oregon, and the Panthers appear poised to make a run at the Marmonte 
League title. Newbury Park begins the season ranked second in the state in 
Division III. North Hollywood 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 15-7

 The Huskies again may be the class of area City Section teams. They have 
advanced to the City championship game three times in Allen's 11 seasons and 
won eight of the last nine Mid-Valley League titles. Two-time All-City point 
guard Anna Celaya should break the school's career scoring record this season. 
Celaya, her twin sister, Bobbi, and Anaheim Canyon transfer Wasserman have led 
Allen to switch to a three-guard offense. Notre Dame 03,17,08,07 1993-94

 The Knights can't wait to prove they have arrived. "We have never ever been 
this good," DiMuro said. Nine players, including four starters, return from a 
club that set 11 team records last season. Dixon, a Times second-team 
All-Valley selection last season, has signed with the University of San Diego. 
If the Knights are to win a Mission League championship, however, they must 
beat Alemany, the No. 2 team in the state. "They are the model program," DiMuro 
said. "We are building to beat that model." Simi Valley 03,17,08,09 1993-94

 Three starters return and the team has been bolstered by the addition of 
Cooper, a transfer from rival Royal who led Ventura County in scoring as a 
sophomore. "One of our goals is to compete for the league title," Murphy said. 
"If everyone thinks we're going to be good, we have to live up to those 
expectations." Simi Valley will have plenty of competition in the league, 
especially from Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks. Taft 03,17,08,07 1993-94

 After 13 seasons coaching Taft's boys' team, Woodard takes over a girls' team 
that won the Northwest Valley Conference championship and advanced to the City 
3-A Division semifinals last year. This season, however, the conference has 
been moved to the 4-A division. Three starters return, including All-City 
selections Griffin and Martinez. McKeith, a small forward last season, has made 
the transition to point guard. "That was a huge question mark for us," Woodard 
said. "Now it's one of our strengths." Ventura 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL

 In the past five seasons, the Cougars have reached a Southern Section final 
three times and the semifinals twice. "Our goal is to be peaking at playoff 
time," Gray said. Brown must have another big season if Ventura is to challenge 
Buena in the Channel League. The All-Southern Section guard/forward averaged 
14.6 points last season and has signed with Long Beach State. Size may be a 
problem for the Cougars. The tallest starter is 5-10. Village Christian

 James, Palmquist and Lehman led the Crusaders to the Southern Section IV-A 
championship game and state semifinals last year. "The rest of our team is 
young and inexperienced, but they have a lot of talent," Domke said. Village 
Christian has dominated the Alpha League, winning its past 18 games. Langhans' 
ability to step in for graduated All-Southern Section point guard Jeanne 
Beauchamp may be pivotal.

 FINAL ACT 
</P>
<P>
 Record-setting quarterback Steve Sarkisian will play in his last game for El 
Camino College on Saturday night when the Warriors (9-1) meet College of the 
Desert (8-2) in the Southern California Bowl at Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Because statistics from bowl games are not credited toward season totals, 
Sarkisian won't get a chance to add to an impressive list of passing records. 
His 3,659 yards this season ranks second on the all-time national community 
college list behind Tom Luginbill, who passed for 3,701 yards in 1993 at 
Palomar. Luginbill, son of former San Diego State coach Al Luginbill, plays at 
Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkisian also ranks second on the all-time national list in career yards 
(6,629) and touchdowns (58). He is third in career completions (455). 
</P>
<P>
 This season Sarkisian became the first community college quarterback to finish 
with a passing efficiency rating of over 200. He completed 72.4% of his passes 
(228 of 315), with 37 touchdowns and only eight interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phenomenal, just phenomenal," El Camino offensive coordinator Fred Petersen 
said of Sarkisian, who broke virtually all of the school passing records. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen, who coached seven All-Southern Section quarterbacks in 20 seasons at 
West Torrance High and has worked with four JC All-American quarterbacks in 11 
years at El Camino, says Sarkisian has a great feel for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had quarterbacks with a little better arms, guys with better size and 
guys with more quickness," Petersen said. "But for the overall package, he's 
the best. He understands coverages and (defensive) alignments, and he hardly 
ever runs us into a bad play. He sees stuff as quick or quicker than I do. 
Teams try to blitz us a lot, and he burns them." 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen expects the same against an aggressive Desert defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a blitzing, stunting, try-to-get-you-upset type of team," he said. 
"They're pretty good, but Sark hasn't had that much trouble with blitzing 
teams. I think we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkisian has given an unwritten commitment to Brigham Young University, but 
Petersen said the sophomore still plans to take recruiting trips to Kansas 
State, Fresno State and BYU. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still up in the air a little," Petersen said. NOSTALGIA 
</P>
<P>
 Before this season, the last time a Mary Star football team reached the 
semifinals of the Southern Section playoffs was in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Andrie remembers because he was a junior that year at Mary Star and 
played on a team that featured Tim Wrightman, who went on to play tight end for 
UCLA and the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrie, in his first season as Mary Star's coach, says the spirit of '77 is 
alive and well at the San Pedro school this week as the Stars (11-1) prepare to 
meet top-seeded Orange Lutheran (10-2) in the Division X semifinals Friday 
night at Daniels Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of excitement in the air right now," Andrie said. "The kids 
have played well and brought back the winning tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1977 team lost in the semifinals to Norwalk, which went on to win the 
Central Conference title. It figures to be just as difficult for Mary Star to 
get past Orange Lutheran, champion of the competitive Olympic League. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look good," Andrie said of his team's opponent. "They have an explosive 
offense and they run a lot of different formations and shift into a lot of 
different sets. They try to create mismatches. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to be the best you have to beat the best. At least we have them at home. 
I'm looking forward to the game." HONOR ROLL 
</P>
<P>
 Several outstanding defensive performances were turned in by area players last 
week in the quarterfinals of the prep football playoffs. The highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Serra defensive backs Ademole Turner and David Burr returned interceptions 
82 and 55 yards, respectively, for touchdowns in a 19-10 Division III victory 
over Rowland. Turner leads the area with 10 interceptions, three returned for 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peninsula linebacker Jeremy Sparling had a team-high 11 tackles as the 
Panthers limited Arcadia to 136 yards in a 17-0 Division II victory. The 
Panthers lead the area in scoring defense, giving up 7.2 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mira Costa linebackers Dennis Hughes and Ricky Saunders continued to make 
life miserable for quarterbacks, combining for four sacks in a 15-7 Division 
VII victory over South Hills. Hughes leads the area with 21 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mary Star linebacker Phillip Trutanich had 12 tackles and defensive back 
Iggy Galaz intercepted his eighth and ninth passes of the season in a 27-7 
Division X victory over Ontario Christian. The Stars are giving up an average 
of eight points a game. HOME COOKING 
</P>
<P>
 For the second year in a row, Mira Costa's football team spared itself a trip 
to Lompoc by winning a coin toss to determine the home team. The Mustangs 
(11-1) will play host to Lompoc (11-1) at 7:30 Saturday night in the Division 
VII semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa beat Lompoc, 15-8, in the quarterfinals last season at home. 
Afterward, Lompoc Coach Robin Luken addressed Mira Costa's size advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Volkswagen and a Mac truck just don't mix," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luken was mainly referring to fullback-nose guard Phil Fonua, who rushed for 
two touchdowns and was a disruptive force on defense. Luken won't have to worry 
about Fonua this time because the senior has been sidelined all season after 
suffering a ruptured brain aneurysm last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mira Costa's defense is still a force, having held 10 opponents to 12 
points or less. The linebacking corps of Hughes, Saunders and Isaac Marin is 
regarded as the best in school history. ILL WIND 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula's football team not only has to prepare for a formidable opponent 
this week, the Panthers also must prepare for the bone-chilling weather they 
expect to encounter Friday night in a Division II semifinal at Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Gary Kimbrell said he ordered thermal tops for his players and was 
looking into the possibility of bringing portable heaters to the game. The 
temperature is expected to be in the 30s, and the usual heavy winds in the high 
desert can add to the windchill. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will take more than inclement weather to bring down the area's hottest 
football team. Peninsula (11-1) has outscored opponents, 383-55, in winning its 
last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything stops the Panthers, it will be Antelope Valley (9-2), which has 
cruised through the first two rounds of the playoffs. POSTSCRIPT 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't all that surprising to Leuzinger football Coach Fred Boehm, 
whose team was blown out by top-seeded Hart, 51-0, last week in the Division II 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehm said he sensed the Olympians were spent after back-to-back emotional 
victories over Hawthorne and Burroughs of Ridgecrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those last two games took something out of our kids," Boehm said. "The 
players tried to talk it up during the week, but I could tell it wasn't there. 
The week started off badly when our quarterback (Rob Fredrickson) smashed his 
finger in a door and couldn't practice for a couple of days. And we lost some 
kids to ineligibility." 
</P>
<P>
 And then Hart showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they're pretty awesome," Boehm said. "But we're not that bad." NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Bishop Montgomery is looking for a new football coach to replace Matt 
Giacalone, who has resigned to devote more time to his family and job as the 
school's dean of boys. The Knights were 6-14 with no playoff appearances in two 
seasons under Giacalone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peninsula, the area's top girls' basketball team, opened the season 
Wednesday night in the 16-team Capital City Shootout in Sacramento. The 
Panthers return four starters from last season's 25-5 team, led by senior guard 
Allison Fortner and 6-foot senior center Katharine Foster-Keddie, and have 
added 5-11 sophomore forward Mo-nique Langston, an all-state freshman at 
Bakersfield Foothill last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bishop Montgomery and Mira Costa were both eliminated in the semifinals of 
the State girls' volleyball playoffs Tuesday. Mira Costa lost to St. Mary's of 
Stockton, 15-4, 13-15, 15-8, 15-10, in a Division I match, and Bishop 
Montgomery lost to Centennial of Bakersfield, 15-2, 15-12, 17-15 in a Division 
II match. ROB FERNAS

 Civic groups -- A story about the Coalition for a Non-Violent City published 
Nov. 24 in the San Gabriel Valley section incorrectly identified Rena Dyson and 
Sharon Anderson as co-founders of the We Care Coalition. They are currently We 
Care's co-chairs. We Care was founded by Shirley Adams and Alan LaShaw of the 
Pasadena-Foothill branch of the Los Angeles Urban League.
