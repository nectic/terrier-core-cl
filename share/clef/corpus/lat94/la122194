A DECISION THAT'S REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE; WASHINGTON REJECTS LOS ANGELES 
APPLICATION FOR A CRUCIALLY NEEDED EMPOWERMENT ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever the real reason, the decision not to award a federal empowerment zone 
to Los Angeles was a bad one. No other American city has suffered as much in 
recent years. The Northridge earthquake, the riots, fires, mudslides and a 
lingering recession have claimed a fearsome toll. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington argues that the city's application for a federal package of 
$100 million in tax credits and other coveted economic incentives was weak and 
in particular lacked the important specifics and parallel public and private 
commitments that were in the winning applications. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Mayor Richard Riordan's office claims the L.A. application was 
deliberately general -- designed to allow each targeted community to determine 
what it needed to reduce blight, create jobs and encourage economic 
development. Los Angeles was also hurt by federal criteria that greatly boosted 
the chances of smaller cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the problems, the feds should not have aced out a region whose 
troubles were the very reason Congress revisited the empowerment-zone issue and 
created legislation whose fruits are now evidently to be denied Los Angeles. 
The 1992 riots, awful as they were, did push the then-moribund but still 
meritorious "enterprise zone" idea back onto the front burner in Washington. 
(The bill cleared Congress but was vetoed by then-President George Bush.) 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's decision is very sad indeed. A federal empowerment zone would 
have benefited poor neighborhoods in Pacoima and East, Central and South Los 
Angeles. The city could use a dozen empowerment zones to reduce blight in poor 
areas. While most of the nation enjoys a healthy rebound from the recession, 
Southern California continues to struggle. Yes, there are some positive signs 
lately -- and for some of them the Clinton Administration deserves credit. 
Washington's help after the Northridge quake last year was remarkable. Even so, 
the region remains plagued by high unemployment and the loss of defense jobs 
due to downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the stunning decision is causing politicians to scramble for cover, 
seeking to point blame away from themselves. Los Angeles politicians suggest 
the Administration is paying back political favors owed more urgently to 
others. Maybe, but the Clinton Administration hardly needs to irritate the same 
California voters it must have to stay in the White House beyond 1996. Thus, 
while painting the L.A. political power structure as disorganized and 
outmaneuvered by savvier competitors elsewhere in the nation, the 
Administration is expected to throw Los Angeles a few major bones, including 
millions from another federal program. Still the question remains: How did what 
should have been a political slam dunk become a costly political turnover?

DON'T LET GO OF THE CROWN JEWELS; THE DEFICIT-REDUCTION PROGRAM WAS WORKING -- 
STAY WITH THAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tax cuts are scarcely a new idea. Bill Clinton, when running for President, 
promised some kind of middle-class tax cut (though once in office he tabled the 
idea, wisely, to focus on deficit reduction). And tax cuts are almost always 
popular with Republicans, who spotlighted the idea in the so-called "contract 
with America," the GOP blueprint issued earlier this year. So it's no secret 
why President Clinton is now in such a big rush to be the front runner in the 
Washington tax-cut race; he fears that the Republicans are stealing the idea he 
stole from them and he'll wind up the loser. 
</P>
<P>
 His hurried and incomplete proposals for both tax and spending cuts, however, 
will do little to raise public confidence in the Administration. Clinton has 
been too quick to bend to the political winds, jeopardizing the credibility of 
his otherwise prudent economic policy. He zeroed in on deficit reduction early 
in his Administration, showing leadership, courage and consistency. Now in 
political anxiousness brought on by the GOP election triumphs, Clinton could 
very well marginalize his own economic accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending cuts that the Administration unveiled Monday were an exercise in 
political expediency and a demonstration of why the public is so cynical. In an 
effort to add credibility to his five-year, $60-billion middle-class tax-cut 
plan, disclosed last week, Clinton offered an elaborate briefing on Monday to 
explain some spending cuts needed to make those tax cuts possible. 
</P>
<P>
 His first attack on spending produces only $20 billion in savings and largely 
involves reconfiguring or selling assets, programs and departments in five 
agencies. The initial attempt to achieve a leaner government centers on 
consolidating and/or privatizing some programs. Clinton has proposed selling 
the government's Naval Petroleum Reserves, in Elk Hills, Calif. He also wants 
to turn air traffic control operations over to a federal corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending cuts, like the Administration's tax cuts, raise more questions 
than they answer. Too many of the cutbacks are unspecified. How much will come 
from permanent reductions in ongoing government operations? Some savings, such 
as from the proposed sale of Elk Hills reserves, are mere one-time adjustments. 
Will safety be compromised if air traffic operations are privatized? Are 
government-owned corporations viable entities? 
</P>
<P>
 And now the public waits. A renewed sense of cynicism creeps in as we watch 
the tax-cut derby. The President is feeling the pressure. Worse, he is 
overreacting with a misplaced urgency that could undermine his program -- and 
reelection. This is the time for a clear strategy at the White House instead of 
shortsighted tactical moves. If that takes time, take it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clearly not in the nation's long-term interest to rush into a tax cut. 
The recovering economy does not need the stimulus of a tax cut. Small and 
efficient government is desirable, but the savings from such a change should be 
used to pay down the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Deficit reduction is a goal that should not be abandoned. The Administration 
responds that its new package also permits more deficit reduction, albeit 
modest. Don't be so modest. Stay focused on reducing that deficit. The policy 
was working.

THE END OF THE NEW BEGINNING?; CHRISTOPHER RIGHTLY TELLS PYONGYANG TO STOP 
PLAYING GAMES WITH HELICOPTER AIRMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is still possible to hope that the pilot of a crashed U.S. helicopter and 
the remains of his dead colleague will be returned by North Korea at any moment 
and that the delay of the last few days has been nothing more than the result 
of North Korea's arteriosclerotic decision-making processes. But in the event 
something more ominous is going on in Pyongyang, Washington must make it 
unmistakably plain: The pilot, as well as the other airman's body, must be 
given back without further delay if progress in U.S-North Korean relations is 
to remain on track. As U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher aptly put it 
Tuesday, "We have indicated that a further delay . . . would be of great 
concern to us and would affect the atmosphere in which we've been hoping to 
improve relations with North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 One major problem now in dealing with North Korea is that it is not entirely 
clear who is really running the country following the death of long-term leader 
Kim Il Sung. The nation remains in official mourning, and there is speculation 
that Kim Jong Il, Kim's son and designated successor, has not been able to 
seize all the reins of power. The possible reason: North Korea's military, more 
inward-looking and Stalinist than even the North Korean Communist Party, still 
hasn't accepted the son as legitimate heir. 
</P>
<P>
 The elite of the armed forces may regard the helicopter incident as a military 
matter and insist on controlling the issue. But if that happens, North Korea 
will be putting at risk not just the recent positive trend in 
Pyongyang-Washington relations but the $4-billion deal by which the United 
States would help that impoverished nation build non-threatening nuclear 
electric generators in exchange for North Korea's suspension of its nuclear 
buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 This should not come to a dangerous standoff. But it could if North Korea 
drags its feet much longer. The proposed nuclear pact, already under criticism 
in the United States, will not have any support among Americans if Pyongyang 
reverts to its old Cold War ways.

HOSPITALS' MEDICARE BILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am an attorney with the Center for Health Care Rights (CHCR), a nonprofit 
group that assists Medicare beneficiaries, both as individuals and with respect 
to systemic problems such as the one experienced by Phil Willon and his wife 
("Medicare Through the Looking Glass," Commentary, Dec. 14). Unfortunately, 
Willon's "Alice in Wonderland" experience with the financial side of 
health-care coverage is not uncommon. As a result of the situation described by 
Willon, Medicare beneficiaries generally pay about 48% of the amount hospitals 
receive for outpatient surgery, rather than the 20% that hospitals, Medicare 
and Medicare supplemental insurance companies lead them to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 CHCR has been trying to rectify this injustice. I am the lead attorney in a 
nationwide class-action lawsuit challenging both how much Medicare 
beneficiaries may be charged for hospital outpatient services and the Medicare 
notices that falsely claim Medicare pays 80% of such charges. However, even if 
successful, litigation often takes years. Last year, Rep. William J. Coyne 
(D-Pa.) introduced a bill in Congress to limit how much people with Medicare 
must pay for hospital outpatient services. The bill died along with health-care 
reform, but will be reintroduced in the next Congress.

 * Willon's article explains the morass of Medicare payments well, but reaches 
an incorrect conclusion. He clearly demonstrates that politicians make huge 
promises (e.g., Medicare), then government jury-rigs the system (paying "50 
cents or less on the dollar") so politicians can avoid admitting that they 
can't fulfill their promises. As a result, the private client/private insurance 
companies pay artificial high prices to keep the medical system afloat. 
Government ducking its share is a major contributor to medical cost inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Willon properly notes the problems caused because patients do not see/dispute 
their bills. The solution is not for government to make more big promises (like 
Social Security, which is also grossly underfunded) and incur more debt, nor is 
it to make big business the sole payer. 
</P>
<P>
 Our primary medical-care payment system must encourage individuals to contain 
costs by avoiding unnecessary treatment and by monitoring their charges. This 
is best accomplished by making the individual responsible for his/her bills, 
with the availability of private insurance that would leave the individual 
paying a meaningful deductible and coinsurance percentage.

BUCHANAN ON JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Christians, Nazis and Jesse Jackson" (Column Right, Dec. 13), Pat Buchanan 
got it half right. The Rev. Jesse Jackson was wrong to liken to Hitlerism the 
religious conservatism of the Christian Coalition whose leader, Ralph Reed, has 
embraced the core values of the civil rights movement and made sincere attempts 
to reach out to African Americans and American Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Buchanan ought to come to terms with the historical 
evidence that too many "conservative Christians" either ignored or even 
approved the rise of National Socialism in Germany and Jim Crow in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II, Pastor Martin Niemoeller admitted 
his own fateful error: "In Germany they came first for the Communists, and I 
didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and 
I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the trade 
unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they 
came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. Then 
they came for me, and by that time no one was left to speak up."

 * Buchanan cannot stop rattling that "liberal media" saber. A "hypocritical 
media" allow the "rhetoric of assassination." It seems that Buchanan would take 
umbrage about Jackson's remarks about the theological rationale for the Nazis, 
although, referring to the Crusades and the Inquisition, Christian reaction to 
opposition could be seen as equally heavy-handed. I'll note that no column 
appears when conservative golden calf Limbaugh speaks of "feminazis." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting his argument Buchanan writes, "As early as 1937 Pope Pius XI 
issued" a proclamation denouncing Nazi persecution of Catholics. He doesn't say 
the Pope spoke against Jewish or Gypsy persecution. Hitler was named chancellor 
in January, 1933, and given dictatorial powers two months later. He built 
Dachau (1933), enacted the Nuremberg Laws (1935), reincorporated the Saar 
(1935) and occupied the Rhineland (1936). The Pope spoke only after increasing 
Nazi power threatened the church. Surely this "blind eye" helped fascism 
solidify control. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose none of this makes a difference to a columnist making a point. I 
just never thought I would see the day that Buchanan would accuse anyone of 
name-calling.

 * Buchanan's column really got me chuckling. It seems that the group that 
brought us the words "feminazis," "counterculture McGovernicks" and a host of 
other names that drip off the lips of the Pats, the Rushs, and the Newts of 
this country do not like it when someone calls them a name. It seems funny that 
what is common practice on the right is characterized as a minor tennis 
infraction (foot fault -- I had to look it up). But when someone on the left 
turns a phrase, it is characterized as a rhetorical hate crime.  
</P>
<P>
 To Pat, I now know that you do not like to be called names so I will just say 
hypocritical whiner. If the shoe fits, wear it.

<P>
 I note the passing of Rep. Glenn Anderson with sadness and a cherished 
personal memory (Dec. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952 I was a first-year high school history teacher.In need of a copy of 
the California State Constitution, I called the office of my assemblyman, the 
same Glenn Anderson who was later to become lieutenant governor and 
congressman. I was surprised that he answered the phone himself. No secretary, 
no voice mail. He assured me I would get my copy of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 About nine o'clock that evening there was a knock on my door. It was my 
assemblyman with the Constitution in hand. I taught for the next 35 years and 
used that story many times as an example of the ultimate in constituent 
service.

</P>
<P>
 For those of us who worked with the congressman over the years, he will always 
be remembered for the projects he made possible for our region and his 
commitment to serving his constitutents. He obtained the funding for numerous 
projects -- allowing our ports to grow and remain prosperous, making the 
Century/Glenn Anderson Freeway possible and providing the Metro Rail program 
access to federal funds. He understood the interconnectivity of the 
transportation system and the importance of all types of projects working 
together to help our region to be economically viable. He had vision.

 Re "Fire Chief Apologizes for Portrayal of Video," Dec. 14:

 Rather than investigating whether Chief Donald Manning and the Los Angeles 
Fire Department were making a "blooper" tape or just trying to "cover their 
burros," Fire Commissioner Leslie Song Winner should be concerning herself with 
a far more serious problem. Winner, the entire Fire Commission and even The 
Times should be trying to find out if any of those physically inept persons, of 
whatever gender or ethnic persuasion, depicted in the infamous video have 
slipped through the drafty cracks of affirmative action and are now sitting in 
a fire station, an accident waiting to happen.

ANNENBERG'S CHALLENGE; EDUCATION: L.A.-AREA GRANT SUMMONS BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY 
TO SUPPORT SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN B. SAMPLE, Steven B. Sample, president of the University of Southern 
California, chaired the group that prepared Los Angeles' response to the 
Annenberg challenge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last December, Walter H. Annenberg offered a Christmas gift to the nation's 
public elementary and secondary schools -- a $500-million challenge grant to 
support reform efforts. The Los Angeles area has just received its own present, 
as former Ambassador Annenberg has earmarked $53 million of his original gift 
to spur reforms here.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the cash value, the Annenberg challenge is important because it 
represents a shrewd businessman's willingness to invest in what many believe to 
be a shaky enterprise. When an entrepreneur of Walter Annenberg's renown puts 
large amounts of his own money into our public schools, he raises their 
credibility in the eyes of mainstream American business and industry. Now is 
the time for the nation's private sector to follow his lead and become fully 
engaged in the education of the nation's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Many citizens feel that the education of children should be left to government 
agencies or local school districts. However, sometimes the most effective role 
for those bureaucracies to play in the area of school reform is simply to get 
out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 When parents, teachers, civic leaders, governments, businesses and neighbors 
are motivated to work together for the sake of children, a true educational 
community is established. And such a community can overcome many of the 
obstacles that now stand in the way of the education of those children. The 
Annenberg challenge offers the kind of financial carrot that can begin to pull 
these groups together to provide stability and opportunity for the next 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrewdness of the Annenberg challenge -- so named because private and 
public organizations are challenged to provide matching funds -- is that it is 
designed to support reform movements that are already budding in so many parts 
of the United States. Rather than create yet another approach to reform, 
Annenberg is rewarding those approaches that have already demonstrated the 
greatest promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience tells us there is no single prescription for our schools' ills. 
Different communities will need to address different concerns in different 
ways. But the best solutions generally share two traits: an ability to bring 
disparate groups together as stake holders in a common enterprise, and a 
willingness to allow market forces to reward quality and promote innovation and 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of challenge that Walter Annenberg has made to the rest of us is not 
merely a financial one. It is also a moral one. The time has arrived for each 
of us, regardless of whether we have children enrolled in public schools, to 
respond to Annenberg's challenge and make our own contributions to society's 
overriding mission: the equipping of our youngest citizens to face successfully 
a demanding and uncertain future.

A CAUTIONARY LESSON FOR OUR GOVERNOR; PROP. 187: ORVAL FAUBUS WON POLITICAL 
POINTS AS A BIGOT; IS THAT HOW PETE WILSON WANTS TO BE REMEMBERED, TOO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

pages.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was ironic and even poetic that former Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus died last 
week on the same day a federal judge in Los Angeles dealt a major legal setback 
to Proposition 187, the mean-spirited initiative California voters approved 
last month in an attempt -- born of frustration and most likely futile -- to 
stop illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 To those of us who consider a decent public-school education to be a 
fundamental right for all children in this country, those seemingly separate 
events fit together quite nicely. In the 1950s, Faubus defied federal orders to 
admit black children to white-only public schools and became a lightning rod in 
the fight against racial segregation throughout the South. In the 1990s, 
California Gov. Pete Wilson, the chief proponent of Proposition 187, has become 
a similar symbol by trying to use the controversial initiative to keep illegal 
immigrant children from attending public schools in this state. But Wilson's 
status as a Faubus for the '90s is not unalterable. He can be forced to change. 
</P>
<P>
 During the highly charged campaign leading up to the November election, Wilson 
often portrayed himself as the victim of unfair attacks by opponents of 
Proposition 187. To hear him talk, he was just a well-meaning chief executive 
who on his watch happened to discover all the economic damage illegal 
immigrants allegedly do to this once-Golden State. So he sadly took on the 
distasteful task of bringing the troubling problem to the attention of the 
federal government and, not coincidentally, California voters. It was not his 
fault that this had to be done in the same political year that sloppily written 
and constitutionally dubious Proposition 187 was put on the ballot by 
grass-roots immigration restrictionists. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative aims to halt illegal immigration not by drying up the jobs that 
lure immigrants to California, but by barring illegal immigrants from 
government-paid social services. That includes, most significantly, access to 
public schools -- even if an illegal immigrants' children were born in this 
country. That runs directly counter to U.S. Supreme Court decisions, one of the 
main reasons U.S. Dist. Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer issued a restraining order 
last Wednesday barring implementation of most of Proposition 187 until legal 
challenges to it run their course, a process that could take years. 
</P>
<P>
 But back to the way Pete Wilson sees things: For just discussing the illegal 
immigration issue on the campaign stump, he wound up being vilified, especially 
by angry Latino activists who attacked him as the reincarnation of every 
historic villain from Cortez to Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the anti-Wilson rhetoric was overblown. But Latinos did have good 
cause to be angry with the governor. He blatantly used the anti-immigrant 
initiative to help revive his reelection campaign, which had once been 
considered moribund. Wilson may not be a racist villain, but he is clearly an 
ambitious politician who found a hot-button issue and exploited it -- much as 
Orval Faubus did 40 years ago in Arkansas with school desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Faubus became such a symbol of bigotry in the early civil-rights era, 
it is often forgotten that he was first elected governor in 1954 as a liberal 
populist who was a moderate on racial issues. But Faubus' biographers agree 
that in 1957 he took a segregationist stance because he feared being defeated 
for reelection by right-wing rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when it became time for Arkansas to implement the Supreme Court's Brown 
vs. Board of Education decision by allowing nine black students to integrate 
Little Rock's Central High School, Faubus played the race card. He threatened 
to use the Arkansas National Guard to turn black students away, but he was 
trumped by President Eisenhower, who ordered troops from the 101st Airborne 
division to escort the children to class.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Faubus') hubris, his romping ambition, got in the way of his doing what I 
suspect he knew was right," said Robert Savage, chairman of the University of 
Arkansas' political science department, in discussing Faubus' career last week. 
But Faubus' segregationist strategy worked. He won reelection and went on to 
serve as Arkansas' governor for four moreterms. And, as Faubus' obituaries 
noted, he never did apologize for his actions in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 That final point is what sets Faubus apart from another, better-known 
politician who came to be closely identified with racial segregation, Alabama 
Gov. George Wallace. Wallace did apologize for his actions in trying to prevent 
the desegregation of the University of Alabama in 1963. He did so when he again 
ran for governor in 1982 -- after the 1965 Voting Rights Act gave black voters 
in Alabama political clout they had not had before. It is not insignificant, I 
think, that Faubus retired from office in 1967 rather than run before an 
Arkansas electorate that included newly empowered black voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson here for the many Latinos in California and elsewhere who 
universally detest Pete Wilson is obvious. He can either remain an Orval Faubus 
of the '90s or become this generation's George Wallace. It all depends on 
Latinos' willingness to start voting in large numbers, as African Americans did 
in the segregationist South after 1965.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE MIDDLE EAST; MAKE WAY FOR A CLEAR MANDATE; THE ABSENCE OF AN 
ELECTED PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT RETARDS BOTH POLITICAL STABILITY AND ECONOMIC 
STRUCTURING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MUSTAFA BARGHOUTHI, Mustafa Barghouthi is president of the Union of 
Palestinian Medical Relief Committees and a former member of the Palestinian 
negotiating team to the Madrid peace talks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen months after the signing of the Oslo agreement, and about half a year 
into its implementation, there is frustration among both Palestinians and 
Israelis that the promised fruits of peace and prosperity are still far beyond 
their reach. 
</P>
<P>
 In a situation complicated by serious security problems and instability for 
both peoples, where violence and an oppressive occupation in more than 90% of 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip are the daily facts of life, a dangerous 
polarization is taking place between the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas 
fundamentalist group. At this stage, Hamas is successfully using the 
authority's failure to meet the people's very basic needs, presenting its ideas 
as the only alternative to a harsh and disappointing situation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main reasons for this challenge to political stability is the 
failure of both Israeli and Palestinian leaders to create an environment 
conducive to economic growth. There is a lack of effective systems to use the 
substantial base of Palestinian expertise. Such systems are necessary to 
encourage investment and development. This process will not take place as long 
as investors are insecure about how their money is used and while there is an 
absence of clear regulations and standards to guard against abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only source of authority on the Palestinian side lies within the 
office of Yasser Arafat. Despite many appointments made by the Palestinian 
Authority, those in positions of responsibility lack a clear mandate, job 
description or the necessary authority to allow them to perform their jobs. 
Many of the appointments have been based largely on patronage and status in the 
30-year-old PLO bureaucracy. The result has led to the marginalization of many 
national and secular leaders who could provide a wealth of expertise if 
empowered. To add to the confusion, multiple appointments have been made to 
fill single positions. In the Health Ministry, for example, there are three 
appointed directors and no one knows who is in charge. The poor handling of the 
recent outbreak of cholera, which surfaced in Gaza for the first time in more 
than 25 years, illustrates the risks inherent in this situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the popularity of the governing authority and the peace process 
itself is dwindling. Individual income continues to diminish and unemployment 
sits at around 50%. In a recent public-opinion poll conducted by the Center for 
Palestine Research and Studies, 40% of the respondents said that the general 
living and economic conditions have worsened since the signing of the Oslo 
agreement; only 31% said that they were satisfied with the performance of the 
Palestinian Authority. About 80% of the respondents agreed that elections are a 
better alternative to appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, sizable segments of the democratic forces of the country, having in the 
past advocated a peaceful but just solution to the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict, are now paralyzed because of the behavior of the Palestinian 
Authority. Such forces are torn between rightful dissatisfaction with the 
authority's unprofessional and undemocratic methods and, on the other hand, 
apprehension that criticism will be viewed as an obstruction to peace.  
</P>
<P>
 Increasing the pressure on Arafat to modify his behavior will not alone 
rectify this degenerating situation. In the eyes of many Palestinians, one of 
the major underlying causes of this sad state of affairs lies in the 
undemocratic nature of the Gaza-Jericho agreement (known commonly as the Cairo 
agreement), signed by Israel and the Palestinians last May. The agreement 
denies the Palestinians the right to have legislative elections; it talks about 
electing only a small executive body with no or very limited legislative 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
 This restriction preempts comprehensive general elections in three ways: by 
not allowing Palestinians to elect representatives to negotiate on their behalf 
as legitimate, democratically elected leaders; by not allowing the separation 
of legislative, executive and judiciary powers, which is crucial to remedy the 
long history of Palestinian suffering from power abuse and by not including the 
Palestinian people, through elections, in the process of peace and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the obstacles to elections are overcome, it is hard to imagine a 
constructive way to resolve the mounting political and economic crises. Without 
a democratically elected body responsible for creating laws and regulations, it 
is impossible to expect suitable agencies to develop that can support economic 
growth, trade, finance and banking systems. Without a legislative body that 
reflects the needs of the people, it is hard to imagine how a vision will 
develop to deal with the severely deformed infrastructure and efficiently 
utilize the international aid promised to the Palestinians. Given the existing 
level of Palestinian frustration and dismay, it is also hard to imagine how 
further negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis could be conducted, 
especially when both sides come to the difficult issues such as the future of 
the West Bank, Jerusalem and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 After so many years of pain and affliction in the region, the same absence of 
democracy and people's participation surfaces again, not only as one of the 
main causes of prolonged suffering, but also as the main obstacle in the way of 
moving forward toward a promising future.

DEAR SANTA: WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE; A PRESIDENT WHO'S PROACTIVE, NOT REACTIVE; 
WELFARE REALITY CHECKS FOR CONGRESS; POSITIVE NEWS ABOUT LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates writes from Los Angeles about 
modern culture, race relations and politics for several national publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's that time of year again, when the post office is besieged with letters 
written in stubby pencils, crayons and markers. These haphazardly stuffed 
envelopes are usually filled with the collective longing of children across the 
country, each hoping that Santa Claus will hear his and her individual plea. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a safe guess that there will probably not be too many ponies staring in 
bewilderment as the automatic garage doors slide open to bring them face to 
face with a child struck dumb with happiness. Even in Los Angeles, that's the 
stuff of movies. (There will be puppies and kittens adopted from the city's 
animal shelters, however.) Some lucky kids will get exactly what they want -- 
and more. Some, but not enough, will receive toys and clothes donated by the 
kindness of strangers who cannot stand to contemplate a presentless Christmas 
for a needy child. And, sadly, far too many will receive nothing, despite the 
best efforts of their parents, who are often impoverished and/or homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 We adults hope for things at Christmas, too, but few, if any of us, sit down 
and write to Santa. Maybe it's the specter of all those children's letters 
circulating in dead-letter limbo. Maybe it's that we don't have the time to 
write our real friends and relatives -- let alone someone we're not sure even 
exists. But faith, as St. Paul pointed out, is belief in the evidence of things 
unseen. Or, as countless parents have pointed out: Nothing ventured, nothing 
gained. So, keeping those two pieces of advice in mind, I'd like to submit the 
following, in the assumption that Santa has time to read the paper: 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Santa, 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some things I'd truly like to have for Christmas: 
</P>
<P>
 A President who really and truly makes up his mind and sticks to it; who stops 
being reactive and begins being proactive (horrible government word, that) once 
more. Even if it means he's at his present address for only two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-expenses-paid, two-week stay at the orphanage of his choice for the new 
Speaker of the House. 
</P>
<P>
 A month on welfare, in public housing, for each member of the House and 
Senate, so they can begin negotiations on welfare reform with proposals that, 
if not grounded in reality, have at least come into contact with reality before 
they're written. 
</P>
<P>
 A concession speech -- finally -- from Michael Huffington, and a little book 
on losing gracefully, which he can read back in Texas, where he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles subway system that is actually completed on time, on budget -- 
and is safe to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Long hauls in minimum-security prisons for the people who knowingly 
constructed the shoddy, unsafe and unforgivably expensive underground rail 
system with which we are currently cursed. 
</P>
<P>
 No major magnitude quakes for another 12 months, while we continue to recover 
from the last one. 
</P>
<P>
 One week where we are relieved of hearing or reading any of the following 
names: Simpson (O.J., Nicole, you name it), Shapiro, Cochran, Clark, Garcetti, 
Ito, Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the sad (and increasingly frequent) news of absentee and homicidal 
parents, a renewed pledge from adults everywhere to protect, nurture and guide 
the children in their lives on the right path. 
</P>
<P>
 A national adoption policy that respects the feelings of both adoptive and 
birth parents but places absolute priority on the well-being and security of 
the children in question. 
</P>
<P>
 A great thriller that lets Michael Douglas keep his wits about him -- and his 
pants on. 
</P>
<P>
 A positive reason for Los Angeles to make national news. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a lot to ask, I know. But (another thing the grown-ups used to always 
say) if you don't ask, you don't get. And Santa, I'd be happy with even a 
fraction of what I've asked for.

season. They won only one game under former Notre Dame Coach Gerry Faust, who 
has retired, and that against winless Ohio University in the season finale.

 Zips, by the way, doesn't refer to zero but is short for Zipper, a brand of

THE DEMONIC LEADERSHIP OF A SELF-PROCLAIMED PREACHER; BROTHER LOVE MURDER, 
MONEY AND A MESSIAH BY SYDNEY P. FREEDBERG . PANTHEON: $24, 335 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every so often, the melting pot of American culture spews out a strange and 
terrifying lump like Jim Jones, a demonic figure for whom race and religion are 
instruments of violence. And we come face to face with yet another self-made 
practitioner of the politics of apocalypse in Sydney P. Freedberg's "Brother 
Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who called himself Brother Love was known by other names, too: Hulon 
Mitchell Jr., Hulon X, Father Michel, Yahweh Ben Yahweh. 
</P>
<P>
 Born to an Oklahoma preacher, Mitchell reinvented himself as a disciple of 
Elijah Muhammad in the Nation of Islam, a Christian radio evangelist in Atlanta 
and, finally, as the charismatic leader of a Miami-based church of "Black 
Israelites" that he called the Temple of Love. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am here to save you," Mitchell told the converts who fell under his spell. 
"I am here to take you out of hell." 
</P>
<P>
 From his stronghold in Liberty City, a riot-torn ghetto in Miami, Mitchell 
cobbled together a religious movement based on militant black nationalism and a 
profoundly revisionist reading of the Old Testament, which he regarded as a 
cryptogram that revealed Jesus -- as well as Job, Jeremiah, Solomon and David 
-- to have been black. 
</P>
<P>
 "All white people who say they are Jews," declared Mitchell, "are liars and 
impostors." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell called himself Yahweh Ben Yahweh -- a Hebrew name that means "God, 
the Son of God" -- and initiated his followers into a cracked variant of 
Judaism. They studied Hebrew, wore skullcaps, shunned pork and shellfish; 
Mitchell personally circumcised his male followers and tutored his female 
followers in midwifery; the Temple of Love began to bottle and sell its own 
line of "Yahweh" beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, not unlike Jim Jones, courted and won over not a few credulous civil 
leaders who were convinced that Yahweh Ben Yahweh was capable of casting out 
the demons of drug-dealing and racial violence from the streets of Miami. 
Behind the doors of the Temple of Love, however, something very odd and ominous 
was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Freedberg, Mitchell collected greenbacks from his followers on 
the strength of a promise to pay them back in silver bullion -- but only after 
Judgment Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The midwifery classes began to sound a lot like orgies, and Yahweh himself 
demanded sexual favors from his adoring female disciples while preaching 
abstinence to their husbands. "Husbands, irritated by the celibacy rules, 
begged women to get biblical in the shadows," writes Freedberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more ominously, Freedberg suggests, members of the Temple of Love began 
to die under Mitchell's "rod of correction," and even the youngest children 
among them were apparently starved and sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Yahweh Ben Yahweh called on the menfolk to wear swords at their 
sides and to carry "staffs of life" that were especially useful in beating 
someone to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many would die for Yahweh?" Mitchell asked his disciples. "How many would 
kill for Yahweh?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Yahweh Ben Yahweh was a jealous god, and when some of his disciples 
began to doubt his divinity, retribution was swift and deadly. Freedberg 
describes an execution in which a member of the Temple of Love was singled out 
and clubbed to death by the gathered congregation, including children and young 
women with babes in arms. Dismembered bodies began to appear on the streets of 
Miami as Yahweh's "death angels" sought strangers for blood sacrifices and 
wreaked the cruelest imaginable vengeance against imagined enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedberg, a reporter for the Miami Herald and winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, 
has adopted what is now the formulaic approach to true crime -- an underpinning 
of investigative journalism and a draping of novelistic detail and dialogue. 
Still, as shopworn as the genre has become, Freedberg is undeniably good at it. 
For example, Freedberg evokes the steamy and sinister streets of Miami -- from 
Liberty City to Little Havana -- in grim and sometimes gruesome close-up. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Brother Love" does not pander to our taste for the exotic and the 
outrageous. With all of its weird and whacked-out trappings, "Brother Love" is 
essentially a distinctly American morality play, a cautionary tale of what can 
happen when a gifted mountebank feeds our appetites for money, sex, violence 
and true belief. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as Freedberg follows Hulon Mitchell Jr. out of the Temple of Love and 
into the courtroom where he was sentenced to 18 years in prison, we come to 
realize that the story of Yahweh Ben Yahweh and the Temple of Love is so 
thoroughly and uniquely American that it could not have happened anywhere else.

MOVIE REVIEWS; A TIME WHEN LOVE AND RESPECT MATTERED; A STRONG CAST BREATHES 
NEW LIFE INTO REMAKE OF ALCOTT'S 'LITTLE WOMEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gillian Armstrong's beguiling new version of Louisa May Alcott's "Little 
Women" brings alive the past so vividly but perceives it through a contemporary 
sensibility so acute that you have the feeling that you're watching life 
unfolding before you. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong, screenplay adapter/co-producer Robin Swicord and their colleagues 
have got everything just right: You really believe you're observing New England 
family life in the 1860s, yet you're almost subliminally aware that you're 
seeing it from a present-day perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 In their vision, Alcott's alter ego/heroine, Jo March (played by Winona 
Ryder), is not a modern-day feminist but rather points the way to the future in 
her unladylike ambition and outspoken free thinking. The filmmakers acknowledge 
the second-class status of Victorian-era women without making a federal case 
about it; indeed, if this "Little Women" reveals what women needed to gain for 
themselves it even more shows us what has been lost in much of middle-class 
American society: the love of and respect for family and ethical conduct in 
everyday life. In its charmingly persuasive way, "Little Women" suggests that 
such matters still count, no matter how we may tend to neglect them. 
</P>
<P>
 With her radiance and quizzical spirit, her courage and vulnerability, Ryder 
is perfectly cast as Jo, the most intellectual of the four March daughters of 
Concord, Mass. They live with their mother, Marmee (Susan Sarandon, just the 
actress to leaven Mrs. March's sweetness with a dash of earthiness) in a 
spacious picture-book house of homespun warmth and well-worn beauty -- it has 
that look an Ethan Allen catalogue promises. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're hard put to make ends meet, and not just because Mr. March 
(Matthew Walker) is off fighting in the Civil War. The Marches are 
Transcendentalists, who -- like fellow Concord resident Ralph Waldo Emerson -- 
thought that reality may be perceived through spiritual intuition. They are 
such do-gooders, in fact, they're poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they were a fine family," sniffs their rich, grand next-door neighbor 
Mr. Laurence (John Neville) -- but that's before he really gets to know them 
through his handsome grandson Laurie (Christian Bale), who becomes virtually a 
part of the March family. The other sisters, also captivating, are the demure, 
traditional Meg (Trini Alvarado), the gentle Beth (Claire Danes) and lively 
young Amy, who's played by Kirsten Dunst at age 12 and Samantha Mathis at 16. 
Living nearby is Mr. March's rich, selfish aunt (an amusing turn by Mary 
Wickes, one of the last great Hollywood character actors). 
</P>
<P>
 While fully recognizing the restrictions of genteel poverty and the female 
condition, Marmee, as an enlightened woman, encourages her daughters to make 
the most of themselves, especially Jo, who eventually goes off to New York to 
make her way as a writer, a daring act for a young woman of little means and 
fewer connections in the 1860s -- and not one to be taken lightly today. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the men in their lives, Mr. March remains shadowy, even upon his return 
from war; Eric Stoltz is a prim but decent teacher. Bale's Laurie and, later 
on, Gabriel Byrne's German professor, a boarder in the Manhattan rooming house 
where Jo lodges, emerge as major figures, romantic, to be sure, but also as 
reflective as the March women. 
</P>
<P>
 Bale has an extraordinary scene in which we're able to feel the full force of 
the pain of rejection upon a truly worthy young man -- deeply in love, devoted, 
good-looking, rich, Harvard-educated, open-minded, with a future of limitless 
promise; you do have to wonder if a woman wouldn't be just a little crazy to 
refuse him. Yet Armstrong makes such a turn of events as understandable as she 
did in her stunning, not dissimilar Australian 1978 debut film, "My Brilliant 
Career." 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Women" is an affectionate, superbly acted group portrait of female 
strength and solidarity as four young women come of age and how, despite 
natural clashes and differences of temperament, they are ultimately always 
supportive of each other. The great thing about the film is its accessibility. 
It invites thought but plays like a sure-fire, heart-tugging Christmas season 
entertainment. And it looks glorious, alternately summoning up memories of 
Currier & Ives prints and illustrations from Godey's Ladies' Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In evoking the past, Armstrong is here even better served than in her "Mrs. 
Soffel," set in turn-of-the-century Pittsburgh. Anachronisms are nearly 
nonexistent in this exquisite period piece, the creation of production designer 
Jan Roelfs and costume designer Colleen Atwood, whose crucial contributions 
have a burnished glow, thanks to cameraman Geoffrey Simpson's care with 
lighting. Completing the picture is Thomas Newman's lovely score. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, "Little Women" says a great deal about Gillian Armstrong's own 
character and integrity as an artist. As she has proceeded from one distinctive 
accomplishment to the next, alternating between America and her homeland, 
Armstrong has remained uncompromised among those Australians who have heeded 
Hollywood's siren call.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; GARY MORRIS' VOCALS SPARKLE IN HOLIDAY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "We're doing this show all over the country, but not like we've done so far 
here tonight," Gary Morris remarked during his Christmas show at the Crazy 
Horse Steak House on Monday night. It was, indeed, a most atypical show for 
Morris. He usually is one of the most in-control performers in country music, 
with his exactingly directed shows mirroring his remarkable vocal control. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is on the country charts that he's placed his hits, Morris' 
commanding voice owes more to musical theater (he's starred in Broadway 
productions of "Les Miserables" and "La Boheme"), in both the nuance and 
bluster of the medium. 
</P>
<P>
 In most Morris performances it would have taken a tidal wave to upstage him, 
but Monday he freely abdicated his place in the spotlight, letting band 
members, the audience and his 15-year-old son, Matt, take the lead for much of 
the show.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point, keyboardist Chuck Glass answered an audience request that Morris 
didn't know with an impromptu rendition of "I'll Be Home for Christmas," which 
prompted Morris to shout, "It's my show!" in a mock wounded voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who was scheduled to play again Tuesday night, explained they had been 
playing only large theaters on their Christmas tour, and they clearly 
appreciated the intimate club gig as an opportunity to cut up and relax a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The boon of the lighter approach was a show that was more spontaneous and 
celebratory. The downside was that several Christmas songs that would seem 
splendidly suited for Morris' remarkable tenor never got the benefit of it.  
</P>
<P>
 That's a minor quibble, since he and his cohorts did a generous 22-song 
performance, which left ample room for his voice to do its stuff, while also 
showcasing the not-inconsiderable talents of his five-piece band and son. 
</P>
<P>
 The show opened with a couple of a cappella numbers, including a richly 
harmonized "Do You Hear What I Hear?" followed by a bluesy "Go Tell It on the 
Mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't quite an unplugged performance, but the instrumentation remained 
subdued throughout the show, with Morris and Jeff Rea on acoustic guitar, Brad 
Smith on congas and hand percussion, C.J. Cowell on bass, John MacLeroy on 
electric guitar and Glass on keyboards. The sole sonic lapse was Glass' 
tendency to favor generic, lifeless synthesizer tones on some songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some selections, including "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," were largely left 
to the audience to sing, and the Crazy Horse audience proved a tuneful bunch, 
despite Morris' loud snoring during "The Christmas Song." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris likes to show a curmudgeonly demeanor onstage, to the degree that it's 
difficult to know if his gruff repartee is just for show, an expression of 
genuine ire or a combination. Despite the holiday mood, he managed to gripe 
repeatedly about the stage lighting.  
</P>
<P>
 When percussionist Smith was clowning between songs, Morris threatened, "Brad, 
I think Lee Greenwood's gonna love it when you're on the road with him. You'll 
get to do 'God Bless America' all night." 
</P>
<P>
 His asides aside, when Morris does a holiday show, he does it all the way. His 
sole concession to his hit-filled career was a solo rendition of "The Wind 
Beneath My Wings." Otherwise, the evening was packed with Christmas tunes, from 
the bluegrass gospel number "What Month Was Jesus Born In?" to such usual 
suspects as "Winter Wonderland," "Silent Night," "We Three Kings" and "Joy to 
the World." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During his solo section, Morris also sang "O Holy Night," making a beautiful 
vocal showcase of it, though his performance seemed a tad emotionally detached 
(particularly when compared with some other versions, such as soul singer Jerry 
Butler's classic take on the song). 
</P>
<P>
 There were no such reservations about his closing encore of "Amazing Grace," 
though. Despite being one of the most mangled melodies of all time -- 
frequently the victim of vocal excesses -- Morris managed to chart a course 
through the song that was both fresh and emotionally vital. At such times his 
voice -- sounding like a more powerful, meat-eatin' Johnny Mathis -- truly 
seems to be a divine gift.  
</P>
<P>
 His son Matt clearly has inherited some of that gift. On his several featured 
songs, particularly "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" and "God Rest Ye 
Merry, Gentlemen" he revealed a voice much like his dad's -- pitched deeper and 
clearly influenced by the Stevie Wonder school of soul singing -- but with the 
same assurance and mastery of melisma. Not bad for a kid who has spent several 
years as a Disney Mouseketeer.

 New Odd Couple?: Lame-duck New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is being wooed to do a 
daily radio talk show that would contrast with Rush Limbaugh's nationally 
syndicated program. Newsday reported that Edward McLaughlin, head of EFM Media 
and a driving force behind the Limbaugh show, has been urging Cuomo to become 
the liberal counterpart to Limbaugh's views. Cuomo, who leaves office at the 
end of this month, is also considering job offers from law firms and 
universities and is lining up speeches, a sideline that earned him more than $1 
million during his 12 years as governor. William O'Shaughnessy, head of WVOX 
radio in New York and a mutual friend of McLaughlin and Cuomo, said the 
governor might prefer to do readings of poetry he has written since the 1960s. 
He also might publish another volume of his diary entries since his last volume 
ended when he took office in 1983.

 More Limbaugh, for Sure: Beginning Jan. 1, cable's Talk Channel will air two 
weekend installments of "Rush Limbaugh, the Television Show," featuring 
highlights from past shows. The channel chose weekend presentations so as not 
to conflict with Limbaugh's Monday through Friday radio and TV programs.

 From Across the Pond: The British Broadcasting Corp. plans to beam its 24-hour 
international news service, the BBC World Channel, to the United States 
starting in February. The BBC channel -- which is seen in countries around the 
world -- said it has initial commitments of 60,000 subscribers in this country. 
The cable entry here is a joint venture between the BBC and New York-based 
International News Network, a partnership of former CNN executive Reese 
Shonfeld and Cable USA. MOVIES

 Suit Filed: As expected, the makers of "The Last Seduction" filed suit Tuesday 
against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in an attempt to stop 
the mailing of Oscar ballots pending a court ruling on the film's eligibility 
for competition. Attorney Pierce O'Donnell, representing the filmmakers, 
accused the academy of restraint of trade and unfair business practices, 
claiming the academy wants to punish the filmmakers for "the unpardonable sin 
of allowing the picture to be shown first on television." The suit filed in 
Superior Court in Pasadena also alleged that individuals will suffer 
"irreparable injury" if they are barred from the Oscar race. Specifically cited 
was actress Linda Fiorentino, who recently won the New York Film Critics Circle 
best actress award for her role in the film. But academy officials, noting that 
the ban on films first airing on TV is "Rule No. 1" of the organization, said 
the domestic distributor, October Films Inc., and the producer, ITC 
Distribution Inc., knew the rule. The film aired five times last summer on HBO. 
"There came a time when they had an option of maintaining this film's 
eligibility for the Academy Awards or accepting a $1-million deal to put this 
on cable," said Academy Executive Director Bruce Davis. "They took the million 
dollars."

 India Halts Screening: A New Delhi judge Tuesday banned the screening of a 
movie about India's legendary bandit, Phoolan Devi, after she sued the 
producers saying they had not let her see the film, which she believes is 
inaccurate. The movie was produced by Britain's Channel Four television 
company. The high court judge told the producers of "The Bandit Queen," which 
made waves at the Cannes festival last summer, not to show the film in India or 
abroad before the case was decided, the Press Trust of India reported. The 
33-year-old Devi, who headed a ruthless gang, was accused of scores of murders 
in the ravines of central India, a hotbed of caste vendettas. Wanted in 55 
cases in her native Uttar Pradesh state, she surrendered to police in 1983. The 
Supreme Court released her a year ago after she languished in jail while the 
judicial process dragged on. The court said the years she spent inside were 
punishment enough. QUICK TAKES

 Actor Gregory Peck was released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Tuesday, a 
day after he was rushed by ambulance to the emergency room with "stomach 
distress" suffered while having dinner in a restaurant near his Holmby Hills 
home. The 78-year-old actor improved quickly, a hospital spokesman said. . . . 
Comedian Paul Reiser, who stars in NBC's "Mad About You," was named host of the 
37th annual Grammy Awards, which will be held in Shrine Auditorium on March 1. 
. . . Ginger Rogers, 83, who made movie history dancing with Fred Astaire, was 
honored for her achievements in London. Robert Wagner was the host of the 
event, which raised funds for a children's hospital, and singer Shirley Bassey 
and actors Anthony Hopkins, Anthony Quinn and Diana Rigg were on hand. . . . 
Pianist-turned-conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy quit as music director of the Royal 
Philharmonic Orchestra, contending that officials violated his contract when 
they negotiated with Italian conductor Daniele Gatti as a possible successor 
without first getting his approval. ART BERMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ROCKERS FROM OUT OF TOWN SPIKE 'FUN' RAISER'S PUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ringling Sisters' ninth annual Holiday "Fun" Raiser may have sprung from a 
well of good intentions, but, Monday at the Palace, the six-hour benefit show 
-- featuring a roster of rockers, poets and performance artists -- let off more 
of a constant fizzle than a resonating bang. 
</P>
<P>
 Local punk luminaries X, the Circle Jerks, former Blaster Dave Alvin and the 
host Ringling Sisters, along with newer bands such as Possum Dixon, all played 
20-minute sets, mostly with seasonal gusto. But it was out-of-towners Jim 
Carroll, 7 Year Bitch and Babes in Toyland that proved high points in the 
generally slow night. (Proceeds will go to the Hollygrove Orphanage, Rock for 
Choice, the free speech rights organization F.A.I.R. and the Los Angeles Youth 
Network.) 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, a noted New York poet who found a niche in the early punk scene, 
joined L.A. popsters Possum Dixon for one of the evening's best songs, a rowdy 
version of Carroll's 1980 classic "People Who Died." That followed an earlier 
reading by Carroll, which emerged as one of the night's most compelling sets, 
although half of the audience talked through it. Carroll focused on the 
inhumanity of the Bosnian war and the downward spiral of Kurt Cobain in simple 
yet gripping terms, minus the dramatics and cryptic imagery that often make 
spoken word unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's 7 Year Bitch was perhaps the biggest draw for the bohemian crowd, 
many of whom left after the quartet's driving, mean set. Singer Selene Vigil's 
raspy and demanding delivery of tunes like "Kiss My Ass Goodbye" and, 
fittingly, Carroll's "It's Too Late" pumped vibrancy into the half-filled 
venue, while the band played big, fat rock grooves somewhere between AC/DC and 
Black Flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Babes in Toyland, the Minneapolis trio that laid the groundwork for bands like 
Hole and even the entire Riot Grrrl movement, blasted the room with pounding 
beats and Kat Bjelland's louder-than-God roars. The singer-guitarist 
manipulated her voice from eerily sweet whispers to rabid expulsions, a 
much-needed dynamic for the tired crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 X was the biggest disappointment of the evening, seeming as if it hadn't 
played together for a while. Its usually tight delivery was sluggish and 
careless, while singers John Doe and Exene Cervenka never hit the bent 
harmonies that made up half the band's original appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 The recently reformed Circle Jerks closed the show with the speedy, 
hit-and-run sing-alongs that made them hardcore heroes 14 years ago. The 
quartet, which is working on its first album in years and just happens to be 
resurfacing during a supposed punk resurgence spearheaded by Green Day and the 
Offspring, didn't really do much more than deliver a blast from the past. But 
so what? It's their past to reclaim.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'MRS. PARKER' PRAISES AND PUTS HER DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Algonquin crowd in "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" -- the film should 
be called "Smart and Smarter" -- are a nattery bunch of smarty-pants cynics, 
mostly men. The only woman who holds her own with them is Dorothy Parker 
(Jennifer Jason Leigh). 
</P>
<P>
 As a Jazz Age wit in a roomful of overweening fellow wits, Dorothy is a sodden 
sprite. Her zingers take the form of funky aphorisms, but her line delivery is 
deliberately wan. It's as if she's bored by her own genius for barbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Alan Rudolph and co-scripted by him with Randy Sue Coburn, "Mrs. 
Parker" is a real odd duck of a movie. It seems to have been made both as 
tribute and put-down. The sporty conviviality of the Algonquin Round Table -- 
the playwrights, critics, poets, actors, artists and hangers-on who regularly 
convened for lunch at New York's Algonquin Hotel for more than a decade -- is 
celebrated, and yet there's a hollowness to the confabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph doesn't really want to skewer the likes of George S. Kaufman (David 
Thornton), Robert Benchley (Campbell Scott), Charles MacArthur (Matthew 
Broderick), New Yorker magazine founder Harold Ross (Sam Robards), Robert 
Sherwood (Nick Cassavetes) or Alexander Woollcott (Tom McGowan). He doesn't 
want to spoil the party but he doesn't want to make these people the life of 
the party either. Their can-you-top-this banter is full of bon mots that aren't 
all that bon . 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Algonquin Round Table has faded into American literary mythology, 
Rudolph's attempt to revive it seems musty and coy. It's not just a matter of 
"Who cares?" We are given no compelling reason to care. Parker, and her 
extended and deep friendship with Benchley, are the movie's centerpiece, but 
most of the time we seem to be floating high above the proceedings. The movie 
is basically about writers as jawboners, as drinkers, with Parker as Queen of 
the Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most of their achievements -- on Broadway, in Hollywood, in the 
magazines -- are skimped or glossed over, we're unfortunately left with their 
personalities. And Rudolph, as usual, puts brackets around his people: Like the 
Paris expatriates in "The Moderns," the Algonquin gabbers are conceits first 
and human beings second. They congregate in a mellifluous, boozy haze. The 
inauthenticity is carefully wrought -- even the furniture seems to be 
play-acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker starts out hung over with cynicism and, by the time the film finishes 
up with her death in 1967, she's essentially the same way. In between she 
slashes her wrists, puts up with a series of disdainful husbands and lovers, 
goes to Hollywood and retreats to semi-anonymity in Manhattan -- she's a pixie 
Garbo who still goes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh manages the 30-plus year trajectory with ease and yet her performance 
seems like a deeply felt stunt. Her clipped archness is apparently a 
dead-ringer for Parker's but, as with Leigh's Katharine Hepburn-ish accent in 
"Hudsucker Proxy," the exaggerated intonations distract from the woman 
underneath. Leigh manages to work up a fair amount of feeling for Parker 
without stooping to easy pathos, and that's an achievement. At times she 
fulfills Alexander Woollcott's famous description of Parker as a cross between 
Little Nell and Lady Macbeth. But the Dorothy of this movie doesn't really live 
on in our imaginations. None of the characters do. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of Parker's life is that, although her lifelong theme was the 
seductive closeness of death, she managed to outlive just about everybody in 
the Round Table. She squandered her considerable gifts as a poet and 
short-story writer and then sat in silent witness to the wreckage. Some of this 
material comes through in the movie, but not enough -- perhaps because Parker's 
talents on the page are never really given their due. Instead Parker is 
memorialized as a misery-wracked quipster. It's too limiting a conception. Her 
mausoleum could use a few more rooms. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; CULKIN'S 'RICHIE RICH': COMEDY-ADVENTURE WITH HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Richie Rich" presents an irresistible Macaulay Culkin in a wonderful part and 
bursts with the gadgetry that many adults thrill to as much as children do. At 
the same time, it never loses touch with its humanity, directed by Donald 
Petrie with humor and panache. 
</P>
<P>
 In the title role, based on the Harvey Comics character, Culkin is the richest 
12-year-old in the world. Appropriately, Biltmore, the century-old Vanderbilt 
estate in Ashville, N.C., the largest mansion in America, serves as Richie's 
home, which for purposes of the story is somewhere outside Chicago. Richie is 
also a classic poor little rich boy, but not because he's unloved or neglected 
or even spoiled but because so much is expected of him, including the kind of 
public duties carried on by the more conscientious members of the House of 
Windsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Richie is a terrifically good kid, intelligent, polite, perfectly groomed, 
cheerful and rightly self-confident. He has everything the world has to offer 
but friends his own age. At a public ceremony, marking the renewal rather than 
the anticipated closure of a Rich-owned factory, Richie notices a bunch of 
neighborhood youngsters playing baseball nearby. The look of longing on 
Richie's face is the linchpin of the entire film, summing up what Richie 
doesn't have. Little do the other kids suspect that he's actually a crackerjack 
player -- Reggie Jackson, after all, is his personal coach. Richie's butler 
(Jonathan Hyde, a delight) starts figuring a way to bring the kids and Richie 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette, a gleeful villain with a 
helmet of lacquered hair), a top executive at Rich Industries, is figuring out 
ways to get his hands on the Rich family fortune, which is in the neighborhood 
of $70 billion. Van Dough's machinations plunge Richie into high adventure, yet 
writers Tom S. Parker and Jim Jennewein, working from Neil Tolkin's story, 
never lose concern for their characters, who include Michael McShane as a 
colorful inventor, and Stephi Lineburg and Mariangela Pino as mother and 
daughter, hearty representatives of the normal world. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the usual self-absorbed parents poor little rich children are 
supposed to have, Richie's mother and father (Edward Herrmann and Christine 
Ebersole) are devoted to each other and to their only son. The refreshing point 
the picture makes is that vast wealth, in its insular qualities, has made them 
innocents. They're a silly and staggeringly naive couple, yet sincere 
do-gooders; they seem to have just stepped out of a Preston Sturges screwball 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Production designer James Spencer and special effects coordinator Michael Wood 
have come up with much stylish wonderment for cinematographer Don Burgess to 
photograph gleamingly. There's even a hilariously cockamamie homage to "North 
by Northwest's" famous climactic sequence at Mount Rushmore. Yet "Richie Rich," 
a wide-appeal Christmas comedy-fantasy, steadfastly keeps its heart in the 
right place and even its values in proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for mild violence and language. Times guidelines: It is 
suitable for all ages.

WHIMSICAL 'TIN SOLDIER' FROM OTTAWA PLAYS ALL THE ANGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not "The Nutcracker," but it has toys that come to life, dancing soldiers 
and malevolent mice. It's not "The Wizard of Oz," but it has a nice-guy tin man 
on an adventure in the strangest places. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a tale by Hans Christian Andersen, Ottawa Ballet's "The Tin Soldier" 
plays all the angles, filling 48 minutes with everything from ragtime frogs to 
sewer rats who dance in a jazzy street-style that suggests a "West Side Story" 
rodent company. 
</P>
<P>
 This whimsical children's ballet comes to the Disney Channel tonight in a 1992 
adaptation of the original stage version that uses plenty of video technology 
(including computer animation) to make the fantasy come alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale has been balleticized more than once. In 1975, for instance, George 
Balanchine emphasized the hopeless yearning of the tin cavalier for a flighty 
paper ballerina in "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" (to Bizet). This time, Ottawa 
choreographer Timothy Spain makes the relationship anything but hopeless -- 
though it is threatened periodically by an evil jack-in-the-box. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Canadian danseur noble Frank Augustyn (director of Ottawa Ballet) 
brings deadpan charm and solid technique to the title role. Dewy Stephanie 
Hutchinson looks comfortable with the classical platitudes of the ballerina. 
But Louis-Martin Charest steals every scene in which he appears as either the 
gleeful jumping-jack or the swaggering king gangsta rat. Bad toys have all the 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's dances are serviceable but undistinguished, leaving Mary Kerr's witty 
costumes the main attraction here. Robert Swerdlow contributes a bright, 
hurdy-gurdy-ish (synthesizer?) score that generates a lot of energy but sounds 
graceless in lyric passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-director David Langer deftly assembles the narrative, dance, and video 
elements in an engaging storybook, making special use of the tricks of scale 
that dramatize the difference between the so-called real world and the domain 
of toy soldiers and paper dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Kellar's sets aren't always as clever as the other production elements, 
but his smoky sewer is terrific: partly an urban playground, partly the perfect 
environment for a dollhouse "Les Miz." 
</P>

LAKERS THROW CEBALLOS (50) TO THE WOLVES; PRO BASKETBALL: FORWARD HAS A CAREER 
NIGHT IN 108-95 VICTORY OVER MINNESOTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He had scored 50 points before. Of course, he was sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody gets 50 in their dreams," Cedric Ceballos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, Ceballos got it in reality, becoming the first Laker since Gail 
Goodrich in March of 1975 to reach that plateau as the Lakers defeated the 
Minnesota Timberwolves, 108-95, before 11,101 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 He got it the hard way, too, with the Timberwolves keying on him the final 
several minutes, obviously not wanting the onslaught to come at their expense. 
No such luck. Ceballos made 12 of 18 shots and scored 18 of the 50 points in 
the fourth quarter in what became the second-highest output in the NBA this 
season, behind only the 53 by Philadelphia's Willie Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker teammates delivered several key passes, but offered more in other areas. 
When Minnesota called timeout with 2:23 left, just as Ceballos had tired and 
was still four points shy of the goal, they shouted "50! 50!" at him in the 
huddle. Tony Smith told him not to come back in the locker room if he didn't 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when my adrenaline rose to the top of the Forum," said Ceballos, whose 
previous career high was 40, accomplished three times. "My hands started 
shaking a little bit. I really started concentrating on what I was doing 
instead of just playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers tried getting him the ball every time. The Timberwolves tried to 
deny. Once, Ceballos got the ball knocked away while driving to the basket. The 
next time, his jumper hit the front of the rim. The next time, three defenders 
ran at him when he got the ball on the left post. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he got Point 47 on a free throw with 48 seconds left. The crowd rose 
every time the Lakers went back on offense, and they booed when Antonio Harvey 
took a wide open free-throw-line jumper with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos had one last chance to reach 50, when the Lakers got the ball back 
with 13.6 seconds left. The crowd rose. Ceballos was exhausted when he got the 
ball behind the three-point line on the left side, with a defender, Pat Durham, 
in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos went up. Durham didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't believe it was going to go in," Laker guard Nick Van Exel said. 
</P>
<P>
 It did. Direct hit, with 5.7 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how I made that shot," he said. "I don't. Durham was so on me, I 
don't even know how I got it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone was looking out for me. It went in. It was a fitting ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Elden Campbell, who had 21 points as the Lakers won for the fourth time 
in five games: "It's really fun. I've played with guys who have scored 50. 
Tonight, it was like I scored 50." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't only the fourth quarter either -- Ceballos went four of eight in the 
first quarter, five of five in the second and four of six in the third, capping 
that period with the second of three three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, a game after recording a season-low 11 points at San Antonio on 
five-of-18 shooting, he had made 21 of 31 shots, added nine rebounds and two 
blocks, and played a career-high 46 minutes. He played the entire fourth 
quarter, after which Coach Del Harris saw Minnesota assistant Mike Schuler in 
the hallway by the Laker locker room and apologized if the Timberwolves felt 
the Lakers were trying to show them up. No problem, Schuler said, they 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to take him out," Harris said. "But the players said, 'Leave him 
in, let him get the 50,' and I think maybe the Minnesota coach (Bill Blair) 
maybe didn't like it. But on the other hand, I'm sure there will be a night 
when he'll have to choose between me and his player and I'm sure he'll take his 
player every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos and Minnesota's Isaiah Rider dueled for three quarters. They each had 
32 points as the Lakers held an 86-82 lead. Rider finished with a career-high 
35, but the Lakers pulled away and the only suspense was whether Ceballos would 
reach 50.

CLIPPERS SNOOZE THEIR WAY TO ANOTHER LOSS; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY SHOOT 37.7% 
FROM THE FIELD IN 110-79 SETBACK AGAINST THE SUPERSONICS IN TACOMA.

 What's more boring? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Waiting in line to get a gift wrapped at the department store? 
</P>
<P>
 B. Getting stuck in rush-hour traffic on the San Diego Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 C. Watching the Clippers play? 
</P>
<P>
 If you answered "C," you win two tickets to the Clippers' lottery party. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Coach Bill Fitch looked bored as he watched his team fall behind by 34 
points in the fourth quarter and lose its second consecutive game, 110-79, to 
the Seattle SuperSonics Tuesday night before a crowd of 11,952 at the Tacoma 
Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch criticized his players' shot selection after the Clippers shot only 
37.7% (29 for 77). Instead of being patient, the Clippers rushed their shots 
against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have got some people who look for the jump shot first, and it's like 
cancer," Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Pooh Richardson, who missed all 10 shots he took in his previous game, 
missed seven of eight shots against the SuperSonics. And the shot he made was a 
fast-break layup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not making them," Richardson said with a look of disgust. "I think 
the last-second shots kill me because I just throw them up there. But that only 
happened once tonight. I've got to make those shots. Those are my shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only shots I take are the ones (during which ) I can stand there and look 
at (the basket). If I miss them, I've got to live with them. I'm not going to 
put myself in a situation where I'm shooting shots with people all on me unless 
the clock is running down." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie forward Lamond Murray made two of 11 shots and forward Loy Vaught made 
four of 12. Guard Terry Dehere made two of 10 shots as the Clippers lost for 
the fourth time in their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Malik Sealy, who had averaged 20 points in his first five games as a 
starter, was one of the few Clippers who shot well, making nine of 12 shots and 
scoring a team-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star forward Sean Kemp, who had a career-high 42 points in the 
SuperSonics' 132-127 double-overtime victory over the Clippers on Dec. 10 at 
the Sports Arena, had 23 points and 13 rebounds in 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, who drew a technical foul for taunting rookie forward Eric Piatkowski 
after a dunk in the SuperSonics' last game against the Clippers, drew a 
technical foul for taunting Clipper center Charles Outlaw after a 
second-quarter dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said I looked at (Outlaw) too long," Kemp said of the technical. "I can 
understand the last one because I pointed at him, so this is a little hard to 
take. But I'll have to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're looking for things now. I guess I'll just have to sprint back 
to the other end as fast as possible from here on out and not even celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star guard Gary Payton had 22 points and nine assists, and Kendall Gill 
had 21 points, four rebounds and four assists as Seattle won its third 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Although guard Gary Grant, who hasn't played this season after undergoing 
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee last summer, said he hoped to make his 
debut in Friday night's game against Washington, Coach Bill Fitch said it's 
doubtful unless someone gets hurt because he doesn't want to waive anyone two 
days before Christmas. Grant said he plans to take a strength test today. . . . 
Fitch held Eric Riley, a 7-foot center who signed with the Clippers Sunday, out 
of the game.

MORNING BRIEFING: PASADENA FOLLOWS ROSE BOWL RULE OF 'NEVER ON SUNDAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl game between Penn State and Oregon will be played on Monday, 
Jan. 2, in keeping with the Tournament of Roses Assn.'s "Never on Sunday" 
policy for its New Year's parade and football game. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition dates to 1893, when officials feared that the parade would 
frighten horses tethered outside Pasadena churches and perhaps disturb worship 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the 16th time the festivities will be held the day after New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Jan. 2: The situation won't happen again until 2006. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Penn State has had 65 All-American football players. Who was the 
first? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marked man: Tight end Josh Wilcox, Oregon's self-proclaimed free spirit, has a 
new tattoo on his left biceps to commemorate the Ducks' game with Penn State. 
It's a skull with fiery red eye sockets and the words "Rose Bowl '95." 
</P>
<P>
 "Memories are forever," Wilcox said, "and so are tattoos." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Backup job: Exchanging his helmet and pads for a tuxedo, New England 
quarterback Drew Bledsoe joined the Boston Pops orchestra and guest conductor 
Bobby McFerrin for a reading of " 'Twas the Night Before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 About 120 Boston business executives attended the annual event to raise money 
for the Boston Symphony orchestra. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Never too old: Ron Lyle, who once fought Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in 
heavyweight title matches, wants to make a comeback at age 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to fight (Foreman) again," Lyle said. "My skills haven't slipped 
that much. I'm in good shape. I fought at 220 pounds and I'm 235 now." 
</P>
<P>
 Comebacks are nothing new to Lyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got stabbed in prison. Died twice in the operating room but came back," 
said Lyle, who learned to box while serving time.

 Special treatment: When Wayne Gretzky established a curfew of sorts for his 
hockey all-stars on their European tour, he remembered Russ Courtnall, the 
Dallas Stars' wing with a reputation for enjoying night life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The curfew is midnight, unless that's too early," Gretzky said. "Then it's 1 
a.m. But for you, Rusty, there's a $100 fine if you're in your room before 5 
a.m."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another record appears to be in jeopardy tonight at the Sports Arena when the 
Clippers entertain Shaquille O'Neal and the Orlando Magic. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After all, O'Neal's franchise single-game scoring record is only 53 points. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor was asked how opponents might be able to 
keep O'Neal in check. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Legally?" Baylor said. "Maybe triple-team him with big bodies. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal has succeeded Michael Jordan as the biggest drawing card in the NBA, 
but, surprise, plenty of good seats are available for his only Sports Arena 
appearance of the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He won't return to L.A. until April 2 against the Lakers at the Forum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Bulls scored 63 points against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday 
night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On March 28, 1990, Michael Jordan scored 69 against the Cavaliers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith's injury isn't the Dallas Cowboys' only worry. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Troy Aikman still hasn't returned to peak form after his concussion and didn't 
complete a pass to Alvin Harper Monday night in New Orleans. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Allen, the 330-pound Dallas tackle who became an instant hero of Dan 
Dierdorf and other large people when he ran down linebacker Darion Conner after 
Conner had made an interception, played as a freshman at Compton's Centennial 
High. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But Allen attended three schools the next three years, finished at Vintage 
High in Napa, Calif., and became the first player drafted by the NFL from 
Sonoma State, a Division II school that doesn't offer athletic scholarships. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1987, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers traded Steve Young to the San 
Francisco 49ers for second- and fourth-round draft choices and cash. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers took Miami linebacker Winston Moss, now with the Raiders, with 
the second-round pick and Arizona State wide receiver Bruce Hill with the 
fourth-round pick. . . . USC Coach John Robinson is delighted that the Trojans 
will be playing a 12th game this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We're a young team and basically we're getting an extra spring practice," he 
said about the drills that began last week for the Cotton Bowl game against 
Texas Tech on Jan. 2."We also have a new defensive line coach (Rod Marinelli) 
who's able to see what we have." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Delon Washington, the freshman tailback who hasn't played since the Penn State 
game because of eligibility questions, has been impressive in practice and, 
according to Robinson, will get more than 10 carries against the Red Raiders. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything about the Cotton Bowl is very positive," Robinson said. "We'll be 
staying at a fabulous hotel and practicing at Texas Stadium next week. These 
people do it big time. About the only negative could be the weather." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson remembers his first Ram team playing the Cowboys in Irving, Tex., in 
a wild-card playoff game on Dec. 26, 1983, when the temperature was "about 15 
degrees." However, they still were able to win, 24-17. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Keyshawn Johnson, the Trojan wide receiver who spoke to young 
football players ranging from high school to Pop Warner League age Saturday at 
Jefferson High. A microphone wasn't available and he put so much into his 
inspirational talk that he lost his voice and later was speechless for one of 
the rare times in his life. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former USC Coach Larry Smith believes the change from artificial turf to grass 
at Missouri next season will help recruiting. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Lendl, who retired Tuesday, never sold tickets or won a Wimbledon singles 
championship, but should be remembered for his serve, forehand and durability 
and his success in the U.S. Open. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina is ranked first in the nation in men's basketball and fourth in 
women's. No school has scored a double in the NCAA Division I tournaments. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Are you ready for pro beach soccer? Teams from the United States, Brazil, 
Italy, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico will compete in the world 
championships in Rio de Janeiro in January, and an international tour is 
planned for next spring and summer. . . .

big as Russia."

 Alberto Tomba of Italy won his third World Cup slalom of the season on 
Tuesday, skiing down the Lech Am Arlberg, Austria, course twice in a combined 
1:44.73, 1.49 seconds faster than Thomas Sykora of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth consecutive victory in the slalom for Tomba, going back to 
last season, and he won despite pain from a rib injury suffered in Sestriere, 
Italy, last week when he ran into a pole. Labor

 The National Labor Relations Board has dismissed an unfair labor practice 
charge filed by major league baseball's Player Relations Committee against 
Bobby Bonilla and John Franco of the New York Mets. The charge had been filed 
after the two were quoted as threatening players who might cross a picket line.

 NHL teams' union representatives met in Toronto to discuss issues that have 
divided players and to determine bargaining strategy. Among the issues on their 
agenda is the league's proposed payroll tax. The union opposes it, but some 
players have said they would accept a tax. 
</P>

 "It won't happen," said Jeremy Roenick of the Chicago Blackhawks. "We will 
lose the whole season. We are a capitalist society. We don't live in old Russia 
where it was communism. To put a cap on our salaries goes against everything 
our government and living here in North America stands for." Miscellany

FISHING REPORT: CASITAS PLANTS TROUT, BUT BASS GET HARVESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing like a trout plant to improve the fishing -- for bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a couple of trout plants in the past week and it really perked the 
bass up," spokeswoman Gwen Fraser said at Ventura County's Lake Casitas.  
</P>
<P>
 It did indeed. Paul Beppu of Ventura used an AC Plug, which sort of resembles 
a trout, to catch bass weighing 14 and nine pounds. Other big bass were an 11 
3/4-pounder caught by Charles Razo of Oxnard and an 11-pounder by Jim Mason of 
Oak View.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: VAUGHN, 89, CLIMBS HIS ANTARCTIC PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norman Vaughn is on top of the world. Well, actually he's at the bottom of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's feeling great, just the same, having conquered Antarctica's Mt. 
Vaughn last Friday -- three days before turning 89. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain in question, at 10,302 feet, is no Everest, but then Everest 
wasn't named after Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 Admiral Richard E. Byrd named the mountain after the former U.S. Army colonel 
for his part in leading a sled-dog team during Byrd's historic geological 
expedition in 1928 across the icy continent. But until Dec. 16, nobody had 
climbed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, of Anchorage, Alaska, did it with a team that included his wife, 
Carolyn Muegge-Vaughn, 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mountain is spectacular," Vaughn said in a news release after his 
descent. "I can't imagine being in a more exciting place."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. thoroughfares are considered a zoo by some, but Arizona's are more apt to 
resemble one. 
</P>
<P>
 Herds of elk have begun strolling through the streets of a section of 
Flagstaff that until recently was undeveloped and provided the animals with 
winter forage. The elk apparently are still attracted to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year the elk show and cause traffic delays," said Tom Britt of the 
Arizona Game and Fish Department. "Commuters in a rush to get to work are 
impatient and try to drive through our road blocks. We must create traffic 
breaks to provide a clear path for the elk to return to the forest. I am 
worried that someone is going to get hurt out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The larger elk weigh about 800 pounds and, according to Britt, "are capable of 
severely injuring people, themselves, and damaging property." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some marlin apparently have a bill for trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 The International Game Fish Assn. reports that a 537-pound blue marlin took a 
live bait off Hawaii's Kona coast and "jumped and freight-trained" until 
shaking the hook in mid-air. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems the marlin worked up an appetite during the fight, however. It came back 
and swallowed the same bait while the two anglers, Michael Nesbitt and Bryan 
Toney, were reeling it in. 
</P>
<P>
 The marlin wasn't as fortunate the second time. Oh yeah, the catch was made on 
Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're back. . . . Or at least they're on their way. Pacific gray whales have 
begun their 6,000-mile swim south from the Bering Sea to the warm-water lagoons 
off Baja California to mate and bear young. It is the longest migration of any 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Boats from most L.A. area sportfishing landings will be there as the 
whale-watching season begins in earnest the day after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturalists from the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium will be aboard boats based at 
the 22nd St. Landing in San Pedro, Redondo Sportfishing in Redondo Beach and 
Catalina Cruises in Long Beach. Trips are about 2 1/2 hours long and costs vary 
from $8 to $14. Details: (310) 832-2676 between 8 a.m. and 1 p.m., Monday and 
Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Striped marlin have finally begun to feed north of Cabo San Lucas at the 
Golden Gate, although the bigger blues continue to make news off Land's End. A 
545-pound blue was landed by Anastacio Marcel of Huntington Beach aboard the 
Minerva III. 
</P>
<P>
 Large tuna have gotten into the act as well. While fishing aboard the yacht 
Bloodstock, Lisa Baitzell of Houston boated a 192-pound yellowfin after 
fighting it for nearly 2 1/2 hours. Tom DeCuir of Huntington Beach muscled in 
tuna that tipped the marina scale at 176 and 120 pounds. Smaller tuna and 
dorado remain the prevalent catch, however. 
</P>
<P>
 East Cape-La Paz fishermen are still loading up mostly on dorado and 
football-size tuna. At Loreto, yellowtail are providing fast-paced action for 
those fly-lining sardines around Coronado Island, but the fish are still on the 
small side, with few pushing 10 pounds.

ROUNDUP; LAGUNA HILLS, EL TORO PLAY TO A TIE IN GIRLS' SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Hills and El Toro each played one half of uninspired soccer in a 1-1 
tie Tuesday at Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers dominated the Hawks, who could not produce any offense in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro (3-3-3) kept the ball in Hawk territory for most of the first half. 
Thirty-six minutes into the game, senior Mandy Lashmett got the ball in front 
of the net and put it in the corner over goalkeeper Deborah Mundis' head. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the tables turned as Laguna Hills (3-3-2) took control on 
offense. The Hawks allowed the Chargers only three shots and attempted nine on 
El Toro freshman goalkeeper Melody Derloshon. 
</P>
<P>
 Derloshon, who finished with four saves in one half, made two impressive 
diving saves before Laguna Hills forward Ashley Olivieri took a crossing pass 
from junior Carrie Geyer in front of the net and slammed it out Derloshon's 
reach with 25 minutes left to play. MELANIE NEFF

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; CENTURY EXPLOITS FOOTHILL'S RUN OF TECHNICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are some technical reasons why Century was able to end a two-game losing 
streak with a 55-47 victory over Foothill Tuesday night at Century High. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, the Knights could not stop getting technicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill guard John Brittingham was cited by the referees in the first 
quarter. His crime? Wearing uniform No. 13 in the game but having uniform No. 
10 entered in the scorebook. At the time, the Knights were ahead, 14-12. Two 
foul shots and a basket later they were trailing, 16-14. They never led again.  
</P>
<P>
 Foothill forward Dan Almquist was assessed two technicals (and an ejection) in 
the fourth quarter the old fashioned way -- arguing with the officials. 
Almquist was originally whistled for a foul against Vibol Ros, and kept 
disagreeing with the call until he was excused. Ros made four of the six free 
throws, turning a 47-38 lead into a 51-38 runaway with less than three minutes 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Ros, in fact, feasted on free throws; 10 of his team-high 12 points came from 
the line. He made eight of 10 in the fourth quarter alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important to Century's success was the full-court pressure of the 
Centurions (7-3). Foothill (6-5) didn't break the 40-point barrier until there 
was 1 minute 27 seconds left to play, and while it had only 13 turnovers, the 
total is magnified in a game where there weren't many scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight our defense did what it was supposed to do, and that's wear people 
down as much mentally as physically," Century Coach Greg Coombs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill guard Vince Disaia led all scorers with 15. MIKE TERRY

LOYOLA MARYMOUNT HANDLES WASHINGTON, 80-61; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE LIONS TAKE 
TRADITIONAL PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE WEAKLING SERIOUSLY, WINNING DESPITE TURNING 
THE BALL OVER 23 TIMES.

 Washington hasn't come close to making the NCAA tournament since the 
mid-1980s, winning as many as half its games only once during the last seven 
seasons, but Loyola Marymount still viewed Tuesday night's game against the 
Huskies as a benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids realize that this is an opportunity, at least regionally, to make a 
statement," Loyola Coach John Olive said beforehand. "They're a Pac-10 team and 
the Pac-10 is the premier conference in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "And any time you play someone from the premier conference, you want to put 
your best foot forward." 
</P>
<P>
 That proved unnecessary as the Lions rolled to an 80-61 victory at Gersten 
Pavilion despite matching a season high with 23 turnovers and getting only two 
points in 32 minutes from their leading scorer, forward Wyking Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some guys who maybe didn't contribute up to their potential but I 
think, overall, we played as well as we've played all year," Olive said. 
"Obviously, we turned the ball over too many times in the first half (when they 
opened a 36-24 halftime lead despite 15 turnovers). 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than that, though, I thought that we were pretty darn sharp in a lot of 
aspects of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions made 49% of their shots and limited Washington to 37.3% shooting, 
including a dismal three-of-22 performance from three-point range, in improving 
to 6-1, matching the best start in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (1-3) used a 9-0 run to open a 9-3 lead but Loyola answered with a 
9-0 run and later extended its lead to 29-13 with a 15-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola never again led by fewer than 11 points, opening a 62-36 advantage with 
a 13-0 run midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bench really put the game away in that middle-of-the-second-half stretch 
when we had to use them because of foul trouble," Olive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve guard Coby McElroy scored 11 points in 12 minutes, making three of 
four three-point shots, and reserve forward John Anthony had eight points, 
seven rebounds, two assists and a steal in 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions were led by center Ime Oduok, who had 16 points and eight rebounds 
despite playing only 17 minutes because of foul trouble, and guard Jim 
Williamson, who had 15 points and three assists.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; OSTERTAG SITS, WATCHES, LEARNS, THEN HELPS KANSAS 
WIN, 80-75

 Instead of getting angry or embarrassed over not starting for No. 7 Kansas 
against Santa Clara on Tuesday night, Greg Ostertag got it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deserved what I got," he said after keying the Jayhawks' 80-75 victory at 
Lawrence, Kan. "I played like . . . . Saturday at Indiana and I didn't deserve 
to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostertag, a 7-foot-2 center, and Sean Pearson, who played poorly in the 
19-point loss at Indiana, were on the bench when Coach Roy Williams started a 
lineup that was all freshmen and sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostertag, who sat out the first five minutes, made a momentum-shifting 
turnaround jump shot at the two-minute mark and wound up with 16 points, nine 
rebounds and three blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say I made about an 80% improvement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara (6-2) cut the lead of Kansas (6-1) to 78-75, but Jerod Haase made 
two free throws in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Arizona St. 98, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo 43 -- Ron Riley scored 24 
points for the Sun Devils (6-2), whose margin of victory over the Mustangs 
(0-7) was their largest in 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Michigan St. 79, Tennessee 68 -- Shawn Respert scored 25 points and 
Quinton Brooks added 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Spartans (5-1), which 
dealt the Volunteers (3-2) their 15th loss in a row on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 Wake Forest 81, The Citadel 58 -- Tim Duncan scored a career-high 24 
points and grabbed 15 rebounds against the Citadel (3-4) at Winston-Salem, 
N.C., to help the Demon Deacons (6-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest's leading scorer for the season, Randolph Childress, had to be 
helped from the floor with seven minutes to play because of a bruised hip. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 New Mexico St. 102, Texas-Arlington 63 -- Johnny Selvie scored a 
career-high 19 points at Las Cruces, where the Aggies (8-2) defeated the 
Mavericks (3-5) to make Neil McCarthy the school's all-time victory leader with 
401. 
</P>
<P>
 Selvie made all eight of his shots from the field.

SLUGGISH TROJANS FINALLY HOP OVER KANGAROOS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC HAS 
TROUBLE PUTTING AWAY WINLESS MISSOURI KANSAS CITY, 82-74. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 An expected blowout victory can sometimes turn into an upset loss. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what USC fought from happening for most of Tuesday night before 
defeating winless Missouri Kansas City, 82-74, in front of 2,106 at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who improved to 4-4, needed Burt Harris' 21 points, Brandon 
Martin's 18 and Jaha Wilson's 16 and 11 rebounds to hold off the pesky 
Kangaroos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an ugly win but it was a win," USC Coach Charlie Parker said. "I think 
that we needed a wake-up call and they provided one for us. I really think that 
we took them too lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 How bad was UMKC (0-6) going into the game? 
</P>
<P>
 In losing their first five games this season, the average defeat for the 
Kangaroos was 21 points, including a 32-point loss at Kansas State and a 
27-point loss at Saint Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 UMKC did not have a starter taller than 6 feet 6 and its reserves had scored 
only 34 points going into Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not stop UMKC from giving the Trojans a scare. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening tipoff, the Kangaroos played like a team determined to get 
its first victory of the season, while the Trojans played like a team that had 
just finished the final day of final exams and was looking ahead to next week's 
Seton Hall tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that really isn't a good excuse for how we played," said Martin, who made 
six of 11 shots and also had four assists. "It's just that things that we work 
on and execute in practice, sometimes don't go well in games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense was horrible. We can't play like this against a team like UCLA or 
Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 After a nine-day layoff since their two-game trip to Texas, the Trojans did 
shoot well from the field. All five starters scored in double figures as USC 
made 32 of 59 shots (54.2%). 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' biggest problem was that they allowed UMKC to gain confidence as 
the game went on behind Chris Johnson (20 points and nine rebounds), Darecko 
Rawlins (19 and eight) and Curtis Barnes (19 points). 
</P>
<P>
 What also kept the Kangaroos close was their offensive rebounding edge, 14-10, 
and 17 turnovers by USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying everything, but we couldn't stop them with anything," Parker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to outrebound them, especially offensive rebounds, but we didn't do 
that. That made it closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Cameron Murray scored 10 points, including three three-point baskets, 
and tied a career high with nine assists.

SOUTH FLORIDA FINDS SPARK, RALLIES TO DEFEAT PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARK STRODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepperdine couldn't have asked for a better set-up Tuesday night before 685 at 
Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 With about one minute remaining in the first half, the Waves had an 
eight-point lead against South Florida, which lost all 14 road games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to South Florida's misery was an ankle sprain suffered in the first 
half by its second-leading scorer, Jesse Salters. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's when the Bears' Chucky Atkins took over. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior point guard scored 20 of his game-high 23 points in the final 21 
minutes to lead South Florida to a 73-60 nonconference victory over Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins, the Bulls' leading scorer this season at 20.5 points per game, scored 
10 points in a row to lead the comeback. His steal and layup with 18:43 
remaining gave South Florida (6-2) a 35-33 lead that it never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew when Jesse went down that I'd have to step it up a little," said 
Atkins, who made five of eight three-point shots and had six assists and two 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of the leaders on this team, so I knew I'd have to pick up some of 
the scoring slack." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chucky's a fine player," said South Florida Coach Bobby Paschal, whose team 
is enjoying the road so far this year with three victories in four tries. "We 
expect that from him. He's a leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of guys pick up the slack for Salters." 
</P>
<P>
 South Florida made nine of its 14 three-point shots and shot 56.8% for the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine shot only 38.6%, while making four of 19 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot to beat ourselves tonight," said Pepperdine first-year Coach 
Tony Fuller after the Waves dropped to 2-6. "We knew they didn't have a whole 
lot of outside shooters so we tried to take away their inside game. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the game went on, they found their rhythm and we lost ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine closed to within 49-48 on two free throws by Khary Hervey with 8:52 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bulls, led by Atkins' five points and two assists, went on a 13-3 run 
to take a 62-52 lead with 2:03 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Brown led the Waves with 14 points. Josh Merrill had 12 and Gavin 
Vanderputten 10.

MIGLINIEKS, WILLIAMS MAKE THEIR POINTS AS IRVINE WINS 
</P>

<P>
 Two starters who were Oh-for-Arizona during UC Irvine's last loss and a 
forgotten point guard whose playing time has been dwindling awakened Tuesday 
night to lead the Anteaters to an 89-73 nonconference victory over Oregon 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Kevin Simmons and point guard Raimonds Miglinieks, who did not score 
in a loss to the Sun Devils on Saturday night, combined for 27 points as Irvine 
won its home opener in front of 2,410 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons had 17 points and 11 rebounds and Miglinieks, who played only 25 
minutes because of foul problems, scored 10 points and had 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (3-3) led by as many as 16 points midway through the first half, but 
needed guard Zuri Williams to steady the ship when the Beavers (3-4) closed to 
within 60-57 with 12:24 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who played a season-high 15 minutes, had five assists and scored 
nine points, four on two driving layups as the Anteaters outscored Oregon 
State, 23-7, over the next eight minutes to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Irvine) teams in the past might have let this kind of game get away," Coach 
Rod Baker said. "We had our ups and down. We let it slide. But we never let it 
get away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zuri Williams really stepped up in the second half and played the way he's 
capable of playing. He used his athleticism, but he also took control of the 
team. Between Raimonds and Zuri, that's a good 40 minutes at the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a senior who has played in the shadows of several Irvine point 
guards, figures to play second fiddle to Miglinieks this time around. 
Miglinieks wowed the Anteater fans with his mastery of mystery passes -- the 
ones that somehow get through a lot of traffic and find the hands of a teammate 
for a layup. Thanks primarily to him, Irvine's post players were a combined 
nine of 10 from the field in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams got a chance to handle the ball and run the team during a crucial 
stretch and he made the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they got it down to three, I thought, 'Oh no, here we go again,' " he 
said. "I've seen a lot of leads disappear in my first three years here. But 
I've learned a little about leadership and this was my coming-out party."

SLOW-STARTING FULLERTON HOT ENOUGH IN OVERTIME TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton Coach Bob Hawking had more than mild concern going into 
Tuesday night's game against San Diego State that his team might be flat. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Titans' Saturday night upset victory at Nevada Las Vegas in their 
Big West Conference opener, Hawking had reason to be wary. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be justified. Fullerton scored only 20 points in the game's 
first 19 minutes and trailed at halftime. But the Titans scrambled back to win 
in overtime, 83-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard James French, who has been in one of the worst shooting slumps on the 
team, hit aclutch three-point basket from the corner as the buzzer sounded to 
send the game into the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 French also made two of three free throws with 25 seconds left in regulation 
to bring the Titans to within a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws by Aztec guard Chad Nelson still left San Diego State on top, 
68-65, with 19 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans appeared to still be in trouble when the Aztec defense appeared to 
have Chris St. Clair stopped without a shot, but he was able to swing the ball 
to French, whose jump shot floated in. 
</P>
<P>
 The overtime belonged to Fullerton. Chuck Overton scored and was fouled with 
1:50 to play. His free throw gave the Titans a 74-70 lead and three more from 
him put Fullerton up, 77-70. 
</P>
<P>
 French finished the game with 24 points, his career high, making 16 of 19 free 
throws. He had made only six field goals in his last 34 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State (4-3) had a 61-51 lead with about six minutes to play before 
the Titans (3-3) came alive offensively. Five points in a row by Fullerton 
guard Chris Dade cut the deficit to 61-58, and a free throw by David Frigout 
made it 61-59 with about four minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans shot 24% in the first half, making six of 25 from the field and 
going scoreless in eight tries from three-point range. Only 11-of-14 free-throw 
shooting kept them in the game at the end of the first half.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith's consecutive game streak with the Dallas Cowboys could end 
Saturday at 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who pulled a hamstring in the third quarter of Monday night's victory 
against New Orleans, reported for treatment Tuesday.And the report wasn't good 
for someone who wants to play football this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has swelling in the hamstring and it's sore," team physician Robert 
Vandermeer said. "I would think he would have a good chance of being well by 
the first playoff game. Things like this are difficult to predict." 
</P>
<P>
 The game against the New York Giants in the Meadowlands means nothing to 
Dallas, but playing means everything to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want in for one play so I can keep my streak alive," Smith said. "They 
can let (quarterback) Troy (Aikman) throw the ball or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Switzer said, "Emmitt was worse today than he was last night. . . 
. If he thinks he can play and help us win, he'll play."

 Seattle Seahawk owner Ken Behring met with former Stanford and San Francisco

it's not known whether Walsh is a potential candidate for a job or was sought

Tuesday because of a knee injury, but said he expects to start in Saturday's 
regular-season finale at Atlanta. . . . Washington Redskin General Manager 
Charley Casserly will remain with the team, owner Jack Kent Cooke told The 
Washington Times. The Redskins waived second-year linebacker Lamont Hollinquest 
from USC, three days after he skipped a practice and team meetings. . . . 
Florida millionaire George Lindemann said his offer to buy the Buccaneers and 
keep them in Tampa was rejected.

TITANS' STREAK GROWING; BASKETBALL: RUN OF GOOD LUCK CONTINUES FOR A SECOND 
GAME AS CAL STATE FULLERTON BEATS SAN DIEGO STATE IN OVERTIME, 83-73. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton Coach Bob Hawking had more than mild concern that his team 
might be flat for Tuesday night's basketball game against San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking had reason to be wary because the Titans were coming off an upset 
victory at Nevada Las Vegas in the Big West Conference opener.  
</P>
<P>
 His worrying was justified; the Titans scored only 20 points in the game's 
first 19 minutes and trailed 31-23 at halftime. But just when they appeared to 
be tossing away any momentum gained in the victory over UNLV, the Titans 
scrambled back to win in overtime, 83-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard James French, deep into a shooting slump, hit a clutch three-pointer 
from the corner at the buzzer to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 French also made two of three free throws with 25 seconds left in regulation 
time to bring the Titans to within a point. Guard Chad Nelson hit two free 
throws to keep San Diego State on top, 68-65, with 19 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (3-3) appeared to be in trouble when the Aztec defense converged on 
Chris St. Clair, but he was able to swing the ball to French, whose jumper 
floated in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for Chris in that situation," Hawking said. "But they jumped 
two guys in on him. I'm sure they figured he'd be the guy to take the shot 
since he's been our best perimeter shooter."  
</P>
<P>
 St. Clair's three-point shot beat UNLV. But French was the Titans' clutch 
player this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to get a good look at a three," French said. "Chris was going 
to take it up, but he couldn't, so I was able to get a shot at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the new life, the overtime belonged to Fullerton. Chuck Overton had the 
big basket in the overtime with 1:50 left. He was fouled on the play and his 
free throw put the Titans up, 74-70. French added three more more free throws 
to make it 77-70. 
</P>
<P>
 French finished the game with 24 points, his career high, getting 16 points at 
the free-throw line in 19 attempts. Going into the game, he had made only six 
field goals in his last 34 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton center Winston Peterson, who has had four consecutive 20-point-plus 
games, was limited to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough after coming off the Vegas win," Hawking said. "That's all 
everyone was talking about. We kept telling them that today's headlines are 
tomorrow's trash, but it's not easy when that's what everyone is talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking was able to joke about the second consecutive close victory after it 
was over. He looked over at Athletic Director John Easterbrook and kidded: "I'm 
going to need a case of Grecian Formula for my hair after this season is over." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State (4-3) led, 61-51, with just less than six minutes left before 
the Titan offense came to life. Five consecutive points by freshman guard Chris 
Dade got the Titans to within three points. 
</P>
<P>
 David Frigout's free throw made it 61-59 with just more than four minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans shot 24% in the first half, hitting only six of 25 from the field 
and going scoreless in eight tries from three-point range. Only their 
free-throw shooting, 11 for 14, kept them in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton shot 51.7% in the second half to finish at 38.9% compared to 31.3% 
for the Aztecs.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS FALL AS FED STANDS PAT ON RATES; DOW TUMBLES 23.55

<P>
 The Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates alone for now failed to 
prevent another stumble for Wall Street on Tuesday. Stocks were dragged down by 
other considerations. Bond yields rose slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The news that the Fed's monetary policy meeting had produced no surprises gave 
stocks a brief boost, but the effect was fleeting and the modest gains quickly 
disappeared from the major market indicators. The Dow Jones industrial average 
finished at 3,767.15, off 23.55 and near its lowest level of the day. Broad 
market indicators also sagged. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing and declining issues were almost equal in number on the Big Board, 
where 325.53 million shares were traded, up from Monday's volume of 271.69 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting of the Fed's policy committee the center of investors' attention. 
Although it was widely assumed that the panel would refrain from raising rates 
for a seventh time this year, the markets were not certain of that until the 
meeting was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the Fed's decision prompted a muted reaction in the bond market, where 
the yield of the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 7.84% from 7.83% the day 
before. The bond's price, which moves inversely to the yield, was down 1/8 
point, or $1.25 per $1,000 invested. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of broad economic news, events affecting individual issues 
influenced trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Developments involving stocks traded on the Nasdaq seemed to balance each 
other. The Nasdaq composite edged up 0.62 to 728.51. 
</P>
<P>
 Software industry leader Microsoft said it probably will ship its latest 
version of Windows next August, rather than in the spring as previously 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft's announcement of the delay in marketing the new Windows operating 
system sent the company's stock down 2 3/4 to 59 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of Microsoft's announcement was offset by welcome news from Intel, 
which moved to solve problems involving the flawed Pentium chip. Intel's stock 
surged 3 7/16 to 61 1/4, and Intel's promise to replace the chips free of 
charge, no questions asked, also helped other computer stocks. Dell Computer 
rose 1 to 38 3/8 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, investors snapped up stocks after the government dropped the peso's 
floor in relation to the dollar. But the rally lost steam on news from Chiapas 
that police and army troops were moving into recently captured rebel territory, 
and the Bolsa finished 43.06 points higher at 2,274.17.  
</P>
<P>
 In New York, however, Mexican stocks stumbled on news of the devaluation. 
Telefonos de Mexico fell 2 1/2 to 46; Grupo Televisa fell 3 3/8 to 35 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Glaxo's American depository receipts rose 1 to 20 3/4 after the British drug 
maker said it expects the U.S. patent on its Zantac ulcer medication will be 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monsanto tumbled 4 to 68 7/8 on news that it will buy Merck's Kelco 
business. Merck gained 3/8 to 38 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other overseas stock markets closed higher. Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share 
average gained 136.13 points to close at 19,406.98. In London, the Financial 
Times 100-share average rose 23.7 points to 3,058.1. Germany's 30-share DAX 
average ended at 2,079.93, up 3.99 points.

 RAVE REVIEW: A memo summing up the 1994 accomplishments of the Simi Valley 
city attorney led off with his efforts to help the City Council fathom changes 
to the state's open-meeting law. . . . The memo, dated Dec. 12, says City Atty. 
John Torrance's office "assisted the council in its acclimation to the new 
provisions of the Brown Act. . . ." That same day, though, the council -- 
acting on Torrance's advice -- violated the law by meeting in closed session to 
approve raises for Torrance and the city manager. . . . Torrance has admitted 
the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHER EDUCATION: Cal State University officials have finally secured land for 
a public four-year university in Ventura County (B1). . . . Now that the 
30-year search for a site has ended, construction of the campus could take 
another 30 years. . . . Among the next incremental steps: getting statewide 
voter approval in 1996 for a higher-education bond to pay for building new 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT OR NOT? From a self-proclaimed homeboy to a Sinatra-style showman, Santa 
Claus is strutting his stuff in malls across Ventura County (B1). . . . 
Somehow, the big guy always seems to know what's popular with the kids -- and 
which toys aren't making the cut. . . . Barney the dinosaur -- all the rage 
with toddlers last Christmas -- isn't faring as well this season. In fact, some 
retailers say the purple creature may become extinct if slow sales are any 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
 CAN DO: Junior high school students will be playing with food today at 
Oxnard's Esplanade Mall -- but don't worry, the chaos will be under control. . 
. . The students are creating sculptures from as many as 10,000 cans of food 
for Food Share's annual Canstruction contest. After the contest, the food will 
be distributed in Christmas baskets to needy families. Students stacking the 
cans Tuesday declined to identify what the shapes represent. "It's like this 
big state secret," said Jim Mangis of Food Share. . . . Donations -- 
particularly frozen turkeys -- are still needed. To donate, call 983-7100.

R. CRITCHFIELD; WROTE ABOUT SOCIETY'S ORIGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Critchfield, war correspondent and author who studied villages as the 
building blocks of society, has died at age 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Critchfield, who lived in Berkeley, died Dec. 10 in a Washington, D.C., 
hospital, a week after suffering a stroke.He had gone to Washington to promote 
his latest book, "The Villagers," a follow-up to his 1981 book, "Villages." 
</P>
<P>
 His international study was often financed by grants from the Ford Foundation 
and the Alicia Patterson Foundation. In 1981, he became one of the first 
recipients of the MacArthur "genius" grants, which support creative people for 
five years, enabling them to pursue whatever project they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of North Dakota, Critchfield earned a bachelor's degree at the 
University of Washington, a master's at Columbia University and did graduate 
work at Innsbruck and Vienna universities. After serving in the Army during the 
Korean War, Critchfield began his writing career as farm editor of the Cedar 
Rapids (Iowa) Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 He later covered the Vietnam War for the Washington Star, earning the Overseas 
Press Club Award. His first book, "The Long Charade," was about the Vietnam 
War. He also wrote a popular book titled "Those Days: An American Album," using 
his family history to illustrate America's shift from rural to urban society. 
</P>
<P>
 Critchfield is survived by his sister, Peggy Critchfield Moffett of Berkeley, 
and brother, Jim Critchfield of Delaplane, Va., and several nieces and nephews.

CLINTON TO SEEK $91 MILLION MORE FOR AIDS CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, despite tight budget constraints, will seek $91 
million more next year to care for people with AIDS, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who has already boosted spending on the programs by 82%, 
will seek an increase to $724 million for fiscal 1996, Administration officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, lobbying by AIDS groups, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros and 
AIDS policy director Patricia (Patsy) Fleming persuaded Clinton's budget office 
to back off a proposal to stop funding a $186-million housing assistance 
program for homeless and indigent AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton promised during his 1992 campaign to fully fund the Ryan White Act, 
which provides direct medical and social services to people living with HIV, or 
with full-blown AIDS. It is named for a hemophiliac Indiana teen-ager who died 
of AIDS in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The government spends nearly $3 billion a year on AIDS research, prevention 
and treatment programs.

CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS IN HOUSE TO STICK WITH PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana said Tuesday that he and other 
conservative Democrats have decided to stick with their party for at least a 
year, ending speculation that they would join the new Republican majority in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep him and other conservatives in the party, the Democratic leadership 
will have to prove that it wants them, he said. He said he and a number of 
other Democrats will form an active conservative caucus next month to make sure 
the party is responsive. 
</P>
<P>
 "By this time next year, we will know if the party's promises of inclusion are 
true," he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Parker (D-Miss.), another conservative Southern Democrat who had 
been talking about joining the GOP, also said Tuesday he will stick with his 
party and work with Tauzin in forming the caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in just holding hands and talking about how bad things 
are" for conservative Democrats, Tauzin said. "We're going to be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Tauzin told the Thibodaux (La.) Daily Comet that he and an estimated 
22 Democrats thought to be ripe for the picking by the GOP will likely stay 
with their party for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 No House Democrats have switched since the GOP landslide last month, but one 
senator, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, did join the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Tauzin, who has represented Louisiana's 3rd District for 14 years, has been 
disenchanted with the party leadership on Capitol Hill for several years. He 
has complained of getting shabby treatment from his party because of his 
conservative voting record. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, conservative Democrats have had to ask Republicans for time to 
talk on the House floor because their own party leadership had not liked their 
views, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Tauzin won a senior slot on the Natural Resources Committee and the 
Commerce Committee after the Democratic Party's Rules Committee decided it 
would no longer use a score card of party-line votes to determine committee 
assignments, a policy that penalized Tauzin and other conservatives.

VENTURA PIER MAY REOPEN BY NEW YEAR'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even as they braced for another series of powerful waves expected today, 
officials in charge of maintaining Ventura's landmark wooden pier were counting 
themselves lucky so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier, closed because of damage wreaked by surf on Monday, could reopen in 
time for New Year's Day because city officials on Tuesday found nine 
60-foot-tall replacement pilings in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pilings had been unavailable, the pier would have been closed for 
months while the city waited for loggers to fill a special order, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers Tuesday completed a temporary reinforcement to the pier, 
strapping beams to the top of the deck above the knocked-out pilings. 
</P>
<P>
 The reinforced pier was expected to withstand today's waves, which the 
National Weather Service said would reach five to seven feet in height. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty confident that we're not going to have a problem," said Tim 
Jonasson, a city civil engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 City inspectors said the snapped pilings last underwent an underwater 
inspection in 1993 and were found to be sound. Portions of the 1,958-foot-long, 
122-year-old pier were closed from 1986 until 1993, when the pier reopened 
after a $3.5-million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Monty Clark, chairman of the volunteer Pier Into the Future Committee, which 
has raised more than $400,000 for maintenance of the pier, said he was 
disappointed that the pier has been closed again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clark said winter storm damage is to be expected. "We knew we were going 
to have to replace some of the pilings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent renovation, construction workers only replaced pilings that 
were identified as rotted by a diver who tested them with a hammer. But workers 
left in place hundreds of old pilings -- including the ones that snapped in the 
surf zone Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the best job we could of testing them," maintenance services manager 
John Betonte said, acknowledging that some failed pilings had been eaten away 
by sea worms. 
</P>
<P>
 Betonte said the repairs would probably cost between $30,000 and $50,000 and 
be paid for by the city. He said there would be no effort to recover the money 
from Cushman Contracting Corp., the Santa Barbara-based firm that did the 1993 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't do anything wrong," Betonte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said he was delighted that the replacement pilings had been found 
nearby, and he said he hoped they will be installed quickly. "We can be back on 
the pier in no time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier began its history as a commercial wharf and gradually became a 
fishing and recreational pier for local residents. It is the longest 
free-standing wooden pier in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's storm-driven swells reached nine feet in height and combined with a 
high tide to wash away the pilings under a section of the pier where the waves 
were breaking. "It's a lot to ask any wood to withstand," Jonasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's waves will be smaller, but "still way above normal," National Weather 
Service meteorologist Clay Morgan said, predicting that the swells would slowly 
decrease Thursday and Friday and drop off to normal levels over the weekend. He 
said there was a 50% to 60% chance of showers today.

REGIONAL TRAIL PLAN APPROVED BY COUNTY; RECREATION: THE SYSTEM OF BIKEWAYS AND 
HIKING PATHS EXCLUDES THE SANTA CLARA RIVER VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors Tuesday approved a regional system of bikeways and 
hiking paths, but exempted the Santa Clara River Valley from the master plan 
because of farmers' fears that their property values and businesses would be 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 0 to approve the plan, which proposes to 
link most of the county's cities through a system of trails that would be built 
over the next 20 years. Supervisor John Flynn did not attend the meeting, but 
sent a letter urging the board to delay a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the proposal called for a system of about 1,000 miles of trails 
linking all of the county's 10 cities. The pathways would be used by 
bicyclists, hikers and equestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a three-hour public hearing Tuesday, more than two dozen ranchers 
and citrus growers from the Santa Clara River Valley complained that the trail 
system would expose their property to vandalism, trash and possible lawsuits 
from injured hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not a park," Santa Paula farmer Randall Axell said. "We are an 
industry. Show me an industry that has a trail running right through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Pinkerton, executive director of the Ventura County Cattleman's Assn., 
criticized the supervisors for considering the plan without knowing how the 
county would pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has said how much this is going to cost," Pinkerton said. "Business 
people would never approve something without knowing how much it's going to 
cost and how they were going to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 His concerns were echoed by Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura 
County Farm Bureau, who asked the board for assurance that it would not seek to 
obtain private land for the trail system through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee, whose district includes the Santa Clara River 
Valley, agreed with the farmers' concerns and asked that the area be excluded 
from the trail system until those issues could be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm strongly in favor of the idea that we need a trail in the Santa Clara 
River Valley," she said. "But where it should be and how it works still needs 
to be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee said it may not be appropriate for some areas of the county to be 
included in the system, noting that farmers also have fears about the spread of 
crop-damaging pests. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's good for urban areas may not be good for agricultural areas," Kildee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Blakemore, administrator of the Regional Trails and Pathways Program, said 
it was never the county's intent to forcibly take private property for the 
trail system. He said much of the system would be on publicly owned land, which 
includes existing trails and flood control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore said the system would also include some private property. But he 
said if an agreement could not be worked out with owners, the county would 
simply reroute the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not intend to infringe upon the rights of property owners," Blakemore 
told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore said the the next step is for the 38-member Regional Trails Advisory 
Committee to put together a financing plan to build and maintain the trail 
system. He said the panel, which is made up of residents and government 
officials, hopes to be able to bring back its plan within eight to 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cost of the system is unknown, Blakemore said it would be 
financed through a combination of grants, donations and business sponsors. An 
adopt-a-trail system would be set up to encourage volunteers to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only established parts of the system are the nearly 10-mile Ojai 
Valley Trail and a six-mile stretch along the Arroyo Simi in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the system would take between 15 and 20 years to 
complete and would help the county meet federal air pollution regulations by 
providing an alternative for commuters.

TALE OF 2 SANTAS; CHRISTMAS: ST. NICK AT CENTERPOINT MALL IS A FIRME VATO -- A 
COOL DUDE. IN THOUSAND OAKS, HE'S A CROONER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They call him "Homey Santa" -- an affectionate nod to his real-life identity 
as a homeboy in Oxnard's La Colonia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Or "Santa Pac-Man," after the childhood nickname he received for being able to 
pack away food as eagerly as the dot-eating video game character. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever his moniker, Ramon Garcia is holding his own against the skeptics in 
his first-ever stint as St. Nick at Oxnard's Centerpoint Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 When jaded older kids try to put Garcia down, he starts speaking their slang, 
and they realize this Santa is all right. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the 13-year-old smart-aleck who said he wanted a low-rider with 
hydraulics and a girlfriend for Christmas. Garcia told him he'd see what he 
could do about the low-rider, but the teen-ager would have to get "the chick" 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'You're a firme vato, Santa,' " -- a cool dude, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Garcia could be the coolest Claus in the west county, the east county 
has a Singing Santa in Dennis Van Vuren. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Vuren, owner of Crazy California Clowns in Simi Valley, gets rave reviews 
from parents and kids who come to see him at the Janss Mall in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been a professional Santa for 17 years, and his performances for school 
groups have a tinge of Las Vegas flash. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently he treated preschoolers from Horizon Hills School in Thousand Oaks to 
such a spectacle. Using jingle bells for percussion, he sang "Santa Claus Is 
Coming To Town" and "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" in grand style, then held 
the kids spellbound with his dramatic recital of "The Night Before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 But even individual visitors can get the Vegas treatment. Van Vuren once 
crooned "Our First Christmas" so sweetly to a newborn that the child's 
grandmother cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that was a Hallmark moment," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of backgrounds, the two Santas are as different as they can be. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a 38-year-old entrepreneur-entertainer complete with pager and cellular 
phone. The other is a 22-year-old youth football coach and former gang member 
who is new at playing Santa but possesses the heart and heft required for the 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Vuren speaks sign language. He says his most cherished Santa experiences 
have occurred communicating with disabled kids. For instance, there was the 
deaf boy who doubted that he was really Santa -- until Van Vuren started 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he knew I was the real thing," Van Vuren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, on the other hand, speaks English, Spanish and a bit of Korean. But 
whatever means they use to communicate, both Santas are fluent in the universal 
language of love and have become experts at helping kids overcome Santaphobia. 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't think anyone would be afraid of a fat, jolly old man wearing a 
snuggly red suit, but tiny tots can get terrified when it's their turn to pose 
for the traditional Santa photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Vuren's solution is to let mom hold baby on her hip. He then sneaks up 
behind them while his photographer-elf carefully frames and snaps a photo with 
just Santa and child in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks parent Suzanne Duckett said she appreciates the way Van Vuren 
tries to make sure parents get a good photo. It's one of the reasons she comes 
back to see him each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia uses another tactic: He will touch the child's heart. If it's beating 
fast, he knows they are scared. He will tickle them and give them candy canes, 
hugs and smiles to put them at ease for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear other kids have is that Santa is too fat to get down their chimneys 
to deliver toys. Van Vuren just laughs and tells them, "Like they say, a 
bowlful of jelly -- I just get all squishy and slide right down." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides knowing child psychology and having a sense of humor, mall Santas have 
to be well-versed in kid culture. They must know the latest children's movies, 
TV shows and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Santas listed Power Rangers, the new Barbie line, Sega video games, 
the Elmo doll from "Sesame Street," "Lion King" items, Baby Check-Up, Baby All 
Gone and remote-control cars that flip over as the most frequently requested 
items this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is always the kid that gets carried away. Van Vuren told of 
one squirt who pointed to the Toys R Us store conveniently located across from 
Santa's station at Janss Mall and demanded "everything in that store." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Garcia spoke sadly of poor children dressed in tatters who just 
wanted some new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I was a real Santa and I could snap my fingers and things would be 
fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he felt helpless when a developmentally disabled girl told him, "All I 
want for Christmas is I want to be smart and I want to get healed from my 
sickness." 
</P>
<P>
 The list of unfulfilled wishes goes on: A preschool teacher, recently widowed, 
told Santa she would like a new husband. A little boy asked to see his little 
sister, who had just died. A little girl wanted her parents to stop fighting. 
Others ask for baby brothers and sisters or new daddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others ask for world peace -- a gift both Santas said they fervently 
wished they could give. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, a former gang member who is now trying to give something back to 
society, said it's what he personally wants most for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace on Earth and everybody to get along," he said. "For the gangs to stop 
the violence. There's no sense to kill each other for no reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who is doing the Santa gig as part of his job as a security officer at 
Centerpoint Mall, thinks he can make a difference in kids' lives through 
activities such as coaching and playing Santa. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he has met many kids in La Colonia who feel they don't have 
anywhere to turn for positive attention, so they become involved in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't make time for them, I don't think anybody will," Garcia said. He 
added later: "If I were to die the next day, I'd have accomplished something."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; AUTHORITIES WARN OF 2 SCAM ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department is alerting the public to be on the 
lookout for two scam artists who tricked a 54-year-old Fillmore woman into 
giving them more than $2,000, some of which the victim withdrew from a credit 
card account. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Detective Dan Viveros said a similar scam occurred in Fillmore in 
October and has occurred in other areas. "Now that it's so close to the 
holidays, this is going to happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viveros said one of the con artists approached the victim, saying she had won 
a big Lotto jackpot but could not cash the ticket because she was an illegal 
immigrant. He said she then asked the victim and a female accomplice for help, 
offering them a substantial reward. 
</P>
<P>
 The accomplice then returned with a large amount of cash, and she and the 
phony lottery winner asked the victim to produce financial proof that she also 
could be trusted. Viveros said because the victim did not have enough cash, she 
got a cash advance from her credit-card account. 
</P>
<P>
 Viveros said the supposed lottery winner feigned a sudden illness and said she 
needed a prescription filled. She and her accomplice then asked the victim to 
go into a local drug store to obtain the medication while they waited outside 
in the car. When the victim came out of the store, both women had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was left with a small purse that she thought was money, but proved 
to be paper cut to resemble U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The phony lottery winner was described as a Latina about 35 years old, 5 foot 
3 with a slender build, brown eyes and long, fine-textured brown hair. She wore 
a black dress and her hair was in a bun. 
</P>
<P>
 The accomplice was described as a 5-foot-8 Latina with brown hair and a heavy 
build. She is about 40 and has a round face and wore sunglasses with dark 
frames. She was wearing a black and white coat, dark skirt and high heels. JAN

 Fur-quent fliers: Here's still another Christmas tip from jolly old Only in 
L.A. -- Carnival Air Lines, which flies between Miami and L.A., has instituted 
a frequent flier program for pets. For every 10 round trips, the critter 
receives the 11th for free -- a savings of $90. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pet also gets its picture taken with our PR person, Gabriel Gabor," said 
spokeswoman Juanita O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is Gabriel any relation to Zsa Zsa?" we inquired, desperately wanting to 
liven up this item. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she said. Then she added: "You must be from L.A. to be asking that."

 Seasons' Jailings The recent release of con man Barry Minkow from prison 
brought back treasured memories for us. It was six years ago that we published 
our all-time favorite Christmas card -- one that Minkow sent to the federal 
prosecutors who helped bring about his conviction on 57 counts of fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't of wanted anyone else up there making me look soooo bad," 
rhapsodized the former carpet cleaning whiz to James Asperger and Gordon 
Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The card was hand-delivered to the lawyers during jury deliberations because, 
Minkow noted in a P.S., "I'm too cheap to send this card."

 Shopping in the '90s: Consulting a list, the young man began to order a

stared at the list. Then the customer asked his mother to make a substitute 
choice -- via his cellular phone.

 List of the Day: The Star News, a monthly magazine of the L.A. County 
Sheriff's Relief Assn., delights in poking good-natured fun at personnel. Some 
targets in the December issue: 
</P>
<P>
 * A deputy who broke his hand after falling off a bicycle -- a stationary 
bicycle. "He must have been pedaling while watching 'Oprah' and was cut off by 
'Donahue,' " the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
 * One sheriff's staffer who was asked: "Is that sweater one of those new 
cotton blends, Bruce?" His response: "No way, it's acetate. I don't wear 
cotton. I'm an animal lover." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sgt. Ron Spear, a sheriff's spokesman, who was interviewed by a TV newsman 
at the scene of a homicide in Monterey Park. Spear was surprised to hear the 
newsman conclude: "There you have it folks. The Sheriff's Department is trying 
to tie Ron Spear to this murder." 
</P>

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; SLEUTH GRABS FRAUD 
BY ITS WHITE COLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen N. Getzoff is no ordinary rent-a-cop. Sure, he's a reserve police 
officer. But armed with a calculator and a balance sheet, there's a good chance 
Getzoff can tell if your company is being ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
 White-collar fraud is a multibillion dollar business, and people like Getzoff 
are the Sam Spades of corporate crime. Getzoff recently became a Certified 
Fraud Examiner after three decades of fraud sleuthing, tying him into a 
worldwide network of white-collar crime busters. 
</P>
<P>
 "A CFE is not just an accountant, and not just an investigator, and not just a 
security and loss prevention specialist," said Curt Garner, a spokesman for the 
Assn. of Certified Fraud Examiners. "They're a hybrid." 
</P>
<P>
 Regular law-enforcement agencies rarely have the expertise or resources to 
fully investigate white-collar fraud, Garner said. So CFEs are important 
because they "are able to give a case essentially gift-wrapped to prosecutors." 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud costs businesses anywhere from $186 billion to $310 billion a year 
nationwide. And with jobs still hard to find, Getzoff sees the fraud-hunting 
business as a growth industry because more and more disgruntled employees 
decide to steal what they feel they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighty percent of all employees in the work force have stolen," Getzoff said, 
tossing out the everyday examples of office workers taking home pencils and 
paper. "But employees do not steal. They take what they feel they're entitled 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, like that of the bookkeeper who embezzled $400,000 from a 
Beverly Hills doctor, the crimes are more than just petty theft. But his 
reasons were the same as the clerk who swipes a ream of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bookkeeper who took $400,000 rationalized that the doctor was making 
millions while he was the one who kept the place together," Getzoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getzoff offered up the example of an Orange County steel company. For 50 
years, it was a profitable family-run business, he said. But when it passed 
from one generation to the next, an outside manager took over operations. The 
family called Getzoff at his Encino accounting office when they began losing 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Getzoff discovered that the manager had a "personal relationship with a key 
bookkeeper," and had been ordering shipping clerks to send materials to a new 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had set up his own business," Getzoff said. "It's like when your car gets 
stripped. He left a stripped company." 
</P>
<P>
 Getzoff has seen the uglier side of corporate life: the North Valley medical 
company where an employee illegally cashed $6 million in company checks; the 
jewelry shop whose owner was the store's biggest thief, and the Glendale 
doctor's office manager who cashed checks to her boss and used the money to 
supply her boyfriend's drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ideal world, Getzoff admitted, the government would be able to 
investigate all white-collar crime. But he said it's not surprising that the 
burden of sleuthing falls on the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Getzoff noted that a large portion of the LAPD's calls are on domestic 
violence. "If you've got a cop, what are you going to send him out on?" Getzoff 
asked rhetorically. "The domestic violence call, or 'my employee stole 
$100,000'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the number of (public) agents to investigate these crimes, 
as compared to the number of cases, it's impossible," he said. "They're 
buried." 
</P>
<P>
 Getzoff became an accountant 22 years ago, and as a junior accountant he got a 
taste of fraud-busting and was hooked. When he started his own firm a couple of 
years later, he made it known he could handle white-collar crime as well as 
routine accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a quarter of his work is fraud-related, and he also teaches at a North 
Hollywood detective academy and helps out the LAPD on fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoys the intellectual challenge of sleuthing, but says it's not all 
excitement: "It can be sort of Sherlock Holmes-ish, but a lot of it is 
drudgery." 
</P>
<P>
 As anyone who's read a spreadsheet knows.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; DEVELOPER SUES CITY OVER NUDE CLUB BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Las Vegas real estate developer has filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against the 
city of Simi Valley, alleging the city violated his rights when it blocked his 
plans to build a nude dance club in town. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Philip Young, had received a zoning clearance in early 1993 for 
an 11,000-square-foot club to be built in a former strip mall at 999 Los 
Angeles Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials soon revoked his zoning clearance and then in April 
approved a strict ordinance limiting adult entertainment, which eliminated the 
possibility of future approval for the club. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Young backed away from his plans and decided not to buy the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Young's attorney filed a lawsuit in federal court stating that the 
city violated Young's rights to free speech and due process when it revoked the 
zoning clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Young did not act sooner, his attorney Roger Diamond said, because he was 
depressed about his lost opportunity and believed he had no further recourse at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally in cases like this, we ask for an injunction so that the project 
can go forward," said Diamond, who has represented hundreds of adult bookstores 
and nude dance clubs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "But because now the building is occupied by a pet store the only remedy is to 
seek damages." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's adult entertainment ordinance that was passed right after Young's 
zoning clearance was pulled, prohibits sexually oriented bookstores, movie 
theaters, nightclubs and related businesses from opening near a residential 
area, a youth-oriented business, a school, a park or a place of worship.  
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Supreme Court has said that a city cannot -- under the guise of a 
zoning ordinance -- make it impossible for this kind of business to go 
forward," Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this isn't about zoning. Mr. Young could have gone forward. He was in a 
legal location, but they canceled their approval without a hearing and then 
zoned him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley City Atty. John Torrance declined to comment. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PUPILS CREATE CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS FOR 
CONVALESCENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Vanessa Chester was so excited that she woke up at 6 a.m. 
Tuesday and couldn't go back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so much fun to give gifts that I just couldn't wait to come to school 
today," said Vanessa, a fourth-grader at Oxnard's Bernice Curren School. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa was one of 35 students who on Tuesday played Santa as they delivered 
ornaments and cards they had made to patients at the Glenwood Convalescent 
Hospital in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who spent two weeks making the gifts, walked from their 
classroom to the hospital, where they sang Christmas carols, recited poems and 
handed out colorful Christmas cards and ornaments to about 50 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best gift the patients can get for Christmas," said Anna 
Martinez, the hospital's activity director. "It gives them a chance to remember 
their own childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Pat Barba said the class came up with the idea for the gifts after 
hearing about a group of youngsters cleaning up a beach; they decided that they 
too wanted to do something for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Barba, who knew how to make ornaments, decided to make that the class project. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, the classroom was cluttered with thread, needles, lace, fabric, 
pictures, glitter and strings, and students were told to be as creative as 
possible in making their ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The result included miniature Christmas trees, snowmen, reindeer, big and tiny 
Santas, and Christmas cards shaped like stars, cars and sleighs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Calzada got so involved in the project that she made more than 10 
cards and 10 ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like sewing and I've been excited about making the ornaments for older 
people," said Lorraine, who considers herself a sewing expert. "I made a 
blanket, two hats, and now I'm making two dolls to give my little sister for 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was delighted with the idea of sewing. For 9-year-old Bradley 
Boer, the task was hard and tedious.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never sewed before and I don't want to do it again. I kept poking my 
finger," Bradley said. "But it was okay to make the cards." CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; POLICE IMPOSTORS RAID, RANSACK HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five or six men pretending to be police officers stormed an Oxnard house 
Tuesday morning, assaulted the residents and ransacked the house, Oxnard police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Javier Zendejas, 28, told authorities that the men pounded on the front 
door about 10 a.m., entered his house pointing guns and said: "This is the 
police! This is the police!" 
</P>
<P>
 Zendejas said the intruders hit him with a lead pipe and bound his hands with 
a string of Christmas tree lights before ransacking his Nottingham Drive house, 
apparently looking for drugs and money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another occupant of the house, Jose Ramirez, said he was getting out of the 
shower when a man entered the bathroom, pointed a gun at him and said: "This is 
the police. Get down on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez told authorities that one of intruders carried a police radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the impostors left in a red, full-size pickup truck and a 
small black pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not know if the assailants stole anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was disrupted when another man arrived at the house and told 
Ramirez and Zendejas to stop cooperating with police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that despite the victims' subsequent lack of cooperation, they 
would continue to investigate the incident, which they called "very 
suspicious." IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; COUNCIL TO RETAIN CITY HALL ARCHITECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite two council members' inclination to fire an architect blamed for 
delaying construction of Fillmore's new City Hall, the City Council voted 
Tuesday night to keep W. John Kulwiec on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd really like to pull the rug out from under him," Mayor Linda Brewster 
said before the meeting. "But we've spent a lot of time and money so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted unanimously to continue negotiations with Kulwiec's firm 
after the project architect vowed to do everything possible to bring the 
building in line with the budget without significant changes in design or size. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic enough they can pull it off and we don't have to start over," 
Brewster said after Johnson's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore officials hired the firm four months ago to design a $2.2-million 
City Hall, using $1.2 million in federal funds to pay for the building that 
would also house businesses displaced by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lowest bid received earlier this month came in at $3.3 million, far 
more than the city could afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewster and Campbell said before the meeting that they wanted to fire 
Kulwiec, who has received more than $100,000 from the city so far. The two 
backed off their threat after they decided it would be too costly to fire the 
Camarillo architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council decided to reject all bids and pare the project. New bids 
will be solicited for the initial phase of the project only, which the city has 
budgeted at $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Park and city office improvements will not be included in the new 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Kulwiec agreed to pare his original proposal without reducing the 
building's size, and he agreed to do the changes for free. The 
15,000-square-foot, two-story structure is to be built on Santa Clara Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had expected the new City Hall to be ready by August. City Manager 
Roy Payne said he now expects it to be finished by this time next year. PAUL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HUSBAND SENTENCED IN SLAYING OF WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard man who fatally shot his wife at a birthday party has been sentenced 
to 75 years to life in state prison, prosecutors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Castaneda, 26, was given 45 years to life in prison for murder under the 
state's "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 He also received 25 years to life for felony possession of a firearm and an 
additional five years for using the firearm, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Murphy 
said. He had two robbery convictions before being sentenced Monday by Acting 
Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda shot his wife, Mina, through the head April 2 when he returned to a 
Santa Paula birthday party after helping Anthony Castillo rob an Oxnard motel 
clerk, according to trial testimony. The victim, 25, was angry with the 
defendant because he had left the party without explanation, and she was 
wielding a baseball bat when he returned, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Murphy argued that the defendant killed his wife because she 
had humiliated him in front of Castillo, who is serving a two-year prison 
sentence for the motel holdup. At the sentencing, Castaneda declared his 
innocence, claiming Castillo murdered the victim. A jury deliberated just three 
hours before finding Castaneda guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was ever a person that the 'three strikes' law was designed for it 
was him," Murphy said. "He is dangerous and has no conscience." DWAYNE BRAY

FIRE DAMAGES HOME IN MID-TOWN VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire that had smoldered for hours exploded into flames early Tuesday, 
gutting much of a stucco house and spreading smoke across a six-block area of 
mid-town Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters arrived at 504 S. Coronado St. just after 1 a.m., they found 
the three-bedroom house engulfed in flames and thick smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Wayne Belitski said the fire had burned through interior walls 
and spread to the attic. Windows shattering from the heat let in air that 
fueled the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 The first firefighters to enter the house were forced to retreat twice because 
of flare-ups, Belitski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the engine companies had a flashover," he said. "That's when it 
becomes so hot inside that the fire rolls just below the ceiling and tries to 
get behind you." 
</P>
<P>
 After extinguishing the blaze, firefighters remained at the scene until 4 a.m. 
to secure the house and douse embers.  
</P>
<P>
 The fire was sparked by a faulty furnace in the living room floor, 
investigators said.  
</P>
<P>
 Property damage was estimated at $125,000, and contents at $35,000, Belitski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara Bartole, who rented the house from her mother, had left the residence at 
6 p.m. to drive to Orange County. Her four cats escaped unharmed through a 
small opening in the back door. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartole's mother, Barbara, said her grandfather, Soren Thygesen, helped build 
the house in 1927 but never owned it and her parents purchased it in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartole said she plans to rebuild the house. The living room, dining room, 
kitchen and a bathroom were destroyed, she said, but the bedrooms and exterior 
walls are intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a total loss," she said. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIRST INTERSTATE'S MERGER WITH LEVY BANK OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Interstate Bancorp announced Tuesday that the Federal Reserve Board has 
given it permission to proceed with the acquisition of the Bank of A. Levy, 
Ventura County's largest independent bank. 
</P>
<P>
 As completion of the Jan. 31 merger approaches, First Interstate said it plans 
to close three branches: 
</P>
<P>
 * County Center office, 5808 E. Telephone Road, Ventura. The accounts will be 
transferred to the First Interstate branch at 5751 Telephone Road, Ventura; 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousand Oaks office, 137 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks, with 
accounts to be transferred to First Interstate's branch at 180 N. Moorpark 
Road, Thousand Oaks; and 
</P>
<P>
 * Westlake office, 3815 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks, consolidating 
to First Interstate's branch at 3965 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Levy branch at 3907 Cochran St. in Simi Valley will be 
relocated to Sycamore Plaza, 2860 Cochran St., Simi Valley. The new offices are 
the former site of a HomeFed Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bank of A. Levy's 13 remaining branches will continue to operate in their 
current locations until the conversion, scheduled for April 21, said Rich 
Wyler, a spokesman for First Interstate. After that date, they will become 
First Interstate branches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three First Interstate branches in Ventura County will also be closed as a 
result of the merger, Wyler said. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate's Oxnard office at 300 W. 3rd St. will be consolidated with 
the Levy branch at 143 W. 5th St., Oxnard; First Interstate's Simi office at 
2820 Los Angeles Ave. will be consolidated with the Levy branch at 1200 Los 
Angeles Ave., Simi Valley, and First Interstate's Ventura office at 2610 E. 
Main St. will be consolidated with the Levy branch at 2499 Harbor Blvd., 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 All 350 employees at both banks who reside in Ventura County will have to 
reapply for positions at the 19 First Interstate branches that will exist after 
the merger, Wyler said. Ventura County employees will be given preference for 
the job slots, but about 100 layoffs are expected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyler would not comment on severance packages being offered to employees who 
do not stay with the company. But a source inside the company said the benefits 
range from two to eight weeks pay, depending on seniority. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TOY DRIVE SHORT AS CHRISTMAS NEARS

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Christmas just days away, the Marine Corps Toys for Tots campaign is 
9,000 toys short of its goal to provide 38,000 toys to needy children in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Staff Sgt. John Hendrix, coordinator of the effort, said the corps 
urgently needs toys for children ages 10 to 16. Hendrix added that because of 
the name of the annual toy drive, people tend to give items for very small 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys or gifts that older children would like, such as portable stereos or 
curling irons, may be dropped off by Thursday at fire stations throughout the 
county, Volt Temporary Services offices and other participating businesses. JAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 There will be a big slab of holiday ham on the tables of 180 needy families, 
thanks to a donation by San Fernando Swap Meet operator William Hannon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannon bought hams to be given to the San Fernando Police Department, which 
will in turn distribute them to economically disadvantaged families in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to call them cheerful bags," Hannon said of the gift packages that 
police will distribute for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The swap meet owner also encourages others to join in making similar donations 
through the San Fernando police. MAKI BECKER

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; THIS TIME, THE RIGHT LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Board members of the Brea-Olinda Unified School District showed appropriate 
judgment in reassigning the high school principal who failed to tell them that 
counselors had changed students' grades, apparently in violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees last month decided to make John Johnson the temporary director of 
support services for the district, a post in which he will oversee some 
personnel and handle student expulsions and suspensions. They said Johnson, who 
had been principal of Brea-Olinda High School, would hold the job at least 
until June; his assignment after that is yet to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Johnson has tenure, he could return to teaching in the district if he 
wished.  
</P>
<P>
 In making the reassignment, the board members rightly recognized that they 
could not let Johnson remain principal. Indeed, some had considered firing him, 
though that action might have prompted a legal battle.  
</P>
<P>
 In Johnson's favor was the fact that that he acted quickly last year to order 
a halt to the unauthorized changing of grades as soon as he learned of the 
practice. However, he was wrong in not immediately notifying the school board, 
which found out about the practice last spring only when a teacher complained 
after learning of the grade changes. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the trustees moved with commendable dispatch to bring in two 
outside investigators, who found that counselors at the academically respected 
school had made about 600 alterations to student records over several years.  
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, low letter grades were changed to "pass"; in other instances, 
course titles were switched or students were given double credit for classes 
they repeated in order to improve their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmful lessons were presented by this scholastic sleight of hand, which 
turned out to be far more widespread than initially thought. First of all, 
students not receiving the unearned favors got a twisted message: Why pay 
attention in class and do homework when the loafing student in the next seat 
got an equally high grade? Also injured were those whose records were altered; 
they learned they didn't have to live with the deserved grade and that 
supposedly inclusive rules easily could be skirted. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent who then was overseeing the district has retired, and the 
counselors allegedly involved in the grade changes no longer work for the 
district.  
</P>
<P>
 The Brea-Olinda school board members have correctly instituted rules changes 
to prevent future abuses. This time, a beneficial message has been sent: Good 
grades come from classroom work, reading, study and homework, not from a 
secretive stroke of a pen.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: OFFERING SHELTER VOLUNTEERS SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER GARCIA, Alexander Garcia is a Times photographer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Christmas, when the charitable spirit within each of us takes a breather 
from shopping anxiety to help those less fortunate, I wonder if sometimes, in 
our rush to volunteer during the holidays, we forget the not-as-obvious basic 
needs. This became clear to me last Thanksgiving while helping out at some food 
giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike was in his 60s but still learning how to interact with people. In the 
course of our conversation over the free meal, he pulled out tapes of religious 
radio shows from one of the weathered bags huddled around him. He found their 
spoken words to be vital guides in a complicated world. He showed me copies of 
letters he'd written. Writing letters, he said, is great for the process of 
understanding courtesy and tact. He thanked me for stopping for conversation. 
He then eagerly slipped on his portable radio earphones to learn how to improve 
his personal relations, not sensing the irony. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike had been alone sitting in his chair since the morning, an idle volunteer 
said. When I said that I was eager to start a conversation with him or someone 
else, she replied, "Why, were you put in charge of that?" 
</P>
<P>
 I wished I'd laughed. Does someone have to be? After all, who does it really 
help to go to a shelter and pour coffee or ladle some sauce on a plate? With 
the level of abilities and resourcefulness necessary to eke out a living on the 
streets, it is almost insulting to assume that the homeless or destitute can't 
or might not want to pour their own coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfeit of volunteers on Christmas or Thanksgiving is usually pretty 
irksome to those at shelters who need the same marshaling of resources the rest 
of the year. I would add to this sense of misplaced resources the number of 
volunteers who smile and wave at, or worse, glad-hand the hungry, and then 
whisk away, leaving them with a plate of food. I know it's well-intentioned, 
and these volunteers are sincerely helping out. But it still leaves a bad taste 
in my mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 At one shelter in Costa Mesa, I didn't see any volunteers socializing with the 
hungry homeless. Volunteers stood around, hungry for responsibility -- no job 
was too big or too small. Anything but have a conversation with that strange 
guy in the jacket stained the color of cranberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wants to "do good," and I'm all for it. But conversations with 
strangers don't offer the same quick and easy returns on your time as, say, 
being the person behind the counter with the big spoon. Being on the other end 
of the food line is where you might get that prized teary-eyed "thank you" from 
a grizzled homeless person in rags. Like waiting tables, the role is such that 
you won't get stuck in the complications of getting to know someone. The irony 
is that as a whole, these acts of personal satisfaction can be impersonal. 
Worse, they can flavor the stew of poverty and homelessness with paternalistic 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the most important sharing that goes on at any holiday gathering is 
not in the food but in the conversation. Who can't help but be alternately 
impressed and scared by meeting those more educated than themselves speaking 
about the unexpected circumstances under which their life spiraled downward? Or 
to be inspired by the fighting spirit that a disabled person on the street 
carries within?  
</P>
<P>
 At a holiday buffet where all races and classes are present, it is tragic that 
discourse can get lost amid the clanging of pots and pans. Learning how to 
interact with people different from ourselves is, given the fragmenting in our 
society, a basic need. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe that woman was right. Maybe volunteers do need to be assigned to 
talk to each person from the moment they walk through the door until they 
leave. When a conversation fizzles, someone with responsibility could always 
scream, "Another volunteer and piece of pie!" Because when you get to the 
simple truth, any holiday meal has to be about more that just a plate of 
turkey.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / LA CANADA TOURNAMENT; HARVARD-WESTLAKE CLAIMS TITLE, 80-50 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Collins twins of Harvard-Westlake High continue to dominate in more ways 
than one. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Wolverines continue to win by a whole bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard (9-0), ranked second in the state Division III poll, went about 
business as usual on Tuesday night, rolling to an 80-50 victory over Alemany in 
the championship game of the La Canada tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-foot-10 sophomore center Jason Collins, who was voted the tournament's 
most valuable player, scored 16 points and blocked seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarron Collins, also an all-tournament selection, finished with a game-high 23 
points to outscore his brother for the first time this season. He also recorded 
three blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both twins had 12 rebounds and a seat on the bench early in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's hard to keep up the intensity, winning like this," Jarron 
said. "But we've played some good teams and we've needed the intensity. We've 
just shut them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Ben Robbins, who scored 20 points, including six three-pointers, 
also was selected all-tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines, ranked second to Crescenta Valley in The Times' regional poll, 
hardly broke a sweat in the tournament, winning four games by an average of 28 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we keep winning like this," a jubilant Harvard Coach Greg Hilliard 
said. "It makes it easy on the coach. But our guys are just waiting to get into 
league when it really counts." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard sprinted to a 15-0 lead and held Alemany scoreless for nearly nine 
minutes. Each of the Collins had scored six points before the Indians scored. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Alemany (6-4), hardly expected to reach the final, did a good 
job of making it look close. With the help of a 12-2 run, the Indians pulled to 
within 22-14 at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outcome was never really in question. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're definitely tough," Alemany Coach Robert Webb said of the Wolverines. 
"But I wouldn't trade my 13 guys for anyone in the gym. They don't back down to 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward Adrian Pantoja led the Indians with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis 62, Notre Dame 61 -- Ray Khachatourian made a jump shot in the 
lane with two seconds to play to give the Golden Knights (6-3) third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward James Alvarez led St. Francis with with 17 points. Senior guard 
John Garcia led Notre Dame (7-2) with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada 90, Moorpark 64 -- Senior guard Charlie Petit scored 32 points and 
junior guard Danny Bush scored all of his 22 points in the second half for the 
Spartans (6-4) in the fifth-place final. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Stephen Jennings led Moorpark with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando 74, South Pasadena 66 -- Junior guard Dwayne Lucas scored five of 
his game-high 23 points in the second overtime to lead the Tigers (3-5) in a 
consolation game.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Everson, who coached Agoura High to consecutive Marmonte League girls' 
volleyball titles, has resigned to pursue coaching opportunities in Santa 
Barbara after being dissatisfied with the school's commitment to the volleyball 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Everson, a walk-on coach, led the girls' volleyball team for two seasons and 
the boys' team in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers reached the second round of the Southern Section Division I 
playoffs last month before losing to Newport Harbor, the top-ranked team in the

 "I wanted to stay and get the team into position to compete at the state level 
but I felt there was a lack of support at the school," Everson said. MICHAEL

ON BALANCE, ANTELOPES TOO STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One way or another, the Antelope Valley High basketball team will beat you. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a pitcher throwing an inside pitch to set up an outside pitch, the 
Antelopes shoot three-pointers to set up layups, and stopping either is 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley used a balanced attack to beat Royal, 79-68, in a nonleague 
game on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good little squad," Royal Coach Larry Wiksell said of the Antelopes. 
"I give them a lot of credit. . . . You see them in warm-ups and they have no 
size and they look frail, then they come out and kick your. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelopes pulled away in the first half with hot three-point shooting, 
making six of 11 in the half. They trailed, 16-9, before going on a 15-0 run 
that included three straight three-pointers. Antelope Valley (8-0) made five in 
a row in the half and took a 38-29 lead into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were going to be pretty good shooters outside, but I didn't 
think they'd be shooting three or four feet behind the line," Wiksell said. 
"You just don't teach kids to guard them that deep." 
</P>
<P>
 So Royal spread the floor to take away the three points. Antelope Valley then 
went inside. Of the Antelopes' 13 second-half field goals, 12 were layups and 
one was a six-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run a five-man game with a lot of cuts to the three-point line and the 
basket," Antelope Valley Coach Tom Mahan said. "When they defended the wing, we 
gave it to (Tony) Walker and (Joe) Glover at the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, a sophomore, was playing only his third game since joining the 
basketball team from the Southern Section Division II championship football 
team. He scored a team-high 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect him to be the player he is," Wiksell said. "I had heard about 
him, but you make a sophomore prove himself. And he sure did." 
</P>
<P>
 Glover scored 19 points, including three-of-five shooting from three-point 
range. He was eight for eight from the free-throw line in the fourth quarter. 
Anthony Pruitt added 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal (7-3) was led by sophomore Ryan Nielsen's 25 points.

 SPORT: Basketball 
</P>
<P>
 YEAR: Senior 
</P>
<P>
 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Jacobsen, a 6-foot-4 forward who has signed with 
University of San Diego, is a big reason why Crescenta Valley is 9-0 and ranked 
ninth in the state by Cal-Hi Sports. Jacobsen averaged 21 points and 7.4 
rebounds as Crescenta Valley, fourth in the Pacific League, advanced to the 
Southern Section Division I-AA final last season. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Jacobsen was selected most valuable player of the Crescenta 
Valley tournament after averaging 25.7 points over four games as the Falcons 
won the tournament title. Jacobsen scored 29 points against San Gabriel, 23 
against Poly and a season-high 33 against Blair. He scored 18 in the title 
game, a 76-62 victory over Bellflower.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / LAS VEGAS HOLIDAY CLASSIC; NEW HERO BAILS OUT MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei learned some lessons, or so the Monarchs hope. 
</P>
<P>
 They probably can not continue much further as a three-man show, at least not 
in the Reebok Holiday Prep Classic. They picked up this knowledge relatively 
cheap, sweating out a 49-48 victory over Federal Way (Wash.) Decatur Tuesday in 
a third-round game at Durango High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Decatur pushed the Monarchs by denying opportunities to the Shaun 
Jackson-Schea Cotton-Clay McKnight triumvirate. They were not going to beat the 
Gators, who dared other Monarchs to be a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Mike Waugh accepted the role. Waugh, a 6-foot-1 senior forward, sank 
a 15-foot baseline jumper for a 47-43 lead with 26 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton made two free throws with 17 seconds left, but it was not until he 
received an inbounds pass with 1.2 seconds remaining that the Monarchs were 
assured of being in today's quarterfinal against Louisville Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
 Decatur (5-3) had the ability and the scheme to make things difficult for 
Cotton, Jackson and McKnight. They got their points but found the going 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to be constantly aware of their big three," Decatur Coach Ed Boyce 
said. "Defense was our only shot." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Gators had a good one. Andre Pleasant, who scored 19 points, hit a 
jumper to give them a 41-40 lead with 4 minutes 22 seconds left. Moments later, 
Quincy Wilder, who scored 17 points, had a steal and a layup to tie the score, 
43-43. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kerry Bellessa missed a three-pointer and things began going Mater Dei's 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson drove for a layup to give the Monarchs a 45-43 lead. He tried again on 
the next possession but was triple-teamed. He spotted Waugh in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured we were on a roll, so why not shoot?" Waugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Gary McKnight: "I went no, no, no . . . way to go Waugh." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the second basket for Waugh, who had four points. It got Mater Dei 
out of a sticky situation, one it didn't expect to be in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (9-0), who breezed through the first two rounds, jumped to an 
11-2 lead. But they found out pretty quick this wasn't going to be another 
highlight show. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight couldn't shake loose for three-point shots. He had made 12 of 23 
through two games, but was two of seven against Decatur.

 Passengers on a recent flight from Los Angeles to Chicago with the Cal State 
Northridge men's basketball team were served by the airline industry's tallest 
makeshift flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge basketball players Peter Micelli, Shane O'Doherty, Tom Samson and 
Eric Gray came to the rescue of a shorthanded crew by serving drinks and 
picking up trash on the four-hour leg of the team's trip to Ohio for games 
against Cincinnati and Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a way to pass the time," said Micelli, a 6-foot-8 forward. "You have 
to keep your mind on something else because, God knows, 6-foot-8 and 6-foot-11 
don't fit well in coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one knee in the aisle and the other in the seat next to me." Occupying 
that seat: Samson, who is 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar rescue act a few years ago by former player Brian Kilian ignited a 
lengthy romance with one of the attendants. However, one player's experience 
this time around wasn't entirely positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know those screens that hang down in the middle of the aisles? I must 
have bumped my head on those about 20 times," said O'Doherty, who, at 6-11, is 
the tallest Matador. 
</P>
<P>
 Team player: It won't go down as one of the greatest moves Davis Delmatoff 
ever made, but Valley College football Coach Jim Fenwick said he never heard a 
word of complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmatoff, the former Hart High and Pierce quarterback, saw limited action at 
Valley this season because the Monarchs had record-setting Jim Arellanes at the 
position. Delmatoff had passed for 1,961 yards and nine touchdowns at Pierce in 
1993 but transferred to Valley after the season.  
</P>
<P>
 Talk about bad timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, a transfer from Northern Arizona, showed up at Valley about the 
same time as Delmatoff.  
</P>
<P>
 He won the starting job and went on to set school single-season and career 
records with 3,909 yards passing and tied the Valley career mark with 30 
touchdowns. He also established a state single-game record with 639 yards 
passing against Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmatoff this fall was 25 of 49 for 349 yards and two touchdowns. Someone 
else might have even quit but not Delmatoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody will ever know how valuable that guy was to us because of his 
attitude," said Fenwick, who guided the Monarchs to a 10-1 season, including a 
36-28 victory over Rancho Santiago in the Orange County Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting 'em halfway: The eyes of Texas were on the Providence High boys' 
basketball team this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence Coach Paul Sutton took the team to the Lone Star State, in part so 
he could play a game against Las Cruces (N.M.) Mesilla Valley Christian, which 
is coached by one of his cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams met in El Paso and played the game there. Providence then played in 
the two-day Van Horn tournament in tiny Van Horn -- "a one-horse town about an 
hour and a half outside of El Paso," Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence split the first two games Monday, against Tornillo and Fabens, to 
earn a berth against Fort Hancock on Tuesday in the consolation championship. 
The Pioneers won, 47-36. 
</P>
<P>
 Quirky stat: Sutton's team shot 79 free throws in the first two games. It 
outscored Tornillo, 25-3, from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we didn't get homered," Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the crease: Senior guard Brandon Creason of Oak Park High, who led 
Ventura County players in assists last season, will be sidelined until 
mid-January because of a broken right arm suffered Dec. 9 against Thousand 
Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Creason, a second-team All-Southern Section selection last season, was 
averaging 16 points through five games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really weird," Coach Rob Hall said. "I've watched it on film five 
times. He didn't even hit the ground. He just got his arm trapped between two 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park, projected to be among the county's best teams, has sputtered out of 
the gate. The Eagles are 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Glum alums: A group of former Chatsworth soccer players recently proved that 
while you can go home again, you might not be able to keep up with those who 
took your place. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth's third annual alumni game was staged last week and the current 
team whitewashed their elders, 4-0, in a match shortened to two 30-minute 
halves at the alumni's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good workout for the varsity; the alumni give them real good 
competition," said Coach Jack Sidwell, who coached City Section championship 
squads from 1988-92. Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park boys' basketball Coach Steve Johnson, on 5-foot-7 perimeter 
bomber Brent Bush: "If he hits his first one, look out. He's becoming almost a 
cult hero with his fellow students. He's a little guy out there trying to slay 
the dragon." 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball fever: Agoura boys' basketball Coach Kevin Pasky, on missing his 
team's league opener because of a stomach virus: "I had to be within 10 steps 
of the bathroom for 24 hours." Registrar

<P>
 The College of the Canyons golf team will hold its annual fund-raiser 
tournament at Valencia Country Club again this year -- but there's a new 
wrinkle: There will be two tournaments, on Feb. 6 and Feb. 27. It is a scramble 
format.

 Scrooge (actor Hal Landon Jr.) wasn't the only one thinking about the meaning 
of generosity at a recent performance of "A Christmas Carol" at South Coast 
Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon receiving a crystal sculpture from SCR producing director David Emmes in 
recognition of his support of the arts, Kazuo Sonoguchi -- president of Mazda 
Motors of America, Inc. -- told guests at a post-performance reception: "This 
play and especially the character of Scrooge have special meaning for me. When 
I was with Mazda in Detroit, my subordinates said I was demanding and greedy. 
They called me Scrooge! Then I came to Orange County and was transformed." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the performance, guests at the Sonoguchi tribute, which was sponsored 
by SCR and the Japan Business Assn., mingled al fresco at a reception catered 
by the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests also included SCR board president Hal Schulz; Ryozo Yanagiuchi, vice 
president of Matsushita Electric Corp. of America and chairman of the Japan 
Business Assn.; Jim Clough, assistant vice president of Pillsbury Madison & 
Sutro (who helped organize the tribute with partner Henry Ota) and Ron Hartwig, 
executive vice president and general manager of Hill & Knowlton. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Hal Landon Jr.: The SCR founding actor and his wife, Janice, will 
join theater buffs beginning Tuesday for a one-week tour of London that will 
include orchestra seats to four shows and excursions to Stratford-Upon-Avon and 
Windsor Castle. The group will ring in the New Year from Trafalgar Square.

 Opera Pacific boat parade bash: Three support groups of Opera Pacific -- the 
Gourmet Diners' Guild, the Opera League of Laguna Beach and the South Coast 
Guild -- joined forces at Bistro 201 (now by the bay in Newport Beach, instead 
of near the freeway in Irvine) on Saturday for the opening of the Newport Beach 
Christmas boat parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner choices at the $80-per-person bash were salmon in potato crust served 
up with mushrooms, artichokes and asparagus or rack of lamb presented on 
polenta with rosemary and mint au jus. 
</P>
<P>
 When guests weren't licking their fingers, they were viewing one of the area's 
prettiest holiday parades or dancing to the big band sounds of Tracy Wells and 
his orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Event co-chairs were Joan Simonoff, Liz Sliepka, Carolyn Klein and Barbara 
Roberts. Underwriters were Jim Baker, Connie Morthland, Colin Slim and Eugenia 
Thompson.

Philharmonic Society, the event is being supported by 
bachelor/philanthropist-about-town Mark Johnson of Tustin and mega-givers Judie 
and George Argyros of Newport Beach.

</P>
<P>
 Included in the invitation are grand prize drawing tickets that can be

DANA PARSONS: FULL-TIME, STAY-AT-HOME DAD SAYS FATHERS NEED RESPECT, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hogan Hilling asks a good question. 
</P>
<P>
 What is fatherly love, exactly? We have a culturally shared understanding of 
"motherly love," but fatherly love? The image does not leap as easily to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilling wants to change that, to which I say, "Good luck," believing that the 
only obstacle in his way is the entire recorded span of human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilling is not nearly as pessimistic. As proof, he offers up the tale of Hogan 
and the Moms at the Doughnut Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, having ended a break-even business and unsure of his 
next step, Hilling became a full-time, stay-at-home father, while his wife, 
Tina, became the sole financial provider in her job as a speech therapist with 
the Irvine Unified School District. The Hillings had two sons then and have 
since added a third. Complicating Hilling's task is that 5-year-old Wesley has 
Angelman's Syndrome, a severely disabling developmental condition. 
</P>
<P>
 At home alone in Irvine with the boys, Hilling dived into being a father, 
having grown up without one himself. And so, one morning he was out with Wesley 
and came upon some moms having coffee outside a doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 He was familiar with the turf: Mom's Turf. Yes, he was the stay-at-home 
caretaker for his children, just as they, but he wasn't a mom. He wondered 
whether it would be like other situations, such as at PTA or other parent 
groups, where if he showed up alone with the kids, the women who dominated the 
attendance left him feeling, well, like a man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is any different than women coming into a men's club," he 
says. "I felt like I was prey to a group of lionesses that were surrounding me. 
Women are shocked (to see a man at something like a school function), so it 
created some very uncomfortable situations, and I see this happening to other 
fathers who come to PTA meetings or push strollers or carry diaper bags. You 
feel somewhat embarrassed, because it's abnormal. People notice it, and mothers 
haven't found ways to help men feel comfortable about fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened is that there's a kind of gender war going on out there. 
You've got mothers saying, 'Look at all the deadbeat dads' and there's nothing 
but negative comments. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Hilling would sit in the midst of the den, whether at school or outside 
the doughnut shop, and feel like he had to prove himself as a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I was frustrated and had a lot of resentment," he says. "I find 
humor in it now. It was more of a look from them, a feeling. Sometimes I think 
it was more so whenever I tried to make comments about the way I nurtured the 
boys, because if I did it differently than they did, they assumed I was wrong 
and they saw no value in what I had to say. I felt like as much as they said 
they wanted their husbands to participate, another part of them said, 'Hey, 
this is our turf, we don't want you here.' I was kind of disturbed because I 
felt like I was being pulled from both ends." 
</P>
<P>
 The happy conclusion to the doughnut shop group is that he is a welcome member 
and it's part of his routine. At first, they called him "Mr. Mom" when they saw 
him coming, "but I straightened that out," Hilling says. "I told them I didn't 
want to be Mom. I want to be a Dad. I don't want to impose on their nurturing 
territory. I want to create my own identity. So I asked them to call me 'Mr. 
Dad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He learned they didn't just talk about "mom stuff" or "women stuff." They 
discuss whatever, but when the conversation inevitably turns to children, 
Hilling has found a much-needed haven for discussing his successes and 
challenges with his three boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilling, 39, has become passionate about fathering, which to him means how 
men, women and society can all contribute to helping men do it better. In a 
society where many fathers don't even know what subjects their children are 
taking, much less their grades, it's a mighty task. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't enough space here to talk about societal or self-imposed pressures 
on men to succeed in business. Too often, they forfeit fatherhood because of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Hilling what he's learned from his contact with mothers. "What I 
learned from the lionesses' den was a respect for motherhood and respect for my 
wife. Part of it was the virtue of the task itself (of raising children), but 
it also was that part of me was trying to create some value for what I was 
doing as a father. I was being very selfish in thinking my family needed to 
respect me first, when it was the other way around. I needed to show respect 
for my wife and children before I could expect to be respected as a valued 
member of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind their bravado, many men want to be better fathers, Hilling says. They 
just need help. So while he gets miffed at men who don't back up their claims 
to wanting to be better fathers, he has a suggestion for wives, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me put it this way," he says, "I think as much as women have asked 
fathers to understand motherhood, they haven't done enough to understand 
fatherhood." 
</P>

ARSON PROBED IN LONG BEACH BLAST; DESTRUCTION: GAS LINE WAS DELIBERATELY 
DISCONNECTED, AUTHORITIES SAY. INVESTIGATORS SEEK TO QUESTION A RESIDENT OF 
BUILDING WHO WAS HOSPITALIZED BY THE EXPLOSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A devastating blast that tore through a North Long Beach neighborhood -- 
destroying one building, shattering two blocks of storefront windows and 
injuring nearly 20 people -- was deliberately caused by someone who 
disconnected a gas line in an apartment building, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach fire officials, combing the wreckage of the Atlantic Avenue 
building leveled by the Monday night blast, said they discovered a detached 
steel tube leading from a kitchen gas outlet to a stove. The shut-off valve was 
still on when investigators arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 While they did not know what caused the gas to ignite, Long Beach fire 
investigators were treating the incident as arson. "Clearly, somebody had 
twisted (the line) off," said Deputy Fire Chief Anthon L. Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department arson investigators were focusing their probe on Terry Martin, 
a 35-year-old unemployed man who lived in the upstairs apartment where the 
severed gas line was found. Martin suffered second- and third-degree burns over 
a quarter of his body and was in fair condition Tuesday at County-USC Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen others were injured in the blast, including a 2 1/2-year-old child 
who required three stitches on her cheek.  
</P>
<P>
 The blast damaged 22 buildings, shattering windows for a block on both sides 
of the two-unit apartment building, which also housed a photography studio. 
Long Beach officials estimated the cost of the destruction at $1.5 million to 
$2 million. The force of the explosion could be felt for miles and heard as far 
away as Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they had not ruled out the possibility that someone had 
caused the explosion as an act of attempted murder, but "we don't think that's 
what happened," said Fire Investigator Dave Kean. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Aimers, who lived below Martin and emerged from the blast unscathed, 
suggested that the incident may have been a suicide attempt by Martin, whom 
Aimers said was out of work and spoke of killing himself just last week. 
Authorities declined to speculate on the matter and arson investigators were 
planning to interview Martin in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Gas Department officials estimated that gas had been flowing into 
the upstairs unit for at least three minutes before the explosion. They also 
did not know what caused the gas to ignite. However, "for an explosion of this 
size, there had to be a considerable amount of gas in the room," said John L. 
Williams, the Gas Department's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimers had just sat down to watch the 6 p.m. "Monday Night Football" telecast 
when the ceiling over him came crashing down. He crawled through a mountain of 
rubble, wearing only his underwear and a T-shirt. Aimers, an electrical 
construction mechanic, suffered only a few bumps on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, he watched as demolition crews tore down what remained of his tiny 
Atlantic Avenue apartment and recalled the harrowing moments as the floor began 
to shake and the walls collapsed around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden blackness and rumbling," said a visibly shaken Aimers, 34. "I 
was breathing pure dust. I looked up and saw the ceiling two feet above my 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the injured were in an adjacent grocery store or walking along the 
street at the time of the blast. One woman was driving by when the explosion 
sent her car careening into a light pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Families who lived in the four-unit apartment building next door to the 
building occupied by Aimers and Martin spent Monday night at a motel a few 
doors away, courtesy of the Red Cross. It was unclear when -- or if -- they 
would be allowed back into their units, which they fled with only the clothes 
on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several were still shaken Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Jones, 17, was showing visitors from the Red Cross the cuts on his 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Aimers, Jones was watching the football telecast when the explosion 
ripped through the ground-floor apartment he shares with his mother, directly 
across from Aimers' apartment. He ran into his bedroom, only to find the 
wrought-iron bars outside his window blown into his room, where they landed on 
his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I saw was black smoke everywhere," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 He immediately telephoned his mother. "He called up crying, 'Mommy, mommy, the 
house blew up. There was a bomb,' " Terri Jones, 55, said.

COUNCIL LIFTS BAN ON TUNNELING IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council removed the last obstacle Tuesday for tunneling 
to resume beneath Hollywood Boulevard, ending a four-month construction ban 
ordered after sinkage was discovered along the famed thoroughfare during the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved a set of safety recommendations -- including 
daily city inspections -- that will allow the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority to resume boring the northern tunnel of the Red Line pair of tunnels 
after Jan. 1. Work was suspended in August after buildings and sidewalks sank 
up to 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who represents Hollywood, voted with the rest of 
the council to approve the plan but warned the MTA that the city would keep a 
sharp lookout for any new problems or lapses in construction techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assure you that my staff will be there every day and at least one member of 
the city's engineering family will be there every day," Goldberg said. "I want 
someone there watching." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's approval, although technically not required, was crucial for the 
MTA to continue construction. It came after a lengthy city task force report 
that advised extensive grouting to protect historic landmarks such as Mann's 
Chinese Theater and the Roosevelt Hotel. The city also hired task force member 
and engineer Gerald Lehmer to ensure that grouting is conducted immediately if 
further settlement occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we feel like we can go ahead. This is definitely a milestone," MTA 
spokesman Bill Heard said of the council vote, adding that it would have been 
"foolhardy to proceed without city approval." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tunneling is scheduled to resume on the northern tunnel soon after Jan. 1, 
with work on the southern tunnel to follow. The MTA expects digging beneath 
Hollywood to be completed in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Resumption of work on the troubled project will cap four months of tumult for 
what is the nation's most expensive subway system per mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of subsidence along Hollywood Boulevard prompted the evacuation 
of dozens of residents and the rescue of several sidewalk stars along the Walk 
of Fame. It also brought the stunning announcement in October that the federal 
government would withhold funds for Red Line extensions to the Eastside and the 
San Fernando Valley until the MTA showed it could manage the project 
competently. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the Federal Transit Administration relented after MTA chief 
Franklin E. White shook up construction management and approved engineering 
changes designed to prevent a repeat of the problems that have plagued the 
multibillion-dollar project. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsibility for quality and safety control was shifted in-house and taken 
from a widely criticized private firm. Workers grouted the tunnels and 
installed steel beams to stabilize the two tunnels. Revamped construction plans 
also require the use of steel struts inside the tunnels instead of the wooden 
wedges blamed by outside engineers for some of the ground sinkage. 
</P>
<P>
 White agreed to the added conditions, including the daily city inspections, 
before the City Council on Tuesday. The more stringent construction guidelines 
did not appease Chris Shabel, president of the Hollywood Stakeholders, a 
coalition of residential and merchant groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I heard about the report gives me no reassurance whatsoever," Shabel 
said. "I don't see MTA as having altered one little bit. They're still the 
same. They're still being slipshod." 
</P>
<P>
 She contended that the city task force had not done an adequate job of 
scrutinizing the tunneling problems and said buildings and sidewalks continue 
to sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still dropping. We will now monitor every crack, everything that goes 
on on the boulevard."

IDLED SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS TO BE RETRAINED AS TEACHERS; EDUCATION: U.S. TO 
ANNOUNCE $5-MILLION PROGRAM FOR LAID-OFF PERSONNEL. THEY WOULD GIVE MATH AND 
SCIENCE LESSONS IN INNER-CITY SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a program conceived as a national model, the U.S. Department of Defense 
will announce today a new $5-million program to retrain laid-off scientists and 
engineers for teaching careers in Los Angeles' inner-city high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 20 "teaching fellows" will be selected in the coming months and by 
summer should begin their studies -- a specially tailored combination of 
classwork out of Cal State Long Beach and hands-on experience with mentor 
teachers in Los Angeles Unified School District. The trainees are expected to 
earn full credentials in time to start working as teachers in the fall of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some displaced defense industry workers have turned to teaching, 
occasionally supported by grants and programs, this is the largest commitment 
to date of government funding aimed at retraining for teaching careers in a 
specific district. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope that the Scientists to Teachers Project will provide the seed 
for widespread improvement of math and science instruction in Los Angeles' 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot more important than just producing some more teachers," said 
Bruce M. Alberts, chairman of the National Research Council, a private 
nonprofit organization that will coordinate the program. "We hope (the fellows) 
will become leaders and advocates for science and math reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles was selected for the project because of its ready supply of 
laid-off aerospace, defense industry and military workers, because of the 
diversity of its student population and because the dearth of math and science 
teachers virtually ensures employment, Alberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will cover all educational costs for the fellows and pay a $22,000 
stipend during the instruction period. There is no requirement that the new 
teachers remain in the inner city. But the program will provide professional 
development and mentor activities for two additional years for those who stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cal State Long Beach will be the site of the first year's program, it 
may spread to other colleges and universities next year, when another 40 
fellows are expected to be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified administrators greeted the project with enthusiasm and 
applauded the decision to focus on inner-city schools, where they find it 
especially difficult to recruit and retain well-qualified teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major obstacles that we have is that there are not enough trained 
teachers in mathematics and sciences," said Assistant Supt. Amelia McKenna. 
"Any avenue that will help us bring to the district people with this expertise 
is very attractive to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Although strong in their knowledge of science and math, what the former 
professionals may lack is the ability to work well with teen-agers, McKenna 
said. To address that, project coordinators said they will look closely for 
applicants with attributes that might help the fellows thrive in public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unquestionably they are very capable people, but they are not accustomed to 
the behavior of 10th-graders," said Bob DeVries, director of a similar program 
at Cal State Dominguez Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 DeVries' program began with financial support from four defense firms but is 
now funded through the Department of Labor as one of several options offered 
laid-off aerospace workers. Another national program, Troops to Teachers, 
focuses on getting retired military personnel into classrooms. Yet another 
provides educational support for ex-employees of the Lawrence Livermore 
Laboratories in Northern California who want to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Gray, a Caltech chemistry professor and chairman of the Scientists to 
Teachers advisory board, said the Los Angeles project should be viewed as an 
experiment, not a well-researched solution.

BOARD OKS REALIGNMENT OF LAPD, ADDS CAR PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday approved an ambitious realignment 
of the Police Department that will redraw boundaries of the LAPD's 18 
divisions, add 16 cars to patrol areas across the city and pave the way for the 
eventual addition of two new police stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's unanimous vote ends a sometimes contentious debate in which 
some residents have complained about the shifting boundaries and their possible 
effect on police services. In addition, some City Council members have 
expressed concern about an aspect of the plan that will add six new basic 
police car areas to the San Fernando Valley while adding only two to the 
department's West Bureau and four each to its South and Central bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. complained in a letter to Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams that his area was being slighted in favor of the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 20 years without such a realignment, I would think that the cars would 
be better suited where crime occurs," Svorinich wrote. "The current draft of 
the department's report, however, leads me to consider that other factors 
influenced the allocation of limited city resources." 
</P>
<P>
 But LAPD Cmdr. Garrett Zimmon, who oversaw the realignment, said the decision 
to send more of the new cars to the Valley reflects the extraordinary growth in 
that area over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past 20 years, the demographics and community sizes (throughout the 
city) have changed considerably, particularly in the San Fernando Valley," 
Zimmon told police commissioners Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The remapping plan represents a key element in the department's efforts to 
reform itself into a more community-oriented style of policing. Backed by a 
federal grant, the LAPD intends to add a dozen so-called "basic car areas," 
communities that are patrolled by a senior lead officer who is responsible for 
building ties to residents and neighborhood groups in his or her area. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the goals of the realignment are increasing the visibility of officers 
in the field and allowing senior lead officers to work as small and cohesive a 
community as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of remapping the entire city, Zimmon said police officials 
discovered that some of the LAPD's areas are vastly overworked compared to 
others. Particularly overextended, he said, are some areas of the Valley and 
the Rampart police station, located at the city's heart and home to some of its 
most volatile areas. 
</P>
<P>
 To lighten the load on the officers at the Rampart station, the realignment 
will carve out some of its area and will add patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime in the future, Zimmon added, the department will need to add two more 
police stations, one in the central Valley and another in the Mid-Wilshire 
area. Preliminary planning for those stations already is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 As news of the proposed realignment has reached community activists, some have 
been angered because they have felt that the process lacked sufficient 
community input. Commissioners chided the Police Department for that Tuesday, 
suggesting that officials take greater care in the future to involve community 
representatives in any large-scale undertakings such as redrawing police 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams acknowledged that the plan had caused "some significant concern in 
certain parts of the community," but said he believed that the result was the 
best possible outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a perfect plan, but there's nothing more we can do," he said. 
"With the resources we have, this is the best we can do."

STATE CONFIRMS DEAL TO BUY UNIVERSITY SITE; EDUCATION: IT WILL BE YEARS BEFORE 
STUDENTS CAN ATTEND CLASSES AT 260-ACRE LOCALE NEAR CAMARILLO. CONSTRUCTION 
FUNDING IS UP TO VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three decades after the search first began for a university site in Ventura 
County, state officials Tuesday confirmed an agreement to purchase 260 acres of 
farmland near Camarillo for Cal State Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will be years before students can attend classes at what state planners 
hope will become Ventura County's first public four-year college. And funding 
for construction depends on California voters approving a bond for higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after word leaked out about the settlement, the state chancellor's 
office formally announced that negotiations ended successfully between Cal 
State and Mohseni Ranch, the larger of two property owners who for years 
resisted selling the lemon groves. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which voids a condemnation lawsuit under way, calls for the 
state to purchase two agricultural parcels in the greenbelt between Camarillo 
and Oxnard, said David Leveille, Cal State director of institutional relations, 
who made the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state university system has set aside enough money to buy the 
acreage, Leveille said, very little has been saved to design and build the 
campus, which he said would serve 15,000 full-time students when it is 
completed in 20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not have the financial resources to construct anything," said Leveille, 
who said building the campus would depend largely on whether voters approve a 
higher education bond in the 1996 California primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County is one of the counties where the approval rate was worse" than 
the statewide average in the last bond election, he said, adding that Cal State 
would pursue private contributions from local businesses to support the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce M. Kennedy, director of the Cal State Northridge extension campus in 
Ventura, said she was thankful that county and state leaders never gave up on 
the latest site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a glorious day for Ventura County residents," said Kennedy, who has 
fought for years to site a permanent campus. "We're in a position now that we 
haven't been in for 20 years, so this is a major advancement." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials bought 425 acres near Somis in 1969 to build a university, 
but sold the land seven years later when the project stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Leveille and other officials declined to give the sales price for the 260 
acres near Camarillo until escrow closes some time before April on the Mohseni 
Ranch and Sakioka Farms properties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the land is appraised at roughly $5 million, according to Daryl Brown, 
Ventura County's chief deputy assessor. Transferring the private property to 
the state will take about $50,000 a year out of county tax revenues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's purchase price includes court costs, attorney fees, appraisal and 
engineering costs, and any potential severance damages or claims arising from 
the now-moot condemnation process, said Marsha S. Miller, the deputy attorney 
general handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 County work crews have nearly completed a series of drainage improvements in 
the area to prevent the farmland from flooding in heavy rains, Public Works 
Director Arthur E. Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be done long before (the state) does anything on the site," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, made final late last week after a series of intensive negotiations, 
nearly fell through when property owner Michael Mohseni held out for a higher 
selling price, Leveille said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Mohseni as a business person wanted to get the best return on his 
investment that he could get from the state," Leveille said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leveille said he was prepared to walk away from the transaction and start 
"from ground zero" if the last offer was not accepted. "We were prepared to 
withdraw from that project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohseni said Monday that he accepted the offer because he did not want to be 
responsible for delaying the campus any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Jack O'Connell, D-Carpinteria, said Tuesday that he hopes that Cal 
State Ventura will be operating in time for his daughter, now in the third 
grade, to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that's a viable option not only for Jennifer O'Connell, but for all 
the other Jennifer O'Connells around the county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Leveille, O'Connell said the next important step in building the campus 
would be to garner popular support for a higher education bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do a better job of educating the community about the benefits of 
having a CSU here," O'Connell said. "We need to make a case to the CSU 
hierarchy that this is a priority."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY'S 
OLDEST ANGLO-JEWISH WEEKLY SOLD TO AUSTRALIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles' fourth-oldest newspaper, the 97-year-old B'nai B'rith Messenger, 
has been sold and major changes are planned for the weekly, its new owners 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's oldest Anglo-Jewish weekly was purchased by a group of Australian 
investors headed by real estate developer Joe Bobker. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper was sold to Bobker by outgoing executive editor Rabbi Yale Butler 
and his Pittsburgh-based family. The Butlers had run the paper for 12 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The new owners said they intend to debut a new format with the Jan. 13 issue 
that will have more of a magazine appearance, with a broader range of news and 
features.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Butler, the newspaper had come to be regarded as the "Orthodox 
newspaper" in Los Angeles, which with a Jewish population of nearly 
three-quarters of a million is the world's second-largest urban Jewish 
community after New York. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, the Messenger was the dominant Jewish paper in Los Angeles. 
But in the last two decades, it saw increased competition from Heritage, 
published by Herb Brin, and Israel Today, published by Phil Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest and most widely distributed Anglo-Jewish newspaper is the Jewish 
Journal, published for six years with subsidies from the Los Angeles Jewish 
Federation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FATHER 
CONVICTED IN DEATH OF 3-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles man was convicted of second-degree murder Tuesday in the death 
of his infant daughter, who he claimed was killed in retaliation for his 
testimony in a gang murder case.  
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Bullock, 21, slammed down his fist and lowered his head when the 
jury's verdict was read.Superior Court Judge Mary Ann Murphy scheduled 
sentencing for Jan. 31. Bullock faces a maximum of 15 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 His 3-month-old daughter, Shantez, was killed Oct. 30, 1993. The baby suffered 
severe head injuries and may have been suffocated, Deputy Medical Examiner 
Eugene Carpenter testified during the trial. He said the baby's body showed 
signs of previous abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 A police report said Bullock told investigators that out of fear and anxiety, 
he had accidentally slammed her with considerable force into a wall. But during 
the trial, he testified that gang members had killed her.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MENENDEZ PROSECUTORS 
SEEK SHARP LIMITS ON DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signaling their intent to play hardball, prosecutors in the second Menendez 
murder trial said Tuesday that they do not believe the issue of abuse is 
relevant to the case and asked for sharp limits on defense testimony.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David P. Conn said prosecutors no longer believe that the 
concept of "battered-child syndrome," under which most of the defense in the 
first trial was presented, provided a legal basis to allow testimony or other 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, Conn said, 32 of the 56 witnesses who appeared for the defense 
should be excluded from the second trial. And, he said, the testimony of 
defense experts ought to be limited as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Leslie Abramson called the request "the most outrageous 
motion I've ever encountered as a defense attorney." Van Nuys Superior Court 
Judge Stanley M. Weisberg said he needed time to study it and set a Feb. 28 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez, 24, and Lyle Menendez, 26, remain in County Jail without bail. 
Their second trial is set for March 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial ended in January with separate juries deadlocked between 
murder and lesser manslaughter charges in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings 
of the brothers' parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez.  
</P>
<P>
 The brothers admit to the slayings. Prosecutors contend that the brothers 
killed out of hatred and greed. But the brothers say they lashed out in fear 
after years of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, the defense case began with anecdotes from teachers, 
coaches, relatives and friends about life in the Menendez household. The 
defense put on those 32 witnesses in a bid to lay the framework for the 
climactic testimony of the brothers.  
</P>
<P>
 A half-dozen mental health experts followed, saying that a lifetime of fear 
had left the brothers prone to impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors at the first trial -- led by Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Bozanich -- 
ridiculed the testimony of the mental health experts and opted not to raise a 
wholesale objection to the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 That tactic was based on a 1991 state law that authorized expert testimony in 
cases involving a claim of "battered-woman syndrome." Bozanich reasoned that it 
would be fruitless to object in a case in which sons were claiming parental 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Conn took over for Bozanich after the first trial, and he was careful Tuesday 
not to criticize her. But in urging Weisberg to exclude the first 32 witnesses, 
he said the 1991 law applies to testimony from expert witnesses, not teachers 
and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson, who represents Erik Menendez, countered that the prosecution's view 
of the evidence would unfairly cut the guts out of the defense case. Deputy 
Public Defender Charles Gessler, who represents Lyle Menendez, said he also 
opposes the prosecution request. ALAN ABRAHAMSON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: RELIGIOUS LEADERS PLAN 
DRIVE TO FIGHT CUTS IN FOOD PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local religious leaders said Tuesday that they will be pooling their resources 
nationwide to fight GOP efforts to make deep cuts in nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At a conference sponsored by the Southern California Interfaith Hunger 
Coalition, religious leaders said the moves by Republicans would increase the 
ballooning number of hungry people, mostly children, in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few weeks, the local leaders say they will draft their own plan to 
oppose the GOP proposal and will work with state and national officials. 
Earlier in the day, charity officials met in Washington to announce similar 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Republicans, led by incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), have proposed dismantling the nation's federal nutrition network. 
Under the House Republicans' "contract with America," the federal government 
would give up responsibility for the programs and have states administer them. 
The GOP's proposed Personal Responsibility Act would combine all nutrition 
programs into one and cut spending by 5%. The speakers in Los Angeles agreed 
that the GOP needs to make cuts in government, but said programs to serve the 
hungry should be retained. 
</P>
<P>
 "How will we be a strong nation in the future when up to 20% of our future 
work force will have been malnourished in childhood?" asked the Rev. Davida Foy 
Crabtree of the United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders said Gingrich's plan to rely more on private resources and 
charities to pick up the slack after the cuts will not work. The Rt. Rev. 
Frederick H. Borsch, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, told the 
crowd: "I've been out in the streets and the charities just can't do it (feed 
the hungry) all by themselves." FRANK B. WILLIAMS

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LITTLEROCK; BOY, 10, 
FINDS HANDGUN IN ABANDONED CAR, KILLS SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-year-old Littlerock boy accidentally shot and killed himself Tuesday 
while playing with a handgun he found in an abandoned car near his mother's 
trailer, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2:15 p.m. shooting occurred in the 37800 block of 90th Street East as the 
boy played with a .38-caliber gun in the living room of his mother's trailer, 
said Deputy Britta Tubbs.The boy, whose name was not released, died of a single 
gunshot wound to the head, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy and his 12-year-old brother were visiting an aunt a few blocks from 
their home when the younger boy found the gun in an abandoned car and did not 
tell his brother. When the boys returned home, the older brother left the 
10-year-old alone while he used the bathroom. He heard a shot and "found the 
other brother lying on the sofa . . . with the gun at his side," Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the boys may have been having problems with other youths 
from a park and speculated that the younger brother may have wanted the firearm 
as a form of protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the family said the boys' mother was in shock. "The mother is 
taking it very badly. It is very hard for her," said neighbor Sarphine 
Phillips. "She said the boy found the gun under a car but it is all still a 
mystery."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; JURORS DEADLOCK 
11-1 FOR DEATH PENALTY IN 2 MURDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mistrial was declared Tuesday in the penalty phase of the murder trial of 
Sergio Nelson, 20, a La Verne man convicted of killing two Target store 
co-workers in La Verne last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pomona Superior Court jury Dec. 13 found Nelson guilty of first-degree 
murder in the Oct. 2, 1993, deaths of Robin Shirley, 23, and Lee Thompson, 22, 
both of Pomona.The prosecutor argued that Nelson, who had worked at the store 
for a little more than a year, was distraught because he had been passed over 
for a promotion given to Shirley. 
</P>
<P>
 After conclusion of the penalty phase of the trial, the jury was to decide 
whether to recommend the death penalty or life in prison without the 
possibility of parole. Jurors said they deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of the 
death penalty and a mistrial was declared. A Jan. 10 hearing has been scheduled 
to decide if a second jury should be convened to rehear the penalty phase.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; SANTA VISITS CANCER WARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa had to leave the reindeer behind and latch onto a 100-foot extension 
ladder to do his bit. But the kids on the cancer ward at Children's Hospital of 
Orange County didn't mind that he was on a ladder outside the building and not 
on his sleigh with Rudolph leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to come on a sleigh," said Angela Wilhite, 3, as she waved to him. 
"But Santa's reindeer are in the fire station. He parked them where they are 
nice and shady." 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas came early on Tuesday for the children at the hospital. Santa's 
visit marked the 23rd year that the Fire Department has sent an engine blaring 
into the hospital's parking lot and hoisted Santa to greet kids through the 
windows of the six-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter Kevin Kelso, 43, said he enjoys being Santa and has played the 
role the past eight years. "This is how I get into the Christmas spirit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa shook bells and waved at the children through the windows. He then got 
off the ladder and made visits to each room. 
</P>
<P>
 The only kink in the plan this year was that Kelso failed to find the huge 
pillow that gives his slender frame that famous Santa look. Nurses, parents and 
even some kids shouted that he was too skinny as he walked the halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been working out," joked firefighter Ron Sanchez. "It's not from 
cutbacks." LESLEY WRIGHT

DESPITE DROP IN MANY RENTS, STUDY URGES CONTINUED CONTROLS; HOUSING: SUGGESTION 
UPSETS BOTH LANDLORDS, WHO SAY THE L.A. LAW MAKES IT HARD TO EVICT CRIMINALS, 
AND TENANT ACTIVISTS, WHO SAY THE ORDINANCE IS TOO WEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City rent controls, which cover about 500,000 Los Angeles households, should 
be continued even though landlords' profits are dropping and the law has 
"produced little or no dollar savings to tenants" in recent years, says a study 
prepared for the city's Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the recession and high vacancy rates forced many rents down somewhat, 
the average income of tenants fell faster, the report says. "Even if the real 
cost of their rents has been lowered, many more tenant households are now 
paying rents that are unaffordable by the most widely used federal standards," 
declares the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by the Hamilton, Rabinovitz and Alschuler Inc. consulting firm, the 
report is expected to prompt months of debate on whether the city should change 
the rent stabilization ordinance. The 1978 law, which covers only buildings 
existing then, limits annual rent increases to between 3% and 8%, pegged to 
inflation. This year, 3% hikes were permitted and stabilized rents averaged 
$653 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The study looked at rent stabilization amid what it showed to be a very gloomy 
overall rental housing market in Los Angeles, one that suffers from severe 
overcrowding, high vacancies and little new construction. In an accompanying 
letter to Mayor Richard Riordan, Housing Department General Manager Gary W. 
Squier warned that parts of Los Angeles are threatened with the decay that 
ravaged New York's South Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a fork in the path of housing policy," wrote Squier, who urged a 
more active city role in offering financing and technical aid to landlords and 
homeowners. "We can let the market take its course and stand back as real 
estate and neighborhoods go through a shakeout process, as has already occurred 
in most rust belt cities; or we can intervene to reverse the decline of housing 
and neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, his call for activism came just as the Clinton Administration 
proposed to radically overhaul the federal housing programs that support most 
local initiatives. Squier and other experts fear a resulting steep drop in 
federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In many U.S. cities, landlords have complained that strict rent controls have 
contributed to abandonment. The Los Angeles consultants conclude that the law 
here is not so disruptive because it lifts controls when housing is vacated, 
while also discouraging unfair evictions. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the report gave a lukewarm endorsement of rent stabilization, mainly 
for what it could do in the future if Los Angeles recovers from the recession, 
riots and earthquakes. Still, the recommendation to maintain the status quo 
upset both landlords and tenant activists. 
</P>
<P>
 With many rents declining and post-earthquake apartment vacancies now 
estimated at nearly 7%, the only reason for controls is "to maintain jobs for 
bureaucrats, and that is not a very good use of taxpayers' money," contended 
Charles Isham, executive vice president of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los 
Angeles. That group represents about 25,000 landlords in the county. Isham 
alleged that the ordinance makes it almost impossible to evict drug dealers and 
criminals, leading to buildings' decay as good tenants leave in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the pro-rent stabilization Coalition for Economic Survival 
advocates the end to vacancy decontrol, suggesting that landlords cause 
overcrowding in many apartments by keeping others vacant rather than lowering 
rents. "One of the reasons we are facing such a disaster in our housing 
situation is that the ordinance is not strong enough," said Larry Gross, 
coalition executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Among alarming statistics, the report and Squier's so-called Housing Barometer 
noted that the percentage of owner-occupied housing in the city dropped from 
46.2% in 1980 to 39.7% a decade later; the number of severely overcrowded 
apartments doubled to 20% of all rental units; the share of households paying 
more than 30% of their incomes to live in rent-controlled apartments rose from 
42.4% to 61% between 1984 and 1993, and to make up for lost income, landlords 
on average cut maintenance by about 15% in that period. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot was that the median price of single-family homes in the city 
dropped to about $183,300 last year, although that is still more than many 
families can afford. 
</P>

Angeles apartments remains high, and even destruction by the Northridge

COUNTY HOLDS OFF ON MANDATORY HIV TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a plan to 
expand voluntary HIV counseling for pregnant women but declined to take a stand 
on whether HIV tests at county prenatal clinics should be mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich had proposed the testing plan and had asked for a 
legal opinion on whether pregnant women at county clinics could be forced to 
take HIV tests, which indicate the presence of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguing for the mandatory testing, Antonovich cited recent studies that 
found that the chances of an HIV-positive mother transmitting the disease to 
her unborn child are dramatically reduced if she takes the drug AZT in the 
early stages of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board postponed a decision on the forced-testing issue for six months 
to gather more information on the success of the counseling program, which 
would offer voluntary testing for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Gloria Molina and Zev Yaroslavsky voiced opposition to forced 
testing, with Yaroslavsky urging against even asking for a legal opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want an official action of the board to indicate we are moving in the 
direction of forced HIV testing of pregnant women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said the board should have more information 
about the numbers of HIV-infected babies being born in the county and how many 
women decline the tests before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Schunhoff, director of the county's AIDS program, told the board that 
about 70% of women who are offered HIV tests decline to take them. He said 
statistics show that about 50% of women do not know they are infected with HIV 
at the time they give birth.

 Parkfield, the Central California hamlet on the San Andreas Fault where 
scientists have deployed an elaborate network of seismological instruments 
since 1985, had a 5.0 temblor early Tuesday, but scientists did not view it as 
a likely precursor of a larger quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The moderately strong 2:28 a.m. jolt was centered three miles west of 
Parkfield and was felt in a wide area, including Paso Robles and San Luis 
Obispo, causing only a few minor rockfalls that did no damage. Scientists have 
been expecting a 6.0 to 6.5 quake at Parkfield for about 10 years, but they 
said Tuesday's temblor occurred just outside the area where it would be 
considered a foreshock. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Michael, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said the 
earthquake was centered five miles farther southeast along the San Andreas from 
the point where foreshocks to two magnitude 6 quakes took place in 1934 and 
1966. On Tuesday morning, he said the chances were less than 10% that such a 
strong quake is in the offing by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those chances decline every hour, and Michael said that by this morning the 
chance of a sizable quake by Friday would be down to between 2.5% and 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good earthquake in its own right," said Michael of Tuesday's 
temblor. "But nobody's holding his breath for a bigger one." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, based on earlier, fairly evenly spaced magnitude 6 earthquakes near 
Parkfield in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934 and 1966, scientists said there was a 
95% probability of another such earthquake occurring by the beginning of 1993. 
The instruments were deployed in hopes of being able to detect exactly what led 
up to it and what happens while it is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite occasional alerts, no such quake has struck.  
</P>
<P>
 Scientists put Parkfield on "A alert" status in 1992 and 1993 after magnitude 
4.7 and 4.8 earthquakes occurred near the sites of the 1934 and 1966 
foreshocks, stating in each of those cases that there was a 37% chance of a 
larger earthquake striking within three days. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at a recent American Geophysical Union meeting, Michael and another 
Geological Survey scientist, Lucile Jones, presented a study indicating that 
those probabilities had been miscalculated and that the chance of the larger 
quake occurring those times should not have been higher than 8%.

CITY FEARS LOW-COST HOMES STILL TOO COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reneging on years of city promises, the Oxnard City Council on Tuesday 
acknowledged that most residents of a blighted trailer park will never be able 
to afford the city-subsidized housing intended for them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city pledged to look for ways to improve their current conditions -- 
by buying them new mobile homes, for instance -- or finding another place to 
relocate them. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous delays and canceled meetings, real estate speculator Donald T. 
Kojima, who has no previous experience as a developer, unveiled his latest 
proposal Tuesday to build low-cost homes before the Oxnard City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was originally conceived as a way to relocate the 1,100 residents 
of the Oxnard Mobilehome Lodge -- one of the county's worst slums -- by 
building them a new place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 But the homes now being proposed would be too expensive for almost all of 
those residents to ever afford, and the Oxnard City Council pledged after a 
six-hour discussion to change its strategy for the mobile home residents. The 
city will no longer consider the project a replacement site for the Oxnard 
Mobilehome Lodge's residents, mostly farm workers. But recognizing a shortage 
of affordable housing in the city, the city will continue to pursue Kojima's 
project as a way to provide between 100 and 150 low-cost homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Trailer park resident Luis Teran said he was disappointed by the council's 
decision, which he felt was a betrayal that came after much talk and several 
promises.  
</P>
<P>
 "You promise much," Teran said to the council, "But I don't see you delivering 
much for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Holden said he was also upset because the trailer park 
residents had been led to believe that they could afford homes, when in reality 
they cannot. He said he personally never promised them homes they would own. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was told that regardless of my income I would be able to own a house, 
and now the reality sets in, I would be frustrated also," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for California Rural Legal Assistance, which represents the mobile 
home residents, said they were not happy with the decision, but were pleased 
the council agreed to search for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have gotten shut out completely, the way three of the four 
councilmen were talking," said David Kirkpatrick, special counsel for CRLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly elected councilman Dean Maulhardt, who owns the land adjacent to the 
site, did not participate in the discussion because of a possible conflict of 
interest.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was part of a $5.32-million land transaction between Kojima and 
Oxnard that, after lengthy negotiations, ended with Kojima being given first 
shot at developing the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations -- which took years to complete -- were clouded by claims of 
back-room city council filibusters and sweetheart real estate deals from Kojima 
and council members, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordable housing advocates, who wanted to present proposals to build the 
homes themselves, cried foul, charging that Kojima was given an unfair 
advantage by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials, who helped Kojima put together his housing plan, 
incorporated some of the advocates' suggestions into Tuesday's proposal, along 
with the efforts of nonprofit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the project -- to build 115 homes that low-income families could 
afford -- is still possible, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 But for it to be achieved, Oxnard would have to donate the entire 20-acre 
site, Kojima would have to contribute $1 million, the city would have to waive 
$1 million in development fees, and the families would have to put up a 10% 
down payment on their future homes, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Several possible housing types were proposed, including factory-built modular 
units, conventional homes with adjusted design standards to reduce costs, and 
manufactured units.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's still an opening for something to happen," said Kirkpatrick. 
"But I don't know if that is the reality. I don't know what that opening would 
be."

COUNTY OKS CONCEPT FOR RARE-SPECIES ZOO BETWEEN SIMI AND MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit group that wants to build a one-of-a-kind zoo in eastern Ventura 
County for endangered species was given the go-ahead Tuesday to begin drafting 
plans for the project and to arrange financing for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors agreed to a one-year optional lease agreement with 
the Los Angeles-based Endangered Species Zoological Society, which hopes to 
build the 115-acre zoo at a county-owned park between Moorpark and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization will have an option to extend its lease with the county four 
additional years on the condition that it meets certain fund-raising 
requirements. If financing for the project is secured, the county would then 
enter into a 50-year lease with the zoological society. 
</P>
<P>
 As planned, the Endangered Species EcoPark would be the first in the nation to 
house only rare animals, such as Madagascan lemurs and Brazilian golden lion 
tamarins, in a wildlife preserve setting. Backers said the zoo at the county's 
Oak Park would draw up to 250,000 visitors a year and pump millions of dollars 
into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The board praised the proposal as a potential world-class tourist attraction 
and educational center that would also be a boon to the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting concept," Supervisor Susan Lacey said. "These people are 
dreamers. I think it's great to have folks that dare to dream in this day and 
age." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, however, said that the biggest challenge will be for the 
zoological society to come up with the money necessary to build the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the lease agreement approved Tuesday, the group would have to raise 
$250,000 to extend its lease agreement for a second year and $1 million 
beginning in the third year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county in turn would receive $1,000 a year for the first five years and 
between $6,000 and $12,000 a year for the first five years of the long-term 
lease. The rent would then be adjusted based on the income of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors said the lease option was necessary to give the zoo's backers 
a chance to attract investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to go to a corporation or someone willing to donate money 
for a project like this if you don't know where it's going to be," Supervisor 
Maria VanderKolk said. "Now they have the ability to say, 'We've got a site.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, the board approved a two-year lease agreement with a 
developer seeking to build two 18-hole golf courses at Happy Camp Regional Park 
just north of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the zoo project, the golf project also has a lease option designed to 
give developer Ralph Mahan time to come up with detailed plans and financing 
for the project. The golf courses would be built on the lower 700 acres of the 
park, and the upper 3,000 acres would remain wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
 If built, county officials estimate that the golf courses could generate 
between $250,000 and $500,000 annually for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But one environmentalist complained to the board Tuesday that the golf courses 
would destroy rare grasslands and harm the park's wildlife -- deer and bobcat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County is being encouraged to abandon its role as a steward of the 
Happy Camp wilderness preserve," said Roseann Mikos, from the Moorpark chapter 
of the Environmental Coalition. "Watch out for that almighty dollar because it 
can make us make decisions that we sometimes regret." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake Boyle, manager of the county's Recreation Services Department, said that 
an extensive environmental review would be required before the project is 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environmental process would deal with all of these issues of sensitive 
grasslands, water availability and habitat," he said.

NEW PORT HUENEME COUNCIL PLANS TO KILL RV PARK PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Port Hueneme's recreational vehicle resort is on the verge of final 
approval from the California Coastal Commission, the city's newly elected 
council plans to kill the project today by voting to withdraw it from the 
coastal panel's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice but to destroy this project at once," said Mayor Toni 
Young, a strong opponent of the proposal. "It's been hanging there for too 
long. We need to put the RV park behind us and move forward in developing other 
ways to improve the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the council's three new members -- Robert Turner and Jon Sharkey -- 
agree that the proposal to build the resort on a 10-acre beachfront site near 
the municipal pier should die.  
</P>
<P>
 During the election, Sharkey said, "We had a pretty clear message from the 
people of Port Hueneme about the RV park. The majority of the people do not 
want the park, so it's time to get this behind us and focus our efforts on 
things we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The third new council member, Anthony Volante, said he has not yet decided on 
the issue. The remaining councilman, former Mayor Orvene Carpenter, has been a 
staunch supporter of the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years Carpenter, along with former council members Dorill Wright, Ken 
Hess and James Daniels, pushed for the resort despite opposition from 
environmentalists and nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said Tuesday that he will urge the council to examine the city's 
finances before voting to kill the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mistake for them to do away with this project without reviewing the 
city's financial situation," Carpenter said. "It's a waste of time and money 
and I don't think they are considering the interest of the city as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have estimated that the resort would raise $400,000 a year in 
revenue. So far, the city has spent $700,000 on environmental and market 
studies of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Turner and Sharkey were elected, they have joined forces with Young 
in arguing that the RV resort would not increase revenues by that amount and 
that the 139-space RV resort on the city's only beach would distort the 
character of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 After the new panel was sworn in Dec. 7, council members asked city staff to 
examine the impacts of killing the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Figg, the city's director of community development, said the city has no 
legal or financial obligations to carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memorandum to the council last week, Figg said that if the city wants to 
kill the RV proposal, it must do so before the end of this week. Otherwise, the 
request will be on the Coastal Commission's agenda for its January meeting and 
is expected to pass automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has two alternatives to killing the project. It could ask the 
commission for a temporary suspension of the project and take that time to 
examine the city's finances, or take no action and let the commission grant the 
city the final permit, Figg said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Coastal Commission does grant the permit it would be good for years, 
and the city would not be obligated to build the park, Figg said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Turner said he plans to ask city staff to send a letter to the 
Coastal Commission asking that the permit request be canceled immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get this over once and for all," Turner said. "Keeping the project 
in a drawer will not be enough. The last thing we want is to have the RV park 
dragging on our shoulders."

SCHOOLS GET GRANTS FOR ANTI-SMOKING PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Four Ventura County school districts were notified Tuesday that they will 
receive nearly $150,000 in state education grants to create high school 
programs to keep teen-agers from smoking, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley, Ventura, Moorpark and Oak Park school districts were among 49 
districts statewide that received grants ranging from $10,000 to $300,000 
depending on district size, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley district, the county's largest, was awarded the biggest grant 
locally -- nearly $75,000, officials said. Ventura received $50,000, Moorpark 
$14,755 and Oak Park $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done very well," State Board of Education consultant Rae Kine said of 
the Ventura County districts, which competed in a field of 97 applicants for 
$3.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 County school officials said local districts collectively may have been more 
successful than those from any other county. They attributed that success to 
thorough planning and detailed grant writing. School leaders met as a group 
this fall to plot ways to persuade state educators that their schools needed 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel that that played a role in having more strong applications 
submitted," said Jean Varden, director of the Healthy Kids Center in the county 
Superintendent of Schools Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools have taken steps in recent years to ban smoking even among adult 
employees to win state and federal grants for alcohol, drug and tobacco 
prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our county has made a real commitment over the past few years to provide drug 
and tobacco education," said Becky Wetzel, director of programs and assessment 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's grant will be used for classroom instruction, and to help 
students quit smoking, Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it will provide teacher time and nurse time for direct instruction 
on tobacco health risks," Wetzel said.  
</P>
<P>
 The state pays for similar programs in elementary and junior high schools, but 
recently eliminated funding for high school programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley, for example, lost about $60,000, Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. 
"This will help us," she said. The $75,000 grant will be divided among Simi 
Valley's three high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In starting to award grants on a competitive basis, officials said they were 
forcing districts to do a better job of teaching the anti-smoking lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really were hoping that this money would show what kinds of (programs) 
really work," Varden said.

FULLERTON'S DIVISIVE UTILITY TAX IS REPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After much debate and delay, City Council members Tuesday night repealed the 
controversial utility tax that caused the ouster of the three council members 
who voted to levy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time," Mayor Julie Sa said. "We have to repeal the tax tonight. It's 
time to get rid of the tax, forget about it and start concentrating on 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 Sa publicly apologized for the county's financial crisis and then urged 
residents to help the city overcome any difficulties by volunteering their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm asking for cooperation, input and help from the whole community," she 
said. "We need to start thinking about how we will attract businesses to 
Fullerton and revitalize business already here." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 to repeal the 2% utility tax effective Feb. 28. 
Council members Jan M. Flory and Don Bankhead cast the dissenting votes, saying 
the city should wait and see if the county investment crisis will be resolved 
and if the state balances its budget by taking funds from the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think to eliminate the tax at this time is absolutely foolish and 
ridiculous," Bankhead said. "I don't think this 2% utility tax has anything to 
do with driving business out of Fullerton."  
</P>
<P>
 The council two weeks ago postponed the decision to repeal the tax because it 
had no idea whether the city's $18 million, which is tied up in the county's 
troubled investment fund, was safe. Council members said then that if the city 
loses the $18 million, they would have to consider such measures as keeping the 
utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Councilman Peter Godfrey said keeping the tax would be "like 
(sprinkling water) on a forest fire and wouldn't help much." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James L. Armstrong said now that the tax will be withdrawn, cuts 
totaling about $2 million will have to be made in services throughout the city. 
The cuts will not be severe, however, because the city has already begun the 
"downsizing process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Killing the tax seven months earlier than its scheduled expiration date of 
Sept. 30, "only accelerates the (budget-cutting) process," Armstrong said. 
"Eventually, the tax was going to go away anyway. We're going to have to get 
used to it earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents cheered when the council voted to repeal the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted," former Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. O'Neill said. 
"Fullerton can get by with or without the utility tax, regardless of this 
county financial fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax on all utilities, which was levied in October, 1993, triggered the 
successful recall of former Mayor A. B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly 
McClanahan and Bankhead, who won back a seat on the council in the November 
election, six weeks after being ousted.

ON THE ROAD AGAIN; BULLDOZERS MOVE ACROSS LAGUNA CANYON AS TOLLWAY FOES WATCH 
IN PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES and LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Bulldozers resumed grading in Laguna Canyon on Tuesday after a federal appeals 
court denied a petition for a rehearing in the Laguna Greenbelt's suit to halt 
the final phase of the 17-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, up to 30 protesters, many of whom had taken civil disobedience 
training courses, went to the construction site. But they demonstrated 
peacefully while heavy equipment scraped the earth in the environmentally 
sensitive canyon. One person was arrested for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors were told to resume work by the Transportation Corridor Agencies 
after receiving word from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco that the petition for a rehearing was denied and a previous 
injunction dissolved, said Lisa Telles, a corridor spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 A last-ditch effort to stop the bulldozers came in the form of a request for a 
temporary restraining order filed in Santa Ana federal court later Tuesday. 
Greenbelt argued that the habitat of the California gnatcatcher, which is 
listed by the federal government as a federally threatened species, deserves to 
be protected by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything we can to try and protect the area," said an 
optimistic Joel R. Reynolds, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council in Los Angeles and the attorney for Laguna Greenbelt Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on a temporary restraining order is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on a 4 1/2-mile segment of the tollway had been blocked for 15 months by 
litigation challenging an environmental impact statement. With the court's 
action, work resumed between El Toro Road and Newport Coast Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great news for commuters in South Orange County," said William 
Woollett Jr., chief executive officer for the Orange County Transportation 
Corridor Agencies. "This process has gone on much too long. It is now time to 
finish the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about two dozen protesters visited Laguna Canyon Road carrying 
signs that read, "Developers Go Build in Hell!" The court's action, they said, 
had caught them by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 CrisScaglione, 39, of Dana Point said friends called her at 10 a.m. and 
notified her of the decision. Immediately, the psychotherapist, who had taken 
civil disobedience training, canceled her afternoon appointments and drove to 
the protest site. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she parked behind a hillside and walked by herself for several 
hundred feet over a rise only to be confronted by several bulldozers moving 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stood in front of these men coming down with their bulldozers," Scaglione 
said. "I didn't think I could do it. But they drove around me . . . it didn't 
help. If there had been about a hundred of us it would have helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Project foes obtained a preliminary injunction in September, 1993, to stop the 
project's construction. In June, a drama unfolded in the canyon north of El 
Toro Road when a judge ruled that grading could begin, prompting bulldozers and 
protesters to race to the site. One protester chained himself to a bulldozer 
and another was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The grading was halted the next day by a second court order. But on Dec. 2, 
the Court of Appeals gave the toll road the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Leeds, one of the protest leaders, said if the temporary restraining 
order now is not granted, "demonstrators, if necessary, will go into the hills 
to protect those trees that are standing." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, protesters cried foul when heavy-equipment operators bulldozed 
several larger trees, including an oak. They said many of the trees were 
supposed to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gene Foster, Transportation Corridor Agencies corridor manager who 
was at the site, said the trees taken down were already selected for removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster characterized protesters as being "well-behaved." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he said workers will continue with clearing, grading and erosion 
control.

SUPERVISORS UNDO PLANNING AGENCY FOR EL TORO REUSE; GOVERNMENT: THE BOARD ALSO 
EXCLUDES IRVINE AND LAKE FOREST FROM A DIRECT ROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The planning agency for the reuse of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station was 
dismantled Tuesday by the Orange County Board of Supervisors, who also voted to 
exclude Lake Forest and Irvine from direct participation in the development of 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote means that the county, led by the five supervisors, will now assume 
responsibility for developing the facility. Irvine and Lake Forest had a role 
in the planning process for El Toro until they were excluded Tuesday. Officials 
from both cities fought to remain a part of the planning process, but were 
turned down by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board action killed a hard-won compromise hammered out between the county 
and the two cities, which had demanded active participation in plans to develop 
the base when the Marines leave in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The five supervisors, who had been prodded into being more inclusive by offers 
of federal funding for planning the base's development, agreed earlier this 
year to establish the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. The nine-member 
authority board was composed of the five supervisors plus three representatives 
from Irvine and one from Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Defense officials had expressed comfort with the now-dismantled 
agency because it met their requirement that affected communities, such as 
Irvine and Lake Forest, be included in the planning process. Now, the county 
will have to get Pentagon recognition as the new reuse planning agency for the 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Defense representatives could not be reached for comment late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Miller, executive director of the dismantled authority, will continue to 
direct the county planning effort and will go to Washington next month to 
persuade Department of Defense officials to recognize the county as the new 
planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll ask for their comments and input on the new changes and hope they 
endorse them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the Pentagon to recognize the county as the new planning agency is 
crucial. Development of the base cannot continue without recognition by federal 
authorities, who are under no obligation to turn over the base. In addition, 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal funds, which the Pentagon could 
make available for the planning process, are also at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he did not know how Department of Defense officials will react 
when they learn that Irvine and Lake Forest are out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's critical that the supervisors get recognition (from the Pentagon). . . . 
We can't get federal funding until the military recognizes the official reuse 
authority," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Thomas F. Riley voted against the proposal, 
but only because the other board members rejected two minor changes they 
offered. Last month, Vasquez and Riley voted with the rest of the board to pull 
the county out of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority rejected a recommendation by Vasquez to delay dismantling the 
planning authority 30 days to allow Irvine and Lake Forest officials ample time 
to study the board's plans to assume planning responsibility for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Councilwoman Paula Werner complained that she and other council members 
did not learn details of the board's plans to assume planning responsibility 
for the base until Friday evening. She asked for a 30-day postponement so 
Irvine officials could study the board's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal was not developed in consultation with Irvine and the City 
Council," Werner said. "We would lose shared decision authority under the new 
structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Mayor Richard T. Dixon also asked for a 30-day delay and 
preservation of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. "The federal government 
has not recognized the mandate of Measure A," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the supervisors voted to pull out of the planning authority after 
voters adopted Measure A, which requires the county to build a commercial 
airport at El Toro when the Marines leave. The initiative does not require the 
dismantling of the planning authority, but calls for a 13-member El Toro 
Airport Citizens Advisory Commission to plan for an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Some supervisors have suggested that Irvine and Lake Forest could be 
represented on the citizens advisory commission, but this has been rejected by 
officials from both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inconceivable and unconscionable that Irvine be relegated to an 
advisory position," Werner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon echoed Werner's protestation when he told the board that "Lake Forest 
should continue to share in the planning process." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Supervisor William G. Steiner expressed support for the cities' 
continued participation in the planning process rather than giving the cities 
merely an advisory role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Measure A still allows for Irvine and Lake Forest to be a part of the 
process," Steiner said. However, none of the other supervisors expressed 
support for this position. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A requires the county to build a civilian airport on 2,000 acres of 
the 4,700-acre base. The rest of the land has to be developed in a way that is 
compatible with an airport.

'ABSOLUTE HERO'; MEMORIAL: PILOT WHO DIED IN CRASH, AN EX-VALLEY RESIDENT, IS 
REMEMBERED FOR HIS PERSEVERANCE, INTEGRITY AND LOVE OF FLYING. 
</P>

 As a kid growing up in Woodland Hills, Richard Evan Anderson dreamed of being 
a jet pilot. He made his first solo flight even before getting his driver's 
license. He took jobs washing planes, sweeping up hangars and pumping jet fuel 
just to be near the jets he loved. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Anderson and another pilot were killed when the private jet they 
were flying for the military developed engine problems and crashed into a 
Fresno apartment complex. In trying to land the jet with one of its engines on 
fire, Anderson avoided a busy schoolyard filled with children and brought the 
plane down instead on a nearby street. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, at a memorial service at the Church at Rocky Peak on Santa Susana 
Peak Road, Anderson was eulogized as a man of perseverance and integrity, and 
as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still believe in dreams . . . and in heroes," said Fresno Fire Department 
Capt. Bob Waterston, who was at the crash scene within 10 minutes and who 
addressed the 250 people who gathered to say a final goodby to Anderson. 
"Richard was an absolute hero in every sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and another pilot, Bradford J. Sexton, 34, both of Klamath Falls, 
Ore., were returning to the Fresno airport in a jet owned by Georgia-based 
Phoenix Air after completing a training exercise with an F-16 fighter shortly 
before noon Dec. 14. They began experiencing engine trouble and radioed the 
airport tower. 
</P>
<P>
 They tried to land the plane on a wide street about two miles southwest of the 
airport. The plane skidded down the street, mowing down power poles and 
electrical wires before crashing into a two-story apartment building and 
exploding in a fireball. The two pilots were the only fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that he was doing what he loved to do when his time came," said Jerry 
Todd, a friend and fellow pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is survived by his wife, Cindy, and three children, Krista, 13, 
Richard Bret, 11, and Kaitlyn, 2. He is also survived by his mother, Melba 
Anderson, his brother, John, and a sister, Kathy Borell. His father died in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson attended Woodland Hills Elementary School and Taft High School. He 
and his wife were friends in high school, but they did not begin dating until 
after they graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to ask me to the prom, but a girlfriend of mine told him I already 
had a date even though I didn't," Cindy Anderson recalled Tuesday. "So I didn't 
go to my prom." 
</P>
<P>
 The two attended Pierce College together, and then he went on to Texas A & M 
University. Before completing his studies, he returned to the San Fernando 
Valley, and married Cindy in 1979. They lived in Panorama City for a while and 
settled in Castaic for seven years before moving to Oregon two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man of integrity and honesty," Cindy Anderson said. "I've lost my 
best friend." 
</P>
<P>
 David W. Miller, pastor of the Church at Rocky Peak, where Anderson and his 
family attended for nearly four years before moving to Oregon, said Anderson 
had a strong spiritual relationship with God. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we struggle with the questions of why, he is with the one who has the 
answers," Miller told the gathering. "Richard is more alive than anyone here." 
</P>
<P>
 John Anderson said he was always proud of his younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was such a wonderful example of devotion and dedication to a cause," said 
Anderson. "He was in a profession he loved, he was flying missions he loved. He 
was a tremendous family man, husband and father, a great brother and a 
wonderful son. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father died in 1982. We as a family believe that we will see him again," 
Anderson continued. "Now we believe we will see Richard again. Richard just got 
to see Dad first. Our hearts are at peace with this knowledge."

BANK BUYS HALF OF HUGHES LAND; BUSINESS: DEAL TO MOVE COAST FEDERAL INTO VACANT 
FACILITY WAS BROKERED BY A NONPROFIT GROUP CREATED BY THE MAYOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan on Tuesday announced the sale of 40 acres of the closed 
Hughes Aircraft Co. research facility to Coast Federal Bank in an unusual 
transaction that was brokered by a nonprofit corporation created by Riordan to 
assist local business. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast, which has been seeking larger quarters for its 700 workers, will use 
about half of the 843,000 square feet of office space at the former Hughes 
plant in Canoga Park, which was shuttered in October when the aerospace company 
transferred its staff to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the transaction, Hughes gets a tax credit for selling the property below 
market price to the Valley Job Recovery Corp., a nonprofit group the mayor 
created in August to help retain local business. That corporation, in turn, 
sold half the land to Coast, which had considered leaving the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city will receive a five-acre park at the entrance to the 
former Hughes facility on Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Martin, Coast's chief executive officer, called the deal a "win-win 
agreement for our company, the surrounding community and the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the sprawling 86-acre Hughes property, formerly a missile research 
and development facility, was not disclosed but Riordan aide Rocky Delgadillo 
said it was below the site's estimated $10-million to $14-million market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said the nonprofit corporation, which operates outside city 
government, is currently in negotiations with at least two other companies to 
buy the remaining space. 
</P>
<P>
 In a short speech Tuesday, Riordan credited the Valley Job Recovery Corp. with 
"bringing life back to a property that has been vacant since October." Keeping 
Coast Federal Bank in the Valley will save about 750 local jobs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This site was in jeopardy of becoming a statistic of the economic downturn, 
and it will be, but a good one," said Riordan, speaking to a group of city 
officials and Coast administrators who toured the facility after final 
documents were signed. 
</P>
<P>
 By completing its first successful deal, the organization has shown it can 
boost business in the city, said Benjamin Reznik, a San Fernando Valley 
attorney who is chairman of the VJRC's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city were to create the nonprofit, then you would have to go through 
city bureaucracy, and that could take years," Reznik said. "This way, it moves 
much faster. If we have to hold a quick meeting, we're available. If we need 
documents signed, we're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 John Rooney, president of the Valley Economic Development Center, said other 
cities have used independent nonprofit corporations to attract and retain 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a super tool that you are going to see a lot more of in Los Angeles," 
Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Hal Bernson and other Valley council members have been kept 
informed of the corporation's projects, which includes negotiations with 
General Motors officials about its defunct Van Nuys auto assembly plant. The 
VJRC hopes to purchase the facility and transform it into an industrial park, 
Reznik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznik declined to provide details about the negotiations with GM officials 
but said he hopes to have a deal worked out early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the city will help expedite the permit process for Coast, 
allowing the bank to begin relocating to the Canoga Park site by early April. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some Granada Hills residents said they are worried that the Coast 
building on Chatsworth Street will be replaced with a commercial building that 
will bring traffic and congestion to the neighborhood.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; HOUSING SERVICE THROWS A PARTY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Christmas is about love and giving thanks for being alive. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the message at the Neighborhood Housing Service's third annual 
Christmas party Tuesday at the La Habra Boxing Club gym, where about 150 needy 
children and their families gathered to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours, the families forgot about their financial woes and enjoyed the 
party, which came complete with poetry readings, Christmas carols, a pinata and 
Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas is about being together, helping each other and caring," said Mary 
Lou Gomez, an NHS volunteer who helped organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
 NHS is a nonprofit organization that makes low-interest loans to people with 
low incomes so they can buy homes. It also offers residents community 
leadership skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said the purpose of the annual party is to spread Christmas cheer among 
the families of the predominantly Latino neighborhoods of Grace/Pacific and 
Corona. Most of the families cannot afford to buy Christmas gifts for their 
children and said they were grateful for the party. 
</P>
<P>
 They applauded, sang in Spanish and English, and in some cases wept while 
watching a playlet by the Chicano Poets Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama focused on a boy who thought Christmas was about gifts. When his 
parents could not afford to buy him anything, he cried until the hero, Super 
Chicano, came to comfort him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you know what you have is more than many people have?" asked Super 
Chicano, played by Carlos De Rosas. "You have a roof over your head, you have 
good health, you have food to eat and you have a family that loves you." 
</P>
<P>
 De Rosas added that Christmas was a time to remember the birth of Jesus, who 
was born in a stable to bring hope to humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier A. Cortez, 27, co-founder of the Poets Society, said he wrote the 
playlet "to let people know that the real meaning of Christmas is to feel 
fortunate for what you have and that the gifts from the heart are the gifts 
that count the most." MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; GOLF COURSE GETS CITY OK TO CUT TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This city so loves its mature, historic trees that it takes an act of the City 
Council to remove one. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue surfaced earlier this month when the Cypress Golf Course requested 
permission from city government to remove 14 diseased eucalyptus trees on golf 
course property.The request went before the City Council because a 21-year-old 
city ordinance puts strict controls on mature trees deemed "landmarks." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 12, the council unanimously approved the golf course's request to 
remove the diseased trees, with no need for replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Eynon, public works director, explained that the 1973 ordinance protects 
"large, majestic" trees that have been designated "landmark trees" and placed 
on a city inventory. The Cypress Golf Course eucalyptuses are among them, Eynon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written report to the council, Eynon noted that "the criteria for 
determining whether or not to issue such a permit includes the condition of the 
landmark tree with respect to disease, general health and danger of falling." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the 14 trees golf course officials asked to remove all had been 
found "to be dead or dying as a result of infestation by the long-horned borer 
beetle" and that removal of the dead or dying trees "is necessary to keep the 
beetle infestation from spreading." 
</P>
<P>
 Eynon said the golf course owners should not be required to plant replacement 
trees for the 14 diseased ones. She told the council that the golf course two 
years ago planted an excess of replacements when a batch of landmark trees had 
to be removed that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Eynon said a large number of landmark trees will remain on the golf course.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; YOUNGSTERS GET FIRST CHANCE TO PLAY IN SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three-year-old Scott Thompson of Calabasas did a double take Tuesday when he 
got his first look ever at snow during a preschool field trip to Gates Canyon 
Park, where two small knolls were blanketed with snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got off the school bus, and he looked at it, and he said, 'Hey, what's 
this white stuff?' " said Christi Cane, director of preschool activities for 
Kids Club, a Calabasas after-school program. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before Scott discovered that the snow -- created by a 
snow-making machine hired by the city -- could be rolled into balls and thrown, 
and that it made a nifty splat when it bounced off another kid or adult. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got us all," said Cane with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's adventure was but one small sidelight in the three-hour event, part of 
Calabasas' third annual "Let It Snow" day. Kids were charged $3 each to help 
pay for the snow machine's rental, which cost about $1,000, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the proceeds will benefit the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the morning, hundreds of youngsters accompanied by their parents 
brought plastic saucers and sleds to enjoy a rare activity for Southern 
California children, especially on so sunny a day as Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 It was controlled chaos as children lined up to make trip after trip down the 
snow-covered knolls, as laughter and snowballs filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played with my friend, Jessica, and I threw snowballs at her," said Erit 
Keisari, 8, of Calabasas. "Throwing snowballs is fun, because you get to throw 
them back at all your friends and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Blore of Woodland Hills said the event offered a convenient way to let 
her children, Vanessa, 7, and Krista, 3 1/2, experience snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Krista has never been to the snow, and they have been wanting to go," said 
Blore, cradling her 10-month-old daughter, Veronica, in her arms. "We didn't 
want to drive three hours to the mountains so we figured we would give this a 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The event is becoming well established as word spreads, said Heather Toma, a 
recreation specialist for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them brought their saucers, which is great," Toma said. "Last year, 
a lot of them didn't and we were loaning out cardboard." FRANK MANNING

<P>
 The City Council is considering delaying some public works projects because of 
the county bond crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Don R. Griffin assured residents that the city has never relied on 
the county pool for day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You, the citizens, can expect to receive all regular and emergency services 
such as police, fire and paramedic services as usual and without diminished 
response or performance," Griffin said during a council meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park had $28 million invested in the county pool, and officials are 
still in the process of finding out what the ramifications might be for the 
city, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest project that might be delayed is a $9.5-million reconstruction of 
Dale Street that includes an overpass for the railroad tracks, Public Works 
Director Donald K. Jensen said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's share on the Dale Street project is $4.2 million, which was 
scheduled for May. The state would pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also delayed a vote on buying an $18,000 vehicle for water-meter 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin told residents that the city has always taken a conservative stance 
toward investment. As a result, he said, the city did not borrow money to 
invest in the pool and did not invest any city employees' compensation or 
retirement money in the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While this crisis is of great proportion to Buena Park, it should not impact 
the city's ability to provide services to the community," Griffin said. LESLEY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; 2 OF 3 POLLED FAVOR LARGER TERMINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds of respondents in a poll commissioned by Burbank Airport 
officials say they support plans for building a new, larger terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 800 Burbank residents surveyed, 64% were in favor of a new terminal and 
30% were against it, according to a report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were asked whether they support a new terminal with nearly twice as 
many aircraft gates as there are now. 
</P>
<P>
 But, pollster Arnold Steinberg said, they were not asked specifically about 
whether they approve of quadrupling the terminal's size and nearly doubling the 
number of flights in and out of Burbank -- as airport officials intend to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport's executive director, Tom Greer, said he was satisfied with the 
poll's results, which come just a week after airport officials won an important 
court battle against the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased to the extent there is not a lynch mob out there waiting for 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tells us the Burbank citizenry are pretty level-headed and they make up 
their own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one homeowner, who lives outside Burbank and opposes the 
multimillion-dollar project, questions the poll's results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm presuming they didn't ask people in the right parts of Burbank . . . the 
ones who are in the departure pattern," said David Engelbach, a spokesman for 
the Citizens for Fair Airport Noise Homeowners Coalition. "I don't know who 
they polled." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also revealed that 65% of respondents believe the airport's nine 
commissioners are doing a good job. But 52% said the airport officials do a bad 
job of communicating with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, crime and gangs topped the list of most important issues, with 
the airport at the bottom. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL VOTES TO RAISE FEES AT 2 GOLF COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday approved a series of fee hikes at the city's two 
municipal golf courses to increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The H.G. (Dad) Miller and Anaheim Hills golf courses will increase rates on 
Fridays from $11 to $13 for nine holes and from $16 to $22 for 18 holes.Weekend 
tournament fees will double to $10.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials predict that with the increase in weekend tournament fees, some 
tournaments will move to weekdays, leaving more tee times for the individual 
golfer on weekends. They hope this strategy increases the number of rounds 
played overall and brings in an additional $160,000 each year. The courses 
already contribute about $1.5 million annually to the city's general fund, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Zemel proposed that the city put half of the revenue from the 
fee increases into a separate fund earmarked for construction of a new 
clubhouse at the Anaheim Hills golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about raising the funds and having them disappear into the 
general fund," Zemel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1 to set aside half the money in a separate fund for 
possible use for a clubhouse, but with no guarantees it would be used that way.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY EXTENDS HOLD ON STREET VENDING PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will issue no new permits for street vendors for at least six months. 
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to extend a moratorium on the 
issuance of new vendor/operator permits to June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they need at least that much time to draft an ordinance 
designed to curb trash, noise, customer loitering and vendors staying in one 
location too long. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Kocsis, a resident who spoke in favor of the extension, said: "These 
people do not obey the law. This is a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the city's code enforcement department has been unresponsive to 
her continuing complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium does not affect the approximately 150 licensed vendors who 
currently sell a variety of products including produce, groceries, cigarettes, 
clothing and furniture, from the back of parked trucks and vans, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the council enacted a 90-day moratorium. But after meeting with 
concerned residents and vendors, city staff said they needed more time to work 
on the continuing problems, said John W. Poole, city code enforcement manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the 4th District Court of Appeal nullified a 1992 Anaheim ordinance 
that prohibited street vending in residential neighborhoods. The court said the 
vehicle code allows cities to regulate street vending but not to ban it.GREG

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: EARTHQUAKE RECOVERY PROPOSAL WITHDRAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson yanked a controversial redevelopment 
plan out of the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday and began seeking other 
ways to finance earthquake recovery in his west San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said the plan would give too much power to the city's Community 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find it impossible to work with the CRA," Bernson told the council, which 
unanimously accepted his proposal to kill the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners who opposed the measure from the outset praised Bernson's move 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem was the area was too vast, no one knew for sure where the 
damage was and what the extent was and, on top of that, no one trusted the 
CRA," said Harold Coleman, who co-chaired the North Valley Property Owners' 
Coalition formed to oppose the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council brought up similar issues over the Bernson plan, except for 
the distrust of the redevelopment agency. The council has already authorized 
the CRA to launch five other redevelopment plans in the Valley and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents questioned the need to divert property taxes from necessary services 
to finance a massive project over 45 years, as the CRA wished. Other funding 
sources have not been pursued adequately, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local homeowners also worried about the administrative costs accrued by the 
CRA, the bond debt the agency would create and potential stigmas to property in 
a redevelopment zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put yourself in the position of a buyer," said Rick Weiner, a member of 
Coleman's group. "You're looking at a home and it says it's in a recovery area. 
It makes it look bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bernson plan would have covered 21,000 acres in Northridge, Chatsworth, 
Granada Hills, Porter Ranch and North Hills, but attempted to severely limit 
the powers of the redevelopment agency. When the agency bridled at the 
restrictions, the citizens advisory committee that authored the plan advised 
Bernson to pull it out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said he will add members to the advisory committee and begin seeking 
other funding sources in federal, state, local and private sectors. GEOFFREY 
MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST VALLEY DISASTER AID DENIAL APPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) called Tuesday for the federal 
government to reverse its recent decision not to assist West Valley communities 
in disasters such as flooding and mudslides resulting from last year's 
wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to Beilenson, maintains 
that the eligibility period for disaster assistance has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson told FEMA Director James Lee Witt in a letter that communities in 
his district will continue to suffer the economic effects of the fires. For 
instance, he wrote, the fires have denuded hillsides, making them prone to 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire-impacted communities may very well incur mud and debris cleanup costs 
that directly result from last year's firestorms for several more years," 
Beilenson wrote. "FEMA should continue to reimburse those costs so long as the 
damage occurs." 
</P>
<P>
 The communities affected by the decision, according to the congressman, are 
Agoura Hills, Westlake Village, Malibu and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Village City Manager Ray Taylor praised Beilenson's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's prudent that we cities have the ability to tap into FEMA 
resources," he said. "Disasters have no regard for boundaries or time." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Raphael, a public information officer for FEMA, said Tuesday that he 
wanted to check with his superiors in Washington before commenting on 
Beilenson's letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incident period ended April 22 for the firestorms," he said. "Any 
additional problems would have to be included in a new disaster declaration."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; PLANNERS TAKE NO STAND ON APARTMENT 
COMPLEX 
</P>

<P>
 The Mission Viejo Co.'s proposal to build an 850-unit apartment complex failed 
to win a recommendation this week from planning commissioners, who said they 
needed more information on the impact of noise from Marine jets passing over 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Although commissioners said they like the project, a recommendation against it 
in September by the county Airport Land Use Commission worried them.The 
Planning Commission sent the proposal on to the City Council along with a 
statement but without a recommendation for or against. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Planning Commission favors the residential concept; however, it's deeply 
concerned with the liability issue in view of the Airport Land Use Commission 
denial of the project," read the commission's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment complex would be built on about 50 acres just east of El Toro 
Road at the city's northern border. 
</P>
<P>
 City Development Director Clint Sherrod had asked the commission to delay a 
decision to July 3 to allow time for monitoring of noise levels. But the 
Mission Viejo Co. asked the commission to make an immediate decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Working shorthanded with the absence of Commissioner Tim Watson and the 
election of former Commissioner Sherri M. Butterfield to the City Council, the 
commission declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is scheduled to go before the City Council on Jan. 9. FRANK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MAN WITH VIOLENT HISTORY SENTENCED UNDER '3 
STRIKES' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man with a long criminal history, including slashing his girlfriend's throat 
with a straight razor, is the second defendant in Orange County to be sentenced 
to 25 years to life in prison under the new "three strikes" law, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Eric Parrish, 36, was sentenced Friday by Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Anthony Rackauckas.The judge also sentenced him to an additional term of 
16 years to life in prison for the slashing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Parrish's criminal history dates back to 1989, when he was convicted of 
burglarizing a home in Orange County. He has an additional conviction for 
assault with a deadly weapon for stabbing a man in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 His 18-year-old girlfriend required 20 stitches after she was attacked Jan. 15 
in Anaheim. Parrish fled after the attack but was arrested in April when he 
tried to get a cash refund for goods he had stolen from a Buena Park department 
store. He was charged with burglary in that crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the "three strikes" law was not signed into law until March, Parrish 
could not be sentenced under it for the attack on his girlfriend. But 
prosecutors sought the toughest punishment against him for the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rackauckas sentenced Parrish to a 16-year prison term for the assault and a 
25-year-to-life term for the burglary.RENE LYNCH

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; BOY STUNG BY SCORPION IN MEXICO RECOVERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents of a 13-month-old Costa Mesa boy who nearly died of a scorpion 
sting in Mexico last weekend said he is recovering quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 "The little guy is a miracle story," Diane Bjella said on Tuesday, a day after 
her son, Anders, was flown by an ambulance jet from Puerto Vallarta to 
Children's Hospital in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's breathing on his own. The brain looks good," she said from the hospital. 
"Everything's being monitored closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Anders apparently was stung by a scorpion that crawled into his shoe Sunday 
afternoon, as the Bjellas got ready for a restaurant outing in Puerto Vallarta, 
where they were vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjella said she and her husband, Ross, had been "casually warned" about 
scorpions but did not check the boy's shoes before dressing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He jumped off the bed and took a few steps and yelped," she said. "We thought 
he hit his mouth, and he's getting new teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 But during the two-hour walk to town, she said, the boy cried uncontrollably 
and began frothing at the mouth. They rushed back to their villa, where "Ross 
took his shoe off and the scorpion crawled out." 
</P>
<P>
 She said they took Anders to two hospitals, where half a dozen doctors had the 
same bad news: There was little they could do. The boy's temperature hit 104 
degrees, his lips turned purple and he stopped breathing at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sure we were going to lose him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An emergency-room doctor suggested calling the San Diego-based air ambulance 
and, 17 hours after he was stung, Anders was flown early Monday morning to 
Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Bjella, who is five months' pregnant with her second child, said: "He's 
on his way to recovery. I think we're going to have a very good Christmas." KEN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; CAMPFIRE KIDS BRING COMFORT TO GUIDE DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of dogs being trained to guide the blind will rest more comfortably 
thanks to the work of a group of Campfire Girls and Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Megan Mason, a 17-year-old from North Hollywood, Campfire groups 
citywide gathered 395 towels, blankets and other pieces of bedding and 
presented them to Guide Dogs of America in Sylmar on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group raises and trains dogs to guide vision-impaired and blind 
people. At any time, there are between 80 and 100 dogs and puppies being 
trained or boarded, said John B. Pettitt, president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Guide dogs can do amazing things once they are trained, said Pettitt, but 
keeping their bedding clean is not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important thing," said Andi Krusoe, social service coordinator 
for the group. "Our linen and towel situation was getting very raggedy." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some of the sheets and bedding will be used in the group's 
dormitory, where future dog owners stay for a monthlong orientation before 
getting their dogs, Krusoe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Megan is earning the Campfire Girls and Boys' highest award, the WoHeLo 
Medallion, through a variety of volunteer efforts, including Tuesday's 
donation. She also volunteers to lead a younger Campfire group and helps out at 
the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Megan originally wanted to volunteer with Guide Dogs of America, but workers 
said the donations would be more helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they can always use towels and blankets," Megan said. "The puppies 
go through them like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Megan drew up posters and leaflets, distributing them throughout the Los 
Angeles council's numerous Campfire groups in September. Soon, she was 
literally blanketed with donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "One girl was really into it," she said. "She got her whole school to donate." 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs seemed to appreciate the gift, or at least appreciated the chance to 
frolic and press their cold noses against children. Mason brought along half a 
dozen Campfire Girls and Boys from the group she helps lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Kai, a lanky 18-month-old black Labrador, frantically beat his tail against 
the boxed and wrapped donations piled in the lobby of the group's Sylmar 
facility. If he does well in his studies, Kai could be paired with a 
sight-impaired or blind owner in six months or so. Meanwhile, he was learning 
how to get along in the crowd of children. GEOFFREY MOHAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; QUAKE EFFECTS ON CITY BUILDINGS TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A structural engineering firm will conduct studies on four city buildings at a 
cost of $48,500 to determine whether they have been damaged by earthquakes over 
the years and need to be upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday awarded the job to Brandow & Johnston Associates, 
which is based in the unincorporated area of Santa Ana Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony C'DeBaca, assistant development service director for the city, said the 
firm will conduct seismic studies on the police station, City Hall, the city 
yard and the downtown community center. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, he said, will tell the city how it can modify the 30-year-old 
buildings so they can withstand earthquakes to the point where it is safe 
enough to exit them in the event of a temblor, C'DeBaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will do a preliminary review of the structure and recommend the changes 
so the buildings can meet today's seismic code requirements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm will start its work today.TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; TRUSTEE URGES DISTRICT TO PREPARE FOR CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New school board member Hank Adler called for immediate action from Irvine 
Unified School District officials to plan for cuts in programs and employees in 
light of the county fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened," Adler said Monday. "The time for denial is over." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district should plan for a potential $30-million loss and urged 
school board members to eliminate their $400-a-month stipend. 
</P>
<P>
 But his 20-minute presentation angered school board member Mike Regele, who 
said it is too soon to talk of dismantling the county's premier school district 
when the extent of the losses are not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we have a $30-million problem -- it's an irresponsible thing to say," 
Regele said. "I do not know that, in fact, anybody can demonstrate we have a 
$30-million problem. And to scare our staff and the community the way they've 
just been scared is reprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
 Adler, a certified public accountant elected in November on the promise to 
take a "fresh look" at school district financing, said his intention is not to 
scare anybody, but to communicate a sense of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to deal with these issues," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also suggested that the district could offer a choice of budget decisions 
to voters in a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees will consider budget cuts, the elimination of board member stipends 
and will review all projects at the board's next meeting on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district will meet all expenses including debt payments through the 
first week of January, according to Paul Reed, deputy superintendent. If the 
district has access to tax revenues deposited by the county into a separate 
account since the bankruptcy filing, Reed said Irvine Unified will meet all 
expenses through March. 
</P>
<P>
 That still leaves nearly three months of the school year unfunded. And Reed 
has no answers for how the district will pay off a $54.5-million debt due in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Tom Burnham said it appears inevitable that the 
district will have to determine what basic services are legally required, then 
make tough choices about what else it can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all continue to hold out hope that we will get all of our money back," 
Burnham said. "But the reality is that there will probably be a profound change 
in our revenues."RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; MALL OFFERS CHILDREN SCIENCE WORKSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children interested in science can learn how to make kaleidoscopes, watch a 
video of Mars and discover how dolphins hear -- all at the Launch Pad in 
Crystal Court, which will be holding three workshops a day for three days next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters ages 5 to 14 can also play a variety of science games or they can 
make dolphins out of clay, but that's only on Dolphin Day, which is 
Tuesday.Space Science Day is Dec. 28 and Eye Spy day is Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Children can also discuss what kinds of adaptations certain animals would have 
to make to survive on Mars. They will also discover how the eye functions by 
witnessing the dissection of a cow's eye, said Pam Shambra, a spokeswoman for 
Launch Pad. The group is a nonprofit organization set up to give residents a 
peek at what the Science Discovery Center will look like when it opens in Costa 
Mesa in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 But the purpose of these workshops, Shambra said, is to educate children about 
math and science and to excite them by participating in and performing hands-on 
tasks.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; POLICE PURCHASE 'LESS LETHAL' WEAPON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gun is in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that the "multi-role projectile launcher" is in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cost of about $2,000, the San Fernando Police Department has bought a 
"less lethal" semiautomatic weapon and an array of accessories from a weapons 
manufacturer in Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Less lethal weapons -- so called because they are much less likely to kill 
than conventional firearms -- are already used by the Los Angeles Police 
Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and other regional law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun ordered by San Fernando's police force can fire three-inch rubber 
batons (cylindrical-shaped projectiles), pepper or tear-gas canisters, and 
"barrier-penetrating" cartridges -- capable of smashing through a wooden door 
-- from its 37-millimeter muzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 The department for some time had been seeking an alternative to using deadly 
force in subduing suspects, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Though San Fernando's 35 full-time police officers patrol an area of only 2.4 
square miles and rarely encounter riots, officials said the less lethal gun 
will come in handy during attempts to disarm or incapacitate armed and 
dangerous individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're taking on a suspect with (a knife)," said San Fernando Detective 
Mark Jacobs, "instead of approaching him to use lethal force, you can approach 
him from a safe distance and knock him down, with the advantage of being able 
to pin him into an area." 
</P>
<P>
 John Klein, president of Sage Control Ordnance, the company that sold the 
department its new weapon -- called the SL-6 -- said such less lethal weaponry 
gives law enforcement officers an important alternative to handguns or 
hand-to-hand physical force. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he noted, there is always the risk that the weapon could cause a fatal 
injury. "It's somewhere between a nightstick and a 9-millimeter (gun)," Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals who think police are getting soft on them, firing plastic instead of 
lead, should think again. Getting pelted by one of the "blunt trauma" batons is 
like "being hit with a fastball traveling 100 m.p.h.," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 To disperse crowds, the rifle, which has sights, breaks open for loading like 
a shotgun and is capable of firing six rounds in succession. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando's Police Department received a $2,000 donation from the local 
police advisory council to purchase the weapon and assorted ammunition. The 
purchase was approved by the City Council earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons have a proven record among police forces in the region, law 
enforcement officials said. In September, Ventura police officers used a less 
lethal weapon loaded with tiny sandbags to subdue a man wielding a six-inch 
steak knife. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, LAPD officers used the weapons to fire rubber projectiles toward an 
unruly crowd at the L. A. Fiesta Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The SL-6 will be deployed initially with the department's special response 
team, Jacobs said, with every member of the force eventually receiving training 
to use the weapon. TIM MAY

PROSECUTOR SAYS OFFICER CONCEDES ROLE IN SHOOTING

<P>
 An Anaheim police officer accused of killing his estranged wife's lover has 
told authorities that he was involved in the shooting, a Riverside County 
prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Minn, a 14-year veteran of the Anaheim Police Department, told 
authorities on Saturday that he was involved in the shooting death of Paul R. 
Hangen, a friend of Minn who had been dating his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Allison Nelson, however, refused to offer any more details 
about Minn's statement or the case against the motorcycle officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still conducting investigations," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sheriff's Department still has witnesses to interview, and we still have 
to wait for evidence to be reviewed by the crime lab." 
</P>
<P>
 Hangen's body was found Friday night in his pickup truck in Norco. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, authorities have confiscated guns, shell casings, ammunition, shoes 
and clothing from Minn's home. Shoe prints from the crime scene also have been 
recovered, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No fingerprints were taken because (Minn and Hangen) were acquaintances," she 
said. "Fingerprints wouldn't count because he had been in the guy's car 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Minn, 36, was scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday at the Riverside County 
courthouse. But his attorneys asked for more time to prepare their case, and 
the arraignment date was postponed until Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Elian Schonberger, 36, Minn's wife, has said she and Hangen, 28, were dating 
and that she had planned to move out of the Corona home she shared with her 
husband and file for a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Minn's attorney, James A. Stotler of Santa Ana, refused to comment about the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Minn, who was placed on administrative leave, is held in lieu of $250,000 bail 
at the Robert Pressley Detention Center in Riverside.

<P>
 A 16-month-old girl died Tuesday after she ran in front of her father's pickup 
truck and was run over outside the family's home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbis Karatepeyan was driving north in the 9500 block of Delco Avenue near 
Halsted Street about 12:15 p.m. when he struck his daughter, Christine, who was 
running alongside the vehicle and suddenly darted into its path, said Sgt. Rod 
Graheck of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine's mother was standing outside the home with her when the toddler 
began running after her father's truck, Graheck said. She died of her injuries 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, Graheck said.

OWNERS OF TOLUCA LAKE JEWELRY STORE ROBBED; CRIME: COUPLE IS SAFE AFTER BEING 
ABDUCTED AT THEIR HOME. KIDNAPERS TAKE MORE THAN $1 MILLION IN GEMS, CASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The owners of a prominent Toluca Lake jewelry store were kidnaped at gunpoint 
from their home and forced to drive a pair of ski-masked robbers to the shop 
before the thieves fled with more than $1 million in jewelry and cash, police 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Ohanian, 67, and his wife, Helen, 62, were surprised about 7:30 p.m. 
Monday by robbers who hid outside the couple's Toluca Lake home and followed 
them into the garage, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Ron LaRue. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers ransacked the house while holding the Ohanians at gunpoint and 
then ordered the couple into their 1989 Mercedes, directing them to drive the 
few blocks to the family jewelry store, Van Ohanian Jeweler on Riverside Drive, 
LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
 After forcing Van Ohanian to unlock the store's safe and cleaning out jewelry 
display cases, the thieves hustled the couple back into the car and drove a 
block away, where the gunmen got out and ran away, LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately no one was harmed," LaRue said. "If there's a saving grace, 
that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 LaRue said robbery of expensive jewelry is common, particularly around the 
holiday season. But, he added, he has never before seen this method used. 
Investigators suspect the robbers had been watching the Ohanian home and shop 
for some time before they committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the robbery, the shop's display cases were stocked with the few 
items of jewelry that remained. Friends and neighbors streamed in, offering 
their condolences to family members and vowing to find ways to tighten security 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The store has been robbed three other times, said the Ohanian's youngest son, 
Diron. In fact, Diron said, a thief once pressed the barrel of a gun into the 
chest of his older brother, Terry -- an act that persuaded Diron to find 
another line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is different," said Diron, 28, now a lawyer. "This one's scary, 
because they came into the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Ohanian was questioned by detectives at the store and then returned to his 
home, shaken. "They really are not in the mental state to deal with this," 
Diron Ohanian said of his parents. "They're really devastated. It's not just 
the financial thing -- it's people coming into your home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohanians immigrated to the United States from the Middle East in the 
1950s. Penniless, Van Ohanian worked as a jeweler to support the couple's 
children. In 1968, the family moved from Michigan to California, hoping to make 
it big. In time, they bought their own jewelry store in Toluca Lake and worked 
for 25 years to transform it into a neighborhood fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Van) came here with nothing and built up a family, and saved some money, 
and opened this place up," Diron Ohanian said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the store is insured, but did not know how much, if any, of the loss 
will be covered. "What can you do?" Diron Ohanian asked. His parents are old, 
he emphasized: "It's not like with me -- I can pick up all the pieces and move 
on. . . .But they should be able to be comfortable."

 Gertrude McCubbins didn't want to bother with a monthly mortgage payment or 
have to depend on others to put a roof over her head. So two years ago, she 
used her life savings to pay $90,000 cash for a three-bedroom condominium near 
Woodley Avenue and Chatsworth Street. 
</P>
<P>
 However, her independence was taken away by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, 
which left her 88-unit condo complex uninhabitable. McCubbins, 79, was forced 
to move in first with her son and later get an apartment for herself.

<P>
 Worst of all, she faced losing her life's savings if the building could not be 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Her homeowners' association had no earthquake insurance and the group -- 
composed mostly of first-time and elderly homeowners with limited incomes -- 
was turned down for a Small Business Administration loan because it lacked the 
ability to repay it. Some homeowners simply stopped paying their mortgages and 
allowed the banks to foreclose. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to a no-interest 30-year federal loan, McCubbins and her neighbors 
expect to move back into their rebuilt complex by the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council approved a $2-million loan for the 
association, the first to a large condominium complex under a federal program 
administered by the city's Housing Department for owners of apartments, 
condominiums and single-family home who were turned down for SBA loans after 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very frustrating, it's been kind of hard," McCubbins said. "I broke 
myself buying this place. But I think it's great that we are getting this 
loan." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has taken a year, but we are so thrilled," said Lela Collins, who manages 
the building and was persistent in trying to get a loan to save the 14-year-old 
building. She sent letters to government officials locally and in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will allow homeowners to get back on their feet without having to incur 
additional debt for a few years," said Brian Hatkoff, acting president of the 
Continental Village Condominium Assn., noting that the first payment is not due 
for six years. "Without the loan, the building would not have been rebuilt and 
the city would have been forced to tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not within the boundaries of a "ghost town," the building suffered 
much of the same vandalism as those within the 13 designated clusters of 
severely damaged vacant buildings, and owners were forced to hire private 
security guards to keep vandals out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single door was kicked in and windows were broken," said Hatkoff, who 
was renting out his unit in the complex at the time of the quake. "They took 
appliances and even garbage disposals." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatkoff said the complex sustained about $250,000 in damage from the 
vandalism, and the association has been paying $10,000 a month for security.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Moncrief, director of the major projects division of the city's housing 
department, said the Continental Village condo is precisely the type of 
building officials hoped to help when additional funds were made available by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a group that had very little money left, but they remained organized 
and kept moving forward," Moncrief said. "They have shown courage. I wish we 
could have helped them sooner."

VALLEY BRIEFING / WEDNESDAY SPECIAL: ALL THE TRIMMINGS; ALL ABOUT THE MOST 
POPULAR CHRISTMAS DECORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reported origins of the Christmas tree tradition are varied. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say it began in the 8th Century when St. Boniface replaced Odin's sacred 
oak with a ceremonial evergreen during his effort to Christianize Germanic 
Teutons. Others say it grew from the medieval Dec. 24 Adam and Eve's Day 
celebration, in which an evergreen "Paradise" tree was decorated with apples 
for a retelling of the first family's story. 
</P>
<P>
 The first documented references to Christmas trees come from Latvia and 
Estonia in the early 1500s, when merchants paraded decorated trees through the 
cities of Riga and Reval during Christmas festivities. By the 17th Century, fir 
trees decorated with paper roses, glazed fruit and candies were common Yuletide 
fixtures in European homes. Careful Handling 
</P>
<P>
 Every year a handful of homes are destroyed by Christmas tree fires in Los 
Angeles. Some growers cut their trees in early November to get them to market 
on time, causing the tree to be dried out and fire-prone by the time it reaches 
the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure the tree you buy is still supple, with no needle loss. Ask the seller 
to make a fresh cut at the trunk to improve the tree's ability to absorb water. 
Trees can consume as much as a gallon of water a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Christmas tree fires begin because of faulty lights strung in the 
branches. Never leave a lighted tree unattended and dispose of the tree as soon 
after Christmas as possible. Tracing Their Roots 
</P>
<P>
 Most growers buy young trees from farms that specialize in raising the tree 
from a seed to a sapling about 8 inches in height. Saplings can be purchased in 
bulk for as little as 50 cents each. The most commonly grown tree in Southern 
California, the Monterey Pine, grows at the rate of one foot per year. The 
average tree is ready for market in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers may have as many as 1,000 trees on each acre of land, pruning each 
tree three to four times a year to train the shape. The 40 Christmas tree farms 
in Los Angeles County usually average no more than two acres. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 35 million trees, raised on 15,000 Christmas tree farms covering 
more than 1 million acres, will be sold nationally this year. Tree Origins 
Pre-cut Retail lots: 65% "Choose and Cut": 25% Living: 10% Pricing Varieties 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of the trees sold in Los Angeles come from the Pacific 
Northwest. The three most common are the Monterey pine, Douglas fir and noble 
fir. 
</P>
<P>
 Characteristics: 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey pine: Grows well in warm, dry climates. Long, 3- to 4-inch round 
needles. Dark green color with bushy branches. Costs about $4.50 a foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble fir: Wet, cold climate tree, grown in Oregon and Washington. Short, 
thick 1-inch oval-shaped needles with light green coloring. A sparser branch 
pattern with lots of room for ornaments. $5.50 per foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas fir. Also from colder climates. Medium length, thin 2-inch deep green 
needles. Like the Monterey pine, they have a bushy shape. $4 per foot. Prices 
</P>
<P>
 Averages for Southland in 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Cost of tree: $31. 
</P>
<P>
 Grower profit: $5-8 Surviving Predators 
</P>
<P>
 Trees sold by local growers cost a little more this year because of an 
epidemic of so-called "Grinch fungus" that has killed as many as 40% of the 
trees in choose-and-cut lots. The pitch canker fungus is carried by the tiny 
ips beetle, which bores into the trunk of the tree and spreads the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The fungus breaks down the cells the tree uses to carry nutrients from the 
trunk to the top branches, causing the tree to drown in its own sap. Initial 
symptoms are a lightening of needle color, followed by an oozing of sap from 
holes bored by the beetle. Once symptoms are evident, the tree dies within a 
month. Recycling Your Tree 
</P>
<P>
 Call the city of Los Angeles tree recycling hot line at (800) 587-3356. There 
are three Valley locations for tree recycling and last year more than 60,000 
trees were mulched into wood chips used for ground cover.

FULLERTON, CYPRESS COLLEGES GET PRESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two new presidents were named Tuesday night to lead Fullerton and Cypress 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Martinez, administrative dean of educational programs at Santa Monica 
College, will become president of Fullerton College, and Christine Johnson, 
dean of students at Kings River Community College in Reedley, Calif. will take 
the helm of Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so elated," said Johnson, 49. "I have been preparing for this job for 25 
years and I'm ready to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the North Orange County Community College District had searched 
nationwide for candidates since mid-summer, when Jane Armstrong was appointed 
interim president of 19,000-student Fullerton College and Elma Clamp became 
acting president of Cypress.  
</P>
<P>
 Cypress College, with about 13,000 students, has been without a permanent 
president since Kirk Avery resigned in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton College has been without a president since June, when Philip W. 
Borst, president for 17 years, retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, 55, said she is excited about Fullerton College's active student 
body. "I like that kind of energy," she said. "If people have that kind of 
energy and interest it can be used in a way that's very constructive and 
progressive. It's a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who grew up in San Bernardino and Riverside, has master's and 
doctoral degrees in sociology from UC Riverside. She also is one of the 
founding members of the California Community College Latina Leadership Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a native of Tyler, Tex., has a master's degree in counseling and a 
doctorate in higher education, both from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson developed a program for recruiting and retaining African American 
males in college that was adopted by the state community college system.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 10-YEAR-OLD BOY SHOOTS HIMSELF TO DEATH 
PLAYING WITH HANDGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-year-old boy accidentally shot and killed himself Tuesday while playing 
with a handgun he found in an abandoned car, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at 2:15 p.m. in the 37800 block of 90th Street East as 
the boy played with a .38-caliber gun in the living room of his mother's 
trailer, according to Deputy Britta Tubbs.The boy, whose name was not released, 
died of a single gunshot wound to the head, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy and his 12-year-old brother were visiting an aunt a few blocks from 
their home when the younger boy found the gun in an abandoned car outside his 
aunt's house and did not tell his brother, Tubbs said. When the boys returned 
home, the older brother left the 10-year-old alone while he used the bathroom. 
He heard a shot and ran into the living room, Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He found the other brother lying on the sofa . . . with the gun at his side," 
Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the boys may have been having problems with youths from a 
local park and the younger brother may have wanted the firearm as a form of 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the boys' mother was in shock. "The mother is taking it very 
badly. It is very hard for her," said Sarphine Phillips. "She said the boy 
found the gun under a car but it is all still a mystery."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FELONY CHARGES FILED AGAINST PAIR OVER 
GRAFFITI; PALMDALE: AUTHORITIES SAY THE SUSPECTED VANDALS, BOTH 18, WERE 
INVOLVED IN MORE THAN 75 TAGGING INCIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a tough stand in a case involving more than 75 tagging incidents in 
Palmdale, authorities filed felony vandalism and conspiracy charges Tuesday 
against two teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecutor said the charges, which can lead to a term in state prison, were 
warranted because of the extensive damage the suspected vandals are accused of 
causing. In a tactic that is becoming increasingly common, authorities added 
together the cost of cleaning up many graffiti markings linked to the suspects 
in order to qualify for a felony filing. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palmdale official who supervises the daily removal of graffiti in her city 
applauded the crackdown on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, where we have somebody who has been doing incredibly large amounts 
of vandalism, we're very anxious to prosecute them to the full extent of the 
law," said Terry Stubbings, the city's community relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with the felony were Neal Scott and Michael Furman, both 18-year-old 
Palmdale residents. Scott pleaded not guilty Tuesday in an arraignment before 
Antelope Municipal Court Judge Joseph W. Chandler and remained in custody in 
lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Furman, released from jail after posting $50,000 bail, was ordered to appear 
at a Jan. 4 arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators said that Scott and Furman used spray-paint and other 
marking materials to place their tagging names, "Nut" and "Tada," respectively, 
on structures throughout Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Stubbings said she is very familiar with these monikers. "These people have 
been plaguing our community for some time," she said. "I have seen those names 
on billboards, block walls and curbs -- any type of surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti has become a stubborn crime problem for Palmdale in recent years. The 
city employs two full-time workers to remove local graffiti, usually within 24 
hours after it is reported, and a third worker is sometimes needed to help out. 
</P>
<P>
 During November alone, city workers removed graffiti from 102,439 square feet 
of surface at 508 locations. The city endured one of its worst graffiti sprees 
during October, when vandals marred 186,000 square feet, Stubbings said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Palmdale spent $90,000 in materials alone on graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers were arrested without incident, authorities said. Lt. Tom 
Pigott said their distinctive tagging signatures helped tie them to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can link them definitively to 75 (graffiti incidents) and maybe more," 
Pigott said. "These individuals are believed to be part of a tagging crew. The 
investigation is continuing." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey S. Gootman filed charges Tuesday after 
investigators linked Scott and Furman to more than $5,000 damage, the minimum 
required for a felony conviction under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Gootman said graffiti is usually filed as a misdemeanor, rather than a felony, 
because in isolated offenses the damage rarely exceeds $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a number of incidents can be tied to a single suspect, authorities 
have begun adding together the damages in order to cross the felony threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such case in the San Fernando Valley, Jaime Anthony Rodriguez, 20, of 
North Hollywood, pleaded guilty Monday to felony vandalism. Investigators had 
accused him of tagging 200 sites over a six-month period, causing more than 
$12,000 damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of proof and severity," said Gootman. "These guys have gone 
beyond childish pranks." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Palmdale case, Gootman also charged Scott and Furman with conspiracy, 
defined as an agreement between two or more people to commit an illegal act, 
which is then carried out. "They agreed to do it, and basically went out and 
did it," the prosecutor said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STATE CITES TWO FIRMS OVER WORKER'S FALL DOWN 
HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two construction companies have been cited by the state for safety violations 
at a site where a worker fell down a 66-foot hole in August, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Lozoya, 32, fell into the 2 1/2-foot-wide hole while inspecting the 
shaft.He went into cardiac arrest as he was pulled from the hole after nearly 
four hours, and died two days later at a Santa Clarita hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Two construction companies at the site, Miller Construction Co. of Castaic and 
D.J. Scheffler Co. of Walnut, were cited for not properly securing the shaft 
cover, said Rick Rice, a spokesman for the state Department of Industrial 
Relations, which conducted the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was covered, but the feeling of our investigators was that it should have 
been secured as well," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 The citations have to do with the alleged safety violation, which has not been 
directly named as the cause of the accident. Eyewitnesses have said that Lozoya 
had lifted the cover and was inspecting the shaft when he stepped into it. 
</P>
<P>
 The fines that go with the violations are only about $500 for each company, 
even though the safety violations are classified as "serious," the 
second-highest classification on a four-step rating system, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to realize our penalties have strictly to do with penalty code 
violations, not the resulting effects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said he believes the companies received the safety citations on Monday 
and will have 15 days from that date to appeal. He said if challenged, it could 
be several months before hearings are held and the issue resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA is determining if criminal charges should also be sought concerning 
site conditions, Rice said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the construction companies did not return telephone calls 
Tuesday.

FLIGHT-DELAYING FOG OUT -- BUT TRAFFIC ROLLING IN; TRAVEL: CLEARING TODAY COMES 
IN TIME FOR THE START OF THE HOLIDAY RUSH AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, HIGHWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Forecasters say the thick morning fog that caused delays at John Wayne Airport 
for the third straight day Tuesday is over, just in time for holiday travelers 
to start packing the airport and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year is kind of funny since Christmas is on a Sunday," said Bonnie Koch, 
owner of El Camino Travel in San Clemente. "The heaviest travel will be the 
Friday before Christmas. . . . There are a lot of functions going on (Monday, 
Jan. 2) and everybody has to go back to work on (Jan. 3), so Monday's going to 
be a busy day too." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, from Dec. 20 to Jan. 3, a total of 280,093 people flew in and out 
of John Wayne. This year, more than 300,000 are expected for the same period, 
said Pat Ware, spokeswoman for John Wayne Airport. Last year, when Christmas 
fell on a Saturday, the heaviest flying days were Wednesday and Thursday, with 
about 23,000 passengers using the airport each day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, dense, patchy morning fog delayed flights for more than an 
hour. The fog lifted about 8:30 a.m., but not soon enough for passengers on a 
dozen flights whose takeoffs and landings were delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials are optimistic that travelers won't be affected today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather forecast looks like rain, and fog doesn't come with rain," Ware 
said. "Flights should not be affected since rain does not cause nearly as much 
of a visibility problem as fog does." 
</P>
<P>
 An offshore flow kicking in early Monday night drove fog away early Tuesday, 
and a 40% chance of rain is forecast this afternoon and tonight with clearing 
Thursday. A chance of rain is also expected Saturday, with Christmas Day being 
partly cloudy, said Curtis Brack, a forecaster with WeatherData, which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Highs will be in the 60s to low 70s, and lows will be in the upper 30s to mid 
50s, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents said weather has not had a big effect on their clients, many of 
whom bought tickets in the fall when some airlines were engaged in a price war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Air fares have been so low," said Dianne LaPort, vice president of operations 
for World Travel, which has 15 locations throughout Orange County and the 
Inland Empire.  
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport will be particularly busy this year because the May and 
November additions of Southwest Airlines and Reno Air have increased the 
options for travelers, Ware said. The airport now has 11 commercial airlines.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the fog might not cause delays, airport officials are urging travelers 
to account for the crowds by arriving at least 1 1/2 hours early. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term parking is expected to fill by Thursday, so motorists are advised to 
park at a remote 1,679-space area on Main Street between MacArthur Boulevard 
and Red Hill Avenue. A free shuttle will be available to take passengers to 
terminals, Ware said. More than 300 hourly parking spaces are also available 
immediately in front of the terminal for people picking up family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Skies may be clear, but roads may also be slick from rains. California Highway 
Patrol officers urge people to be cautious, check vehicles before setting off, 
leave plenty of room between each vehicle and avoid drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will be out in force too. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have starting Friday are maximum enforcement periods," which includes 
drunk-driver checkpoints, said Officer Joan Rivas, a spokeswoman for the 
California Highway Patrol in Westminster.  
</P>
<P>
 Freeways with the most traffic will be those that lead out of the county, such 
as the San Diego Freeway and the Santa Ana Freeway, said Kari Keul, spokeswoman 
with the Orange County Traffic Management Center in Santa Ana.

 HO, HO, LOT OF MAIL: If you're late sending a package to someone right here in 
Orange County, and you just know it won't make it by Christmas Day, the U.S. 
Postal Service has a suggestion: Express Mail. . . . If it's the Santa Ana 
area, not only are you guaranteed Christmas Day service, you can have your 
packages delivered by someone in a Santa Claus hat -- if you ask. . . . The 
Santa Ana postal district is one of 36 areas in the U.S. offering "Santa" 
deliveries.

 LITTLE ENERGY: Remember those house calls Anaheim officials started making 
last year to help residents save on their energy bills? Nearly 500 homeowners 
have taken them up on their offer. Maria Cover, spokeswoman for the project,

reduce their utility bills, and others are just very environmentally 
conscious." . . . Besides a complete house survey, the city will even supply 
some energy-efficient lights.

Coast Plaza, or helped build the Orange County Performing Arts Center, he was 
one of the heroes of World War II. . . . Fifty years ago this week, he was 
wounded while with an Army field artillery unit during the last major German 
offensive turned back by the Allies -- known now as the Battle of the Bulge. . 
. . Segerstrom, who left the war as a captain, has modestly declined comment 
about it.

 FRESH-FACE FRESHMAN: If you're the youngest golfer ever to win the U.S. 
Amateur, expect to draw attention. The '94 champion, Tiger Woods of Cypress, 18 
and now a Stanford University freshman, got a couple more nice plaudits this 
week. . . . He was pictured on the cover of the weekly magazine Golf World as 
its "Man of the Year" and was picked by Elle, the fashion magazine, as one of 
the "fresh faces of '95." Says Golf World: "Tiger inspires kids who have never 
had a role model like him."

PROBERS ASK IF CITRON BORROWED TO COVER LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal and state regulators are investigating whether former Orange County 
Treasurer Robert L. Citron plunged the county an additional $600 million into 
debt during the summer to cover mounting losses in his investment pool -- and 
then misled investors about the fund's stability, sources disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One source close to the inquiries said investigators are trying to determine 
whether the operation of the now-bankrupt county fund effectively deteriorated 
into a "Ponzi scheme," in which new investor funds were used to cover earlier 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Securities and Exchange Commission and the state Department of 
Corporations want to know whether Citron and a team of financial consultants 
failed to fully disclose the fund's shaky condition, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, they hope to determine if the $600 million borrowed through a 
note sold in July was used to cover losses in the investment pool, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch, the giant Wall Street investment firm, underwrote the bond 
offering, and Santa Monica-based Leifer Capital served as the county's 
financial adviser. Both firms have been subpoenaed by the SEC as part of its 
investigation into Orange County's fiscal disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents describing the offering to potential investors made no mention of 
the tremendous financial strain the county portfolio was facing as its big bets 
that interest rates would fall proved wrong. If serious enough, non-disclosure 
of crucial information could violate federal securities laws that require 
municipalities to provide investors with a full picture of the risks they face. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A Merrill Lynch spokesman 
reiterated late Tuesday that the firm's conduct in underwriting the note was 
proper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made it quite clear that all the disclosure with regards to the 
$600-million underwriting is complete and all material facts were provided to 
investors," spokesman Jim Wiggins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer officials have refused comment. LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae -- a Los 
Angeles law firm that served as bond counsel on the bond issue -- also has 
refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview last week, acting county Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe 
refused to discuss how the proceeds from the bond sale were used, saying he was 
spending his time "looking ahead, not back." But Raabe insisted that the money 
was never used to cover losses and added: "I don't think I can be much clearer 
on that." 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, the fund borrowed $16 billion, aiming to reinvest the proceeds at 
higher interest rates to boost the pool's return to its investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers of the county's financial dealings said they have concluded 
that the $600 million in bonds issued July 8 was intended to cover losses 
caused by Citron's ill-fated belief that interest rates would decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at it knowing what we know now," one high-ranking county official 
said, "no reasonable person could come to any other conclusion. . . . You'd 
have to assume the treasurer was using money from the fund to cover the losses. 
But no one knew it at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Gruenbaum, a former SEC enforcement officer, said he believes Citron sold 
the $600 million in bonds specifically to meet anticipated "collateral calls" 
-- demands by creditors to pay off a portion of their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they hadn't sold (the bonds), they would have had to sell securities and 
post losses," said Gruenbaum, now a private securities attorney in Los Angeles. 
"It would be astonishing if the SEC wasn't looking into disclosure issues here. 
It is a red flag. It's an issue and it calls for close examination." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and the bankers who worked on recent bond issues refused to 
release documents concerning recent collateral calls made against the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Liability for disclosures to investors falls not only on the municipality 
issuing bonds, but on the financial consultants who help prepare the offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulations require municipal dealers preparing bonds for public sale 
to fully disclose any economic trends, marketing strategies or financial risks 
that could affect the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwriters also must generally disclose in the prospectus any financial 
relationships with the issuer -- such as political donations. Merrill Lynch has 
donated $15,000 to Orange County elected officials since 1986. That includes 
$4,000 donated by its employees to Citron's campaign June 13 -- the day before 
the $600-million bond issue was approved by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But those contributions were not mentioned in the bond disclosures circulated 
to potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Issuers in the municipal market routinely make public statements and issue 
reports that can affect the market for their securities," the SEC said in a 
March report on the need for better disclosure regulations. "Without a 
mechanism for providing ongoing disclosures to investors, these disclosures may 
cause the issuer to violate the anti-fraud provisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents for the bond issue do include several sections on risk. But they do 
not mention that the fund already was in trouble, and the only detailed 
discussion of negative economic trends blames Sacramento for raiding county 
coffers during 1993-94 budget cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-sentence section called "Investment Risk," investors were told: "If 
the county investment pool suffers an overall investment loss on the portfolio, 
pledged monies may be insufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the 
notes." 
</P>
<P>
 In a passage on "The Orange County Investment Pool," investors were told: 
"From time to time, a significant portion of these securities are pledged with 
respect to reverse repurchase agreements authorized by law." 
</P>
<P>
 An SEC staff member in Washington, who asked not to be identified, said any 
precipitous drop in the value of a fund would normally be something that 
potential investors should know in considering a bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Because underwriters are often allowed discretion to decide what is 
"relevant," the staff member said, "it's hard to say anything absolutely under 
the anti-fraud regulations. But that sounds like something that should be 
disclosed. I would say so." 
</P>
<P>
 By June 1, there were reports that the Orange County investment fund had lost 
$1.2 billion in value in five months and that the county had been forced to 
post more than $300 million in extra collateral because the value of the 
securities used to borrow from brokerages had declined as interest rates 
climbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "With rates rising steadily, by July of 1994 the pool would have already lost 
money," said Gruenbaum. Long-term bond yields "had already gone way up, so they 
were losing, losing, losing. The question is whether these losses in the pool 
were fully disclosed to investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers of the $600 million in bonds were simply told in the offering documents 
that as of March 31, the fund's value totaled $7.61 billion, climbing by June 
16 to $7.71 billion, according to bond documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is that you've got lawyers at the table looking at the deal 
trying to decide what is really important to the investors buying these taxable 
notes," said Andrew Kintzinger, president of the National Assn. of Bond 
Lawyers, a group of 3,000 attorneys. "And it's a judgment call. Ultimately, 
it's the county's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Kintzinger questioned whether investors in the Orange County fund knew what 
they were getting into. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not every market downturn or adverse trend is always material, so it doesn't 
need to be told to investors," Kintzinger said. "But looking back at Orange 
County, this clearly does not appear to be one of those cases."

A NEIGHBORHOOD SCOURGED BY CRACK FINDS REDEMPTION; DRUGS: ON 69TH STREET, THE 
PLAGUE DESTROYED DREAMS, LIVES AND FAMILIES. BUT SOME SURVIVED AND FOUND NEW 
LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The aging, wood-frame house that Ronald White once called home -- the house he 
left in search of greatness, the house he returned to in disgrace, the house 
where he now struggles for redemption -- stands at 69th and Normandie in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, its large spreading tree, covering the front lawn, was a magnet for 
crack dealers, providing perfect cover. Today the house is a magnet for White, 
two brothers and three-dozen other recovering addicts. On Sundays they flock 
there to confront the disease that swept over them. 
</P>
<P>
 On this single block, like so many others in Los Angeles' poorer communities, 
the evils of crack converged at once -- the dealing, the homelessness, the 
prostitution and betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 One home after another, one family after the next, was felled by the plague. 
It was not just that lives were lost, it was that life -- simple civility -- 
was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 But remarkably, life has returned to the White family and their neighbors on 
the 1300 block of West 69th Street. What happened there is a lesson in the 
agonizing cycle of survival that crack creates: Only when its users reach moral 
exhaustion can they confront their weaknesses and crawl out. The Family Goes 
Under 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-Ninth Street once symbolized the upward mobility of blacks who migrated 
to Los Angeles from the South, a stream that began after World War II and 
exploded in the 1960s. African Americans settled first near Central Avenue, 
then spread west as opportunities grew. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, when Marie White, a native of Mississippi, moved her family of six 
boys to 69th Street from a cramped apartment two miles east, she found an 
integrated working-class block whose 30 single-family homes had gardens and 
fruit trees. The new arrivals were people with office and Civil Service jobs. 
It was a community with Little League, Pop Warner football, a neighborhood 
beautification program and a culture in which parents watched out for their 
neighbors' children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. White raised her sons to aim high. Ronald never had time for drugs or 
alcohol, nor did he spend much time in the neighborhood. He had his sights set 
on becoming a lawyer. It was a dream he shared with his older brother Ralph and 
his younger one, Reggie. They would one day have the firm White, White & White. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the first post-civil-rights-movement generation of African 
Americans, graduating from high school in the late '60s and early '70s with a 
sense of hopefulness and new wave of affirmative-action programs. "We never 
considered the possibility of failure," Ronald said. 
</P>
<P>
 They went to college and never looked back: Ralph to UCLA, followed by Ronald 
at Loyola Marymount University and Reggie to Redlands University. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three, Ronald was the only one to become a lawyer, graduating from 
Hastings College of Law in San Francisco in 2 1/2 years in 1979 and passing the 
Bar on his first try. He returned to Los Angeles with the goal of making a 
million dollars a year as an entertainment lawyer. A diminutive man with a warm 
and thoughtful manner, he worked for a while with the Legal Aid Foundation of 
Los Angeles, moved to an entertainment management company and even hung out his 
shingle for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 But success eluded him. It did not, as he'd imagined, solve his childhood 
insecurities about his small size, dark complexion and bookish personality. 
There was always something missing -- a hole in his gut -- and in an age-old 
tale of addiction he tried to fill that space with drugs. In college it was 
alcohol and marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt tall, I felt good-looking, I felt popular," he said. "I was part of a 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 By law school he was snorting cocaine. By the time he was practicing law he 
was freebasing it, not long after comedian Richard Pryor severely burned 
himself while freebasing cocaine in a notorious San Fernando Valley incident. 
His suits and professional title kept up the pretense of success. 
</P>
<P>
 Then crack came to town on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it was an experience Ronald enjoyed sharing with his brothers, like 
talking politics or watching a football game. But the drug's brief, intense 
euphoria was overwhelming, and he began spending more and more money, time and 
energy chasing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, at 29, he was living the life of an addict, not a lawyer. He rode the 
bus to work and slept on a couch in Reggie's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he moved back in with his mother. Not long after, Ralph came back 
home. His wife, her bank account depleted, angrily dropped off his clothes. 
Then Reggie followed. They too had become addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The block, whose temptations the older brothers had largely avoided while 
growing up, suddenly became the center of their adult world. Through crack, 
these more sophisticated siblings bonded with two of their younger, less 
successful brothers, Roderick and Ricky. Roderick's street contacts kept the 
older Whites in good supply; Ricky, who was developmentally slow, had a source 
of income: a monthly government check. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, it worked. They were members of that prized brotherhood: crack 
addicts who still had jobs, providing enough cash to party in rented motel 
rooms. Ronald finally felt that sense of power he'd craved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be in charge of the good time, flashing money, spending 
money, being able to call the shots," he said. "We saw it as a paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, they quit their jobs or were fired, and they were no longer 
controlling crack. It was controlling them. They started selling it so they 
could keep buying it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of crack's perversities is how bad it makes you want it. It destroys not 
only people but taboos. Friends (or brothers) who had warmly shared other drugs 
soon began to cheat on each other for crack. 
</P>
<P>
 The White brothers became part of a nocturnal subculture of dealers, 
panhandlers, shopping cart scavengers and prostitutes that haunted the 1300 
block. A house for rent quickly became a crack house. The Whites' garage became 
another. Eventually, homeowners with no connection to crack -- people such as 
Kenneth Middleton, who made his living as a security guard -- would hear their 
doors being rattled in the middle of the night by users presuming that every 
house on the block sold rock. 
</P>
<P>
 There were problems on the block long before crack arrived, to be sure, but 
crack -- in a way that no drug ever had done -- was exacerbating them, 
magnifying and speeding up their effects, turning years into a blur that would 
later stand to many users and neighbors as a scarcely recollectable interval. 
</P>
<P>
 On the street, Ronald was now known as "Lawyer," the man who sometimes dressed 
in suits and offered you legal advice in exchange for a hit on the pipe. He 
became, variously, a small-time con artist, a crack-house doorman and an escort 
for women who sold their bodies for a $10 rock of crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritual controlled him: hustling for money, cutting the deal, cheating and 
stealing more and more, settling for smaller hits . . . anything for another 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a handful of crackheads would sometimes use an abandoned house not far 
from 69th Street to smoke themselves dry. One night they were waiting for a 
young woman to return to the trash-strewn house with money after turning a 
trick at a nearby motel. Like men of a millennium ago they waited in darkness, 
only a candlelight flickering on the floor, no toilet, no running water. They 
had been smoking for hours, days, pausing to break only when the pipe was 
empty, when it was time to hustle more money to buy more crack. Ronald's hands 
were black from the heat of the pipe, his cheeks sunk in, his eyes bulging, his 
skin ashen, stretched tight across his skull. A can of food was warmed on a hot 
plate. No one dared to leave. They might miss out; there would be no sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I said I'd never do, everything I scoffed at, I ended up doing. It 
was pathetic," he said. "But when I was in the life, it seemed like everyone 
was in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever they ran out, the block's main dealer, a younger man named Donnell, 
was waiting. The Dealer Rises 
</P>
<P>
 Donnell Alexander and his two brothers and two sisters lived on the other side 
of 69th in a neat, well-furnished home in the middle of the block. His father 
was a Postal Service worker with high expectations for his son. As a child, 
Donnell had admired the White children on the corner. When he went off to 
community college, he dreamed that he would make it in professional football. 
</P>
<P>
 But crack took Donnell too -- in a different way. Attracted by early reports 
that the new drug was an aphrodisiac, he was one of the first on the block to 
try it; he was disappointed. Then, as the market took flight, he was drawn by 
the financial prospects of selling a drug that forced the users to buy it over 
and over again in an increasingly tighter spiral of abuse. Donnell was 21, 
typical of the youthful first wave of crack dealers. Their customers tended to 
be older men and women, raised in the 1970s, an era that celebrated casual drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnell never had a qualm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was business," he said matter-of-factly. "Crack could make you do anything 
-- anything maybe except shoot yourself in the head, because then you wouldn't 
be able to get any more. I didn't care if the (users') kids didn't eat. I just 
wanted the money -- and crack was a moneymaking machine." 
</P>
<P>
 His early drug experiments had given him contacts among the neighborhood's 
older dealers. He knew how to cook up crack by shaking baking soda with 
cocaine. Donnell had one more advantage: He was not hooked on crack. He was 
hooked on power. The drug would become a tool to manipulate lives like the 
Whites, whose stars shone brighter than his. 
</P>
<P>
 He began delivering crack on a moped and eventually set up crack houses, 
including one that he rented a few doors from his mother's home. With the 
money, he employed a small legion of dealers -- mostly crack addicts -- to 
peddle his product, paying them with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The block was a great source of labor. Ronald and his college-educated 
brothers, selling to support their habits, occupied the lowest rung. Roderick 
White, a childhood friend of Donnell who had hung around the house with few 
ambitions after graduating from high school, often worked as a courier, 
delivering drugs to dealers in San Diego. Donnell didn't trust him; Roderick 
tended to sample what he sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whites joined other sons and daughters of the block who were busy 
transforming 69th into a drive-through minimarket for crack. Louis (Paco) 
Radford, the stepson of another postal worker who lived down the street, was 
also a foot soldier. Next door to Donnell's crack house lived Joanne Smith, who 
sat on the porch and monitored the block for police or other signs of trouble 
in exchange for crack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever left the block," Smith said. "You'd go away for a while and end 
up right back here. The neighborhood just sucked you up. . . . My crack pipe 
was my MasterCard." 
</P>
<P>
 Business at the corner, under the house with the great spreading tree, was 
frenetic. You pulled your car up and got instant service. Sometimes there was a 
rush of competing hustlers. Once Ralph White beat them to a car pulling up to 
the house and held out his rocks. He looked into the car's open passenger 
window, said "What do you need?" and stared into a face that was familiar and 
terrifying. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his mother. A friend was dropping her off from church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned, broke and ran," he said. "Humiliation. Total humiliation." Ronald, 
standing nearby, slipped away into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years this was the nightmare that Marie White, nicknamed Saint Marie 
by her neighbors, lived. She had escaped the harsh rural life in the small 
Mississippi Delta town of Cleveland. She'd come here as a teen-age single 
mother and supported her family by doing everything from housecleaning to 
taking in laundry. In her 40s she'd gone back to school, earning a degree with 
honors from Cal State L.A. And now, just as she began preparing to enjoy her 
own life, her sons' addictions were pulling the house apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Her shoes were stolen from the closet, food from the refrigerator. The gold 
clock she was awarded for community service disappeared. She could not leave 
her purse unattended. Her garage had become a smokehouse for her sons and other 
neighborhood addicts. When she left home for a week on a vacation cruise they 
turned the entire place into a crack house, selling rocks out the front door 
and smoking in the back. After she returned and they closed down sales, 
customers continued to drop by the house at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe educated people did this," she said. "It was the hardest 
thing for me to admit." 
</P>
<P>
 As her sons' devotion to crack hit its peak, she began to suspect that they 
were planning to kill her to take the last of what was left. She called a 
breakfast meeting and confronted them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't even think about killing me to get what I have left," she told them. "I 
don't have anything for you. You won't get a dime." They thought she was crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, she never put her sons out, clinging to the belief that they 
would turn around. She had frequent nightmares that someone would call to tell 
her that one of them was dead. She counted heads to be certain they made it 
through another day. She cringed motionlessly at their stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the day Ronald was assigned by a dealer to hawk marijuana and used the 
profits to buy and smoke crack. 
</P>
<P>
 He was at his mother's house when the dealer came looking for him. On the 
lawn, under the tree, the dealer knocked him down and began kicking and 
stomping him into the street. Out of the corner of his eye, Ronald could see 
his mother on the porch. He was waiting for her to cry out, but she just stood 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, thank you," Mrs. White was saying to herself. "Maybe this will do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 She turned and coldly walked back to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the last person who had believed in me," Ronald said, "and she was 
turning away. That's when I knew I had hit bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day he checked into a rehabilitation center on Skid Row. Off the 
street, he rested for the first time in weeks, suffering through sweats, 
fighting the nagging craving for crack. Bone tired, he did little other than 
sleep and eat. "No more games, no more hustling," he decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald was the first to successfully complete the journey out. Several other 
brothers soon began to slowly push each other in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick saw the change when he got out of jail after serving a six-month 
sentence for selling to an undercover officer. He'd expected the comfort of 
crack at home. It wasn't there. With encouragement from his brothers he checked 
into a treatment center but couldn't stick with it, dropped out and wound up 
living on the street on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, Roderick placed a desperate call home, asking if he would be 
allowed to celebrate Christmas with the family. When he walked into the house, 
his mother didn't recognize him. His clothes were tattered, his hair matted, a 
string holding up his pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "He smelled like something that had been buried," Mrs. White said. "This was 
my baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The other brothers hadn't told their mother where Roderick was. "If you had 
known, you would have gone and got him," Ralph told her. Roderick, the brothers 
insisted, had to make the change himself for the change to stick. It did. 
</P>
<P>
 That Christmas, 1987, was different. The brothers, who used to eat quickly and 
sneak off to smoke, stayed longer and enjoyed each other more. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of their family had saved the White brothers. But just as they 
began to exit the drug life, their block, like so many others throughout Los 
Angeles, was plunging further into hell because of the irreversible forces 
unleashed by the genie called crack. The Block Goes Under 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ways Donnell established his reputation as a dealer was by giving 
free samples. He wanted to be looked upon as a benefactor. Word got around. 
New, competing crack houses sprang up on 69th Street. Throughout South-Central 
Los Angeles, newly prosperous dealers were willing to spend a few hundred 
dollars a month renting inconspicuous single-family homes. Marie White was 
stunned when she realized that the people who had rented the house next to her 
were part of a Jamaican drug gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack users -- some of them middle-class people driving in from a surprising 
swath of Los Angeles -- began turning over paychecks, cars and other 
possessions to Donnell to feed the monster inside them. Donnell remodeled his 
crack house, adding a pool table, a microwave and television monitors to scout 
both ends of the block. At one point he had $50,000 to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was, with all that cash he soon needed protection, not just from the 
police but also from criminals who viewed crack houses as an easy mark. He 
stockpiled Uzis and other automatic weapons -- and made sure competing dealers 
knew about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who opened shop on the block had to first go through us," he said. 
"They had to get our approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Donnell's crack house drew increasing scrutiny. After neighbors complained 
about the traffic, undercover police placed the block under surveillance. One 
night police made a buy outside the house and raided it. Donnell got away, but 
one of his brothers was arrested. Another time, Donnell was shot in the leg by 
a gunman who broke into his father's guest house demanding money. Donnell's 
other brother was shot and stabbed by a rival dealer, who himself was found in 
a car trunk a few days later, shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a target," Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 On surrounding streets, once-reputable neighborhood businesses became fronts 
for crack sales: A hot dog stand added a new, unadvertised item to its menu. An 
ice cream truck repeatedly circled the block long after the children were 
asleep. Pimps were driven out of business by women so addicted to crack that 
they plied their trade alone on the street, in cars and alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Middleton, the security guard, had moved onto the block a couple of 
years before the crack epidemic with his wife and two children. One day, 
returning from a trip to the store, he was confronted by a panicked dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's my stash?" the dealer demanded. Unbeknown to Middleton, the dealer 
had hidden marijuana in the bumper of Middleton's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the ethnicity of Middleton's wife was a drug flash point. Because she was 
Jamaican, and because a Jamaican gang ran a crack house on the block, users 
once mistakenly tried to buy drugs at the Middleton house. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the constant danger, Middleton, like many others, did not confront the 
madness. He adapted, rather than challenge the drug traffickers and their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't bother me, so I didn't bother them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the elders on the block lived in fear of the children. The 
stronger parents laid out the rules and held their breath. Rosalyn Durr, who 
lived a few doors east of the Whites and had grown up a friend of the brothers, 
heard it from her father: You can go to the corner house and stop, or you can 
keep walking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to keep walking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her younger brother, Eric, also missed the worst years of the plague. A couple 
of years before crack's birth, he was sent to prison for killing a man in a 
Marina del Rey nightclub. It was a blessing, Rosalyn decided later. "It 
probably saved his life." 
</P>
<P>
 With business to attend to, Donnell lost sight of what crack was doing to his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 His younger sister, Monique, became hooked and started hanging out in crack 
houses, where she was abused by men who lured her with the drug. She was 17 and 
on the edge of one of the most pitiful sights of the plague: crack-smoking 
women who eventually became prostitutes. These women got pregnant, had children 
and lost them in a cycle of indignity. "Skeezers," the men called them. "Hos." 
"Strawberries." 
</P>
<P>
 Some nights, Joanne Smith, the friend who lived next to Donnell's crack house, 
would find Monique at another crack house, drive her home, stand her up outside 
in front of Monique's parents' house and honk her horn. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never had a chance," Joanne said. "It was a bad scene because she was so 
young." 
</P>
<P>
 One evening the two planned to go out smoking together, but Monique rushed off 
for a date with a man in a rust-colored car. She said she would be back in a 
few minutes but never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "She ran off, and I had this feeling that something is wrong, very wrong," 
Joanne said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 12, 1988, Monique's nude body was found by a man walking his dog in 
an alley near Vernon and Western avenues. She had been shot several times. 
Police listed her as one of several possible victims of a serial killer who 
preyed on prostitutes and crack users. 
</P>
<P>
 Monique's death had a chilling effect on the block. It was the first killing 
that could be blamed, at least indirectly, on crack. Donnell was horrified by 
the fact that she had bled to death -- and troubled by his own, unsubstantiated 
fear that Monique had been murdered in retaliation by a customer he'd ripped 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing Monique made Joanne, 25 -- the mother of a 5-year-old girl and now 
pregnant -- begin to question her addiction. But it did not make her stop. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, something else did. 
</P>
<P>
 After five days of marathon smoking, Joanne awoke early one morning and found 
herself in a hotel about 40 blocks from home. She gathered her purse and a bag 
of clothes and started walking home. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the way, she would later remember, she blanked out but kept 
walking. She must have been drifting along in a haze for a block when she heard 
a horn blow, and a man's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lady! Lady!" he said. "Baby! What's wrong with you?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was an older man in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been following you for the longest," he said. "You have been walking 
and crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne told the man she just wanted to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you live?" he asked. "I don't want to know the address." 
</P>
<P>
 She stumbled to his car and he drove her to the corner of 69th Street and 
Normandie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever is troubling you in your life," he told her, "you need to change 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne walked into her house. She remembered the man, the ride home, but 
everything else was a blank. And maybe that was good, she said to herself. 
Somehow during her journey, she lost her purse and the clothes bag. She had a 
scar on her forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened? I don't know," she said. "I was pregnant and tired. When I got 
inside my house, I got on my knees and prayed: 'God just give me the strength 
to quit because I'm tired.' And that is when I first decided to give up smoking 
dope. But in my mind I still wanted to get high." 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, five years after crack came to town, she would take her last hit 
on a pipe, early in the morning on Feb. 4, 1989. It was the day she gave birth 
to her son Demon, who entered the world with the shakes, suffering from his own 
addiction to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Under court order, Joanne left the baby with relatives and checked into a 
treatment center. She hasn't smoked since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a choice." she said. "I could smoke dope or have my children. I chose 
to have my children. I had smoked off paychecks, good jobs, good men. Just 
imagine all the time and energy I spent into getting high, what I could have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 The same questions were going through Ronald White's mind. By the time Joanne 
quit, Ronald had been clean for two years. He had more options than most 
crackheads on 69th Street. He had been working as a proofreader and a 
bookkeeper, and now he started to wonder how he might reclaim his legal career 
-- and how he might explain that gaping hole in his resume, the years he'd 
spent on crack. 
</P>
<P>
 He applied for an opening in the public defender's office. He was brought 
before a team of attorneys and ultimately the agency's chief, Wilbur 
Littlefield. They reviewed his resume and indicated they liked what they saw. 
There was, however, one question, the one that Ronald dreaded. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the truth, and he told them drugs were no longer part of his life. The 
job was his. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a difficult decision," said Littlefield, who retired last year. "We 
are there to help people, to give people a chance. If the public defender 
wouldn't do it, then who would?" 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Ronald moved out of his mother's house and was on his own. He married in 
1991, the same year his wife gave birth to a son, Ronnie. The proud father was 
there to cut his son's umbilical cord. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, three streets away at Florence and Normandie, the Los Angeles 
riots erupted in the wake of the verdict acquitting policemen accused of 
beating Rodney King. On their television sets, residents watched neighbors 
throwing rocks and bottles and looting. The very rioters convicted of brutally 
beating trucker Reginald Denny were acquaintances. Henry Keith Watson grew up 
on the block. Damian Williams lived a few blocks away, and Antoine Miller was 
also known in the neighborhood. Miller's mother was known on the block too, for 
her past addiction to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons the neighborhood is hard-pressed to explain, crack use seemed to 
surge upward after the riots, then leveled off and plummeted. Donnell got 
himself arrested for the first time for selling and served half a year. Paco 
Radford, who sold drugs on the block, was also arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 A painful transformation was occurring. Gradually, people who spent their time 
living to buy crack were disappearing -- dying or going to jail or starting to 
grope toward salvation. It was as though the fire that had consumed the block 
and the neighborhood had run out of brush to burn. New communities of users 
were sprouting throughout Los Angeles as the plague slowly ebbed in its first 
home in South-Central and lurched elsewhere. A struggling sense of the old 
vibrancy began to return to the 1300 block of 69th Street. The Neighborhood 
Watch club was rekindled. Cleanup campaigns began. Residents chipped in to 
beautify each other's front lawns. The block club fought a successful battle to 
limit hours of a nearby liquor store. Rosalie Galpin, 70, a retired machine 
shop worker who had lived in her home for half a century, noticed the 
difference. She had watched the block fall with a sense of frightful 
wonderment, closing herself off from it, making less neighborly chitchat, 
losing friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that some of those young culprits are gone, things have gotten a lot 
better," she said. "People are trying harder to keep the neighborhood up." 
Epilogue 
</P>
<P>
 Donnell, 31, abandoned a life as a dealer after his arrest. He now works with 
his father, Porter Alexander Jr., in the construction business and believes he 
was a pawn of a government conspiracy to circulate drugs in the black 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 He got out, he said, because he got sick of playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of trying to figure out who I was going to jack (rob) next," he 
said. "It was a sickness." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Smith, free of drugs for five years, has three children: Schvetta, 11, 
Demon, 5, and Louis, 2. She also provides a room for two other children whose 
parents were lost to crack. Her youngest child was fathered by Paco Radford, a 
seller on the block. Paco was shot to death in a domestic dispute last year 
with another woman in a Gardena hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie White lives with one son, Roderick, in the house with the great 
spreading tree. Two family photos hang on her living room wall. One reveals a 
family of men with gaunt, tired faces, warped by life on the street. Ronald 
didn't make that picture. The second photo, full of round, healthy faces, 
brightens up the room. 
</P>
<P>
 She knew her voice would echo and eventually steer her boys home, Mrs. White 
says. It wasn't simply her wisdom. It was the values of the neighborhood: the 
friends, the teachers, the extended family -- the civility nobody seemed to 
believe in any more. It grew on this block. It had been resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really gave up hope," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday mornings, a crowd of 30 to 40 gathers at the house. It is a recovery 
group, loosely modeled on Alcoholic Anonymous, formed and zealously promoted by 
Ronald in his commitment to staying clean. Of the 12 steps to recovery, he 
says, the first is the most important: The need to admit that you have a 
problem, that you are powerless unless you resolve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Ronald strains to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was filtered through eyes that were not quite seeing reality," he 
says. "It was like suffering amnesia. Every so often, snippets and pieces come 
back and you say, 'Who? Did I really do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph White, 41, has remarried and works as a paralegal for a Downtown law 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie, 38, is an office worker for a Downtown corporation and is married. 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick, 35, works nights in a recovery home for addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky, 37, has his own place a couple of blocks from his mother's home. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ronald, 40, the saga of 69th Street has carried over into his routine as a 
deputy public defender at the Compton Courthouse, where he often juggles 30 
criminal cases, many involving people on crack. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson? "Sometimes," he says, "you have to hit the bottom before you can 
reach back and see the way out." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day in the courthouse, White represented a gang member accused of 
shooting his girlfriend's foot half off in a jealous rage. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man sat sternly in his chair as the woman hobbled to the witness 
stand and relived the painful experience that permanently crippled her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the prosecutor concluded her questioning, Ronald asked his client a few. 
The gang member's eyes never turned in his victim's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ronald asked the young woman to show her mangled foot. She lifted it, 
covered in a neat, white sock. He asked her to take off the sock. A hush fell 
as she slowly, painstakingly, removed the sock and revealed what was left of 
her foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's defiant expression melted away to reflect his horror at what 
he had done. It was the reaction White had hoped for. This wasn't about 
tactics, he would explain later. It was about morality. He wanted the gang 
member to taste the consequences of his act. He wanted him to hit rock-bottom.

RETIRING O.C. SUPERVISORS TELL REMORSE 
</P>

 As Orange County officials predicted layoffs as soon as next month, retiring 
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder expressed remorse Tuesday 
over the financial crisis that has pushed the county into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about you, but I wish I had listened just a bit more, questioned 
just a bit more, and trusted just a bit less," said Riley, 82, a former Marine 
general and 20-year board veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tragic, unfortunate and awful to have my county going through this 
ordeal as I leave office," said the 74-year-old Wieder, who had been on the 
board for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Riley and Wieder attending their final regular board meeting, an angry 
group of residents demanded that supervisors cut their pay in the wake of the 
county's $2.02-billion investment loss. They also called for the elimination of 
perks -- such as the board's county-provided cars -- and a reduction in county 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you are bad people or crooked, but just basically decent folks 
seduced by the power of spending other people's money," said Bill Ward, an 
electronics consultant from Costa Mesa. "You have become severely out of touch 
with working taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The crisis will "definitely" result in layoffs, one high-ranking county 
official said -- a prediction echoed by other managers. Among those departments 
expected to be hardest hit by an estimated $10-million-a-month budget shortfall 
are the offices of the county administrator, auditor-controller and county 
counsel. Officials could not estimate how many county workers might lose their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed Ernie Schneider, the 
county's top administrative officer, seeking a broad range of documents that 
relate to his dealings with Merrill Lynch, the leading underwriter of Orange 
County bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency has previously sought personal documents from all five 
supervisors, former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, acting treasurer 
Matthew R. Raabe and several Merrill Lynch brokers who did business with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 * SEC and Orange County district attorney's office investigators worked side 
by side in the treasurer-tax collector's office, copying documents on microfilm 
as they seek to determine whether anyone broke the law. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg said he would expand his review of Citron's books 
to include all contracts with outside investment brokers and the fees each 
earned. The auditor's team also will investigate whether the county skirted 
competitive bidding procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg said he was asked by state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) to 
focus on the county's dealings with Merrill Lynch, which has denied any 
impropriety. The results may be turned over to the state attorney general's 
office if Citron is found to have violated government codes in his dealings 
with brokers, Sjoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 * In good news for Orange County, the Federal Reserve did not raise interest 
rates after the year's final meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee. 
Another increase in interest rates would have further devalued the county's 
beleaguered investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 * A coalition of local government finance groups convened by the U.S. Treasury 
Department pledged "to work together to promote sound investment policies and 
practices by state and local governments." The group said it will promote the 
use of model investment guidelines and identify possible regulatory or 
oversight issues that require government attention. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ripples from the Orange County debacle continued to be felt as far away as 
Texas, where state officials said they spent $55 million averting a crash of 
their own municipal investment fund, known as TexPool. State Treasurer Martha 
Whitehead said a $2-billion run on the pool by panicky municipalities -- which 
cut its size to $1.47 billion -- seemed to have ended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) called for a Fair Political Practices 
Commission investigation of Citron. In a letter to FPPC Chairman Ben Davidian, 
Conroy suggested that the former treasurer may have violated the state 
Political Reform Act by accepting gifts from firms that do business with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County began auctioning off the riskier portion of its remaining 
portfolio. Salomon Bros. sold about $1.24 billion of notes and foreign-issued 
certificates of deposit, but the firm declined to say how much the sales netted 
the county. Investment sources said as much as $624 million of the proceeds 
will be used to pay off loans held by Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last securities purchased by the county's investment pool, a 
$600-million fixed-rate note issued by the Student Loan Marketing Assn., was 
among the instruments sold Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron bought the entire Sallie Mae issue Nov. 1. Financial analysts say the 
county almost certainly took a sizable loss on the sale, as it purchased the 
notes for $3.8 million more than their face value and they were most recently 
quoted for sale at 95 cents on the dollar. At that price, the county would 
realize close to a $34-million loss on those notes alone. 
</P>
<P>
 However, traders said the county would benefit in one important way from the 
sale: Because the notes do not mature for 10 years, the sale will cut the 
average maturity of the county portfolio. A shorter average maturity will 
reduce the investment pool's exposure to movements in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sold Tuesday were $24 million in notes issued by the Government National 
Mortgage Assn. and $580 million in certificates of deposit issued by a number 
of foreign banks. The foreign CDs were likely to have been sold at the deepest 
discount, investment sources said, as they were structured notes whose payouts 
decline as interest rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county's new investment consultant, Salomon Bros. is expected to 
collect more than $1 million in fees, along with commissions and a percentage 
of the now-bankrupt investment pool; in all, the firm could be paid more than 
$5 million, according to county records. The county has paid the Wall Street 
firm $500,000, and Salomon will receive $150,000 a month for at least six 
months to continue assisting county officials, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 As the auction of the portfolio continued, the Board of Supervisors faced its 
most vocal and bitter crowd since the county filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen speakers berated supervisors, accusing them of failing to 
exercise oversight and leadership in the crisis, which has jeopardized the 
investments of 187 cities, school districts and other public agencies, along 
with 435 minors whose court settlements were deposited in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "To point out to the public that you feel you lack the expertise to understand 
complex financial transactions does not excuse past performance nor reassure 
the public that you are capable of dealing with the current crisis," said 
Connie Haddad, president of the League of Women Voters of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a countywide taxpayer group known as the Committees of 
Correspondence warned that the group might try to oust the officials if they do 
not show good faith in meeting the demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are giving them the demands. If they want to cooperate, fine," said Bill 
Mello, a Huntington Beach activist. "If they don't want to cooperate, they are 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The Committees of Correspondence, which include members of Ross Perot's United 
We Stand group, issued a list of seven demands to the board and asked each 
supervisor to pledge by Jan. 4 to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands include: a 10% reduction in the salaries of supervisors, the chief 
administrative officer and the county auditor; elimination of car allowances; 
cutting board staff expenses by half; contracting county services to private 
entities, and signing a pledge not to accept federal or state assistance or 
raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are responsible for this," Mello said. "They should share in the 
suffering along with everyone else. . . . If this had happened in the private 
sector, they'd all be fired immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the supervisors signed the pledge when given copies at Tuesday's 
meeting. Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he was examining "the contents of the 
proposal." Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said, "I'm serving my constituents," not 
outside interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the downtown Civic Center concourse about three dozen investigators 
continued poring over documents at the treasurer's office, with a now-familiar 
orange van parked outside the building behind yellow crime-scene tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the district attorney's office are seizing documents from 
the treasurer's and auditor's offices that involve any disclosures made to 
investors in the county investment pool. They also are gathering documents on 
specific dealings between the treasurer's office and investment bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wiechert, Citron's attorney, said he remained baffled about why 
investigators would seek a search warrant for the records of the former 
treasurer, who cleared out of his office when he resigned two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC, which last week subpoenaed personal and office documents from top 
county officials, is taking a broader look at whether elected officials steered 
business to Merrill Lynch in exchange for kickbacks. County officials and 
Merrill Lynch strongly dispute the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron is scheduled to testify before the SEC on Jan. 20 in Los Angeles. 
Raabe, who took office after Citron resigned, is to testify Jan. 19, according 
to sources close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the search of county offices continued for a second day, employees 
described an office in a virtual state of paralysis, with authorities carting 
away computers and boxes of records. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's officials have said they wanted to carry out the searches 
without hampering normal county operations and would leave copies of all 
documents that employees need for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Luster said thousands of pages of records were seized, with no copies 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Several city officials said Tuesday that they had been interviewed last week 
by investigators from the district attorney's office who questioned them about 
whether Citron's staff had misrepresented the risks of investing in the county 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, which invested $48.6 million in the pool, investigators 
"generally wanted to know how the county represented the fund to us," said 
deputy city administrator Richard Barnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Eric Lichtblau, Lee Romney, Tracy Weber and Rebecca 
Trounson in Orange County and Michael Hiltzik in Los Angeles contributed to 
this report.

PANEL TAKES OVER MONITORING LAPD REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated by the pace of reforms at the Los Angeles Police Department, the 
Police Commission has stripped primary authority for investigating the status 
of those reforms from the department and taken over the job, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our responsibility to the community to do this," said Gary Greenebaum, a 
member of the Police Commission and a leading advocate of reform. "We believe 
this will expedite the reforms, which is our job." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the blue-ribbon group known as the Christopher Commission issued its 
recommendations in 1991, the department has struggled to implement many of the 
report's proposals. Particularly frustrating to advocates of reform has been 
the slowness to push ahead with recommendations involving LAPD personnel, 
including training, discipline and tracking of potentially problem officers. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed computer system to simplify tracking is not in place after more 
than two years. Image-conscious officials have changed the name of that system 
from OBITS, an ominous acronym for a system that will hold officers' 
disciplinary records, to the friendlier-sounding TEAMS, short for Training, 
Evaluation and Management System. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have made recent strides toward bringing the new system on line, 
it has yet to be activated, and officials are continuing to debate how much 
information about officers should be available to supervisors via computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic system is designed," said Bill Russell, commanding officer of the 
LAPD's support services bureau. "We've resolved all the technological issues." 
</P>
<P>
 To push forward that and other reforms, the Police Commission last year began 
demanding updates from the LAPD, but the department's reports are often vague 
-- listing recommendations as "partially in place" when there is little 
evidence of progress, or as "subject to discussions with the police union." As 
a result, some commissioners have bristled at what they perceive as 
foot-dragging by department leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new approach, the staff of the five-member commission, which 
oversees department policy, will take over auditing reform proposals and will 
present its findings to Police Chief Willie L. Williams. The chief will be 
responsible for responding to those findings and will be held accountable for 
performing to the commission's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "From now on," Greenebaum said, "the commission staff will take the lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Reform advocates cautiously applauded the shift, saying they hoped that it 
would strengthen the civilian commission's hand in its relationship with the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it will be better under this system," said Joe R. Hicks, executive 
director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los 
Angeles. "The pace of some of these reforms has been glacial." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Parachini, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern 
California, agreed, calling the pace of reforms in some areas, especially the 
training of officers, "inexcusably slow." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is a step in the right direction," Parachini said. "It can only 
be a positive step to have the commission judging the department and not the 
department judging itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had no comment Tuesday when Greenebaum announced the changes at a 
meeting of the Police Commission. Members of the panel said later that the 
chief had not expressed any opinion about the new procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 He has, however, designated the department's second-highest official, 
Assistant Chief Ronald Banks, to work with the commission on pressing ahead 
with reform. Williams is a vocal backer of Christopher Commission reforms and 
was brought to the LAPD with a mandate to change the way the department 
operates. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his backing for the reforms, Williams' success with implementing some 
of them has been mixed. In recent months, frustration with his leadership has 
mounted in some quarters. Although they expressed support for him generally, 
some commission members have said they would like to see the chief move more 
aggressively on the reforms and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the commissioners met privately for several hours to discuss their 
year-end evaluation of Williams' performance as chief. Afterward, they declined 
to comment on their review, which still has not been delivered to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 As they survey the record on implementing Police Department reforms, 
commissioners concede that there have been both successes and disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the commission's recommendations were put in place by city voters with 
the 1992 approval of Charter Amendment F, the sweeping reform initiative that 
established term limits for the chief of police and created other civilian 
controls over the Police Department's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the LAPD has implemented some other reforms that were not part of 
the original ballot measure. In recent months, police disciplinary review 
boards have for the first time included a civilian member. The idea was raised 
by the Christopher Commission and resisted by some officers but ultimately 
approved by the Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a number of recommendations remain stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 One major source of concern for the commissioners has been the slow 
development of cultural awareness training. The commission members also have 
expressed dismay that there have not been quicker improvements in field 
training given to officers once they graduate from the Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Overarching all the proposed reforms is the mandate for the LAPD to move 
toward a more community-oriented style of policing. That task is under way in 
some areas, but the transformation has been far slower than advocates had 
hoped. Progress, according to department officials, has been hampered by a lack 
of clarity about what community policing entails and a lack of commitment of 
LAPD resources to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the reform proposals are stalled because of a lack of money, 
others have been slowed by mix-ups, by a lack of resolve and by the need to 
resolve differences with the police union, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Zine, a director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said 
talks between the union and the city have been cumbersome at times. But he 
stressed that the league has not sought to block meaningful reform of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would definitely say that the meet-and-confer process has not slowed down 
the progress of any important reform," he said. "But any time you want to 
change working conditions, you have to meet and confer." 
</P>
<P>
 Police commissioners acknowledge that the union should be consulted as changes 
that could affect the working life of police officers are undertaken. Moreover, 
several commissioners have taken pains to address officers' low morale and are 
reluctant to make changes that could further depress the dispirited rank and 
file. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the push for department reform remains one of the commission's 
highest priorities, and panel members said they expect the new procedure for 
monitoring progress to improve the department's current record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our efforts are to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the reports in this 
area," said commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr. "That's what this 
approach is intended to do." Christopher Commission

INTEL, IN SHIFT, TO OFFER FREE REPLACEMENT OF FLAWED CHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reeling from an unprecedented consumer uproar, Intel Corp. reversed course on 
Tuesday and offered free replacements for its flawed Pentium computer chip 
along with a "sincere apology" for its botched handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, one of the nation's largest and most profitable high-tech companies, 
had tenaciously resisted such a move for weeks, arguing that the Pentium flaw 
was a minor problem affecting only a few scientists. But analysts say Intel 
failed to recognize that the personal computer business has become a consumer 
products business -- and customer expectations have changed accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The belated mea culpa could cost Intel as much $1 billion, and it promises 
months of chaos in the PC world as consumers and vendors scramble to replace 
millions of Pentium chips. It remains unclear whether Intel will be able to 
avoid lasting damage to its reputation and its position as the dominant 
supplier of microprocessors, which form the brains inside personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel President and Chief Executive Andrew S. Grove is widely regarded as one 
of the most brilliant men in American business, but over the last several weeks 
analysts say he has failed to understand the simplist of business maxims: the 
customer is always right. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in an early morning conference call with reporters and analysts 
Tuesday from company headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., Grove admitted that 
Intel had mishandled the issue by, for example, grilling consumers who wanted 
replacements to see if the replacement was really necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some people this seemed arrogant and uncaring; we apologize for that," 
Grove said. Intel's apology and offer to replace the chip without questions 
asked will be published in national newspapers in America, Japan and Europe 
beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentium problem emerged last month when a Virginia math professor said 
Intel's newest and most elaborate microprocessor made mistakes in certain 
division calculations. Intel then disclosed that it had known about the problem 
since last summer. That admission infuriated many customers, who took to the 
Internet computer network to air their indignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Major newspapers then began to report the problem, and IBM Corp. sounded 
another alarm last week when it said it would stop shipping Pentium chips. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this was a rude awakening for Intel, which had been accustomed to 
dealing with technically sophisticated buyers who were willing to accept a 
certain level of flaws in a chip. Consumer outrage expressed over electronic 
mail and in tens of thousands of phone calls to Intel's hot lines played a key 
role in the company's change of heart, according to Intel insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intel has been an engineering driven company and they took a hard-core 
engineering stance," said John Lazlo, analyst at Paine Webber. "It proved to be 
the wrong stance and they had to eat their words." 
</P>
<P>
 Admitted a somewhat befuddled Grove: "What we view as an extremely minor 
problem has taken on a life of its own." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he apologized, Grove warned that leading edge microprocessors like 
the Pentium are so complex "testing methodology cannot ensure that all errors 
will be caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Such admissions are a surprise to many consumers who have equated high 
technology with high accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This represents a loss of innocence for consumers buying computers," said 
Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future, a Menlo Park-based think 
tank. "It will be a long time before buyers trust computers or computer 
manufacturers again. People can't assume that just because it's in silicon it 
is accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Intel itself has been a leader in the drive to make the PC a consumer product, 
and it has deliberately sought to build its own brand name with the 
$150-million "Intel Inside" advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will now have to work hard to repair its image on two fronts: with 
consumers who might associate the company with the flawed chip, and with 
personal computer manufacturers who have long resented Intel's power and are 
furious over the way the company has handled the Pentium problem. 
</P>
<P>
 While IBM and Compaq Computer said early on that they would replace Pentium 
chips for any of their customers, other vendors, including Dell, AST Research 
and Gateway 2000, stuck by Intel's assurances that there was no problem -- and 
now look foolish for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 How effectively Intel redeems itself may depend on its handling of the messy 
logistics of responding to millions of consumers likely to demand replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is working its employees seven days a week to get a corrected chip 
into full production, but the reality is that there won't be enough of the 
"clean chips" to go around for some time. Intel said there was a 60-day waiting 
list for replacing chips even before the announcement was made. That list could 
easily lengthen. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Banks, an analyst for Dataquest, a San Jose-based research firm, 
estimates that Intel will ship 8 million of the flawed chips before it converts 
completely to production of the corrected versions. He believes that all 3 
million of the corporate buyers of the chips will eventually demand 
replacements while about 1 million of the 5 million consumer users will ask for 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 With each replacement costing Intel up to $200, Banks estimate the total cost 
to Intel at up to $800 million. On the low side, John Lazlo, a Paine Webber 
analyst, estimates the cost at $150 million to $200 million. Those costs value 
the chips at production cost of about $30 a piece and don't include the lost 
"opportunity cost" from having to divert chip production for filling 
replacement orders rather than selling them for their market value of $500 to 
$1,000 apiece. Opportunity costs could be in the billions of dollars, analysts 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel will take an unspecified charge against earnings in the fourth quarter 
to cover the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers, who are looking anxiously over their shoulders to see if the Intel 
flap will hurt Christmas sales, said they are content with the Intel move. 
"Intel's put the whole thing to rest today," said Jim Halpin, chief executive 
officer of CompUSA, the largest chain of computer stores. "If a customer wants 
a new chip, Intel will replace it." 
</P>
<P>
 Halpin angrily blames "reporters and analysts" for exaggerating the importance 
of the flaw and insists that the task of replacing chips will be a simple one 
that can be handled by existing in-house technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 PC makers are hiding their annoyance. "It's a significant business 
distraction," says Michele Moore, spokeswoman for Dell computer. "We've had to 
incur additional costs. It hasn't been an easy situation." Moore said the cost 
of replacing chips would be "either born by Intel or be immaterial." 
</P>
<P>
 But these are the same PC makers and retailers who have been telling consumers 
all along that flaws in the Pentium chip were not a serious concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoppers might be scratching their heads about what they heard from (shops) 
last week," said Dan Ness, analyst at Computer Intelligence Infocorp, a La 
Jolla-based marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate computer buyers could face significant costs. Carter Lusher, a vice 
president covering personal computers for Gartner Group, says it will cost from 
$31 to $289 per computer for companies to find the flawed computers and make 
the necessary changes even if they get the chip from Intel free. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way Intel can make this a purely painless upgrade," said Lusher.

MEXICO MOVES TO COUNTER REBELS; CHIAPAS: NO ARMED CLASHES REPORTED AS 
GOVERNMENT SENDS ARMY TO RETAKE AREAS HELD BY ZAPATISTAS. PRESIDENT, CITING A 
'CLIMATE OF INSECURITY,' DEVALUES THE PESO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With nearly a dozen towns in open revolt and dozens more infiltrated by armed 
Indian rebels and peasant supporters in Chiapas, the Mexican army on Tuesday 
sent a convoy of armored vehicles and hundreds of troops and riot police to 
tear down roadblocks, retake rebel-held territory and reassert the government's 
tenuous authority in the southern state. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show of military force after a day of peaceful insurrection that rocked 
Mexico's investment market and threatened the national economy, hundreds of 
soldiers and riot police cleared felled trees from highways and pulled down 
banners declaring "Welcome to Zapatista Territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a "climate of insecurity" that they attributed to the Zapatistas' 
latest mobilization, President Ernesto Zedillo's economic advisers announced 
after an all-night meeting that the government was forced to devalue the peso, 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 That extreme move forced the peso down 15% -- bitter medicine for most 
Mexicans less than a week before Christmas -- and underscored how Chiapas has 
become a critical test case with far-reaching implications for the new 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of armed clashes as the convoy moved through mountainous 
Chiapas. At least 11 of the 38 towns that the rebel Zapatista National 
Liberation Army claimed to have "liberated" on Monday publicly declared their 
allegiance to a parallel "government in rebellion," which was set up last week 
by the state's opposition leader, Amado Avendano. The populist newspaper 
publisher is regarded by the Zapatistas as the state's legitimate governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses, local officials and news agencies reported that most of the armed 
rebels, dressed in the Zapatistas' trademark ski masks and bandannas, appeared 
to have fled to surrounding mountains from positions they had occupied on 
Monday, including the town of Simojovel de Allende about 30 miles north of the 
city of San Cristobal de las Casas. The federal forces peacefully retook 
Simojovel Tuesday night, nearly 24 hours after local officials said the rebels 
had left. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo insisted in a speech in Mexico City on Tuesday that the army remained 
committed to its unilateral cease-fire. But in a clear attempt to turn public 
opinion against the Zapatistas and their charismatic leader, the president took 
the verbal offensive against the rebel group, blaming them for the nation's 
deepening economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a conflict that has caused too much anguish in all Mexicans, a 
conflict that has slowed down the economic recovery and has cast a shadow over 
the prospects for the country's economic development," Zedillo declared at a 
cultural engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a conflict that has slowed job creation, a conflict that has begun to 
cut into the Mexicans' savings and threatens their fair aspirations for 
well-being, above all for the men and women of Chiapas." 
</P>
<P>
 The president also indicated that his government may arrest and prosecute the 
Zapatistas, and not only for Monday's actions. He said he had ordered the 
attorney general to investigate whether the rebels and their leader can be 
charged with federal crimes for any of their acts since they first rose up 
against the government Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zedillo reiterated that, after speaking to "all major political figures in 
the country," he was standing by his commitment to negotiation rather than 
aggressive military action in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I reiterate my government's determination always to search for avenues 
of dialogue and negotiation to resolve the conflict in Chiapas and any other 
place," he said. "In this search, our patience never will be exhausted, even 
when confronted with the isolated acts of violence that have taken place in the 
last hours." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there had been no reports of violence or clashes on Monday either, 
although it remained unclear whether the army would encounter opposition as it 
continued to move through areas the rebels seized the previous day. And so far, 
the worst impact of the Zapatista mobilization appeared to be in the nation's 
economic markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The movements drove Mexico's stock market down more than 4% on Monday, shocked 
financial communities in the United States and Europe and left political 
analysts in Mexico City increasingly concerned that the revolt could spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar chaos is brewing in several other Mexican states, where post-election 
opposition protest movements similar to the one that ruptured the Zapatistas' 
11-month truce in Chiapas have shut down oil wells in Tabasco and blockaded 
town halls in other states this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's handling of the Chiapas crisis, political analysts say, will help 
determine the future stability of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstering the president's strategy to isolate the Zapatistas and turn public 
opinion against their leader, who uses only the nom de guerre Subcommander 
Marcos, are recent opinion polls showing Zedillo with strong popular support 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 A weekly opinion survey by a Mexican pollster just before the Chiapas crisis 
erupted indicated that 84% of Mexicans supported Zedillo's Cabinet choices, his 
proposals for sweeping judicial reforms, increased powers for the elected 
Parliament and a legislative peace commission for Chiapas; 58% -- 10% more than 
voted for Zedillo on Aug. 21 -- said their opinion of Zedillo and his new 
government was favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Chiapas, one of Mexico's most impoverished states, where a history of 
favoritism and ruling-party corruption spawned the Zapatista movement a year 
ago, the rebels still appeared to have widespread popular support.

$53-MILLION GRANT TO BOOST L.A. COUNTY SCHOOL REFORM; EDUCATION: ANNENBERG 
FOUNDATION GOAL IS MORE INDIVIDUALIZED TEACHING. MATCHING FUNDS MUST BE RAISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ambitious effort to consolidate many of the myriad public school reform 
efforts in Los Angeles County under one umbrella, while transforming hundreds 
of campuses into laboratories of change, will be launched today with a 
$53-million challenge grant from the Annenberg Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is short on specifics, will seek to help selected 
"families" of schools create idyllic settings in which teachers are highly 
trained and motivated, parents are deeply involved and students' intellectual 
curiosity is cultivated. It will also seek to achieve efficiencies of scale by 
linking philosophically similar reform efforts that operate under various names 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The first challenge facing the project's corporate, university and community 
backers is raising local matching funds. But developers of the so-called Los 
Angeles Metropolitan Project (LAMP) said money already being spent on school 
reform, as well as public funds, can be used for that purpose, along with 
donations from private foundations and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The money -- $106 million, if fund-raising goals are met -- could start 
flowing as soon as matching funds materialize. The Annenberg funds will not be 
used to hire more teachers, buy books or computers or renovate school 
buildings. Rather, they are intended to go for training teachers, gathering 
data, analyzing the progress of schools toward a set of specific goals and 
making it possible for school faculties and principals to discuss the needs of 
individual students. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is the second awarded to a school district as part of a 
half-billion-dollar private gift -- the largest ever to public education -- 
that philanthropist and publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg announced a year 
ago. A project in New York City received $50 million in September, and grants 
for projects in Chicago and Philadelphia are to be finalized soon. 
</P>
<P>
 USC President Steven B. Sample, who convened the group that wrote Los Angeles' 
application for Annenberg funds, said that at the very least it will regenerate 
support for the public schools in the county among corporate leaders as well as 
parents and others in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 What it will not do, he said, is save public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody here from LAMP is holding LAMP out as the savior of Los Angeles County 
schools," Sample said. "This is a step toward school improvement and school 
reform and it could prove five years from now to be a very real step. It has 
some real money in it. It's not all smoke and mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAMP project boils down to an effort to help often-chaotic campuses find 
ways to create more intimate school settings where students can get 
personalized attention. Incentives would be offered for teachers to stay at one 
school over a period of years so faculties could develop coherent methods of 
serving students. 
</P>
<P>
 Those teachers would also be encouraged to develop educational approaches that 
mesh with those of the other schools in their families. The hope, according to 
documents describing the project, is that schools with stable faculties and 
consistent teaching methods will work to reduce the constant turnover in 
students that many campuses experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stability, we believe, is the basic threshold requirement for creating true 
learning communities," a summary of the program reads. 
</P>
<P>
 But the causes of instability often have little to do with the schools 
themselves and, therefore, will be difficult for the project to address. 
Another problem facing LAMP is its lack of specificity. Although schools will 
be given broad latitude to find the reforms that work for them, the pathway to 
success, which often is not obvious, will not be prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the board will be Virgil Roberts, a record company executive 
who has served on the boards of two of the major school reform efforts in Los 
Angeles County -- LEARN, which stands for Los Angeles Educational Alliance for 
Restructuring Now, and the Los Angeles Educational Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge is to change entire school systems so we don't have a few 
schools that are examples of excellence, but that excellence is the norm . . . 
for all of our children," Roberts said. "It's a difficult goal because it 
requires changing the way we do the business of education." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's first responsibility is to hire an executive director who has 
credibility with unions, educators, researchers and corporate leaders. An 
executive search firm is conducting a nationwide hunt for candidates for that 
job, which Roberts said he hopes will be filled by the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's next responsibility is to select the families of schools, each of 
which will consist of about five schools and include a high school and middle 
school. Each school has to sign a contract committing it to a series of "action 
principles," which include finding ways to give teachers more time to work with 
individual students and with other teachers, and reporting publicly on academic 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said he hopes the first batch of schools can be selected and ready to 
begin operating under the new structure by September. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also is responsible for eliminating schools or families from the 
project if they do not meet their goals, which are spelled out in a detailed 
"learning plan" that is part of the basis for their acceptance into the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Project organizers stress that LAMP will work with the other major reform 
efforts in the county. In the Los Angeles Unified School District, in fact, 
schools have to join LEARN to be considered for membership in LAMP. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old LEARN effort involves 87 campuses in the Los Angeles district 
where principals and teachers are given greater power to control curriculum and 
finances, social services are made available and school staffs are held 
accountable for the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The first reports on the performance of those schools are due in January. But 
the Los Angeles Board of Education has established a goal of having all of its 
more than 700 schools join the LEARN movement within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN President Mike Roos said LAMP validates the work of his organization and 
will extend its successes to schools elsewhere in the county. But, he 
acknowledged, it is too early to quantify the impact that LEARN, which operates 
on an annual budget of about $2 million, has had on student learning. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Annenberg-funded project is "awesome and, symbolically, it says 
that school reform is going to take place in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reform project that has been in the spotlight for its focus on 
remaking schools from the ground up is the Los Angeles Educational Partnership. 
That organization has about $8.5 million to spend over three years to create 
two campuses, one near USC and one in the southeast Los Angeles County city of 
Cudahy, that are cutting-edge models of technology and instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 LAEP spokesman John McDonald said the new project creates an opportunity to 
link the many reform efforts and to make better use of the money that each has 
to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully what is developing here is a critical mass that is going to push 
school reform ahead," McDonald said. "The idea behind this is that everyone 
would work together, and we would certainly be willing to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 One way LAMP will do that is to create a think tank of sorts enabling the 
various educational reform efforts to share ideas as well as office space if 
they desire. Another initiative that would spread the progress among LAMP 
schools and schools countywide is the construction of a computer network for 
electronic mail, voice transmission and video. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore R. Mitchell, dean of the UCLA Graduate School of Education and 
Information Studies and one of the key architects of LAMP, said some schools in 
the county already are operating the way LAMP and other reform efforts 
recommend. Others are working in that direction and need a boost. And still 
others are stuck in the past and have a long way to go. He said membership in 
LAMP is open to all three types of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know change is hard, and we believe that it takes the community coming 
together to help schools change," Mitchell said. "Schools aren't out there on 
their own. They're tied in to a whole network of schools, teachers and parents 
who are all starting to pull on the oars in the same direction."

COLUMN ONE; HEADING TO EL NORTE -- TO SHOP; FROM THE BERNINI BOUTIQUE TO PRICE 
CLUB, MEXICAN VISITORS SPEND BILLIONS EACH YEAR IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA. THE 
SUPER-RICH SEEK SAFETY AND LUXURY. THE MIDDLE CLASS JUST WANT TO FIND BARGAINS.

<P>
 At the Paladion mall, a sleek downtown citadel patrolled by well-dressed 
guards with earphones, a customer from Mexico walks in and buys $60,000 worth 
of designer suits at the Bernini boutique. He pays cash. 
</P>
<P>
 At Price Club 10 miles to the south, a suburban bastion of U.S. consumer 
culture, the bustle of Spanish-speaking families and cars with yellow Baja 
California license plates resembles a Mexican marketplace. About three-quarters 
of the customers drive up from Tijuana, which has the largest middle class 
among Mexican border cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The two businesses have one thing in common: Their survival depends on 
customers from Mexico. Particularly during the holidays, hundreds of thousands 
of legal Mexican border-crossers descend on San Diego and spend money. They 
contribute more than $2.8 billion a year to the U.S. economy, mostly in the San 
Diego border region, according to a recent study. Tuesday's devaluation of the 
peso will reduce Mexican spending power, but it is not expected to seriously 
affect cross-border buying patterns, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the vehement dispute over illegal immigration and Proposition 
187 centers relentlessly on working-class immigrants, obscuring the beneficial 
influx of wealthy and middle-class Mexican visitors. But the political acrimony 
has not altered a fundamental border reality: This city has profound economic 
and cultural ties to Tijuana and the rest of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people coming here to shop, to work, to go to our movie theaters, have 
legal documents," said Millicent Cox, a researcher at UC San Diego who oversaw 
this year's border study. "They aren't coming here to take advantage of us. 
They are coming here because it is part of their community." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego holds a special allure for Mexicans from the interior as well, 
combining climate, a convenient location and a glamorous, resolutely American 
image. It is a de rigueur stop in the orbit of the Mexican ruling class, along 
with country homes outside Mexico City, the beaches of Acapulco, and U.S. 
destinations including Houston, Miami and the ski slopes of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the summer, I see more of my friends here than in Mexico City," said 
former diplomat Marcela Merino, a human rights researcher at a Tijuana think 
tank, who lives in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Tycoons, former presidents and future cabinet ministers own vacation homes in 
La Jolla, Coronado and other outposts of a voraciously ostentatious lifestyle 
satirized by the foremost chronicler of the Mexican elite, Guadalupe Loaeza, in 
her 1992 book, "I Shop, Therefore I Am." You hear patrician Mexico City accents 
in yacht clubs, exclusive restaurants and hip cafes. San Diego is both a 
playground and a refuge from Mexico's smog, crime and political violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel safe here," said Shirley Muller, who owns a bilingual bookstore in 
Coronado where her fellow Mexico City natives sip espresso and browse through 
newspapers and novels from home. "Here they wear their jewels. You have the 
most beautiful boutiques in Mexico City, you can find anything you want. But 
the attitude still is, 'Let's go up to the States.' There is still that thing 
that if it's made in the States, it has to be better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although not as flashy as the millionaires, Tijuana's expanding middle class 
is central to San Diego's prosperity -- the mirror image of the Southern 
Californians whose dollars drive Baja's tourism and service industries. Tijuana 
government officials, factory managers, entrepreneurs and professionals flock 
north to the movies, the zoo, Sea World, supermarkets, outlet stores, swap 
meets and football and soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the benefits remain largely invisible to many residents of San 
Diego, whose views are often shaped by problems such as illegal immigration and 
drug violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average San Diego resident has no conception of the economic benefits 
that Tijuana brings to San Diego because they have an out-of-date view of 
Tijuana as an impoverished place," said Charles Nathanson, a UC San Diego 
border expert. A recent focus group led by Nathanson toured the Mexican city 
and was "amazed that Tijuana had grown into a thriving industrial and 
commercial center." 
</P>
<P>
 The massive legal flow from Tijuana includes about 40,000 workers who travel 
to jobs in San Diego using "commuter alien" work permits granted to applicants 
from the Mexican border region. An estimated 27% of northbound crossings are by 
people who have green cards granting permanent residence in the United States; 
others are U.S. citizens by virtue of immigration history or birthplace. And 
tens of thousands obtain "border-crossing cards" that, based on proof of 
financial stability, allow stays of 72 hours within 25 miles of the 
international line. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers from the Mexican interior, meanwhile, tend to use tourist visas that 
permit repeat extended visits. 
</P>
<P>
 The cross-border network of interdependence seems largely impervious to 
activists' calls for Mexicans to use economic power to punish California for 
perceived anti-immigrant politics. Several retaliatory boycotts of San Diego 
have drawn lukewarm support. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many people in Tijuana, a sustained boycott would create a real 
hardship," said Cox of UC San Diego. "They might respect a one-day boycott. But 
would they realistically stop crossing? I can't imagine someone who works here 
giving up their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Khaled Richani, manager of the Bernini and Versace boutiques at the Paladion 
mall, said Mexicans still account for half of his sales. But Richani has 
noticed a decline since the bitter November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 187 has affected Tijuana (clients). I can feel it," he said. "I'm 
worried that it might have a permanent impact. These people can shop anywhere 
they want." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Paladion opened two years ago, the marble-and-glass atrium mall 
targeted the Mexican market with opulent stores, valet parking and a pianist 
performing beneath an art nouveau statue of a nymph. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in San Diego recognizes that Mexicans are a vital aspect of our 
economy and they all have marketing programs for them," said Jonathan Bailey, 
the mall's marketing manager. "The market continues to grow. They have been 
extremely helpful in keeping these businesses successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Well-off Mexicans have gravitated to San Diego for years. After the traumatic 
devaluation of the peso in 1982 sent Mexican capital fleeing abroad, an 
expatriate colony of sorts flourished in Coronado, a bay-side oasis of stately 
homes and serene streets. So many of the newcomers bought condominiums in the 
commanding Coronado Shores beachfront development that some mean-spirited 
neighbors dubbed it the "Taco Towers." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Mexican elite visit during the Easter and Christmas seasons, the 
summer, holidays and for weekend getaways. They go to the doctor and elderly 
Mexicans spend months here for state-of-the-art medical care. They buy products 
considered better or cheaper than those available in Mexico. They go to the 
bank. They unwind. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist opposition leader and two-time presidential 
candidate, has been seen relaxing in jeans in the tasteful lobby of the La 
Valencia Hotel overlooking the La Jolla cove. 
</P>
<P>
 The wife of a fugitive Tijuana drug lord was spotted strolling through 
Nordstrom at the Fashion Valley mall last year, days after her husband's gunmen 
allegedly killed a Roman Catholic cardinal in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican television personality Nino Canun visited Tijuana to host a talk show 
in which the guests lambasted alleged racism in the United States; then he made 
a cross-border foray to a Chula Vista drugstore and bought a cartload of goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see someone in here today and tomorrow you see them on television," said 
saleswoman Beyka Salman of Cartier at the Paladion. Salman, a U.S.-educated 
Tijuana native, is one of many mall employees selected for their impeccable 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans represent about 35% of sales at Cartier, according to store manager 
Shohreh Parvin. Although the clients may speak the English of the Ivy League, 
they like to do business in Spanish. They prefer large and glitzy items such as 
a gold Panther watch that sells for $11,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love to shop when they are away," Parvin said. "They don't like to shop 
when they are in Mexico. There's a safety factor. They don't want to be seen 
buying jewelry at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the atrium at Tiffany, prominent Mexico City families arrive with 
entourages of bodyguards and spend up to "six figures" on crystal and china, 
employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ironies have not been lost on Mexican literary observers; for decades, 
this insular plutocracy has provided them with abundant material. In "I Shop, 
Therefore I Am," Loaeza explores an era in which the rich got richer. As 
then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari oversaw a dramatic drive to open the 
economy and privatize state enterprises, the ranks of billionaires swelled from 
one in 1987 to at least 24 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Following well-heeled women on jet-set shopping excursions, Loaeza's book 
skewers their ultra-mannered slang sprinkled with English, their obsessive 
appetite for designer labels. These excesses are a grim counterpoint to the 
poverty endured by an estimated 40 million Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Former diplomat Merino of La Jolla moves between both worlds, dedicating two 
days a week to social work among the Mixtec Indians of Tijuana's shack town 
periphery. With mixed resignation and amusement, she said Loaeza paints a 
basically accurate picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends can spend $5,000 in a day at Neiman Marcus," Merino said. "They 
don't believe the poor exist. They think I invent them." 
</P>
<P>
 Moral considerations aside, Mexican money represents a rare opportunity for 
growth on San Diego's barren economic landscape. Merchants work to keep 
cross-border shoppers happy and woo them from aggressive competitors such as 
Houston and Dallas. Paladion management joined a city delegation on a recent 
promotional trip to Mexico City and sponsors classical concerts at clients' 
palatial homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of northern Mexico's modernizing, predominantly urban economy, 
Tijuana's income distribution resembles San Diego's to a surprising degree, 
according to sociologist Nathanson. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you map the census tracts of the two cities, there's an enormous 
similarity," he said. "So there's increasingly an interdependence of equality." 
</P>
<P>
 The study generated compelling numbers: There are 6 million northbound 
crossings from Tijuana to San Diego each month. Shopping is the primary purpose 
of about 1.6 million visits, primarily to Chula Vista, a border-area suburb, 
and the malls of southern and central San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some stores in San Diego have a greater variety of goods," the study said. 
"Auto parts stores . . . benefit from customers who like to take advantage of 
the quick distribution of parts from the main warehouse instead of waiting two 
weeks in Tijuana for a $20 item. Perceived quality is an important part of the 
purchase decision: High-quality meat, fresh produce without pesticides and good 
quality toilet paper, for example, are more readily available in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.8 billion spent yearly in the area by Mexicans generates $120 million 
in California sales tax, the study found. Those estimates are decidedly 
conservative, Cox said. Researchers did not cover air arrivals and they believe 
that some people understated spending because the official -- if intermittently 
enforced -- Mexican customs limit on duty-free goods is $50 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 The top consumer destinations: Ralphs, Vons and Price Club, which has waged a 
membership campaign at Tijuana factories and professional associations. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, PriceCostCo. opened its first Tijuana outlet -- the ninth in Mexico 
-- this month. But executives expect that the Chula Vista Price Club a few 
miles north will not suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping is an ingrained ritual based on more than just acquisition or 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as much a day or weekend trip as it is a shopping trip, and Price Club 
is just one of the destinations," said Bob Hickok, a Price Club vice president. 
"It's part of the culture to come to San Diego to visit family and friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Cordoba, a Price Club member for seven years, personifies the emerging 
Tijuana middle class. A dignified, down-to-earth businessman in a suede jacket, 
he recently emerged from the cavernous Chula Vista store burdened with 
provisions for holiday feasts. He runs a business that delivers potable water 
to Tijuana homes and lives in Playas de Tijuana, a pleasant coastal 
neighborhood. But he spends a lot of time and money in San Diego. "It's cheaper 
and it has more to offer," Cordoba said. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not take issue with the California crackdown on illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, it's all right that they deny services if people 
were taking advantage of them," Cordoba said. "Everybody should work for a 
living." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the vocal Mexican criticism of U.S. immigration policies, Cordoba's 
attitude reflects the sentiments of other Tijuanenses who endure long waits at 
the freeway ports of entry. Although illegal immigration occurs on their 
doorstep, they do not feel that the issue affects them personally. And 
border-crossing is part of the fabric of their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this Price Club survives purely because of Mexican people," Cordoba 
said. "I don't think people are going to stop buying here."

POLICE WOUND ATTACKER IN FRONT OF WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and AARON NATHANS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeless man brandishing a nine-inch knife was shot by a U.S. Park Police 
officer in front of the White House Tuesday, marking the third shooting outside 
the presidential residence in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcelino Corniel, 33, a Southern California native who had been camped in 
adjacent Lafayette Park, was shot in the chest and leg after charging across 
Pennsylvania Avenue about 9 a.m. and menacing a cordon of U.S. Park Police 
officers, authorities said. Police saw no indication that Corniel was trying to 
hurt President Clinton, who was at work in the Oval Office at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel, who remained in very critical condition after surgery Tuesday night, 
will be charged with assaulting a police officer, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other people camping in Lafayette Park, which is home to dozens of protesters 
and drifters, said that Corniel apparently had been angered Tuesday morning by 
patrolmen who routinely came by to wake them. Corniel jumped out from beneath a 
soiled blanket, shouting: "I'm going to get you!" 
</P>
<P>
 He dashed across the street toward the White House, holding his knife in front 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Park Police officer called for assistance and grappled with Corniel, 
whose knife was taped to his left hand. As other officers gathered, they 
repeatedly demanded that Corniel drop the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 With at least three other officers standing in a semicircle about 10 feet from 
him, a policeman approached Corniel and demanded again that he drop the knife. 
Television videotape of the incident shows that Corniel was moving only 
slightly and not trying to strike the officers at the moment he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Park Police spokesman insisted that Corniel's behavior threatened the 
officers' lives and that the shooting was justified. The homeless man "still 
had the knife," said Maj. Robert Hines of the U.S. Park Police. "He was still 
looking at them. He might have been trying to figure out which one to knife." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shots were fired, Corniel collapsed on the sidewalk about 10 feet 
from the north gate of the White House. He was taken to George Washington 
University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Police characterized the incident as routine urban violence but acknowledged 
that the string of shootings, along with the crash of a small airplane into the 
White House in September, produce the kind of attention that could generate 
copycat incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a contagion theory about these things," said Eric Harnischfeger, 
Secret Service spokesman. "They can draw in other unbalanced individuals. 
That's why we don't want to talk about it too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel was ill and receiving disability payments after being burned over 80% 
of his body, according to police in Anaheim, his last known California address. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Torrance Memorial Medical Center said that the hospital 
treated a man with the same name and birth date after he suffered burns over 
75% to 80% of his body in a 1992 Carson car fire. He was an in-patient from 
Aug. 12 to Dec. 23, 1992, said spokeswoman Laurie Lundberg, and came back to 
the hospital for reconstructive surgery throughout 1993. He was treated the 
last time in May, 1994, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel had been listed as a missing person in August by a sister in Anaheim 
after he failed to show up for scheduled surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The sister "was concerned about his health," said Lt. Vince Howard of the 
Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeless people in Lafayette Park described Corniel as a usually gentle 
man who had been living in the park for several months intermittently. One side 
of his face bore extensive scars from the burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeless people said that he seemed physically as well as mentally ill 
at times. He had drifted away from the park a few months ago after complaining 
of police harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bystanders and callers to TV talk shows complained that officers 
overreacted. Hines said Washington police would independently investigate, with 
the officers involved routinely placed on administrative duty, Newsday 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Police, the Secret Service and District of Columbia police have all 
stepped up security in recent weeks because of the incidents at the White 
House, which appear to have no connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Saturday, an unexplained burst of gunfire left three bullets on the 
south side of the White House and one in the building itself. Police aren't 
sure precisely where those shots were fired from, or why, and have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 A gunman sprayed the White House with 29 rounds from a semiautomatic weapon on 
Oct. 29. Francisco Martin Duran of Colorado has been charged with multiple 
crimes, including attempted assassination of the President, in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a Maryland man, Frank Corder, died when he crashed his small 
plane on the White House grounds Sept. 11.

 TREE TRIVIA: The Christmas tree has a lot of tradition behind it. Some say its 
roots go back to the 8th Century, although the first documented references come 
from Latvia and Estonia in the early 1500s. . . . Today's Valley Briefing (B5) 
also looks at tree prices and offers some handling tips.

 FINAL CHANCE: CSUN made it official Tuesday, telling students: You make the 
call. Students in March will be asked to approve a referendum to help finance 
athletic programs. If they vote it down, four sports will have to go. Football 
would be lost in three of the options. . . . President Blenda J. Wilson will 
announce in January which one of four possible funding options will be on the 
student ballot (C1). Said Wilson: "This issue represents a significant decision 
for the university." 
</P>
<P>
 FAKE FLAKES: It snowed in Calabasas, and it was no snow job. Actually, it was. 
The city hired a snow-making machine at Gates Canyon Park in the third annual 
"Let It Snow" day (B2). . . . A few years ago, the real stuff made it to town. 
A February, 1989, storm left five inches in Westlake Village, Porter Ranch, 
Tarzana, Granada Hills and Calabasas.

<P>
 HELPING OUT: Santa came to the rescue Tuesday -- make that hundreds of Santas. 
One day after the Dubnoff Center for Child Development and Educational Therapy 
in North Hollywood reported that more than 100 presents had been stolen, 
donations poured in. . . . The center's Gil Freitag says people brought in 
games, clothes, basketballs, stuffed animals and cash totaling nearly $8,000.

 NEXT PLEASE: The Times sent out eight reporters Saturday to check delays at 
Southern California post offices (E1) and one of the fastest lines turned out 
to be in Littlerock in north L.A. County. It took staffer Phil Sneiderman all 
of one minute to mail his package. So much for the holiday rush. . . . Other 
reporters found a much different scene. Michael Arkush

WILSON SUES TO BLOCK MOTOR VOTER MEASURE; COURTS: GOVERNOR MOVES TO BAN LAW 
PROVIDING REGISTRATION AS PART OF DRIVER'S LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND RENEWALS 
UNTIL U.S. PAYS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. HE CLAIMS IT INFRINGES ON STATES' RIGHTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson escalated his states' rights war against the Clinton 
Administration on Tuesday by filing a lawsuit to stop a new federal voter 
registration law from taking effect in California until Washington comes up 
with the money to finance the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit -- Wilson vs. United States of America -- was filed on behalf of the 
Republican governor by state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren in U.S. District Court in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of voting rights groups brought legal action of their own in 
federal court in San Jose on Thursday, seeking to force the governor to 
implement the National Voter Registration Act, commonly referred to as the 
motor voter law, as scheduled on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson challenged the constitutionality of the act, saying that it 
infringes on the rights of states as provided in the 10th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said in a statement Tuesday that the law seeks to impose a new 
legal duty on California without providing the money to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply wrong and unfair, and the law is on our side," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motor voter bill, long sought by Democrats as a means of expanding the 
national voter pool, passed Congress last year and was signed into law by 
President Clinton. The measure establishes a variety of procedures by which 
state officials must offer citizens a convenient opportunity to register to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has estimated that it would cost the state more than $35 million a year 
to implement the law, although acting Secretary of State Tony Miller said 
Tuesday that it could be done for $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the figure is immaterial, said Miller, a Democrat who leaves 
office in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of federal law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most far-reaching provisions requires that a voter registration 
form be sent to each motorist along with an application for a driver's license 
or license renewal. The law also requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to 
pass along changes of address to voter registration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A major cause of ineligibility is that people forget they have to re-register 
to vote when they move, even if it is within the same town or precinct. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also requires voter registration opportunities to be offered through 
welfare offices, state tax agencies and the state Department of Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, said officials 
could not comment on the contents of Wilson's lawsuit because it had not been 
read yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we respect Congress' intent to make it easier for all Americans to 
exercise their right to register and vote, and hope that others would too," 
Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has already warred with Washington, suing to get the state compensated 
for up to $3 billion a year that Wilson says the state must pay for services to 
illegal immigrants. That cost is a federal responsibility, he has argued. 
Proposition 187, which has been suspended pending a trial on its validity, 
seeks to halt virtually all state aid to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Wilson served notice that he would implement the motor voter law 
only to the extent allowed by the availability of federal money. The lawsuit 
says that the state expects to get some federal money, but not nearly enough to 
cover the full cost of implementation.

HMO'S LICENSING MISSING KEY ITEM; HEALTH CARE: MOLINA MEDICAL CENTERS 
APPLICATION WAS APPROVED WITHOUT A SIGNED STATEMENT FROM A BOARD MEMBER, SEN. 
DIANE WATSON, A STATE COMMISSIONER CONFIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The state Department of Corporations approved an HMO license for a Long 
Beach-based chain of clinics last spring without enforcing a requirement that 
the company submit signed disclosure statements from all its board members, 
officials disclosed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from Molina Medical Centers' application, said Commissioner Gary 
Mendoza, was a sworn statement from a key board member, state Sen. Diane Watson 
(D-Los Angeles), which the company had promised to file but never did. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza dismissed the department's failure to follow up as a "ministerial 
oversight." But he acknowledged that his discovery contradicted statements by a 
department attorney last week that the confidential document was in hand and 
that a license could not have been granted without it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said the omission raises yet another question about whether Molina was 
licensed without meeting a fundamental requirement that a majority of its board 
of directors be financially independent of the family-run company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to ask some more questions about the representation they made to 
the department regarding the (financially) disinterested board they were 
setting up at our insistence," Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina's attorney declined comment Tuesday, but company officials have said 
previously that the proper filings were made with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times disclosed this week that the department, without reviewing critical 
medical audits, had granted Molina an HMO license that later opened a door to a 
state contract potentially worth $400 million. The license was granted in March 
-- the same month the company distributed $15,000 to 23 other lawmakers and 
named Watson to its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said in a recent interview that she provided guidance to company 
officials on "how to work the system" to win a license but she never agreed to 
serve on their board of directors. Her service on the board would have raised 
the "perception of a conflict" of interest, she said, because she chairs the 
Senate's Health Services Committee, which oversees the state agency issuing 
Medi-Cal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said they would not have listed Watson as a board member 
without her approval. Mendoza said the company had submitted documents 
"represent(ing) to us under penalty of perjury that she had agreed to serve on 
the board." 
</P>
<P>
 The new disclosure supports Watson's contention that she had not signed any 
documents relating to her board duties. It also underscores questions raised by 
critics about the diligence that Department of Corporations officials have 
exercised in granting HMO licenses, which are a steppingstone to Medi-Cal 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a March 14 letter identifying Molina's newly appointed board members, Mark 
Andrews, an attorney for the company, drew the agency's attention to the fact 
that Watson's disclosure document did not have her required signature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to a personal emergency, Sen. Watson will not be available until the 
coming week at which time (Molina) will obtain her signature and file" it with 
the department, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mendoza said the document was not filed and his department never followed 
up to find out why it had not been. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the matter Tuesday, Andrews said: "If you're asking me about 
client matters, I have nothing to answer. If you're asking me about public 
records I think you should address that question to the Department of 
Corporations." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza acknowledged that the makeup of the board had been an important issue 
in the department's determination of whether Molina should get its HMO license. 
Department attorney Anita Ostroff had raised a concern that with all the 
company's top officials being family members, financial considerations might at 
times override medical decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina offered to resolve the problem by appointing a majority of its board 
members from outside the company. With that issue out of the way, the 
department granted the company its license. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's presence on the board becomes important, Mendoza said, because 
without it the company never fulfilled its promise to appoint a majority of 
outside board members. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its inquiry into the matter, Mendoza said the department will have to 
resolve several contradictions which, in his view, make some of the senator's 
claims "unfathomable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Watson said she never agreed to serve on the board, records show she 
did not mention that in a letter she wrote resigning from the position. The 
letter of resignation was written in August, four months after the senator said 
she discovered to her chagrin that her name had been placed on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 In her interview, Watson said she relied on her staff to write the letter and 
never knew when it was actually sent. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials said they did not get any letter of complaint from the 
senator, nor did anyone advise them when she resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we decide what actions we will take. . . . we just want to know the 
facts," said Mendoza.

WILSON NAMES AIDE TO RUN STATE AIR BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Wilson Administration aide who spent nearly a decade helping mold the Los 
Angeles Basin's air pollution rules and building liaisons with industry and 
community groups was appointed Tuesday to chair the California Air Resources 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson swore in John Dunlap III, chief deputy director of the 
Department of Toxic Substances Control, to replace Jacqueline Schafer, who was 
forced to step down from the air board after a year as chairwoman because the 
state Senate refused to confirm her nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, 36, spent nine years at the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District, highlighted by his key role in public outreach and in crafting the 
Los Angeles region's controversial ride-share rule, before joining the Wilson 
Administration two years ago. He has a reputation as being a politically savvy 
and charismatic mediator on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The state air board has been under fire recently for its conciliatory approach 
toward the industries it regulates, especially the influential oil and trucking 
companies. Although environmentalists and industry groups reacted positively to 
the appointment Tuesday, opinions were mixed about how much influence industry 
will have on Dunlap's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "John grew up in the most polluted areas of Southern California and worked at 
the air district at a time when it was grappling with some of its most 
interesting and difficult issues," said Dennis Zane, executive director of the 
Coalition for Clean Air. "So I think he has a full appreciation of how 
important cleaning the air is (and) how complicated and difficult it can be." 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists worry about his close ties to the governor's office and 
Assemblyman Jim Brulte, the Republican contender for Speaker of the Assembly. 
"One big question mark is will he be someone who is able to be an independent 
voice?" Zane said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Titus of the California Trucking Assn. said his group is optimistic, 
especially because Dunlap's father is an executive at a truck company. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocal opposition from the trucking industry, which opposes the air board's 
proposals to adopt new standards for diesel trucks, was a major reason behind 
Wilson ousting of longtime air board Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're hearing is that (Dunlap) is generally open to our concerns, and 
that has got to be a very good starting point," Titus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Pellissier, spokesman for the California Environmental Protection Agency, 
said Dunlap's father's ties to the trucking industry are irrelevant and will 
have no influence on state air policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said Dunlap will implement the state's sweeping new 20-year clean-air 
plan, which includes regulations that would require low emission trucks, 
reformulated consumer products and fuels, and the purchase and scrapping of 
large numbers of old, polluting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "John's background in air quality issues will serve California well as we 
continue to lead the country in the development of innovative methods to 
improve air quality," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Dunlap said his career at AQMD and the governor's 
office offers vital training for his new post, but he declined to comment on 
some major issues facing the board until he does more research. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have a unique insight into not only the impacts of air pollution on 
the public but what it takes for industry to be able to comply, and also the 
role of technology," Dunlap said. "Implementation of some of these programs can 
be challenging. I really tried to play a role of being a consensus-builder and 
bringing people together." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap's appointment is contingent on confirmation by the state Senate, which 
probably will wait six months before holding hearings. He is likely to be more 
popular with the Legislature than Schafer, a former official of the Reagan and 
Bush administrations whom Democratic legislators targeted for removal in 
election-year wrangling with Wilson. Schafer now serves as the air board's 
communications adviser, reporting to Dunlap. 
</P>
<P>
 While at the AQMD, Dunlap worked as public adviser, a specialist on the 
rule-making staff and as transportation program manager when the agency was 
adopting aggressive regulations during the 1980s and early 1990s. Included was 
the ride-share rule that requires businesses in the Los Angeles Basin with more 
than 100 employees to provide incentives to their workers to persuade them to 
share rides. The rule was considered a bold and innovative approach to tackle 
solo commuting but became extremely unpopular with businesses. The AQMD board 
last month directed its staff to overhaul it to give companies a wider range of 
options.

BRULTE SEES NO QUICK END TO IMPASSE; ASSEMBLY: REPUBLICAN LEADER SAYS STALEMATE 
OVER SPEAKERSHIP MAY LAST SEVERAL MORE WEEKS. HE SAYS MOUNTJOY PLANS TO 
RENOUNCE SENATE SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In another round in the struggle for Speaker of the state Assembly, Republican 
leader Jim Brulte said Tuesday that his impasse with Democrat Willie Brown may 
last several more weeks -- and predicted that hardly anyone outside Sacramento 
will pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly reconvenes Jan. 4, but Brulte said it will be so early in the new 
session that there will not be much real legislative work to do, and that the 
Assembly will continue to function without a Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a mistake to believe that if we do not organize on Jan. 4, the world as 
we know it will come to an end," Brulte said at a Capitol news conference. He 
and Brown are tied for the post with 40 votes each. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the Assembly conducts little serious business in January and 
February as it organizes itself into committees that will hold hearings on new 
bills, which are still being introduced. "I know it. Willie Brown knows it. You 
in the media know it," the Rancho Cucamonga Republican told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 A key GOP supporter of Brulte is Richard Mountjoy of Arcadia, who was 
reelected to the Assembly the same day he won a state Senate seat in a special 
election. Brulte says Mountjoy has told him he will renounce his Senate seat 
and remain in the Assembly, giving Brulte the vote he needs to deny Brown the 
speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Brulte and Brown have courted members of the opposition party in an 
effort to break the impasse. Each has promised that if he becomes Speaker, he 
will usher in a new era of bipartisanship in conducting Assembly business, and 
both have proposed various forms of power-sharing. So far, the entreaties have 
gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the dramatic tie vote on Dec. 5, Brown has initiated private contacts 
with Republicans and hit the radio talk show, newspaper and television 
interview circuit in an unusual public bid to rally support for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte, in contrast, has waged a behind-the-scenes effort to win over 
potential Democratic defectors. But on Tuesday, he took a more public stance 
and served notice that a resolution of the standoff may be weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 At his first formal news conference in two weeks, Brulte told reporters that 
hard-won Republican gains at the polls that shifted the power in the Assembly 
would not be abandoned. Having turned out Brown from the speakership, GOP 
members "are not about to make Willie Brown Speaker of the Assembly," he said. 
Brown, of San Francisco, has served as Speaker a record 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Election Day, 41 Republicans and 39 Democrats were sent to the Assembly, 
giving the GOP its first majority in 25 years. But Brulte's ascension to 
Speaker was scuttled by one vote when Republican Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar 
bolted and sided with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Infuriated Republicans, supported by Gov. Pete Wilson, have since started a 
recall against Horcher, who has declared himself independent of any party. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and the Democrats feel they can win the speakership fight by expelling 
the veteran Mountjoy and forcing him to take his Senate seat. It was just this 
strategy that led the Assembly's GOP to walk out of the Capitol en masse Dec. 6 
rather than face a vote on Mountjoy's qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brulte asserted Tuesday that Mountjoy has told him he intends to remain in 
the Assembly. "Richard Mountjoy has said that he is not going to accept his 
Senate seat. . . . He's going to stay in the Assembly," Brulte said. Mountjoy 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Brulte's remarks Tuesday about the power struggle, Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), Brown's designated spokesman, accused the Republican 
leader of being "afraid of sitting down and negotiating" a compromise with 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we could resolve this probably in a matter of days if he would talk 
to us," Katz said. He also accused Brulte of hypocrisy for talking of 
bipartisanship even as Republicans are organizing costly recalls against four 
Assembly Democrats, an effort Brulte says does not involve the Assembly's 
Republican caucus.

ON CALIFORNIA: TWO BOATS DID NOT COME BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her name is Joanne Franklin, and her Ketch Joanne coffee shop serves as a sort 
of family room for crews of the commercial fishing vessels that work out of 
Pillar Point here, just south of San Francisco. Winter is crab season, and the 
crabbers come in long before the sun for coffee. They sit around a wood table 
reserved for them up front. Overhead hang framed pictures of their vessels. On 
this morning two of the pictures are wreathed in flowers. There is a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first Sunday in December, which also was the first day of crab season, 
several vessels left harbor loaded down with stacks of crab pots -- a 
dangerously awkward burden even in calm seas. The weather was not good, and it 
only got worse. The wind changed direction, kicking up huge seas. Two boats 
would not come back that day. Four men were presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time one of these accidents happens," Franklin is saying now, "it's 
because of some pressure. They get behind in payments or something, and they 
take risks they wouldn't otherwise take. They make mistakes. They go out on 
days when they know they should not. We had a fisherman here about 10 years ago 
who had a new boat he had to pay for, so he went out in bad weather. He lost 
his life. A few years later, his son went out and lost his life, too. Fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is more than an abstract analysis. Forty years ago, when Franklin was a 
young woman, her father headed to sea in a fishing boat that maybe was too 
small for the conditions. He never did come back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the table sits Bob McMahon, the harbor master. "In the 21 years I have been 
here," he says, "23 people have died. Think about that. But there never has 
been anything like this before -- to lose four guys in one day. This one is 
going to stick with us for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, rain comes down hard. A red flag flaps in the wind, a warning. Only a 
few crabbers have ventured out. The others, idled, drift into the coffee shop. 
They talk of the four lost men -- Kirk Pringle and Alex Kovak of the Lisa, 
Joseph Fischer and Lester Bronsema of the Best Girl. The word family is 
repeated often. "These were the good guys," one mourner says bitterly into his 
coffee mug. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk of fishing, the allure and also the ever-mounting economic 
pressures. As seasons are shortened for various regulatory purposes, risks 
inevitably are increased: There just aren't enough days to waste waiting out 
bad weather. In addition, a strike preceded crab season at Pillar Point this 
year. The dispute boiled down to a 25-cent disagreement over what a pound of 
crab should be worth. It pushed everything back three weeks, stretching the 
finances of all the crabbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here was hurting," Joanne Franklin says, and heads bob up and down 
around the table. Three days before he was lost, one of the fishermen had come 
to her house for Thanksgiving dinner. "He was hurting financially," she says. 
"If he wasn't, he would not have gone out that day. I know that. It was the 
pressure, see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The men at the table all have been in rough water before. They speak of the 
fear that comes when the weather changes fast, knowing that one mistake is all 
it would take. White water splashes across the cabin window. The battering of 
the boat takes on a rhythm, one blow every six seconds. Each blow feels like a 
car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 They figure the men would have been on the rear decks of their craft, 
frantically tossing crab pots overboard. It would have happened fast -- one big 
wave at a bad angle. "Imagine," one says, "this coffee shop turning upside down 
all of the sudden." No time to duck below for a survival suit. No time to radio 
for help. Battery acid and diesel fuel foul the water. Equipment tumbles 
crazily about. 
</P>
<P>
 These doomed men were all well-seasoned, and so there would be a full 
awareness of what was happening, and a furious battle in a tangle of lines: 
"These were active, can-do guys; they would have been fighting." And then a 
long, slow descent in 56-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
 As all this is told, the faces around the table change. Newcomers arrive 
dripping wet from the docks. Others leave to prepare their vessels. The weather 
is not supposed to be much better the next day. And yet, as one old salt says 
as he departs, "you can't catch fish if your gear isn't in the water." The sea 
calls, and so do the bill collectors. Christmas is coming. The pressure mounts 
to go fishing.

CARTER ANNOUNCES BOSNIA CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT; BALKANS: TRUCE BEGINS FRIDAY, HE 
SAYS AFTER SHAKY START WITH REBEL SERBS. DIPLOMATS REMAIN SKEPTICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian government have agreed to begin a 
cease-fire on Friday as a small first step toward ending the 32-month civil 
war, former President Jimmy Carter announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The modest agreement -- one of many proposed cease-fires over the course of 
the war -- came after an unscheduled second round of meetings between Carter 
and the Bosnian Serb leadership in nearby Pale. Carter called the extra session 
after conflicting claims about the results of their high-profile talks on 
Monday threatened to sink his entire peace mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter announced Monday that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had agreed 
to an immediate cease-fire, but Karadzic backed away from the claim a few hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government was so angered by the theatrics that President Alija 
Izetbegovic refused to meet with Carter when he returned to Sarajevo late 
Monday, choosing to make the former U.S. President wait until morning, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had this character 2 1/2 years, and he lies every day," said Bosnian 
Vice President Ejup Ganic, referring to Karadzic. "Make sure that you know with 
whom you deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, said to be alarmed and betrayed by Karadzic's antics on Monday, made 
Tuesday's cease-fire announcement in Pale standing shoulder to shoulder with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 After driving the mountainous road to Sarajevo, Carter repeated the 
announcement at the airport en route to Belgrade, where he plans to hold talks 
with Serbian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a complete cease-fire in all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including 
Bihac, to go into effect at noon on Dec. 23," Carter said. "This cease-fire is 
to be completely monitored, without interference, by UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection 
Force) troops, interposing themselves between the opposing military units 
wherever necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 In The Hague on Tuesday, a two-day informal meeting of defense chiefs from 28 
countries agreed on measures aimed at strengthening the U.N. force. At a news 
conference after the meeting, Lt. Gen. H.G.B. van den Breemen, chief of the 
Dutch Defense Staff, declined to give details on the measures. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed clear the proposals carried at least the potential to make the U.N. 
force stronger and more effective, but they must still be studied by national 
governments and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and then approved by the 
United Nations, which so far has been extremely reluctant to employ force. 
</P>
<P>
 Van den Breemen said the chiefs had discussed, and apparently recommended to 
their governments, the use of aircraft and more firepower to deliver 
humanitarian aid to civilians trapped by the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about helicopters and armed escort helicopters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such escort aircraft would probably be provided by NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor of Van den Breemen's remarks hinted strongly that the military 
chiefs recommended helicoptering supplies over roadblocks and permitting armed 
escort aircraft to attack anyone attempting to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch general also said the agreed proposals would mean adding to the U.N. 
force's troop strength. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Carter's announcement, the cease-fire would last until Jan. 1, 
during which time the warring sides would negotiate the details of a proposed 
four-month cessation of hostilities. If the two sides agree to that temporary 
peace, they will then turn their attention toward transforming the agreement 
into a permanent end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need more negotiations; we need results," one unimpressed Western 
diplomat said. "One has to be very doubtful this will go anyplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomat and others described the process set up by Carter as fragile and 
ridden with potential pitfalls, especially since the former President failed to 
resolve what has been the most intractable obstacle to peace: the Bosnian Serb 
refusal to accept the Contact Group peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that key and critical area, I think they are still 180 degrees apart," a 
U.N. official said. "The whole basis of negotiations is still in dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 The Contact Group plan, drawn up by the United States, Britain, France, 
Germany and Russia, calls for dividing Bosnia about in half between the 
Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government and neighboring Serbia have agreed to the international 
plan, but the Bosnian Serbs, who would have to give up one-third of the 
territory they now control, have repeatedly rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and other backers of the Contact Group plan have described 
it as a take-it-or-leave-it proposal that must be accepted by all sides before 
any of it can be revised or amended. The Bosnian Serbs have said they would 
consider the plan only if it could be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic once again did not accept the plan Tuesday but insisted that it 
should serve as "the basis of negotiation" for peace. The Bosnian government 
maintained that the plan's acceptance was the "starting point" for negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to reach consensus, Carter included the language from both sides in a 
written summary of agreements reached during his two-day visit but said he 
could not "detect any significant difference" between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a difference in semantics that I have not been able to overcome," he 
said, adding after reading a note passed to him by his wife, "and I am 
obviously not taking sides as to whose language is best." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's admission that he could not distinguish between the two positions 
sent chills through Bosnian government offices here. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Carter announced that he would visit their country, Bosnian officials 
have openly questioned whether his presence would be used by the Bosnian Serbs 
to undermine the Contact Group plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. official said that even if Carter secures a cease-fire Friday, it will 
have come at a high price. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to wait for the next two days" to see if there is a cease-fire, 
the official said. "Maybe it holds out a very slim chance of forward momentum, 
but it comes at the great cost of handing Karadzic a propaganda coup and 
muddying the international community's stance on Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 A cease-fire could significantly benefit the people of the Muslim enclave of 
Bihac in northwest Bosnia, which came under heavy shelling again Tuesday. 
Unconfirmed reports said there were many casualties in the area, including a 
10-year-old boy who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a longer truce to take hold, Carter's deal requires the deployment of 
U.N. peacekeepers between the two warring sides. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said Tuesday that there are few available soldiers, and NATO 
military chiefs meeting in the Netherlands did not seem inclined to send 
additional peacekeepers.

GERMANY OKS JETS TO COVER A U.N. BOSNIA WITHDRAWAL; EUROPE: POSSIBLE DISPATCH 
OF SIX TO EIGHT TORNADOES WOULD BE LUFTWAFFE'S FIRST COMBAT MISSION IN 50 
YEARS. 
</P>

 In a historic move that could end 50 years of foreign military abstinence, the 
German government on Tuesday agreed to provide NATO with Tornado jet fighters 
in the event of a withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Cabinet made the decision in response to a request 
earlier this month from the NATO supreme commander for Europe, U.S. Gen. George 
Joulwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations appear 
committed to strengthening the 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia, and the Tornadoes 
may never be called, the decision is significant for reunified Germany, which 
is struggling to define its role in post-Communist Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also highly emotional. The contribution of six to eight jet fighters 
would not make Germany a major military player in the Bosnian conflict, but it 
would mark the Luftwaffe's first foreign combat mission since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The deployment would be legal under a landmark ruling by the country's highest 
court last July that Germany may use its armed forces outside the NATO area, in 
cooperation with international missions and with parliamentary approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In its final meeting before Christmas, the Cabinet also offered to provide 
logistic support to any withdrawal operation in the form of air transport, a 
mine-sweeping squadron and medical units. But it agreed with Kohl and many 
opposition leaders that Germany's history prevents it from sending ground 
troops to the Balkans, where the Nazis installed the brutal Ustasha regime in 
Croatia and supported the execution of thousands of Serbs during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Germans fear that their military participation could provoke the Serbs 
and further complicate the situation, expanding the Balkan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for their hesitation is that many political analysts blame 
Germany for igniting the war in the Balkans in the first place with an overly 
hasty recognition of Croatia and Slovenia when the republics broke away from 
Yugoslavia in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellery Minister Friedrich Bohl said NATO will be advised of the German 
government's decision after Parliament is officially informed. The decision 
must be ratified by a simple majority in Parliament, where Kohl's three-party 
coalition holds a 10-seat majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has divided the major political parties in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition Social Democratic Party has said it is undecided how it will 
vote on deployment of the Tornadoes for a withdrawal, but several members have 
spoken out on both sides of the issue. Their allies in the leftist Greens Party 
are opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany is the only NATO country besides the United States that has the 
aircraft equipped with sophisticated electronic systems that could neutralize 
and destroy Serbian antiaircraft missiles during a contested withdrawal. This 
equipment can detect radar beams from a surface-to-air missile and fire rockets 
back at the source of the beams. 
</P>
<P>
 Bohl said American planes are tied up in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion polls have shown that most Germans oppose sending combat planes to 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl has argued against that sentiment, saying that as May's 50th anniversary 
of the Allied victory over Germany approaches -- an occasion Germany celebrates 
as a liberation from Hitler -- the country must be prepared to return the 
support it received from the West to rebuild and the protection it received 
during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 German newspapers have hotly debated the issue -- and Germany's role as 
Europe's largest economy, in general -- ever since Joulwan made the request for 
help earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germans feel, know deep in their hearts, that the dream of Switzerland has 
ended," columnist Josef Joffe wrote in the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, 
referring to Germany's decades of military abstinence. "Today it is not about 
conquering and aggression, not about the 'place in the sun,' not about going it 
alone in the name of the only true nation. On the contrary, it is about joint 
action and international responsibility. The Germans shall not rule, but help; 
they shall not repeat history . . . but prevent it from happening again as much 
as possible."

BUDGET; MILITARY'S UN-MARTIAL OUTLAYS SCRUTINIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 Here's a tricky question for the serious budget-wonks: 
</P>
<P>
 Where in the federal budget would you find spending for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Breast-cancer research; 
</P>
<P>
 * Environmental cleanup efforts; 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug enforcement programs; 
</P>
<P>
 * Financing for public schools; 
</P>
<P>
 * Aid to the former Soviet Union; 
</P>
<P>
 * Jobs for workers in Connecticut; 
</P>
<P>
 * Rifle practice for neighborhood teen-agers; 
</P>
<P>
 * Government support for the 1996 Olympics; 
</P>
<P>
 * Memorial Day and July 4 concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're busily thumbing through the spending programs for all 149 federal 
departments and agencies, let us save you the trouble: Look under "Department 
of Defense, Military." The Pentagon budget has all of these items, and dozens 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 What's all that stuff doing in the nation's defense budget? 
</P>
<P>
 Many members of Congress have begun asking that question as well. In response 
to lawmakers' inquiries, the Congressional Research Service has identified 126 
programs in the military budget that have nothing to do with the business of 
fighting wars. 
</P>
<P>
 And Republicans on the new House and Senate national security committees are 
planning to launch an effort in the 104th Congress to separate out such 
"non-defense" programs and transfer them to other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers who support such a shift argue that stripping the military budget of 
non-defense programs would free top Pentagon officials -- generals, admirals 
and civilian policy-makers -- to concentrate more on military issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But their real hope is that revamping the budget would generate billions of 
dollars in savings that then could be converted to direct military use. It 
would help "achieve our agenda of a stronger national defense," said Sen. 
Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret why the Pentagon budget is loaded with such oddities. Aid to 
public schools, for example, was added during Korean War days to help school 
districts near military bases absorb the influx of new families. The war ended, 
but the program remained. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental cleanup money was added to help the Pentagon spruce up 
polluted military bases that it is about to close before it makes them 
available for civilian use. And the program to underwrite rifle practice for 
local youths is a holdover from World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Democrats who wanted to provide more money for social 
spending -- and were frustrated by the ceilings that Congress had placed on it 
-- simply funneled the new programs into the Pentagon budget instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result, the size of the non-defense portion of the Pentagon budget 
has soared. The Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan defense-monitoring group, 
estimates that the total has mushroomed to $23 billion in fiscal 1995, up from 
$11.6 billion in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Dov Zakheim, a defense expert with System Planning Corp., a defense-oriented 
consulting firm, argues that a solution would be to transfer responsibility for 
non-defense programs to other agencies, but to leave the money spent for those 
programs in the defense budget for use on the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the idea argue that removing breast-cancer and environmental 
programs may make for a more pristine defense budget, but the Pentagon is 
unlikely to benefit from any savings. Carole Lessure, an analyst for the 
Defense Budget Project, warns that most of the non-defense programs transferred 
to other departments would probably continue to be funded. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speculate that lawmakers will leave the non-defense programs in the 
Pentagon's portfolio, but try to save money by easing regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 That will not yield anywhere near the pot of gold that some pro-defense 
senators envision. But a billion dollars here and there can add up to big 
money.

SOCIAL ISSUES; FUTURES FOR CHILDREN PUTTING ACCENT ON SELF-HELP SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Navajo home day care providers in rural Torreon, N.M., thought they 
needed a fire engine a few years back, they turned to Futures for Children for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization found a Native American firefighter to help the day 
care operators with their problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that because their area had few telephones, few people would be 
able to report a fire, rendering an engine nearly useless. With his help, they 
found other ways to reduce fire hazards, including the use of fire 
extinguishers and smoke detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, says Futures President Ruth Frazier, a self-help solution crafted to 
address a unique situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a valuable principle called 'minimum involvement,' " she says. "Never 
do for people what they can do for themselves. It's the hardest principle of 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 That philosophy might smack of the rhetoric of newly empowered conservatives 
eager to slash social programs, but Futures for Children has been practicing 
what it preaches for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Futures serves Native Americans -- primarily in New Mexico and Arizona -- in 
several ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Futures Through Education program pairs about 2,700 children from tribes 
in New Mexico and Arizona with sponsors who provide financial support and 
encouragement to help keep them in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the organization's community action program oversees up to 50 
projects that embrace self-reliant problem-solving. 
</P>
<P>
 And an annual leadership course for Native American teen-agers takes 40 high 
school students through the process of planning and executing projects that 
benefit their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the project, Futures for Children likes to maintain the lowest of 
profiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The group scarcely advertises and accepts no federal, state or United Way 
money. It relies instead on private donations and grants from corporations and 
foundations. It has especially strong backing in Southern California, Frazier 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Hollywood stars, including Robert Redford, Kevin Costner, Ted Danson, 
Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn and Linda Lavin, have lent their names and time to 
fund raising over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Futures for Children was born of the vision of Richard Saunders, a sociologist 
and educator who was executive director of Save the Children in the 1950s. He 
founded Futures in 1961 at a time when American foreign aid projects were in 
vogue. But as Frazier tells it, Saunders had identified "a missing ingredient" 
in the way such programs routinely were run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people themselves, for whom the development was being done, were not 
involved," says Frazier, who joined the organization in 1974 and became 
president in 1981. "They were the objects of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Before his death in 1990 at the age of 89, Saunders left Frazier some guiding 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
 "One was, don't cut corners," Frazier says. "Another was don't take federal 
funds and get a place of permanence." 
</P>
<P>
 Futures for Children, with 34 full-time and five part-time employees, began 
operating in the Southwest in 1968 after Saunders was approached by Native 
Americans who wanted their children to get an education. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to the sponsorship program, which has served about 6,000 children 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's 2,100 sponsors contribute $360 a year, about 40% of which goes 
directly to the child, with the rest paying for program services. The program 
follows children from kindergarten through college. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the sponsor that simply wants to give money, this probably isn't the 
program," Frazier says, explaining that personal involvement is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors are asked to write, call or visit the children to show an interest in 
their welfare and scholastic success. Students are expected to stay in school 
and maintain a C average or better. Frazier says the yearly dropout rate of 
less than 2% for program participants is a fraction of the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you the closeness of the relationships that develop," she says.

CHARGES IN IRAQ 'FRIENDLY FIRE' INCIDENT ARE DISMISSED; MILITARY: TWENTY-SIX 
DIED IN TWO DOWNED HELICOPTERS. U.S. PILOT CLEARED. AIR FORCE NOW FACES PR 
PROBLEM. 
</P>

<P>
 An Air Force major general on Tuesday dismissed all charges of dereliction and 
negligent homicide against Lt. Col. Randy W. May, the F-15 fighter pilot 
involved in the fatal downing of two U.S. Army helicopters over Iraq last 
spring in one of the worst "friendly fire" cases in U.S. military history. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Eugene D. Santarelli, the 17th Air Force commander who has final 
authority in the case, based his decision on a recommendation made last month 
by the lead investigating officer. The dismissal ends the possibility of 
criminal disciplinary actions against any of the Europe-based U.S. Air Force 
personnel who were involved in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 May, 41, a decorated pilot with almost 20 years of service with the Air Force, 
had been charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide for his role in the 
shoot-down, in which 26 people -- everybody in the two helicopters -- were 
killed. He was also charged with two counts of dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Germany-based 53rd Fighter Squadron, May had been assigned to 
patrol the air space over northern Iraq in an effort to enforce a U.N.-ordered 
ban on Iraqi military flights there. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 14, he and his lead pilot, Capt. Eric A. Wickson, spotted two U.S. 
Blackhawk helicopters, mistook them for Iraqi Hinds and shot them down. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 15 Americans on board, five Kurds working for the United 
States and six military officials from Britain, France and Turkey were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial investigations suggested that May had failed to respond correctly when 
lead pilot Wickson asked him to confirm that the helicopters were Iraqi. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Air Force said Tuesday that Santarelli dismissed the charges because 
May had "followed proper procedures in yielding control of the action to his 
lead pilot." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the investigation, May has stated that Wickson had told him there 
were two enemy helicopters in the "no-fly" zone, and that he saw nothing to 
indicate that this was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 The action Tuesday left one relatively low-ranking officer, a U.S.-based 
captain, as the only official to face a court-martial over the shoot-down, 
which authorities have conceded resulted from a series of blunders reaching far 
up into the chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
 The captain, Jim Wang, had headed the Airborne Warning and Control System 
plane crew that was supposed to have kept track of all aircraft in the region 
and to have warned the patrolling F-15s that the helicopters were American, not 
Iraqi. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force announced on Monday that Wang will face a court-martial on three 
counts of dereliction of duty but dismissed similar charges against two majors 
and two lieutenants who were also aboard the AWACS plane. All of these 
decisions were in line with investigators' recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Air Force a few weeks ago dropped similar charges against 
Wickson, who was also later given immunity in return for his testimony in the 
investigation involving May. 
</P>
<P>
 The round of decisions, made in accordance with longstanding Air Force 
procedures for such incidents, has left the service -- and its leaders -- in 
something of a public-relations quandary over the way it has handled the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 While many insiders support the dismissals of charges as justified, on grounds 
that the deficiencies were in Air Force procedures more than in the conduct of 
one or two officers, they fear that the public may perceive the decisions as a 
whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Pentagon officials said Tuesday that the Air Force was 
considering the unusual step of making public the administrative punishment 
that several of the officers involved have received in place of a 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon already announced in June that Brig. Gen. Jeffrey S. Pilkington, 
who had been in charge of the operation in northern Iraq at the time of the 
shoot-down, had been relieved of his command in the wake of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointedly, the Air Force also issued a news release Tuesday stating that the 
dismissal of the charges against May "does not preclude administrative action" 
against any of the individuals involved in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kind of announcement is going to be worked out," one Air Force officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh reported from Berlin, Pine from Washington.

 A U.S. reconnaissance airplane developed mechanical trouble and crashed in a 
rice paddy on South Korea's west coast today, but the U.S. military command 
said the two pilots escaped safely. 
</P>
<P>
 The RV-1 Mohawk airplane was on a routine training mission before it crashed 
about 8:30 a.m. near the farming village of Taean, 40 miles south of Osan Air 
Base located south of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military spokesman Jim Coles could not confirm South Korean news reports 
that the airplane burst into flames. He said no further details were likely 
until the command completed its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash came four days after a U.S. Army helicopter drifted across the 
demilitarized zone and went down in North Korea, killing one of its two pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Coles said there was no connection between the two accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run tens of thousands of flights a year and have maybe a dozen accidents," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, North Korea continued to stonewall U.S. demands for the release of 
the surviving pilot and remains of the dead one in the North Korean helicopter 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration formally warned North Korea on Tuesday that if it 
does not quickly release the U.S. Army pilot whose helicopter went down there 
Saturday, U.S.-North Korean cooperation on nuclear and economic issues may be 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting with reporters, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
any further delay "would be of great concern to (the United States) and would 
affect the atmosphere in which we'd been hoping to improve our relations with 
North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 If the North Koreans "do act promptly and in a humane way on that subject, it 
will be conducive to good relations," he added. "But the other side of the 
coin, unfortunately, is true as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's warning, which the secretary said also was delivered through 
diplomatic channels to Pyongyang, was the strongest public statement by a 
high-ranking Administration official about the consequences of not releasing 
the surviving pilot, as well as the body of his fellow pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said Sunday that the co-pilot of the helicopter, Chief 
Warrant Officer David Hilemon of Clarkesville, Tenn., was killed in the 
incident, while the pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall of Brooksville, 
Fla., is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have said the helicopter, which was unarmed, accidentally 
strayed while on a routine training mission and edged 11.4 miles north of the 
border. The Pentagon says it still does not know whether it was shot down or 
was forced to land because of mechanical failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration policy-makers took a low-key approach for several days after 
the incident but began hinting Monday that the broader talks would be 
jeopardized if Pyongyang did not act soon. Christopher underscored that warning 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Administration officials had been hoping that relations between the two 
countries would improve in the face of the broader talks, which have been aimed 
at patching up a dispute over North Korea's nuclear weapons program and 
providing Pyongyang with new aid in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pyongyang has been slow to meet U.S. demands in the helicopter 
incident, and Administration policy-makers have become increasingly frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, North Korean representatives to the U.N. Military Armistice 
Commission at Panmunjom -- one of the three principal conduits for relations 
between the two governments -- agreed to take the U.S. request to their 
country's leadership. There has been no reply so far. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Christopher said late Tuesday that Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who 
is in Pyongyang and acting as a U.S. envoy, would meet within a few hours with 
a high-ranking official of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also has been pursuing the issue through the North Korean 
mission at the United Nations in New York, which frequently has served as an 
informal channel for the broader talks, and through other countries in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials conceded privately that, up to a point, they are forced to play 
a waiting game while Pyongyang tries to make the most of the situation for its 
own political ends. In the meantime, the North Koreans are keeping the 
Administration on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon already has admitted that the helicopter strayed into North 
Korean airspace by mistake -- an unusual bit of candor designed to win more 
rapid release of the two pilots. However, U.S. officials so far have declined 
to apologize for the incursion. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's warning was underscored by Winston Lord, assistant secretary of 
state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, who told reporters that "how this 
issue is resolved and how soon it is resolved is very important for our 
bilateral relations with North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're engaged in very serious efforts of gaining the crew . . . as well as 
the helicopter and personal effects," he said. 
</P>

CHECHENS FORM HUMAN CHAIN TO DEFY RUSSIA; CAUCASUS: TENS OF THOUSANDS LINE 
HIGHWAY FOR 40 MILES. BOMBS FALL NEAR STREETCAR STATION IN CENTER OF CAPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a striking show of mass defiance, at least 100,000 Chechens lined their 
last unoccupied highway Tuesday to call for peace as Russian troops stepped up 
land and air attacks on their tiny breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Chechen officials moved from the nine-story presidential palace here to an 
underground shelter after two bombs exploded nearby Monday night in the first 
major air assault on the city center. Frigid wind whistled through President 
Dzhokar M. Dudayev's empty office, and snow dusted the windowsills. 
</P>
<P>
 Tearful homeowners picked through the rubble of their possessions in a 
residential neighborhood near Grozny's central streetcar station where the two 
bombs hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That used to be my house," said clockmaker Ruslan Ismailov, pointing at the 
partial husk of a structure. "We'll deal with those Russian pigs!" 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were confirmed dead Tuesday morning in three overnight air raids on 
this oil-refining center. But the bombs and the constant thumping of prolonged 
battle in the northern suburb of Petropavlovskaya heightened tension among the 
estimated 200,000 people still in Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Kremlin promised "decisive offensive actions" to press Dudayev into 
renouncing his oil-rich republic's claim to independence, fully a tenth of 
Chechnya's mostly Muslim population took to its main highway in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women, infants and old people walled the 40-mile stretch of the 
Moscow-Baku highway from the eastern outskirts of Grozny to the Dagestan 
border. Many carried hand-lettered signs demanding "Freedom for Chechnya" and 
"Yeltsin! Stop the War!" 
</P>
<P>
 At prayer time, many in the crowd laid lambskin coats on the fresh snow and 
knelt on the curly wool, facing Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want freedom and independence," said Makhmadselakh Bechiev, a driver who 
had been standing in the wet snow for two hours. "If we have to, we'll stand 
forever, until there's peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Andi Natsulkhanov, a 62-year-old farmer, said villagers had turned out in such 
numbers because "all of the Chechen population wants to live its own life." 
</P>
<P>
 "No Chechen," he said, "wants all our issues here to be solved by bombing and 
killing and the destruction of all that was built." 
</P>
<P>
 The great line of people had many gaps along the road but swelled into huddled 
crowds near towns and spilled into Dagestan, a Russian republic, where 
thousands joined the protesters in solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers had billed the lineup as a march of peace meant to involve the 
entire North Caucasus. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians have warned that Russia's military moves in Chechnya could explode 
into a new Caucasus war, a modern twist on the conflict that dragged on for 
decades in the mid-19th Century, when czarist Russia tried to force the 
mountain region into its empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven Russian soldiers have been reported killed since President Boris 
N. Yeltsin's government sent 10,000 or more troops into Chechnya on Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechen fighters shot down a Russian helicopter Tuesday in the battle for 
Petropavlovskaya, killing two military doctors and a crewman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody had bothered to count Chechen casualties until Sergei Kovalyov, 
Yeltsin's human rights commissioner, reported Tuesday having personally seen 
the bodies of 42 civilians killed in fighting outside Grozny and bombing raids 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scale of human rights violations by the Russian troops in Chechnya is 
such that the conflict has ceased to be just an internal affair of Russia," 
said Kovalyov, who opposed the offensive from the start. His comments echoed 
protests and calls for peace talks by Turkey, Iran, Jordan and other 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wind-swept presidential palace, Dudayev adviser Abdullah Dadayev said 
the Chechen conflict is more likely to become a rerun of the Afghanistan war 
that bogged down and humiliated the Soviet army in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a drawn-out war," he said. "We've prepared a long time for it, 
and it will be another Afghanistan, whether we want it to be or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's Kremlin statement made it clear that the attacks are aimed in part 
at destroying the Chechens' store of war materiel. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen pieces of "combat hardware" and 10 artillery guns were destroyed in 
the last 24 hours, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main combat Tuesday was focused in Petropavlovskaya, which was reported 
Monday to have been overrun by the advancing Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 But Musa Mirzhuyev, Dudayev's liaison with his fighters, said Tuesday that 
Chechen forces in the suburb were holding back Russian tanks and artillery guns 
with grenades and machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll beat them back," Mirzhuyev vowed. He said he still expected the Russian 
troops to try to storm Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the accelerated bombing and shelling of Grozny and its outskirts, 
Moscow appeared to be holding back, possibly hoping to persuade Dudayev to 
agree to disarm his fighters -- the one concession demanded by Russia for a 
resumption of peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the destroyed houses near Grozny's streetcar station said a bomb 
crater left in an intersection indicated that the Russian planes were dropping 
one-ton bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 The crater measured about 20 feet across and 10 feet deep -- a devastating hit 
but far short of what the former Soviet air force could do if it attacked full 
force.

 A citizens health group petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to ban 
most uses of bone screws in the spine until they can be shown to be safe and 
effective. Public Citizen Health Research Group said the expensive and often 
dangerous screws are implanted in the spines of up to 70,000 people a year as a 
treatment for back pain. The group's report on the orthopedic screws said that 
there was a 33% complication rate and that patients were twice more likely to 
need additional spinal operations than patients getting spinal fusion without 
screws.

JUDGE REJECTS FLORIDA'S ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Tuesday threw out Gov. Lawton Chiles' lawsuit seeking $1.5 billion 
from the federal government to cover Florida's costs of coping with illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis said he doesn't have the authority to 
order the government to compensate Florida and said the dispute is political in 
nature -- not legal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first in a series of lawsuits filed by five states that accuse the 
federal government of not enforcing U.S. immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Chiles vowed to appeal the ruling, which he called a 
"temporary setback in our efforts to bring immigration justice to Florida's 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 "While we are disappointed by the court's action, we are still committed to 
pressing Florida's case and will explore every avenue open to us to make sure 
the federal government does right by Florida," Chiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state filed the lawsuit in April, accusing the federal government of 
failing to protect its borders, thereby encouraging a continued influx of 
illegal immigrants into Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time the suit was filed, Chiles estimated there were 350,000 illegal 
immigrants living in Florida, a state of some 13 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit said Florida spends more than $1 billion a year on services such as 
education, medical care and law enforcement and prisons for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 It said Florida is a victim of "an ongoing immigration emergency that 
endangers the lives, property, safety and economic welfare of the residents of 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles said his state has been picking up the tab for immigration for more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Herndon, the governor's chief of staff, said the governor and state Atty. 
Gen. Bob Butterworth intended to appeal the dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, California, Texas and New Jersey are also suing. In a hearing last 
week in Texas, a federal judge said he is likely to dismiss the lawsuit there 
also, though he gave the state time to file more arguments.

GERGEN HAS SOME DO'S AND DON'TS FOR CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Gergen, who has filled the awkward role of house Republican in the 
Clinton Administration, on Tuesday urged President Clinton to focus more, speak 
less and hire some experienced aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen, who leaves at the end of the month to become a visiting professor at 
Duke University, ended his sometimes-rocky 18-month adventure in the Clinton 
inner circle with a load of Polonius-like counsel for the young President: 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton should resist the notion that "more communication is better 
communication" and limit his public appearances to those in which he has 
something meaningful to say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton should concentrate on two or three domestic policy initiatives and 
two or three foreign policy problems and not get so distracted by the daily 
static of public life. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton should bring his Cabinet members out of the White House shadow and 
use their talents and voices to better articulate the Administration's vision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton should widen his circle of advisers to include more White House 
veterans, more Democratic elder statesmen, and, yes, more moderate Republicans 
like Gergen. 
</P>
<P>
 * And Clinton should lower public expectations about what government can do to 
change people's daily lives and focus on things that will affect people 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the defeats and recurrent crises of the first two years of the 
Administration, Gergen said that Clinton has been a better President than is 
generally recognized and still has an opportunity to reclaim the public's 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me just say . . . that Bill Clinton substantively has been a more 
successful President than he has been politically," Gergen said at a breakfast 
with Times reporters and editors. "I think he has accomplished more than he's 
given credit for." 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen acknowledged that Clinton and his senior staff -- including Gergen 
himself -- had made countless mistakes, from the early effort to integrate gays 
into the military to the over-ambitious design of the failed health care 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The former editor of U.S. News & World Report said that his hiring in mid-1993 
was met with resentment by many of the younger members of the Clinton staff, 
not only because he was given a broad portfolio to advise on policy and public 
relations but also because he had served in three Republican administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen also said that he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had clashed on 
a number of policy issues, including health care, and that by the end of 1993 
he had lost his effectiveness and had decided to leave the White House. But 
Clinton persuaded him to stay and earlier this year he found a home at the 
State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen said that Clinton was handicapped by two currents not of his making -- 
public skepticism about the government's ability to handle complex national 
problems and economic anxiety that caused people to seek someone to blame for 
their stagnant wages and dead-end jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's made it more difficult to govern and I think that's created an 
angrier electorate. That kind of anger and resentment looks for scapegoats," 
Gergen said. "It's a free-floating kind of resentment that may attach itself to 
immigrants as it did with (California's) Proposition 187. It may attach itself 
to all sorts of forces. And I think it has attached itself, to a very large 
degree, to President Clinton, so that he becomes the object of a lot of the 
unhappiness that people feel in their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House aide agreed with much of Gergen's diagnosis of Clinton's 
ills but noted testily that Gergen had been present at the creation of many of 
the problems he identified.

ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP REPORTS RISE IN THREATS AGAINST DOCTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Death threats against abortion doctors rose during 1994 even as other forms of 
violence and harassment aimed at abortion clinics declined, according to a 
survey released by an abortion rights organization Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of four abortion clinics reported that their doctors and staff members 
received death threats in 1994, making it the fastest growing form of 
harassment aimed at clinics and their staffs, according to the survey by the 
Fund for the Feminist Majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of more than 300 clinics was released just as a federal grand jury 
was meeting outside Washington to investigate a possible conspiracy behind the 
recent wave of anti-abortion violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury is working with the new Justice Department task force on 
anti-abortion violence, which was established after the murder of a physician 
and his bodyguard in Pensacola, Fla., on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is taking advantage of the new Freedom of Access to Clinic 
Entrances law that gives federal law enforcement officials broader jurisdiction 
to investigate anti-abortion violence. 
</P>
<P>
 John Burt, a leading anti-abortion protester from Pensacola, reportedly has 
been called to testify before the grand jury. Abortion rights groups said that 
Burt has links to Paul Hill, a Pensacola anti-abortion leader who was convicted 
in the shotgun killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that 17% of clinics experienced an increase in death threats 
after the Pensacola murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, said that the 
decision by the Clinton Administration to place U.S. marshals at some clinics 
around the country has helped to reduce the level of violence aimed at clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said the increase in death threats demonstrates that, because 
extremists are finding it more difficult to attack heavily guarded clinics, 
they are targeting doctors and clinic staff members personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the survey found that 51.9% of clinics experienced one or more types 
of violence or harassment in 1994, including death threats, stalking, chemical 
attacks, bombings and bomb threats, invasions, arson and arson threats and 
blockades. That total was slightly higher than in 1993, when 50.2% of clinics 
surveyed reported incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-abortion leaders dismissed the survey as biased and misleading. Patrick 
Mahoney, a spokesman for the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, said that 
the Fund for the Feminist Majority inflates the figures by lumping acts of 
violence together with peaceful forms of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any study not independently confirmed and done by a group like the Feminist 
Majority does not accurately reflect what's going on," Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the Justice Department filed its first civil lawsuit 
under the clinic access law seeking "substantial" money damages from six 
defendants already convicted of blockading an abortion clinic in Milwaukee and 
two others allegedly involved in the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The six were convicted Nov. 15 by a federal court in Milwaukee in the first 
criminal application of the clinic access law. They are scheduled to be 
sentenced Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas P. Schneider, U.S. attorney in Milwaukee, noted that his office had 
promised last June to enforce the new law aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's civil suit seeks to intervene in a pending damage suit 
brought by the clinic involved -- Affiliated Medical Services Clinic. The 
private suit is limited to $5,000, unless actual damages suffered by the clinic 
are greater. But the government is seeking a larger penalty -- actual damages 
for all parties, including Milwaukee's police and fire departments, and civil 
penalties of $10,000 from each defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is also asking for an injunction to bar the defendants from 
taking part in any further clinic obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department suit alleged that the eight defendants constructed 
blockades at the two entrances of Affiliated Medical Services. Inoperable cars 
were parked in front of each entrance, with two defendants chained and locked 
inside each of them.

 And now, the end is near. One more Ram game in Orange County and that is all, 
according to the whistling winds blowing west to east toward St. Louis. One 
more game, between the 4-11 Rams and the 2-13 Washington Redskins -- on 
Christmas Eve, yet -- and that's it. 
</P>
<P>
 See you later. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy holidays.

 Hate to lose and run, but, well, you know how it goes.

 If this is really goodby, if the Rams are 90%-going-on-100% Missouri-bound, 
why should anyone bother to attend the send-off? The season's gone. The coach's 
gone. The franchise's gone.

 Give me one good reason why I should spend the day before Christmas at Anaheim 
Stadium, watching the nightmare before Christmas, you say.

DEAL NOT CLOSE ON NEW STADIUM; HOLLYWOOD PARK: THERE ARE STILL BIG HANG-UPS FOR 
NEW FACILITY, WITH RAIDER OWNER AL DAVIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS, AS USUAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH AND THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed 65,000-seat football stadium at Hollywood Park that would house the 
Raiders and perhaps UCLA faces major obstacles before such a deal can be 
consummated, sources told The Times Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems that have arisen during months of sporadic negotiations are 
financing,competition from Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the lack of a 
commitment from the NFL and difficulty in dealing with Raider owner Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium, projected to cost $175 million-$200 million, with at least 100 
luxury boxes, would supposedly be ready for play, if built, by the 1997 season 
at an unspecific Inglewood location on 90th St. near Hollywood Park and the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one source, a proposed agreement has been on Davis' desk for 
weeks, butdespite his professed antipathy to the Coliseum, where his team plays 
now, he hasn't signed it and is seeking better terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and R.D. Hubbard, Hollywood Park chief executive officer, last talked 
Dec. 3, but nowmatters are on indefinite hold depending on Raider playoff 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has reportedly proven difficult to deal with as his mood fluctuates 
based on his team winning or losing. About two months ago, Hollywood Park 
threatened to call off the deal, but the Raiders came back stronger, indicating 
that Hollywood Park was where they wanted to be. However, no action is expected 
in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Greg Aiello, director of communications for the NFL, said: 
"Discussions have taken place. But (Hollywood Park) is not necessarily the lone 
way to go. It is one of several opportunities out there. It is far from being a 
done deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing concrete yet. We're interested in working to get new 
facilities, but that's not an unusual role for us." 
</P>
<P>
 An NFL source said Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had met with Riordan to discuss 
possible stadium sites. The NFL has reportedly offered to put Super Bowls, 
perhaps as often as every other year, at a new stadium if that would ease the 
financing problems and expedite its completion. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Riordan, while interested in the Super Bowls, was not in Hollywood 
Park's corner Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, according to press secretary Noelia Rodriguez, wants the Raiders 
inside the Los Angeles city limits, and very probably at an improved Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're supporting the ongoing efforts of the Coliseum Commission to make the 
Coliseum a world-class stadium," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said during public appearances Tuesday that he views Hollywood Park as 
a competitor and is not privy to its negotiations with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 There are serious questions, however, whether the Coliseum is a viable 
contender for future Raider play. Coliseum negotiators freely concede that they 
are at complete loggerheads with Davis, and, just as in past years -- when the 
Raiders accepted tentative deals with Irwindale and Oakland -- the Coliseum 
might succeed in retaining Davis only when other deals fall through. 
</P>
<P>
 A big question is Hollywood Park's ability to take on a huge new venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The company does not expect to make any profits this year because of the 
delayed and costly launch of its new card club casino next to the racetrack and 
because of poor results from the Woodlands, the Kansas racetrack it bought a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park stock has recently tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 The company shocked Wall Street last Sept. 27 when it announced that instead 
of earning $7 million to $8 million this year as analysts had predicted, it 
would barely break even. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news sent Hollywood Park stock plunging from $20.50 to $14 in a single 
day. It has since slipped even further, closing Tuesday at $11.125 in trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange. That's a big comedown from a year ago, when it 
was selling for more than $30 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 What most hurt earnings was that the card club opened six months behind 
schedule and had higher than expected overhead costs when it did open. "They 
had absolutely incredible cost overruns," said analyst Kenneth A. Peterson of 
Red Chip Review in Portland, Ore. "They wereserving complimentary food and 
beverage to almost anybody with a pulse." 
</P>
<P>
 Another disappointment has been the performance of the Woodlands, which 
Hollywood Park bought a year ago for $70 million, including debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind the deal was that the Kansas legislature would quickly 
approve casino-style gambling for the facility so that it could compete with 
riverboat casinos across the Missouri River in Kansas City, Mo. It didn't 
happen this year, and the riverboats took patrons away from the track. 
Hollywood Park is predicting that the legislature will approve the gambling in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 With those problems, is the company able to take on an expensive stadium 
project? 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park has more than $50 million in cash on hand and virtually no 
long-term debt, so "they could get it done financially," said Craig Bibb, an 
analyst at PaineWebber in New York. He noted, however, that it would be a 
questionable use of such a large amount of capital, considering that stadium 
ownership has never been as lucrative as team ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 He speculated that the City of Inglewood could help with the financing by 
providing a guarantee on industrial revenue bonds that could be used to build 
the stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Such financial backing would lower the interest rate that Hollywood Park would 
have to pay and would cost the city nothing -- unless Hollywood Park defaulted 
on the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 One expert who endorsed the stadium idea, however, was Michael S. Megna, a 
Thiensville, Wis.-based consultant on professional sports finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Rams 99% sure to be leaving and the location halfway between 
Downtown L.A. and Anaheim, this is a no-brainer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Megna acknowledged that some NFL owners might worry about the proximity of the 
stadium to a gambling facility, but he pointed out that Davis has successfully 
sued the league when it tried to block his earlier moves. 
</P>

MIKE DOWNEY: PULL RAMS OVER AT THE STATE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Personally, I don't think the Rams leaving town would be such a terrible way 
to end 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, with one big-league football team instead of two (unless you 
count Mater Dei) we could finally get that TV blackout rule lifted and be able 
to view both ends of an NFL doubleheader, rather than professional wrestling or 
Gilligan still shipwrecked on that stupid island. 
</P>
<P>
 We therefore wouldn't have to lay out $895 for one of those Frisbee-sized TV 
satellite dishes with which, on a clear day, you can pick up everything from 
Nova Scotia junior hockey to "Monday Night Soccer" live from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were always glamorous to me and I can see where moving might be 
traumatic. Does anyone think Merlin Olsen or Fred Dryer would have gotten TV 
shows of their own had either of them been St. Louis Cardinals? No way. You 
don't get to be Father Murphy by being a Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas Eve's game at Anaheim Stadium could be our final first-hand look at 
the California branch of the Rams, who are threatening to move to Maryland or 
Missouri or Connecticut or Iran or Japan or wherever the money's sweeter. I 
only hope they don't rent vans from U-Haul and sneak out of town at midnight. 
Please don't make us send one of those Channel 7 Eyewitness News helicopters 
after you. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless: 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 20 reasons why the Rams should reconsider leaving: 
</P>
<P>
 1. St. Louis has money, unlike Orange County, so it would be an expensive 
place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 2. People in the Midwest have basements, and the Rams have been in the 
basement long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Georgia Frontiere will tire of shopping at Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Missouri folks might call him "Jerry" Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Al Davis would move his team to Anaheim and, next thing you know, Mickey 
Mouse is found beaten into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 6. The legal age for drinking beer in St. Louis is, I believe, 6. 
</P>
<P>
 7. The only theme park there is the National Bowling Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Football players in St. Louis must step behind all those Clydesdale horses 
and this presents a continuing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Usual halftime entertainment: Ozzie Smith doing back flips. 
</P>
<P>
 10. St. Louis does have the Blues. Then again, so do most Ram season-ticket 
holders. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Anheuser-Busch will never allow a quarterback named Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Sean Gilbert must rename his sack dance from "Earthquake" to "Flood" or 
"Tornado." 
</P>
<P>
 13. Trust me, people there would rather have Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 14. This guy Peter Angelos is just waiting to buy the St. Louis Rams so he can 
move them to Baltimore. (This guy is waiting to buy anything to move it to 
Baltimore. This guy would buy the White House and move it to Baltimore.) 
</P>
<P>
 15. Nobody ever chants, "Beat Saint Looie!" 
</P>
<P>
 16. All movies with Warren Beatty playing a former L.A. Ram quarterback will 
have to be re-shot or edited. 
</P>
<P>
 17. When introduced to "Deacon Jones," Midwest people will automatically pass 
a plate and take up a collection. 
</P>
<P>
 18. The Mississippi River is not what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 19. Nobody mentioned that the new stadium is actually in East St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 20. Those Missouri winters are going to be hard on Jackie Slater's rheumatism, 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, I am only goofing and I would much prefer that the Rams stick 
around. We make fun of the Rams today because they have played such pitiful 
football throughout the '90s, but they have also given us some glorious 
moments, like . . . like . . . well, maybe I'm not old enough to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 What I do know is that it is preposterous to blame their leaving on lack of 
fan support, because, as an old St. Louis Cardinal football lover of my 
acquaintance once said, "Nobody ever told us that we had to keep supporting a 
bad product until it became a good product." St. Louisans are smart. They know 
better now. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram fans committed the cardinal sin of not caring. It is your team and you 
have to be there for your team, good or bad, because it will leave you. Teams 
become free agents, just like athletes. They go looking for better offers. St. 
Louis and Baltimore found out the hard way, better to see somebody than nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish the governor could step in Saturday and keep the Rams from leaving. But 
that's what people have been doing in California since 1994 began -- leaving.

ROOKIE ROLLER COASTER; LINEBACKER FREDRICKSON'S FIRST SEASON WITH RAIDERS HAS 
BEEN UP AND DOWN, BUT LATELY HE'S ON THE RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 News flash to the Kansas City Chiefs: Raider outside linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson no longer plays like a rookie. For verification, consult the 
Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing about Rob is that he's very intelligent and he learns from his 
mistakes," Raider linebacker coach Jim Haslett said Tuesday. "He can obviously 
run and can hit, but he also can smell plays out, once he's seen them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks learned that Sunday night when they tried to test the first-round 
draft choice from Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, Fredrickson was burned on a key fourth-quarter touchdown pass 
by Miami's Dan Marino to running back Keith Byars in the Raiders' 20-17 
overtime loss. 
</P>
<P>
 When Seattle tried the same play, however, Fredrickson knocked down Dan 
McGwire's sideline pass to Mack Strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good example of how he's grown," Haslett said. "That was the same 
exact play that he got beat on for a touchdown early in the season, but he 
recognized it and made the play this time." 
</P>
<P>
 With one regular-season game remaining, Saturday's against Kansas City, 
Fredrickson acknowledges that he has had a roller-coaster type of season. But 
he also points out that he has made great strides lately, just as the Raiders 
have done as a team.  
</P>
<P>
 "Going from college to the NFL, mentally, is like going from playing checkers 
to chess," Fredrickson said. "Physically, the level of play on the field has 
been like I expected. But off the field is a different story. The studying and 
preparation is a lot harder." 
</P>
<P>
 After missing the first nine days of training camp before signing a five-year, 
$4.875-million contract, Fredrickson joined the Raiders with great 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the team's first linebacker to have been drafted in the first round, he 
began the season at middle linebacker and was penciled in to challenge 
second-year veteran Greg Biekert for the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson's problem, however, was that he had never played inside 
linebacker, which made his transition from the Big Ten to the AFC West that 
much tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 "In training camp, I opened at middle linebacker, which was totally new to 
me," he said. "I don't think that I performed up to mine or the coaches' 
expectations at the beginning of the season. My reaction time and inconsistent 
play was really a problem in that I always wanted to make sure that I did the 
right thing before going full thrust." 
</P>
<P>
 And with Biekert playing well at middle linebacker, it did not take long for 
the Raiders to realize that they were playing Fredrickson out of position. So 
they moved him back outside. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a move that could not have gone better. 
</P>
<P>
 Since replacing Aaron Wallace in the starting lineup before the fifth game of 
the season at New England, Fredrickson has played well enough to become a 
favorite for AFC rookie defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "With more practice and reps in games, I've gotten better," Fredrickson said. 
" 'Practice makes perfect' has worked with me. It's been a roller-coaster year 
for me, but things have gotten better lately." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 4, 240 pounds, Fredrickson is third on the team in tackles with 75, 
including 53 solo stops. He is tied for fourth in sacks with three and is 
second among linebackers with three pass defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just put him in there and he's had to play," Haslett said. "Some people 
around the league have said that they're surprised that he was starting this 
early because they thought that it might take a year or two. But I felt that he 
had that kind of talent to step right in there and play right from the first 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Fredrickson will be challenged by Kansas City quarterback Joe 
Montana and the Chiefs' mobile passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really like to run a lot of bootlegs and rollouts with Montana," Raider 
Coach Art Shell said. "They like to move the ball around and get it to a 
variety of receivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Which means the play of Fredrickson, who had four tackles in their first 
meeting, will be a key. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be going up against Derrick Walker, who is a good solid tight end, and 
Marcus Allen coming out of the backfield," he said. "Joe is very mobile and 
they run a lot of play-action passes. It's going to be a good test again."

IT'S LENDL WHO GETS WORN OUT; TENNIS: FORMER NO. 1 PLAYER RETIRES BECAUSE OF 
LINGERING BACK INJURY AT 34. HE WON ALMOST EVERYTHING BUT WIMBLEDON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ivan Lendl, the dour Czech-born tennis star who won 94 tournaments, eight 
Grand Slam event titles and more than $20 million in prize money -- but never 
won Wimbledon -- announced his retirement Tuesday at 34 because of a lingering 
back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl held the No. 1 ranking for a record 270 weeks, but he fell out of the 
top 10 last year for the first time since he turned pro in 1978. At the U.S. 
Open last fall, Lendl had to quit during a second-round match because of his 
back and hinted afterward that retirement was not out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 He made it official in a conference call to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is never easy," Lendl said of his decision. "I enjoyed playing the game, 
had a lot of great times, and I will miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl leaves behind a legacy as one of the game's greatest baseline players 
whose game was flawed by a numbingly repetitive ground-stroke style. He also 
showed a grating personality that drew few fans his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he gave much of himself to the public," tennis great Jack 
Kramer said. "He didn't look like he was enjoying himself too much. Somehow or 
other, he was brought up not to care about anything except the next ball coming 
his way. He was a sourpuss." 
</P>
<P>
 The only man in tennis to have played in 19 Grand Slam event finals, Lendl 
reached eight consecutive U.S. Open finals from 1982-1989 and won three. So at 
home was he on the hard court at Flushing Meadow, he built an identical 
Decoturf II court in his back yard in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl was the dominant force of men's tennis from 1984-89, turning his career 
around after losing to Jimmy Connors in the 1983 U.S. Open final in four sets, 
when he failed to win a game in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Lendl's fourth appearance in a Grand Slam event final and his fourth 
defeat. But Lendl erased his image as a choker in the 1984 French Open final 
against his nemesis, John McEnroe. Lendl lost the first two sets on the red 
clay of Roland Garros, then won the next three for a 3-6, 2-6, 6-4, 7-5, 7-5 
comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In his next 18 Grand Slam appearances, Lendl won seven more titles and made 
the final in six others. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never conquered Wimbledon. He tried and failed 14 times. He came close 
twice, but had the misfortune of running into 18-year-old Boris Becker in the 
1986 final and meteoric Pat Cash in the 1987 final. Lendl skipped Wimbledon 
this year to receive treatment for his back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The last match Lendl played at Wimbledon was in 1993 when he lost in the 
second round in straight sets, his earliest exit in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl's normal style was not serve and volley, but he tried for years, in 
vain, to play a grass court style at Wimbledon. Kramer said that was a mistake, 
considering that other baseline players such as Bjorn Borg and Andre Agassi 
stayed back and still were able to win on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the tragedy of his career is that he tried to change his game to try 
to win Wimbledon," Kramer said. "He really suffered from the notion that he 
wasn't an all-court player and tried to change that by winning at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was lucky to have a great serve, but he didn't know how to back it up," 
Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his prime, Lendl overpowered his opponents with his forehand and an 
approach to a match that he was prepared to slug for as long as it took, even 
if it was the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors said Lendl's conditioning was instrumental in his success. "His 
ability to wear guys down was pretty strong," he said. "It's too bad he can't 
leave on his own terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl won his eighth and last Grand Slam event in the 1990 Australian Open, 
when he scored a straight-set victory over Miloslav Mecir, another Czech who 
was forced to retire two years later because of a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl became a U.S. citizen in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 An only child, Lendl was born in the coal-mining city of Ostrava in the former 
Czechoslovakia, near the Polish border. Ostrava is sometimes called "the black 
city" because of the soot spewed by smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lendl's father, Jiri, was once ranked among the top tennis players in the 
country. Olga Jenistova Lendlova, Lendl's mother, was once ranked No. 2 in the 
former Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4, Lendl was hitting tennis balls against a wall with a wooden paddle. If 
he could not find someone to play against, he went back to the wall, which he 
said he didn't like to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't beat the wall," Lendl once said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his opponents felt that way about him.

CSUN FOOTBALL'S CHANCES: 1 IN 4; REFERENDUM: THREE OF THE FOUR PROPOSALS WOULD 
ELIMINATE THE SCHOOL'S BIGGEST PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As expected, the fate of four Cal State Northridge athletic programs will be 
left in the hands of the student body, the school announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of research, Northridge released four athletics funding scenarios, 
three of which would result in the elimination of football and include student 
fee hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 As detailed Sunday by The Times, football, women's basketball, men's soccer 
and men's swimming will be cut if any of the referendum options are defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 After soliciting feedback on the proposals, President Blenda J. Wilson is 
expected to announce in mid-January which option will be placed on the student 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Students election is set for March 8-9. The school has failed 
in two previous attempts to pass referendums this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's going to work," Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said. "I'm 
hopeful, but we're still in the same climate when we asked them to support us 
last time." 
</P>
<P>
 The scenarios, released by Wilson after lengthy analysis by a faculty 
committee, cover a broad spectrum. The athletic budget for 1995-96 could range 
from $2.92 million to $4.38 million. Athletics, which faces a deficit of 
$700,000 next year, currently has a budget of $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 What the referendum options mean to students in terms of what they get for 
their money: 
</P>
<P>
 * Under the best-case scenario for athletics, students each would be charged 
$27 each semester and all existing programs would be funded at a higher level. 
Women's soccer also would be added, perhaps for the 1995 fall season. This is 
the only proposal in which the school's NCAA Division I-AA football team would 
be retained. Total annual budget: $4.38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Under another option, students would pay $19 per semester. Football would be 
cut, but funding for the remaining programs would increase. Women's soccer 
would be added. Total budget: $3.84 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * A third plan calls for students to pay $15 per semester to maintain 
athletics on a cost-containment level. Football would be axed, but the plan 
would ensure that all remaining programs would be funded at current or slightly 
higher levels. Women's soccer would be added. Total budget: $3.67 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * There is also a worst-case scenario. If any referendum scheme is shot down 
by student vote, Northridge would slash athletics to 14 teams, the bare minimum 
required for Division I membership. Football, women's basketball, men's soccer 
and men's swimming would be eliminated and women's soccer would not be added. 
Total budget: $2.92 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert predicted that there is a remote possibility Wilson might choose the 
worst-case scenario as the best for Northridge -- eliminating the need for 
another election -- but believes she is committed to staging another 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert conceded that trimming women's basketball, a program that has 
struggled mightily over the past few seasons, would make joining a major 
conference difficult. Basketball carries the highest annual tab, $219,000 for 
1994-95, of any women's sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994-95, the price tag for men's soccer was $80,000. Men's swimming cost 
$53,000 and football cost $530,000. Football, which faces elimination under 
three scenarios, seems in particular jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad there's one (option) that has football in it," Hiegert said. "It's 
hard to keep football in the quotient when you're dealing with balancing 
budgets, gender equity and such."

IT'S NOT AFTER YOU; EXPERTS SAY GREAT WHITE SHARK HAS BAD REPUTATION AS 
MAN-EATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great white sharks are showing their teeth again off the coast of California. 
</P>
<P>
 One struck fatally off Santa Barbara two weeks ago, attacking a diver while he 
searched for sea urchins off San Miguel Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Another was sighted last week feeding on an elephant seal between Newport 
Beach and Santa Catalina Island, only a few thrusts of the tail from a 
coastline dotted with surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was photographed by a commercial fisherman. The media were alerted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man-eater's estimated length was 18 to 20 feet and its estimated weight 
was over 5,000 pounds," said a news release sent out by a saltwater tackle 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 So, once again, great white sharks have been labeled man-eaters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a reputation the shark can't seem to shake, an image revived after every 
attack, after nearly every sighting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a reputation, scientists say, that is unwarranted, one that stems 
from the ignorance of a public whose perception of the great white is one of a 
giant killing machine and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being attacked by a great white is certainly a horrific thing, but it is an 
anomaly," Ken Goldman, 31, an aquatic biologist at San Francisco's Steinhart 
Aquarium, said after the attack Dec. 9 that killed 42-year-old diver James 
Robinson of Santa Barbara.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldman pointed out that through 1993, there have been only 76 confirmed 
attacks by great whites on humans since 1926, and of those only seven resulted 
in fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "So being eaten by a white shark is even more of an anomaly than being 
attacked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, Scot Anderson and Peter Pyle have spent the last several years 
studying white shark behavior off the Farallon Islands, a 211-acre grouping of 
steep, rocky islets rising from the Pacific Ocean about 30 miles west of San 
Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.  
</P>
<P>
 The Farallons, part of a national wildlife refuge managed by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service and watched over by the Point Reyes Bird Observatory, are one 
of only a few places in the world where the sharks can be studied in a natural 
setting, because they congregate around the islands every fall and stay until 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been going out there since 1987 and the same sharks are there," said 
Anderson, 37, a naturalist with the Oceanic Society and a seasonal park ranger 
for the Point Reyes Bird Observatory. "It's like a party." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is conducting a variety of experiments, but he is concentrating on 
identifying and photo-cataloguing individual sharks, based on distinctive 
markings, in hopes of someday determining their migration habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows for sure where the sharks come from or where they go each spring. 
One theory, based on captures and stillborn pups that have washed ashore, is 
that they spend spring and summer off the islands of Southern California and 
Baja. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has yet to match any of the sharks at the Farallons with those 
captured or photographed elsewhere, but he has matched some of the sharks year 
after year at the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I saw a shark eat a seal this year off Tomales Point (near Point Reyes) 
that we saw at the Farallons in '91, so we know the same sharks go to the 
mainland as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman is basing a research paper on the thermo-physiology of the great 
white, but also on its swimming depths and movements around the islands. He has 
tagged and tracked several large sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyle, 37, is the supervising biologist on the island, a bird specialist by 
trade -- the islands are home to 28% of California's sea birds -- but a shark 
expert based on his countless hours of observations. Since 1980, he has spent 
six months a year watching from his perch atop Southeast Farallon Island, the 
largest of the chain and the only one where limited access is allowed.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides helping by filming and cataloguing sharks when Anderson is not there, 
Pyle is studying the effects the weather and tides have on shark behavior and 
gathering data that he hopes will someday be used to help determine population 
levels of great whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyle believes there are 50 to 100 great whites that frequent the Farallons 
each spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that with the data we're getting, we might some day be able to apply 
that to preventing attacks on surfers and such," Pyle said. "We might even come 
up with high-risk and low-risk times for humans." 
</P>
<P>
 Among them, the three scientists have witnessed hundreds of attacks by white 
sharks on pinnipeds -- the sea lion family. And although the sharks are 
somewhat opportunistic -- Pyle has seen them feeding on a blue whale and a 
killer whale carcass -- they are highly specialized hunters, almost exclusively 
targeting elephant seals. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyle theorized that in attacks on humans, the sharks might have mistaken their 
prey for seals. Robinson, for instance, was clad in a dark neoprene wet suit 
and diving in an area teeming with pinnipeds when he was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Four species of pinnipeds frequent the Farallons -- northern elephant seals, 
harbor seals, California sea lions and stellar sea lions, a federally 
"threatened" species. The animals spend much of their time on the rocks resting 
and socializing, but in coming and going they must pass through what the 
scientists refer to as the "high-risk zone," an area between 30 and 80 feet 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 There the sharks lurk like phantoms over the rocky bottom, blending in 
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't even see them," Anderson said. "They can be only 10 feet down and 
you won't see them. There's no way of knowing one's there. It's spooky." 
</P>
<P>
 The sea lions seem to know when they're passing through the zone. They swim 
nervously until they're safely out of it. Pyle has seen fewer than a dozen 
attacks on sea lions and harbor seals. 
</P>
<P>
 The elephant seals, however, are slower, fatter and not as social as the sea 
lions, and therefore not as fortunate. They are targeted seven times more often 
than other pinnipeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyle said the sharks prefer to swim against the current and that most of the 
attacks occur at high tide, probably in part because there is not as much 
haul-out space and more animals are forced into the water. At low tide the 
attacks tend to occur farther offshore, perhaps an indication that the sharks 
require a good deal of room to charge their prey. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, when an attack occurs, it is an awesome display of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shark rushes up from below and grabs its prey and then thrashes it, and 
water flies," Anderson said. "It tries to kill the animal on the first bite, 
then waits until it bleeds to death before it eats." 
</P>
<P>
 The shark will sometimes wait an hour or more before moving in and 
methodically plucking away at the mammal's flesh. And more often than not, 
another shark will come in for a few bites. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears as though they have a sort of pecking order," Goldman said. "You 
never see two grab a seal at one time, but when one gets hit they are aware of 
it, either by sound or smell." 
</P>
<P>
 To tag and track his sharks, Goldman uses a radio-telemetry device concealed 
in PVC pipe. The device is stuck in a piece of meat and fed to the sharks while 
they feed on their prey. The device has a life span of 100 days and Goldman can 
pick up its signal, under good conditions, from about half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said white sharks, as far as he can tell, are not territorial, but 
added that the bigger animals seem to have certain areas where they prefer to 
hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 He tracked his first shark in 1991, a 14-foot male he named Boots. Boots was 
followed for five days over an eight-day period, swimming at an average depth 
of 50 feet.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had a couple of locations on the west side of the island that he liked to 
hang out in, and then he would take these treks from one to five kilometers 
from the island," Goldman said. "He swam out and right back." 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-footer named Ambergris was tagged last year and tracked for 10 days over 
a 17-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shark had one major preferred spot (off the southwest side of Southeast 
Farallon) and he really liked that spot," Goldman said. "He swam between 60 and 
90 feet most of the time. He had a couple of other spots he visited, but he 
spent about 75% of his time in that location. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me the most impressive thing is that these animals spend a lot of time 
stalking prey -- a week, two weeks, maybe three weeks or a month. Then after a 
meal they leave the island area, maybe for the season." 
</P>
<P>
 There was Phoebis, a 12-foot male -- originally named Phoebe because it was 
first thought to be a female. Phoebis was tracked for seven days over a 10-day 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phoebis went everywhere," Goldman said. "He didn't have a favorite spot. It 
was like giving a child a crayon and letting him scribble on wall. He was all 
over the place, 360 degrees around the island." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said that through his work he has come to view the great white not as 
a savage beast but as an animal, like any other, striving merely to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have already proved that they are not the cold-blooded killers 
people take them for. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most fish, whose bodies are not much warmer than the water they swim 
in, great whites are considered warm-blooded or warm-bodied, maintaining a 
fairly constant body-core temperature of nearly 80 degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Anderson: "I like to think of the great white shark as a mammal-like fish 
that feeds on fish-like mammals." 
</P>
<P>
 The general public, however, might never share that opinion.

JOCKEYS' PROPOSAL CALLED 'OUTRAGEOUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prospect of substitute jockeys riding at Santa Anita and other tracks on 
Jan. 1 grew stronger Tuesday after Brian McGrath, commissioner of the 
Thoroughbred Racing Assns. tracks, referred to a counterproposal from the 
Jockeys' Guild as "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks and the jockeys have been bargaining since August in an effort to 
sign a new contract covering the riders' health and accident insurance. Their 
three-year contract runs out Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am chagrined at what the jockeys have given us," McGrath said Tuesday. "I 
view the proposal as a rejection of our best and final offer, which we made on 
Dec. 9. Since August, the jockeys have been saying that they need one-tenth of 
1% of the tracks' handle to raise $9 million-$10 million to pay for their 
insurance. This proposal is that same demand, in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
 The jockeys' latest proposal called for the 40 TRA tracks to guarantee one 
benefit race apiece each year to raise money for the insurance premiums. The 
guild also offered to finance six other races each year to raise premium money. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue is the jockeys' waiving what they say are their television 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's enough money to fund the plan, we would consider changing some of 
the language in this area," said John Giovanni, national manager of the guild. 
"But the way it's worded in the current TRA proposal, it's a contract that we 
can't sign." 
</P>
<P>
 After the tracks had made payments of almost $1.7 million toward the jockeys' 
insurance in 1993, there was a shortfall of nearly $800,000, which the guild 
absorbed. The tracks said that they doubled some of the jockeys' coverages in 
their proposal on Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The guild has about 1,300 members. Giovanni said that guild members ride about 
90% of the races. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's no contract, individual decisions will have to be made," he said. 
"Our line of communication with the membership has been good, and after they 
ask themselves the important questions, I'm confident that they will support 
our efforts by not riding."

<P>
 Roger See, in his 14th season as the Fullerton men's basketball coach, said 
Tuesday he will take a one-year sabbatical starting next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Sweeney, an assistant coach in his third season at the school, will 
replace See. 
</P>
<P>
 See, who has been head coach or an assistant for the last 27 seasons, said he 
plans to spent more time with his wife and two daughters as well as be a 
visiting scholar at Cambridge University in England in the spring of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 See was a history major at Cal State Fullerton and teaches history in the 
summer. He spent three months in England in the spring of 1992 teaching a class 
of students from Fullerton and Cypress colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a nice change for me," See said. "My family will get a big piece 
of my time. . . . Tim's the perfect choice. He's a basketball junkie." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is 8-8 and See has a record of 232-184. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney last was a head coach at Lakewood High, where he was 220-105 and won a 
Southern Section title in his 13 years at the school. STEVE KRESAL

RAIDERS' PERRY FACES FELONY CHARGE OF FIRING GUN FROM CAR WINDOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A felony charge has been filed against Gerald Perry, the Raiders' left 
offensive tackle, who is accused of firing two shots from a handgun out the 
window of a car Nov. 12 in Los Angeles. No one was hurt in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry was arrested after the incident, which occurred on his 30th birthday. He 
is free on bail, thought to be $15,000, pending arraignment today on one count 
of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner, according to Deborah 
Kranze, deputy district attorney. Perry faces a maximum sentence of three years 
in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
 A date will be set today for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Perry can continue playing for the Raiders, who finish the 
regular season Saturday, but hope to qualify for postseason play.  
</P>
<P>
 Two Raider teammates in the car at the time of the incident were not charged. 
The district attorney's office declined to identify them.  
</P>
<P>
 Raider official Al LoCasale said he had no knowledge of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6, 305-pound Perry practiced Tuesday, having recovered from a 
concussion suffered Sunday. STEVE SPRINGER

 A marathon weekend negotiating session failed to close a deal to move the Rams 
to St. Louis, but former Sen. Thomas Eagleton, heading a group trying to lure 
the Rams, said the meetings were the most productive yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were excellent meetings involving a large number of people representing 
different elements of our proposal," said Eagleton, who met with Rams officials 
for three days. "A lot was accomplished. Some things still remain 
unaccomplished, and we will meet again at a time not yet designated and try to 
settle those."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: YIELD SHOPPERS: LOOK TO MUNIS IF GOING 'LONG' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An unfortunate confluence of events in the tax-exempt municipal bond market is 
making for exceptional bargains among longer-term issues -- where yields in 
effect are in the double-digit range for high tax bracket investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Muni investors who favor shorter-term bonds, however, will find that yields on 
those issues are downright lousy right now. In fact, taxable U.S. Treasury 
notes look like a far better buy for investors otherwise inclined to buy 
shorter-term munis. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the year is usually a time when sharp investors hunt for muni bond 
bargains, because sellers often dominate the market through Dec. 31. Then, 
historically, the muni market rallies in January, sending yields down and bond 
prices up. 
</P>
<P>
 The year-end selling pressure typically arises as individual investors (who 
dominate the muni market) clean up their portfolios for tax reasons. In years 
when bond prices decline -- as they have this year -- many investors do bond 
"swaps," selling depressed issues to get a tax loss, then using the proceeds to 
buy another bond or bond-like investment that pays an even higher yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Institutional muni investors, such as mutual funds, also rearrange their 
portfolios at the end of the year, selling bonds and boosting "cash" levels so 
that they're prepared for potential redemptions by shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Once January arrives, however, the muni market often sees the selling dry up. 
Meanwhile, semi-annual interest payments received on outstanding muni bonds as 
of Jan. 1 create billions of dollars looking for a home -- and many of those 
dollars wind up being reinvested in the muni market, sparking a rally. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, some bond pros are dubious about a January rally in the muni 
market overall. One big negative is the continuing fallout from the Orange 
County bankruptcy debacle, which has made investors wary of other potential 
credit-related problems lurking among muni issuers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on Tuesday bond-rating agency Fitch Investors Service downgraded 
Washington D.C.'s general obligation bonds to BBB-plus from A-minus, citing the 
city's deteriorating finances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bidding war between the White House and Congress over a federal income 
tax-cut bill also is causing some investors to step back from the muni market, 
experts say. The reason: Lower federal tax rates would remove some of the 
incentive to seek the tax-exempt income paid by muni bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, expectations of further interest rate increases by the Federal 
Reserve Board in 1995 make many investors leery of locking money up in any type 
of long-term bond. So what demand there is for muni issues is concentrated in 
shorter-term bonds, generally those maturing in less than five years, bond pros 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a result of all of this, muni experts say long-term muni bonds are 
going begging for buyers -- and are offering yields that should be high enough 
to compensate for all of the inherent risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bond Buyer index of 40 high-quality long-term muni bonds now sports an 
average yield of 6.94%, tax-free. That is the same as a 10% taxable yield -- 
such as on a Treasury bond -- for investors in the 31% marginal federal tax 
bracket (which begins at taxable income of $94,250 in 1995 for marrieds filing 
jointly). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As most yield-savvy investors know, you simply can't find 10% taxable yields 
today except on high-risk corporate "junk" bonds. And the highest yield you can 
find on U.S. Treasury issues is 7.84% on 30-year bonds. Which suggests that 
anyone interested in locking in long-term yields at this point ought to be 
looking to muni bonds, not Treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite is true if you're shopping for shorter-term bonds. Example: The 
average yield on AAA-rated general obligation muni bonds maturing in three 
years is about 5.2%, according to yield-tracker Municipal Market Data. For a 
married couple in the 31% tax bracket, that's equivalent to a 7.5% taxable 
yield. 
</P>
<P>
 But given that three-year U.S. Treasury notes themselves now yield 7.7%, 
they're obviously a better buy than munis. 
</P>
<P>
 To express the differences in the muni and Treasury market another way, 
consider the "spread" between two-year and 30-year yields in each market: 
</P>
<P>
 * Top-rated two-year muni general obligation bond yields average about 4.9%, 
while the Bond Buyer index of long-term muni issues now is 6.94%. So the 
incentive for "going long" in munis is two full percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 * In contrast, 30-year Treasury bonds, at 7.84%, pay just 0.29-point more than 
two-year T-notes, which yield 7.55%. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investors may rationally balk at buying long-term bonds of any kind, of 
course. If long-term yields surge again in 1995, bond prices will plummet. 
Still, buy-and-hold investors who are shopping for the best yields should 
definitely give long-term munis (or long-term muni mutual funds) a close look, 
many pros say. A 10% annualized return is nothing to sneeze at. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if you're inclined to play it safe by staying in 
shorter-term bonds, Treasuries are a more lucrative investment than munis 
today.

MEXICO DEVALUES PESO 15% AS REVOLT FLARES UP; ECONOMY: MOVE TO HEAD OFF DAMAGE 
FROM CHIAPAS UPRISING GETS MIXED REACTION. SOME FEAR A REKINDLING OF INFLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acknowledging that political instability threatens Mexico's hard-won economic 
rehabilitation, the government moved to devalue the peso by 15% at dawn on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move rippled through the economy, recalling the 1976 and 1982 peso 
devaluations that sent Mexico into a tailspin. Whether this latest step leads 
to similar economic havoc will depend mainly on investor perception, observers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's action also was being closely watched in the United States, 
especially in California and Texas, where border merchants rely heavily on the 
purchasing power of Mexicans and where hundreds of U.S. companies have 
dramatically ratcheted up their economic transactions with Mexico in the 
free-trade climate of the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sought to calm concerns: 
"Mexico's exchange rate action today will support the healthy development of 
the Mexican economy. With a balanced budget, continuing economic reform and 
prudent monetary policy, Mexico's fundamentals remain sound." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4 a.m. communique, the Mexican government blamed guerrillas in the 
southern state of Chiapas for the instability that made the devaluation 
necessary. The guerrillas announced Monday that they will no longer observe a 
cease-fire that has been in effect since mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition to the potential instability, economists and investors said, 
the peso is under pressure for economic reasons, mainly a foreign trade deficit 
that is widely regarded as unsustainable and has been a major factor in the 
stagnation of Mexico's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 With the devaluation of the peso, Mexico's exports become cheaper and goods 
and services from other nations become more expensive, causing trade deficits 
to shrink. The devaluation means more pesos are needed to equal one dollar, 
with the result that interest rates -- which have been kept high in order to 
attract foreign investments -- will decline and invigorate the Mexican economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger, however, is a rekindling of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's purely an economic decision," said one institutional investor. But "the 
timing is political. If you can paint the (guerrillas) as the cause, that's a 
pretty good mud ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican Stock Exchange Index rose 43.06 points -- 1.93% -- on the news, 
although the prices of Mexican stocks traded in the United States fell an 
average of 6%. Devaluations generally raise stock prices as investors 
anticipate lower interest rates, unless companies have dollar-denominated debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the government widened by 53 centavos the band within which the 
peso trades. That means the currency -- which had been trading at 3.46 pesos to 
the dollar late Monday -- could drop as low as 4.00, a devaluation of 15%, 
before the central bank intervenes to defend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign exchange desks were quoting the dollar at 3.89 pesos on Tuesday, but 
some banks were offering 4.00. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of devaluation had been rampant since spring as the peso clung to the 
top of the trading band, a clear indication that the central bank was drawing 
on foreign reserves to defend the currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides spending foreign reserves, the government also tried to offset the 
trade deficit with foreign investment, attracting capital from abroad by 
keeping interest rates high. That angered Mexican industrialists who must 
borrow at those high interest rates to modernize their outmoded factories and 
compete internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three weeks into the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, it 
became clear that the monetary policy could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Devaluation is a delicate issue in Mexico because previous administrations 
have depleted international reserves and brought the economy to the brink of 
collapse before dropping the peso's value. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign stock investors said they were shaken by Tuesday's devaluation 
and unsure whether it was the right decision. Direct investors were more 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a short-term event," said one U.S. banker based in Mexico. "We 
had planned to invest $100 million in Mexico in the coming years, and we are 
not reducing our operations in the least bit." 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. retailers along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico frontera -- many of whom 
depend on border-crossing Mexican shoppers for their livelihoods -- will 
probably be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Torres, manager of Kragen Auto Parts store in San Ysidro, just across the 
border from Tijuana, said that although business was good on Tuesday, he 
expects the devaluation to hurt as the news sinks in. "Ninety percent of our 
business comes from over there. So whatever happens to them will affect me. 
Yes, I have to be worried." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the hundreds of U.S. manufacturers with plants in Mexico will 
benefit because the cost of labor and Mexican supplies will drop accordingly 
with the peso's loss of value against the dollar, said Ed Brekke, president of 
the Western Maquiladora Trade Assn., a group of some 240 foreign manufacturers 
with plants in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 The degree of benefit will depend on where those plants are situated and where 
their products are shipped, Brekke said. U.S. plants situated in Mexico's 
interior shipping products back to the Midwest, for example, will benefit most, 
because the cost of labor and supplies should fall according to the peso's loss 
of value. 
</P>
<P>
 But that benefit will be less pronounced for U.S. companies with plants close 
to the border, because the border economy is heavily dollar-oriented, Brekke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In downtown Los Angeles, Jorge Sanchez, owner of the record store Discoteca 
Favorita, was happy about the peso drop, because it would help him save money 
when purchasing much of the Mexican music the store sells -- and because the 
$500 he sends monthly to his parents and siblings living in Ensenada would go a 
little further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can afford to send that money every month, and I'll keep sending what I 
can," Sanchez said. "Just because the dollar is worth more doesn't mean that 
I'll send less."

THE HOLIDAY RUSH; COUNTING ON CHRISTMAS; WORD TO THE WISE: DON'T FORGET TO TIP 
THE VALET, THE NANNY, THE MAID . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Christmas, we're told, is the time for remembering people who perform services 
for us throughout the year -- and who can forget, with all the reminders? 
Greeting cards are tucked inside our newspapers; a Christmas tree decorates the 
valet counter in the parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Forsythe of Mission Hills says her manicurist gave her an emery board 
and hand lotion, so what could she do but dig into her pocket in return? Of 
course, Forsythe says, she would have tipped her manicurist anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an ongoing relationship with her, week after week," Forsythe says. "At 
the holidays, you do something extra." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes, as the countdown to Christmas enters its final days. There are 
the gift list, the card list, and, yes, the tip list. The roster includes 
personal trainers, gardeners, nannies, hairdressers and maids -- not to mention 
doormen and caddies. Forget someone and you're sure to get a nudge. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, everyone thinks they should get a tip," moans New York etiquette 
consultant Hilka Klinkenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has gotten terribly messy and out of hand," says Judith Martin, who writes 
a syndicated etiquette column under the name Miss Manners. "A Christmas bonus 
or tip at the end of the year is certainly nice for the right people, but not 
for service people who don't provide any service -- like the garbage collector 
that rattles you awake in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt many service people expect a tip because they don't earn that much 
anyway. Garage attendants and gardeners may earn $5 an hour, some baby-sitters 
receive as little as $100 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The tip, in many cases, has evolved from a reward for good service to 
protection from bad service, says John Schein, founder of Tippers 
International, an organization dedicated to fostering tipping as a reward. The 
group's motto: What you receive is what you leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, based in Oshkosh, Wis., publishes holiday tipping guides for 
various cities, and encourages consumers to withhold tips if the service isn't 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 Some etiquette consultants disagree with that approach. Jan Yager, a 
consultant in Connecticut, says consistency is important. People who tip a 
valet generously throughout the year are expected to do so at Christmastime. 
The holiday tip amount shouldn't vary much from year to year; if your financial 
situation dictates a smaller tip, explain that to the recipient, Yager says. 
</P>
<P>
 Withholding a tip, even to express dissatisfaction, may damage a relationship 
beyond repair, Yager says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you withhold the tip, how are you ever going to improve the service, 
especially if you tipped in past years?" Yager says. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of thinking is apparently a factor in Manhattan, where holiday 
tipping has been refined beyond mere ritual. Consultant Klinkenberg put it this 
way: "It is blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In ritzy apartment towers near Central Park, each resident receives a 
Christmas card signed by everyone who works in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 A strict tipping hierarchy exists: The superintendent gets more than the 
doorman, who gets more than the porters. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaches in tipping etiquette are remembered. Residents say there is a 
relationship between the size of a tip and the speed with which a clogged drain 
is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 At Manhattan office buildings, the list of people awaiting tips is longer. 
There are security guards, the security director, the cleaning staff -- both 
day and night shifts -- receptionists, the building electrician and, at the top 
of the heap, the building manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Valets in parking garages keep score, scrawling the names of tippers in marker 
on white boards, a sort of "tippers honor roll." A journalist who ignored such 
a hint found a card on his windshield. It said: "Merry Christmas -- Second 
Notice." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, hints are gentler. Parking attendants in the downtown Arco 
Towers garage have placed a Christmas tree next to the valet stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the spirit of the season," Mauricio Guardado, head valet, explains. 
The bounty beneath the tree suggests the spirit is catching. There is a case of 
wine, a case of champagne, a bottle of rum, several tins of popcorn and a few 
boxes of candy. On top of that, Guardado says, each of the 15 attendants can 
expect several hundred dollars in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Guardado says valets appreciate the tips but don't consider them charity. They 
have customers' cars ready at quitting time and keep the cars clean, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In service businesses, tales of great tips abound. Guardado recalls a 
Christmas six years ago when a customer gave him $100. He used it to buy 
matching dresses for his three young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among nannies, talk is of trips to Hawaii or jewelry from Tiffany's. Anne 
Hannan, a nanny for an obstetrician in Cleveland, Ohio, received a multimedia 
computer and laser-jet printer from her employer last year -- plus a cash 
bonus.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was really blown away," Hannan said. "I wasn't expecting a PC." 
</P>
<P>
 Breathtaking bonuses are unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with how much you make and how much you pay the nanny and how 
deserving she is," says Sheilagh Roth, director of English Nanny & Governess 
School in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 In some professions, believe it or not, no tipping is the order of the day. 
Postal workers aren't allowed to receive cash, though Postal Service spokesman 
Larry Dozier said a token gift worth under $20 "would not be looked upon with 
suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
 At the shoeshine stand in Citicorp Plaza in downtown Los Angeles, workers 
laughed when asked about holiday tipping. "We don't get anything extra," said a 
worker named Maxie.

FED DECIDES AGAINST FURTHER INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES; BANKING: OBSERVERS SAY 
ORANGE COUNTY'S BOND CRISIS WAS A FACTOR IN FORGOING A SEVENTH HIKE THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board refrained Tuesday from increasing interest rates, 
evidently postponing the next such move until 1995 to avoid stirring up 
financial markets in the wake of the Orange County bond debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fed officials did not explain their thinking, close observers said 
that a few factors, among them the Orange County financial crisis, argued 
against hiking rates immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation has remained under control, recent statistics suggest. In addition, 
the Fed likely wants to let more time pass before it pushes up rates again. The 
last rate hike -- the sixth this year -- came five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Fed has reasons for waiting," said Bruce Steinberg, senior 
economist at Merrill Lynch in New York. "Usually after they have done a big 
move, they let a little time pass before moving again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed decision -- which had the side effect of stabilizing some of Orange 
County's investments -- was made by the board's Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds that remain in Orange County's portfolio are extremely sensitive to 
rising rates, and would have fallen further in value if the Fed had increased 
rates Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy-setting panel, composed of Fed board members and five of the 12 
regional bank presidents, met for more than three hours before adjourning its 
final meeting of the year without announcing an increase. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous rate increases this year, the Fed announced the decision 
immediately after deliberations by the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, economists widely expect an additional rate hike in early 1995, 
perhaps of half a percentage point, because the national economy continues to 
exhibit enough strength to stoke inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Feb. 4, the Fed has moved six times to increase rates -- most recently 
on Nov. 15, when two key rates were raised by three-fourths of a percentage 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists forecast that an influential short-term rate -- the federal 
funds rate -- is headed to 6.5% from its current 5.5%, before the Fed is 
satisfied that inflation dangers are over for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 A slower economy, however, is the price of conquering the inflation fears: "If 
the Fed goes much higher than they are now, then we will be entertaining a 
significant chance of a recession," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of 
Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts point to history as cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been nine recessions since World War II; on only two occasions, in 
the 1960s and 1980s, was the Fed able to pull off its goal of a "soft landing" 
-- taming inflation while also preserving economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some are optimistic that the Fed can engineer a slower pace of growth 
without a slump in the current episode. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get the slowdown that we are expecting, then I think we can get another 
three years of expansion before we have to worry about the next recession," 
said David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy-making committee is scheduled to meet next on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1.

 Now that Intel Corp. has finally decided to offer "no questions asked" 
replacements for the flawed Pentium computer chip, what should Pentium PC 
owners -- or prospective owners -- do now? The company will provide a 
replacement any time during the life of the machine, so that even if you don't 
act now you can get a replacement later. Still, replacing the chip is not 
without hassles and risks. Here are some answers for computer owners' 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a Pentium PC. How do I know if it has the flaw? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Virtually all Pentiums shipped to date have the flaw. Some software 
programs, including most spreadsheets, will reveal the flaw if you run the 
following formula: (4,195,835 x 256) (3,145,727 256) The correct answer is 
87,413.1, but a flawed Pentium will yield 87,407.9. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: OK, I have the flaw. Should I replace my chip? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you are doing heavy-duty arithmetic such as scientific modeling or very 
sophisticated spreadsheets that involve division, then you should get a new 
chip. Even then, according to Intel, the chances of your getting a wrong answer 
are "once in every nine billion number pairs," but IBM and others who have 
researched the problem say that Intel has grossly underestimated the likelihood 
of an error. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're using your computer for word processing, graphics, communications, 
entertainment or simple calculations using programs like Quicken or Microsoft 
Works, then the odds of your encountering a problem are quite small. You then 
have to weigh the inconvenience and risks associated with replacing the chip 
against the benefit of having a chip without this flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've been thinking of buying a Pentium machine. Will it have the flawed 
chip? What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you buy a machine in the next month or so, there is a good chance it 
will have the flawed chip. You could instead buy a 486 that's upgradeable to 
Pentium, but this will probably be more expensive in the long run. You could 
also wait for machines with new chips. But Intel's offer stands even for newly 
purchased machines, so you can get a replacement chip at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do I have to do to get a replacement chip? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Call Intel's toll free customer support line at (800) 628-8686. A recording 
will instruct you to press 5 for Pentium processors or hold if you're not 
calling from a touch-tone phone. Allow plenty of time for the call as you may 
be on hold for a while. A representative will answer the call and ask you the 
make and model number of your PC along with your name, address and phone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Between seven and 15 days later, Intel says, you'll get a follow-up call. That 
person will verify exactly which Pentium PC you have (there are 60, 66, 75, 90 
and 100 MHz models, but most people have a 60 or 90 MHz chip). In many cases, 
the CPU speed is part of your computer's name (such as Dell XPS-90). Some 
utility programs, including the "Sys Info" program from Norton Utilities, will 
report what type of CPU you have. 
</P>
<P>
 The person who calls will also ask for a credit card number, but you will be 
charged only if you fail to return the old Pentium within 30 days after they 
ship a new one. If you return the chip later, they'll issue you a credit for 
the charge, according to an Intel spokesperson. You could be charged up to 
$1,000 if you don't return the old chip. 
</P>
<P>
 The chip should arrive within 60 days of the follow-up call. In addition to 
the chip, there will be instructions on how to perform a replacement, a list of 
local dealers who can replace it for you at no charge and a postage-paid box 
for you to return the old CPU. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How hard is it to replace the chip myself? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: First, you need to open up the computer. That's usually a matter of 
removing several screws and slipping off the case but, in some situations, it 
can be more complicated. Then you have to hope that the CPU is accessible. It 
usually is but, on some systems, the CPU can be under a disk drive or other 
component. If so, you'll have to remove that component. 
</P>
<P>
 The next issue is whether you have a Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) or a regular 
socket. Chances are you have a ZIF socket, which, as the name implies, makes it 
a lot easier to remove and replace a chip. If you have a ZIF socket, there will 
be a lever to one side of the CPU, which is the largest single chip on the 
system boards. In many cases, a Pentium processor has silver-colored metal fins 
(a heat sink) on it, so it might not look like a regular chip. The Pentium may 
also be mounted under a small fan which you can lift out with the chip. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have a ZIF socket, then you'll have to use a chip extraction tool 
or a small screwdriver to pry the chip out of its socket. This can be a bit 
tricky and, if you're not careful, it's possible to bend a pin on the CPU. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if I don't want to replace the chip myself? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The replacement chip will come with a list of your closest dealers or 
repair centers. Chances are you'll have to bring in the machine. The dealer may 
be able to replace the chip while you wait or you might have to leave it and 
pick it up later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there any risks associated with changing the chip? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are always risks involved when you change components. If you fail to 
discharge any static electricity in your body, for example, you can damage the 
Pentium or any other component. If you insert the chip incorrectly, you can 
bend a pin. Even if you decide to bring the machine to a service center, 
there's a possibility that you'll drop it or damage it in transit. Modern PCs 
can handle a small amount of jostling, but the hard disk and other components 
can fail if they're dropped or shaken during transit. It's best to transport 
the machine in the original packing material or at least place it in a 
well-padded box. You can even use a seat belt to strap it into one of the car's 
passenger seats. 
</P>
<P>
 If the machine is damaged during the chip replacement process, Intel will 
evaluate whether or not to pay for the repair of the damages "on a case-by-case 
basis," according to a spokesperson.

 Settlement Ends Beach Boy Feud: Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson has agreed 
to pay the band's singer, Mike Love, $5 million in cash and to split future 
royalties on 35 songs with his cousin.Love, who was smiling broadly in court, 
said the agreement also settled a longstanding dispute that kept the 
songwriting team from rejoining forces. At a hearing, U.S. District Judge 
William Rea approved the settlement that ended litigation between the members 
of the quintessential Southern California pop band. Love, 53, prevailed last 
week in a lawsuit, in which he alleged his name was left off copyright 
applications and songwriting agreements for the nearly three dozen tunes he 
said he helped co-write.

 Home Depot Charged With Sex Discrimination: A class action lawsuit filed in 
San Francisco federal court claims the nation's largest home improvement chain 
systematically discriminated against women in hiring, pay, promotions and 
training.The Atlanta-based company said it takes the charges seriously and 
would conduct its own investigation with outside counsel. But the 313-store 
chain said its record in hiring women and minorities was exemplary. The suit, 
which seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, was filed on behalf 
of eight current and former employees of Home Depot's western region.

 Travelers Hires Former Kidder Peabody Chairman: To run its life insurance 
division, Travelers Inc. hired Michael Carpenter, who lost his job after a 
bond-trading scandal.Carpenter, 48, will become chairman and chief executive on 
Jan. 1 of Travelers Life Insurance Co., the 13th-largest U.S. life insurer and 
a key segment of the financial services giant. The move comes as life insurers 
look for help in their battle with banks and mutual funds for the retirement 
savings of baby boomers. Carpenter was forced out of Kidder, a General Electric 
Co. subsidiary, in June. His departure came two months after GE and Kidder 
accused its former top government bond trader of creating false profits through 
"phantom" trading.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS FALL AS FED STANDS PAT ON RATES; DOW LOSES 23.55 
</P>

<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's decision to leave interest rates alone -- for now 
-- sent short-term Treasury yields tumbling Tuesday, but the stock market could 
only muster a mixed finish. 
</P>
<P>
 News that the Fed's monetary policy meeting ended without another 
credit-tightening move was greeted with a sigh of relief in the bond market. 
The yield on three-month T-bills dropped to 5.61% from 5.72% on Monday, and 
shorter-term rates in general fell. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrials slumped 23.55 points to 3,767.15 in a late 
selloff, but traders said the decline appeared unrelated to the Fed's non-move. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the broader market was mixed. Winners and losers were about evenly 
matched on the New York Stock Exchange, and most indexes of smaller stocks rose 
marginally. 
</P>
<P>
 After raising interest rates 2.5 percentage points so far this year in an 
effort to slow the economy, the inflation-wary Fed had been expected to hold 
monetary policy steady Tuesday -- to wait for further signs that growth is 
slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on long-term bonds, which had been declining in recent weeks on the 
assumption that the Fed is succeeding in reining-in the economy and inflation, 
were little changed on Tuesday. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond inched 
up to 7.84% from 7.83% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold market, meanwhile, benefited as the Fed held back. The near-term gold 
futures contract on the Comex rose $2.60 to $381.80 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many analysts believe the Fed isn't finished hiking rates, and that 
another increase of at least a half-point will come at the central bank's next 
meeting on Jan. 31. For that reason, market strategists caution against betting 
on a major rally in stocks any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology issues were again in the spotlight. Microsoft tumbled 2 3/4 to 59 
7/8 after it said the next version of its popular Windows software won't be 
ready until August. A spring introduction had been planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Intel shot up 3 7/16 to 61 1/4 after the computer chip giant said it will 
replace its flawed Pentium chip free of charge -- ending a public relations 
fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks staged a year-end rally, which some analysts attributed to 
optimism about potential additional patent protection under the GATT treaty. 
Bristol Myers gained 1 1/4 to 59 3/8, Lilly jumped 1 3/4 to 64 1/2 and Amgen 
advanced 13/16 to 55. But generic drug maker Mylan slumped 2 1/4 to 26. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike shot up 5 5/8 to 71 5/8 after reporting surprisingly strong earnings. 
Other athletic shoe stocks also rose, including Reebok, up 1 7/8 to 39 1/2; and 
L.A. Gear, up 5/8 to 5 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, stocks rocketed after the government dropped the peso's value 
versus the dollar, a move that will make Mexican exports cheaper. But the rally 
lost steam on news from troubled Chiapas state, where police and army troops 
were moving into recently captured rebel territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa stock index, which plunged 96 points on Monday, was up as much as 
167 points on Tuesday before closing with a gain of 43.06 points at 2,274.17. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading, many Mexican shares continued to decline. Telmex slumped 
2 1/2 to 46, a new 1994 low. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share index gained 136.13 points to 19,406.98. 
London's FTSE-100 index rose 23.7 points to 3,058.1 while Frankfurt's DAX 
average ended at 2,079.93, up 3.99 points.

 Trade Deficit Grew to $10.14 Billion in October: The expanding gap puts the 
United States on track for its second-worst trade year in history, as a rush of 
Japanese imports sent the deficit with that country to an all-time high. A 
Commerce Department report showed that the deficit in goods and services 
climbed 8.4% from a revised $9.35-billion September figure. U.S. imports rose 
for a sixth straight month to $69.84 billion, the highest ever, as faster 
economic growth stimulated appetites for foreign products.Exports, hurt in 
October by a drop in sales of civilian aircraft, fell 1.6% to $59.70 billion. 
The deficit in goods is running at an annual rate of $150.2 billion this year, 
only slightly below the record of $152.1 billion set in 1987. After Japan, the 
biggest deficit was with China, an imbalance of $3.48 billion, up 26.8%. In 
addition, the United States posted a rare deficit of $89 million with Mexico.

MERCK TO SELL SAN DIEGO-BASED KELCO FOR MORE THAN $1 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merck & Co. announced Tuesday that it has signed a definitive agreement to 
sell its San Diego-based Kelco chemical unit to Monsanto Co. for $1.075 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kelco spokesman said no "short term" layoffs are planned among Kelco's 550 
San Diego employees. The longer-term outlook, however, is less certain, he 
said. Kelco, which makes food additives and preservatives extracted from 
seaweed and kelp, employs 1,300 overall and reported 1994 sales of about $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., announced last August that it was 
selling Kelco as a part of a plan to divest all non-pharmaceutical businesses 
and focus its resources on core health products and research. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the deal makes sense for Merck, which, like most drug companies, 
is struggling to maintain profit growth at a time when cost-conscious managed 
health care plans are forcing lower prices. Merck shares were up 37.5 cents to 
$38.625 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph P. Riccardo, senior health care analyst at Bear, Stearns in New York, 
said the deal follows a pattern for Merck. "It's another move by the new 
chairman (Raymond V. Gilmartin) to reduce their dependence on non-strategic 
assets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for Monsanto is less certain. One analyst said Tuesday that 
benefits of the deal remain to be seen. The firm's shares plunged $4 to 
$68.875, a 6% drop, on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis-based Monsanto -- which manufactures a variety of chemical, 
agricultural, drug and food ingredient products -- said it will complete the 
purchase over the first quarter of 1995, financing the deal with cash and debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelco was founded in San Diego in 1929 and acquired by Merck in 1972. Kelco 
uses huge barges to harvest seaweed from the Pacific Ocean. Extracts are 
processed at plants in San Diego and in the San Francisco Bay area.

PUC TO UNVEIL PHONE DEREGULATION PLANS; TELECOM: REGULATORS WILL TRY TO 
ESTABLISH GROUND RULES FOR THE ENTRY OF NEW PLAYERS IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Opening local telephone markets to competition might sound good to consumers, 
but what if it means that you can't keep your phone number? Or that you can't 
get your number listed in a phone book? 
</P>
<P>
 A year has passed since the California Public Utilities Commission proposed 
allowing unbridled competition in the state's telephone markets by 1997. Yet 
basic issues such as number portability and phone book listings have yet to be 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the PUC is expected to unveil the first details of how deregulation of 
the state's phone industry should be accomplished. The commissioners will try 
to establish ground rules for the entry of new rivals -- cable and 
long-distance companies, for example -- into local telecommunications markets, 
traditionally the province of monopolies such as Pacific Bell and General 
Telephone of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners will also suggest a timetable for dealing with issues such 
as how to redefine basic telephone service, how to continue to fund service for 
low-income and elderly customers and how to ensure that phone-company 
competitors have the interconnections they will need to make their offerings 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, many industry observers noted Tuesday, companies and consumers face a 
rocky, confusing transition. But the payoff could be enormous -- and California 
lags far behind other states in modernizing its local-telephone rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the course the PUC charts over the next two years is really 
going to determine the future of telecommunications for Californians," said 
Regina Costa, telecommunications analyst with Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization, a consumer watchdog group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can create a situation where people really do have a lot of choices and 
better services, or they can create a situation where people will be subjected 
to the worst kind of abuse and be forced to pay for services they don't really 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 A chief goal of deregulation, the PUC said last December, is to spur 
private-sector development of new telecommunications services, with the 
presumption that innovative products will stimulate demand and create thousands 
of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, customers would benefit not only from those services, but also from 
price competition. (Similarly, after Jan. 1, consumers will be able to choose 
among various service providers on local toll calls, a market recently opened 
to competition after having been a local-phone-company monopoly.) 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC's proposal last year drew a mostly enthusiastic response from local 
telephone companies, long-distance providers, cable operators and consumer 
watchdogs. But many observers noted at the time that the five-person agency 
would have to take on the role of determined traffic cop and gatekeeper to 
ensure that service providers stay in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, concerns have mounted among would-be rivals and consumer groups 
that the PUC might not take a firm enough stance in forcing the existing local 
phone monopolies to hew to a schedule and be fair to competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Norman D. Shumway has proposed that, on some key issues such as 
pricing and number portability, Pacific Bell and GTE should spearhead an effort 
to involve all interested parties in a settlement. That suits Pacific Bell just 
fine. "Why not put us all in a room and let us negotiate?" said John A. 
Gueldner, the company's vice president of regulatory affairs. "We feel a 
settlement approach would get it done even sooner (than 1997)."

 Zantac's U.S. Patent Extended: British drug maker Glaxo Holdings said the 
patent on the active ingredient in the ulcer drug will be extended to July 25, 
1997, from Dec. 5, 1995, because of a change in U.S. patent law accompanying 
the enactment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.Glaxo shares surged 
to a nine-month high on the news, lifting shares of other drug companies in 
both London and New York. Shares of generic drug makers fell. The patent 
extension could mean nearly $5 billion in additional U.S. sales of Zantac, 
which dominates the $9 billion-a-year worldwide market for ulcer drugs.

NEW LIMIT ON SBA-BACKED LOANS DRAWING FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration's decision to place a $500,000 ceiling on 
loans made under its popular loan-guarantee program Tuesday drew a disappointed 
reaction from the small business community, which increasingly has been turning 
to the federal agency for financing help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ripple effect is significant," said Patty DeDominic, president of the 
National Assn. of Women Business Owners and chief executive of Los 
Angeles-based PDQ Personnel Services. She said such a limit would dissuade 
banks from working with small and expanding businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since small business is the fastest-growing segment of our economy and 
provides the majority of our employment, cutting back SBA's support is killing 
the goose that lays the golden egg," DeDominic said. 
</P>
<P>
 The change, starting Jan. 1, could affect thousands of small companies looking 
for financing. For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 11% of the loan guarantees 
were for transactions of $500,000 or more, SBA spokesman Mike Stamler said. 
Those loans accounted for 38% of the $8.2 billion in loan guarantees issued 
during the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA makes relatively few direct loans, but instead uses most of its funds 
to guarantee a portion of loans made by banks and other lenders. Currently, 
loans of any size are eligible for SBA backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the ceiling, the SBA would probably run through the $7.8 billion 
allocated for its 7(a) loan-guarantee program by next July, Stamler said. 
Demand for funds is running at a historic high of $38 million a day on average. 
The program ran out of money for a time in fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA Administrator Philip Lader said in a statement that the change "will allow 
the agency to serve the greatest number of small businesses possible." 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul Galles, president of the Small Business United lobby, called the 
change "disappointing" but necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather they expand the ceiling and expand the number of loans they 
guarantee, but we have limited federal resources," Galles said. "People are 
going to have to wake up to the reality that when they call for cuts, it's 
these types of programs that are going to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tremendously unfortunate, because banks are not meeting the needs of the 
small business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamler said the loan cap is part of an overhauling of the guarantee program 
that also streamlined the documentation process for smaller loans. That program 
has become so popular that more than half the guarantees issued since it was 
introduced last July have been for loans of under $100,000.

PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES GETS $365-MILLION BOOST FROM PARENT 
</P>

 Prudential Insurance said Tuesday that it is injecting another $365 million in 
capital into its troubled Wall Street subsidiary, mainly because of the 
mounting cost of settling with customers who invested in Prudential Securities' 
risky limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest contribution pushes Prudential Insurance's investment in the 
brokerage past $2 billion, including the $381 million it paid for the Wall 
Street firm in 1981.But Prudential Insurance said it remains the position of 
Chairman and Chief Executive Arthur F. Ryan that the brokerage unit is not for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Perkins, spokesman for Prudential Securities, declined to elaborate on 
reasons the firm needed more cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But the infusion comes as claims by customers on a settlement pool set up 
under an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission have shot up in 
advance of a Jan. 10 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel F. Brenner, a lawyer supervising the SEC pool, said the number of new 
claims has soared to 3,000 a week from 1,500. The total number of claims filed 
is now more than 152,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool so far has made settlement offers to customers totaling more than 
$472 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The new capital will also cover the costs of cutbacks in two Prudential 
Securities' businesses: mortgage-backed securities and its Japanese operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This capital infusion allows Prudential Securities to enter 1995 positioned 
to regain overall profitability," Ryan said in a written statement.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; FIBER-OPTICS THAT WORK MORE, LABOR LESS 
</P>

 High-speed fiber-optic communication systems depend on movable mirrors that 
steer laser beams of light to the right spot along the glass fiber. But these 
fiber-optic "couplings" are very labor intensive, since the mirrors must be 
adjusted by hand before packaging. Coupling efficiencies -- the percentage of 
the laser light power actually transmitted into the fiber -- are considered 
good at only 50%. And if the couplings are heavily jarred or subjected to 
extreme temperature variations, the efficiency is reduced to the point that the 
coupler must be discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Now researchers at UC Berkeley have built a microscopic version of these 
mirrors, with mirror adjustments made by a micromotor not much larger than the 
cross-section of a human hair. The entire movable micromirror, motor and all, 
fits within an area four-hundredths of an inch square. The micromirrors are 
built by a technique known as surface micromachining, which evolved from the 
processes and materials developed to make integrated circuits. The microscopic 
motors move a slider back and forth by repeatedly striking it with a battering 
ram of silicon. 
</P>
<P>
 Miniature hinges allow the mirror to tip at varying angles. The slider moves 
in tiny steps -- about one-hundred-thousandth of an inch -- and by acting in 
concert with a twin, the motor can adjust the angle of the gold-plated 
micromirror. The researchers have shown that 45% coupling efficiencies can 
routinely be achieved. And owing to their small mass, these micromirror systems 
can survive even a six-foot fall without going out of alignment. The overall 
goal of the Berkeley program, which has been supported by Hewlett-Packard Co., 
is to build complete micro-optical systems that can be used not only in 
communication systems but also for medical and environmental sensing 
applications.

 Smarter Than the Average Bear: Yogi Bear was expert at stealing picnic baskets 
from unsuspecting visitors to Jellystone Park. But Yogi's creators at 
Hanna-Barbera don't want anyone stealing their intellectual property by forging 
their limited-edition and production cel animation. (Art is the second-most 
frequently "forged" form.) So in a first for animation studios, Hanna-Barbera 
is using the DNA of studio founder Joseph Barbera in the transparent 
registration mark on the art as well as in the ink in the pen he uses to 
autograph the art. 
</P>
<P>
 Utilizing the services of the Los Angeles firm Art Guard International Inc., 
the studio created a gene chemistry ink using DNA extracted from strands of 
Barbera's hair. The seal of authenticity features an oval Fred Flintstone logo 
and carries its own number. Art Guard International takes a follicle of hair 
and separates out a single DNA sequence. A forger trying to replicate the inks 
containing the DNA would have to know exactly which sequence has been used. The 
company believes its technology could also be used to prevent forgeries of rare 
coins, stamps, and even credit cards.

 Deadly Diet: Like death and taxes, cockroaches are one of the constants of 
life. People spend half a billion dollars a year on insecticides trying to rid 
their homes and businesses of these disease-carrying and seemingly 
indestructible insects. 
</P>
<P>
 But regular spraying always leaves a few resistant roaches who survive and 
produce offspring who inherit the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, something better may be on the way. Heather Wren, a research 
scientist in Virginia Tech's entomology department, has discovered a 
combination of natural substances that prevents cockroaches from reproducing: 
The females' own bodies sabotage themselves as eggs develop, so the females die 
and the eggs are never laid. 
</P>
<P>
 The insects eat the bait because it contains a nutrient they require. But the 
mixture also contains an inhibitor that interferes with the way the cockroach 
is able to metabolize certain nutrients. Separately, the substances are not 
lethal, but in combination they deprive the insects of nutrients they need for 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous insect growth regulators sought to kill young cockroaches; Wren's 
compound is the only one to kill adults. Dominion BioSciences, based in 
Virginia Tech's Research Center in Blacksburg, Va., has licensed the technology 
and will apply for international patents in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA-required testing will start next year and a commercial product is expected 
by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, to have an environmentally friendly product, Dominion is 
trying to create a biodegradable bait station. The company expects the bait 
stations to be no more expensive than those currently on the market. Research 
is also going on to see if the same approach can be applied to termites and 
ants.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; SANTA, PLZ SND LEGOS & 
BARNEY, THX; INTERNET: MORE THAN A MILLION KIDS THIS YEAR HAVE E-MAILED THEIR 
WISH LISTS TO A VIRTUAL NORTH POLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the olden days, the Alder kids used to send letters to Santa up the 
chimney. This year, like more than a million other true children of the 
electronic age, they filed their requests over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "E-mail is faster and easier, and you get a response," says the pragmatic 
Corey, your typical 11-year-old computer jock. The elder Alder typed in his 
little brother Sam's list (Legos, cap gun, Power Rangers costume) and sent it 
to Santa at the digital North Pole last week. One of them, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, Santa had accumulated some 13 e-mail addresses this year, plus 
at least five sites on the World Wide Web. Once a cute novelty for the 
fiber-optically inclined, cyber-Santas are now populating every virtual street 
corner on the global network. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the computer-generated Clauses have done their share to spread 
on-line cheer, a number of them are out to turn a profit too. One site 
encourages users to purchase a commemorative "I E-Mailed Santa" button for 
$5.00. Another displays an on-line catalogue of "Santa's Christmas Favorites." 
"Sure, Santa and commerce are inextricably linked," grumbled one parent 
on-line, "but is the big guy so strapped for cash that he has to turn the 
workshop into a showroom?" 
</P>
<P>
 As cyber-Santas emerge as a favorite publicity-generator for several of the 
Net's emerging enterprises, they are also encountering -- and coping 
accordingly -- with some challenges not necessarily common in the analog world. 
</P>
<P>
 Spamming, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 A nonprofit Santa site on the World Wide Web, hosted by the Internet 
Multicasting Service, recruited several firms to donate a dime to a local 
charity for every time a user logs onto its site -- up to a predetermined 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a (perhaps well-meaning) message was sent out over the network, 
encouraging people to "spam Santa" -- Net-talk for flooding the site with mail. 
Within a few days, the site had received 200,000 letters, many written by 
computer programs designed to send up to 6,500 messages at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Malamud, Elfmaster and president of the service, countered with an 
electronic posting to several Internet newsgroups: "On behalf of Mr. Claus and 
the Elves, I'd like to say that mailbombs to Santa and the Elves will result in 
immediate removal of your name from the 'good' list and a transfer to the 'bad' 
list." 
</P>
<P>
 Internet Access Inc., an Ottawa-based firm, escaped a spam attack but has 
nevertheless been deluged with nearly 5,000 letters a day to Santa since 
publicizing its North Pole address earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 So the company recently sent an urgent plea for aid out on the Net, with the 
subject line S.O.S. (Save Our Santa): "Santa needs corporate help to finance 
his sleigh . . .If your company would like to sponsor northpole.net, please 
email. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, reaching Santa by e-mail offers a critical benefit that the more 
traditional forms of correspondence do not: a reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the services use automatic, computer-generated replies. Malamud's 
Christmas computer scans for popular requests and inserts a predetermined 
response. (Boys who request Cindy Crawford, for example, are told that "Rudolph 
says don't hold your breath.") 
</P>
<P>
 Internet Access has "instructed the elves to remember, Santa does not promise 
anything, nor does he say he can't get anything," administrator Mary-Ellen 
Heney says. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Loren Hudson, a Santa Rosa parent who helped his 5-year-old sons Peter 
and Christopher send e-mail to the Santa sponsored by Internet Media Services: 
"When you send an anonymous post to the North Pole, you don't often get 
something back. I think they'll remember it and ask to do the same next year. 
And we probably will."

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; CHIP FIASCO ASIDE, INTEL 
STILL LEADER -- SO FAR; COMPUTERS: WHETHER ITS MARKET MONOPOLY WILL BE HURT 
REMAINS UNCLEAR. SOME DOUBT IT WILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While computer vendors and industry analysts on Tuesday generally hailed Intel 
Corp.'s decision to replace defective Pentium chips "no questions asked," it is 
not clear whether the chip giant has avoided long-term damage to its position 
as the near-monopoly supplier of personal computer microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers tend to dismiss the possibility that Intel's market position 
has been hurt. The PC standard, after all, is still based on Intel chips and 
Microsoft software, and Intel's bungled handling of a relatively minor glitch 
in the Pentium chip does not change that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that Intel owns that code. It's still got a monopoly. It's 
still got us all by a chokehold, and it's pretty hard to shake, even when they 
shoot themselves in the foot," says Stewart Alsop, editor of Infoworld, a 
computer trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 While AMD and Cyrix have built profitable businesses by "cloning" Intel chips, 
both are still a long way from a clone of the Pentium -- and the task gets more 
difficult with each subsequent chip generation. Intel can spend many times more 
than these rivals on R&D and manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors that offer faster microprocessors based on so-called RISC 
technology -- notably the Power PC alliance of IBM, Apple, and Motorola -- 
still must face the reality that the overwhelming majority of PC software is 
written for Intel processors and Microsoft software. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, even the Intel monopoly is not forever. The company may have not only 
lost credibility with consumers, but also sufficiently angered its already 
disgruntled PC customers that they will be doubly motivated to consider 
alternatives. Microsoft, whose position is in some ways similar to Intel's, is 
watching carefully, and said Tuesday it will delay shipment of a new operating 
system to avoid bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer, whose Power PC offers comparable performance to the 
Pentium-based computers without using the Intel chip, said its sales had 
already benefited from the Pentium flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers are turning in their Pentiums to buy Power MacIntoshes, especially 
in situations where they've noticed mistakes in their work," said Apple 
spokesman Eric Wee. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said Intel's weeks of inaction -- which left computer 
manufacturers on their own to allay consumer fears -- would make them rethink 
their long-term commitment to Intel.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly the kind of problem that makes the PC manufacturers nervous 
and angry," said Bluestein. "This will add impetus on the part of Packard Bell 
and Dell and Gateway to go through the same strategic reassessment that Compaq 
and IBM went through about their reliance on Intel as a chip supplier." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM, the company with the deepest roots in corporate computing and one that 
has never been successful in the consumer PC market, may come out looking best 
of all as the Pentium crisis winds down. With its decision early on to stop 
shipping Pentium-based computers and its continuing pressure on Intel to 
concede its problems, the company bought a lot of customer goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether Intel's apology is as sincere as it says -- and whether it will 
assimilate the culture of the consumer market into its own -- has yet to be 
seen. And if it doesn't, that could mean more problems down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Says a cynical Alsop: "I don't detect that Andy Grove has learned his lesson. 
All he's saying is despite the fact that this is a really minor bug and no one 
should care about it, we're going to have to do something about it because of 
all the fuss. That's Intel, though. It's just a bunch of engineers that still 
haven't learned how to deal with the real world."

POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING /

 If you really want to understand what all the hubbub is about when people talk 
about the information superhighway, find someone whose computer is connected 
directly to the Internet -- at a university or corporate site, perhaps -- and 
ask to see Mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the software that makes it possible to browse the wonders of the 
Internet's World Wide Web, complete with text, pictures and sound. Mosaic means 
virtually instant access to an ever-expanding world of information, including 
even video, whenever you want it. It's awesome. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, most of us can't use Mosaic. We access the Internet by dialing 
it via modem, without the high-powered connection needed for Mosaic, and must 
content ourselves with browsing the Web via a text-based system known as Lynx. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Internet is fast becoming a land of haves and have-nots in this 
department, a Calvinistic universe in which the elect flit from site to site 
all over the world, tasting the sights and sounds in full color and casually 
following information links wherever they might lead. The unlucky rest are left 
to make do with text and arcane commands. (The really unlucky, who don't know 
how to use the Internet at all, are forced instead to spend time with their 
families, read books and do God knows what else with their time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later there'll be enough bandwidth to bring something like Mosaic to 
everybody's screen, but frankly, I can't wait. Thus, from time to time in this 
space we'll test some of the ways Internet access vendors, software makers and 
others are trying to make the Internet easier to use via something like Mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for example, NetCruiser, the new Internet access software supplied 
by Netcom to work with its special NetCruiser dial-up accounts. 
</P>

 Netcom is the Internet access service that many on the 'net love to hate. The 
company has grown fast by offering complete Internet access with no time 
charges for the rock-bottom price of $17.50 a month. But there are whole 
newsgroups practically filled with complaints about Netcom -- busy signals, 
overburdened servers, poor technical support and so forth. These problems are 
real, but I think Netcom has improved a good deal in the past year, and if you 
don't need a lot of hand-holding it offers full Internet access at a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 NetCruiser is a Windows package intended to make the Net accessible to users 
who can't handle the command line interface from which the Internet is 
typically accessed. It puts a pretty face on gopher, Pine, telnet, ftp and all 
the other stuff familiar to Internet users. Perhaps most important, it is a 
full World Wide Web browser, sort of like Mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, unfortunately, NetCruiser leaves a lot to be desired. In handling 
mail, for example, it doesn't let you read or write messages off line -- a 
valuable feature of the Windows interfaces offered by CompuServe and America 
Online. I didn't like the way it handles Internet newsgroups, either. The 
reader it uses is unthreaded, meaning a series of messages on the same topic 
are not automatically pulled together. Furthermore, it's slow. 
</P>
<P>
 It's greased lightning next to the Web browser, though. I mean, I could 
practically hear my beard growing as I waited for some of those screens to come 
in. Netcom says this is due to NetCruiser itself, which it hopes to speed up; 
the bottleneck posed by 14,400 bps modems and regular phone lines and the 
tendency of various computers on the Internet to be busy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a hopeful user, I found these reasons cold comfort, especially since a 
NetCruiser account costs more. NetCruiser was just too slow for me at 14,400 
bps. Netcom promises 28,800 bps in the New Year and if Santa does his part, 
I'll have the hardware to try it out at that speed. Meanwhile, I'm keeping my 
conventional Netcom account. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows users who have dial-up accounts should try a share ware package called 
SlipKnot, which functions as a rudimentary terminal program with a built-in Web 
browser. It's rather amazing that it works at all, and in fact it works pretty 
well. I used it to take a World Wide Web tour of the Kremlin, starting with a 
map and following up with a visit to Red Square.  
</P>
<P>
 SlipKnot wisely avoids taking over the functions of gopher, Pine, etc., all of 
which are easy-to-use, text-based applications that work beautifully just as 
they are. Nor does it require you to get some other kind of Internet account. 
Be forewarned, though: SlipKnot too is agonizingly slow, too slow for everyday 
use at 14,400 bps. But it's a nice way to see what you're missing out there on 
the Internet -- and to sample what inevitably lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 BTW: On the subject of digital cash, covered in a recent column, USC's 
Information Sciences Institute has released for testing its own NetCheque 
payment system. Developed by ISI scientist Clifford Neuman, it is designed to 
bring the equivalent of secure "bank checks" to the Internet. ISI also has its 
own version of NetCash in the works. For information, e-mail netcheque@isi.edu.

WINDOWS95 DEBUT DELAYED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp. said Tuesday that it will delay introduction of its latest 
Windows software until August of next year, sending its stock price sliding and 
disappointing analysts who hope the Windows95 software will give the whole 
industry a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redmond, Wash., software giant said it wants to be sure it has worked out 
most of the bugs in the product -- a highly sensitive issue in the computer 
industry right now in light of Intel's problems with its Pentium 
microprocessor.Microsoft appeared to be trying to show that it understands 
consumer requirements and won't fall into the same trap as Intel. 
</P>
<P>
 The postponed introduction will not only delay sales for Microsoft, but for 
the multibillion-dollar industry that creates compatible software products for 
Windows95. Tuesday's announcement is the latest in a series of delays for the 
software, which promises to be much easier to use than Windows and will boast a 
variety of built-in features, including an interfacer to Microsoft's new 
on-line service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it bodes ill," said J. Neil, computer analyst at Hambrecht & 
Quist Inc. "But unfortunately, it's a pattern with Microsoft where they 
aggressively project availability dates for what proves to be very complicated 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraut predicted September as the most likely introduction date for the new 
Windows.

 It's that time of year when the world falls in love and there's peace and joy 
across the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrrrring. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for some actions -- and recalling that the post office can be dreadful 
in December -- on Saturday at 10 a.m. we dispatched eight reporters throughout 
Southern California.Clutching the same small parcels, their mission was to 
discover: How is it, really? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is the final week of the Annual Run on the Post Office -- when 
mad dashes are made to get Christmas cards, Christmas-tree shaped butter 
cookies and heavy-as-a-Christmas-tree fruitcakes to friends and loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 We wanted tales of lines snaking out the door, around the corner, down the 
street and straigh to the state line. We wanted ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead we got proof that it is, indeed, that time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 (P.S.: Of our eigtparcels -- all of whih cost $2.59 to send -- the two mailed 
from Orange County were the first to arrive at our designated Massachusetts 
address on Monday. L'Orange may be broke, but it can still deliver the goods.)

 This is no ordinary post office. Its six-window counter and waiting room look 
new and clean and rather stylish for the Postal Service -- greenhouse windows 
along one wall with new tables and benches and high-quality fake house plants. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the United States Postal Service Processing and Distribution Center, 
the gateway for all mail traveling into, out of and within Orange County. Smart 
people long ago figured out that if you mail it here, it goes out quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 So I expected a crowd and wasn't surprised when a friend told me there had 
been a long line of people waiting for the doors to open at 8:30 this 
particular morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As I drove up just before 10, fears were confirmed. Cars were parked against 
the red curb, which could only mean the 38-space parking lot was full. 
</P>
<P>
 I turned into the lot, and there were five empty spaces! Those people risking 
parking tickets had merely panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked into the post office and found only 17 take-a-numbers ahead of mine. 
Only half of this small group had parcels to mail. 
</P>
<P>
 All was quiet, even tranquil. People were sitting or standing with no look of 
stress or impatience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a piece of cake," I said out loud, and the women next to 
me agreed. She had inherited her number from someone who had left seeking a 
less crowded post office. "I don't know where he's going to find anything 
better than this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 True. Though only three windows were open, they were calling numbers at about 
one every minute or so. "Actually, we're going slower than usual," the clerk 
told me. One clerk had called in sick and another had to go back home because 
she forgot her keys. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of Christmas should be this easy.

 The way it worked out just wasn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been handed a golden opportunity to zing the Postal Service. Just show 
up at a post office on the Saturday before Christmas weekend, one of the 
busiest mail days short of April 15, and write about the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise the parking lot a dozen times to find a space. Wait an hour in line to 
mail a small parcel. Interview some weary, impatient customers, weighted down 
with bulky holiday packages. 
</P>
<P>
 As assignments go, this would be as tough as sawing a toothpick in two. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would be pay-back time: for all those endless lines I've endured to get 
a brief audience with the lone postal clerk on duty; for all of those empty 
coin-changers, sitting beside out-of-order stamp machines; for that time the 
Postal Service failed to forward my mail to a new address. 
</P>
<P>
 For this day's expose, I was directed to a small rural post office in 
Littlerock, a dusty desert town of 9,000, about 10 miles east of Palmdale. No 
problem. Post offices, like McDonald's, are just about the same everywhere, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
 But the first sign of trouble appeared when I turned off Pearblossom Highway 
and pulled up to the small nondescript building: three vacant parking spaces 
loomed ahead. Don't the people of Littlerock celebrate Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh horrors awaited me inside. I scanned the outer lobby for that inevitable 
broken stamp machine. It not only was not broken, it was not there. Only humans 
sell stamps at this post office. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the moment of reckoning, that torturous wait for service. Except, as 
I entered the inner lobby at 10 a.m., I found . . . no line. No line at all. 
Just two clerks, each busy with one customer. A miniature Christmas tree 
adorned with colored ornaments and a roll of Lifesavers rested on the counter 
between them. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:01, one window was free. I stepped up and handed over my parcel. "$2.59, 
how about that?" the clerk said cheerily, and I was on my way. 
</P>
<P>
 I stuck around for another 40 minutes just to make sure it wasn't a fluke. 
Sure enough, one of the clerks soon closed her window, and the line grew 
scandalously long: oh, maybe five or six people. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, I hear they're looking for writers to do a hit piece about the 
phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 I think I'll pass.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: PETS IN PERIL BRING OUT OUR ANIMAL INSTINCTS

 Tabitha, Taro, "Coke." 
</P>
<P>
 And now . . . Smokey. These are the 1994 inductees into the American Animal 
Hall of Fame, an exclusive first-names-only club that celebrates the lost, the 
exploited and the deeply misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, we have wept in relief as Taro, the Akita who nipped its 
owner's niece, won a reprieve from Doggie Death Row when the governor of New 
Jersey pardoned him on the condition he be banished from the state. Probably 
didn't hurt that Brigitte Bardot had sent a telegram on the dog's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 We bit our nails to the nub when Tabitha the cat was lost in an airplane en 
route from New York to Los Angeles for 12 excruciating days. While the plane 
was not exactly torn apart rivet by rivet (airlines are sympathetic to cats, 
but only up to a point), it was searched each time it touched down until the 
errant fuzz ball was found. 
</P>
<P>
 We shuddered for poor "Coke," the English sheep dog so nicknamed by the 
veterinarian who surgically removed a bellyful of top-grade cocaine from the 
pooch this month after it arrived in New York from Colombia, giving rise to the 
riddle: When is a dog a mule?  
</P>
<P>
 And last week, rounding out a year that would have made the producers of the 
defunct TV show "That's Incredible!" salivate (remember the water-skiing 
squirrel?), we watched as another doggie found itself in a stare-down with the 
criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess who blinked? 
</P>
<P>
 Smokey, a 5-year-old Labrador retriever from Danville, Va., was found guilty 
of chasing (but not biting) three mail carriers in his Danville neighborhood, 
thus becoming the first dog to face sentencing under Danville's tough "three 
mail carriers and you're out" ordinance. Smokey was sentenced to die by lethal 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case turned political when 40 members of the Italian Senate signed a 
petition on Smokey's behalf, and that world-class humanitarian and retriever 
owner Henry Kissinger urged the judge to "Restore the dog to the owner and tell 
the mailman to take a different route." 
</P>
<P>
 (These pleas raise some sticky diplomatic issues, such as: Did Kissinger 
consider the health and welfare of Cambodian dogs when he authorized the secret 
bombings in 1970? And: Why are the Italians butting in? Are their political 
scandals simply not keeping them busy? Would their time not be better spent 
making Italy safe for anti-Mafia judges instead of trying to make America safe 
for sociopathic Labrador retrievers? And what's with the Italian obsession with 
animals? Last week, the politician trying to oust Italian Prime Minster Silvio 
Berlusconi called his critics "lice and pigs." How disgusting.) 
</P>
<P>
 But I digress. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumor mill worked overtime on Smokey's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly reelected Virginia Sen. Charles Robb supposedly urged Smokey to say that 
he had only been chasing the mail carriers in order to massage, not maul them. 
Robb's opponent, Oliver North, reportedly advised Smokey to say he committed 
the crimes, but only out of loyalty to his master, who had secretly authorized 
Smokey to chase the postal workers in a misguided attempt to get the mail 
delivered faster. North was said to have coached Smokey on putting a tremor in 
his bark. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also rumored that Newt Gingrich suggested a defense strategy for Smokey 
as a victim of misguided liberal ideology: If Smokey had been made to work in 
exchange for food and shelter (bring in the newspaper, save small children from 
fires), he might not have felt so hostile and worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the pressure brought to bear on Danville City Judge T. Ryland 
Dodson was too much. He found a technicality in the law -- the city penalties 
for keeping vicious dogs were inconsistent with state laws -- and reversed his 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reprieve, all is not rosy for the Smokester. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, vets discovered the old boy has heart worms, a condition that will 
be fatal without the proper treatment. Smokey's owner has intimated he won't 
cough up the $350 to save the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 He shouldn't worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Might be tough for a child to raise that kind of dough, but for an Animal Hall 
of Famer, piece of cake.

'90S FAMILY; PARENTING CENTERS GIVE FAMILIES PLACE TO HEAL; SOCIAL SERVICES: 
TROUBLED ADULTS LEARN HOW TO BE BETTER PARENTS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, CHILDREN 
CAN SPEND TIME WITH MOM OR DAD WITHOUT FEAR OF NEGLECT OR ABUSE.

<P>
 There were days when the young mother, a manic-depressive, never left her 
bedroom. Her three children, ages 2 to 9, were left to fend for themselves. 
When she tried to commit suicide almost two years ago, her children were placed 
in foster care by the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 But the woman has been reunited with her children and says her worst days are 
behind her. She gives credit for keeping connected with them to the Family 
Visitation/Parent Learning Center in North Hollywood, a new type of social 
service center that has gained popularity nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on a quiet street shaded by lush sycamore trees, the ranch-style home 
provides a safe environment where at-risk children can spend time with their 
families without fear of additional neglect or abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the nonprofit Children's Bureau of Southern California, it is one 
of eight visitation centers in Southern California and about 100 nationwide. It 
offers parent-education classes and support groups for abuse prevention. Other 
supervised visitation centers provide a neutral site for the children of 
parents caught in custody battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her experiences at the North Hollywood facility, the woman said she 
learned to "parent like an adult." 
</P>
<P>
 The guidance she received from the staff "helped get my children home by 
helping me gain confidence as a parent," she added. "I still bonded with my 
children, because I was able to care for them like at my own home." 
</P>
<P>
 Such centers are becoming the "social service of the future," said Joanne 
Karolzak, president of the nonprofit Visitation Network in Tucson. "There is a 
greater understanding -- on the part of judges, family-law attorneys and 
psychologists -- of children needing to maintain relations with their birth 
parents," she said. The visitation centers "provide a safe place so the parent 
and child can maintain contact." 
</P>
<P>
 When children are separated from their parents, no matter what the reason, 
they experience loss, Karolzak said. "In order for them to go through the 
grieving and healing process, they must maintain contact with both their 
parents. Otherwise, they can become emotionally stunted." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster children, she continued, are at a greater risk, because they are 
separated from both parents. But children separated from a parent through 
divorce face the same sense of loss. "Children need ongoing relationships with 
their non-custodial parent. But sometimes it is not safe for children, so 
supervised visits become necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitation centers received a boost -- at least temporarily -- in September 
when Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the $30-billion 
crime bill. Part of that bill was the Child Safety Act, which called for $15 
million to fund up to 50 supervised visitation centers for "the protection of 
children from the trauma of witnessing or experiencing death during 
parental/child visitations or visitation exchanges." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of recent Republican victories in Congress, Karolzak does not think 
visitation centers will suffer. "Supervised visitation is law-and-order 
oriented. If they see supervised visitation as an enforcement agency, it should 
fare well" in the debate over spending, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridge Focus, a nonprofit agency in Burbank, provides supervised visitation 
for 35 families per year involved in custody disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Family-law attorneys and judges refer clients to the agency for monitoring in 
cases of allegations of physical or mental abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the degree of abuse, said Richard Hill, director of Bridge Focus, 
"the child wants to maintain the relationship with his (estranged) parent, but 
they want the hurting to stop. They don't want the bad stuff to continue. So we 
protect them for their own well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 Bridge Focus offers fees on a sliding scale to its clients, which is an 
advantage to most parents who are deluged with legal fees during a divorce, 
Hill said. But because of a cut in county funds to $14,000 annually -- down 
from $25,000 -- visitations are being reduced to three per week. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood visitation center, opened July 1, allows 12 children, from 
infants to 5 years old, to meet weekly with their birth parents. These children 
are referred by the Children's Services because of their families' involvement 
in substance abuse, mental illness or other forms of abuse or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1983, the Children's Bureau placed at-risk children younger than 
5 in residential group homes. But running a group home cost the taxpayer nearly 
$50,000 a year per child, said Alex Morales, executive director of the 
Children's Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency now serves 12 children each year for the same money it used to 
spend serving one, Morales said.  
</P>
<P>
 At the visitation center, foster-care children meet with their birth parents 
up to three times a week from two to 10 hours per visit. The staff does more 
than monitor visits, said Penelope Katz, visitation center social worker. "They 
try to coach parents on how to play with their child, how to fix a child a 
nutritious meal or how to discipline the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents of abused or neglected children do not know how to parent, Katz 
added. "This program allows them the opportunity to learn practical skills in a 
safe place. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a child is removed from a home, the parent-child bond is broken. If 
parents have the opportunity to bond with their child, the tendency toward 
abuse decreases," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken woman with the three children agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (parenting) classes give me a place to talk about what I need to do," she 
said. "They help me to hear what other parents are going through with their 
children."

'90S FAMILY; ADDING RICHNESS TO EVERYDAY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rituals and traditions add variety and richness to life, and best of all, they 
don't have to be complicated, says Elizabeth Berg, author of "Family 
Traditions: Celebrations for Holidays and Everyday" (Reader's Digest, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 "A ritual or tradition can be as simple as something you do every night, like 
read a story to a small child, or something you do weekly, such as go out for 
Chinese food," Berg says. 
</P>
<P>
 You may think you have no family rituals, but that's usually not true, she 
adds: "You probably have special rituals unique to your family." 
</P>
<P>
 To incorporate rituals and traditions into your life, she and other experts 
suggest that you do the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Recognize existing traditions. Look around to see what you're already doing 
on a regular basis that is unique to your family and give the activity the 
status it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Augment traditions. If you're already reading stories to the kids at night, 
cuddle up in the winter under a special story quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Start small. Begin with one ritual and incorporate it before trying another. 
Holidays are a natural time to begin family rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have weekly family conferences. Weekly talks give family members a chance to 
express problems and share solutions. Just make sure that no one shouts or 
accuses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Start a family-activities jar. Have each family member put suggestions for 
family outings in a jar and then pick one a week to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose traditions that will teach values and social responsibility to your 
children. Sponsoring an underprivileged family at Christmas or visiting nursing 
homes on a monthly basis will teach your children invaluable lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try simple, inexpensive rituals. Some of the most memorable traditions and 
rituals are free. Read books or poetry, play games, put together puzzles, 
listen to music, bake, sew, do crafts, garden, hike and go on picnics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gather ideas from friends and neighbors. When a friend or family member 
tells you about a great tradition, try it yourself. Keep ideas preserved in a 
notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a calendar. Until they are ingrained habits, some traditions and rituals 
must be put on the calendar so you can make time for them and plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prioritize. If you think you're too busy for family traditions, take a hard 
look at your schedule and make some cuts. Saying "No" to some obligations means 
saying "Yes" to your family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Replace traditions that no longer apply. As children age and life changes, 
some traditions may no longer be appropriate. Don't be afraid to try something 
new. JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; AT FEINSTEIN, YOUTHS LEARN THE VALUE OF VOLUNTEERING

 Could this be America's most boring high school? 
</P>
<P>
 No football. No cheerleaders. No gangbangers or metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Student Andrea Smith, 14, said that she studied mediation techniques this year 
to calm squabbling children. She took flowers to invalids. She volunteered at a 
hospital. "I don't really know what the other kids do after school, but me and 
my friends, we just get together and go to the library," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Alan Shawn Feinstein High School in Providence, R.I., said to be 
the nation's first public high school dedicated to community service. While 
many schools now have public-service requirements for graduation, at Feinstein 
-- which opened this fall -- the whole curriculum is built around volunteering 
in day-care centers, hospital labs, community gardens, zoos or soup kitchens. 
Each classroom displays the watchwords of founding philanthropist Alan Shawn 
Feinstein that could become -- if it ever gets a team -- a school cheer: 
"Respect. Courtesy. Integrity. Initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no tests or letter grades at Feinstein, only self-evaluations. 
Rather than sophomores, juniors and seniors, the students are called 
"explorers," "majors" and "masters." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder the school received 240 applications for 170 slots? 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein students start out volunteering four hours a week and work up to 10. 
They discuss their experiences in "Issues, Ethics and Service Class" -- one of 
their three 90-minute classes. By the end of high school, Principal Anthony 
Milano said, they should produce something "that really addresses a social 
question, that provides a real solution to a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't produced any yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added hopefully, "If they had enough information and had done enough 
research, they could propose a solution as to what to do with a lot of our 
abandoned housing in Providence." 
</P>
<P>
 As might be expected, the faculty has its share of hyphenated last names and 
people who remember John F. Kennedy's "Ask Not" speech. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s, however, '60s idealism has a somewhat desperate tinge to it. 
Fearing a meltdown of core values in society, liberals, conservatives and 
centrists agree something has to be done to rebuild a national character -- and 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But administrators say kids who want to come to Feinstein are probably 
predisposed to do good. Sometimes too disposed -- like the student who became 
so involved answering a hot line for missing children that she soon was 
volunteering three hours a night. Her mother called the school to complain that 
her schoolwork was being neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hesitate to say it, but honesty compels me, I didn't know about it," Milano 
said. The girl's hours were cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest anyone assume it's nothing but slow times at Feinstein High, the students 
held a Harvest Dance in October. They also started planning another. At the 
meeting, someone suggested they increase the cost. "They said, 'Why don't we 
add a dollar to the cost of the ticket and donate to a charity or buy some 
non-perishable food items and give it to a place?' " Milano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously a role model of honesty, Milano admitted that school officials were 
unable to screen every applicant this year. Some kids who wanted a little more 
excitement squeaked in. One could probably find some pregnant teen-agers or 
substance abusers at Feinstein, he said. "I know they're not all angels." 
</P>
<P>
 That's no problem as far as philanthropist Feinstein is concerned. "I don't 
see any problems with the high school," he said. "There are a lot of wonderful 
kids in the world. When they suddenly realize they can impact positively on the 
lives of others, they become even more wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hear it for respect, integrity, courtesy and initiative. C'mon you guys, 
yell!

'90S FAMILY; THE RITE STUFF; IN TODAY'S BUSY WORLD OF BROKEN FAMILIES AND TV 
THERE'S NO TIME FOR OLD-FASHIONED TRADITIONS. BUT YOU SHOULD MAKE TIME, EXPERTS 
SAY, BECAUSE RITUALS ARE THE STUFF THAT WONDERFUL MEMORIES ARE MADE OF.

 Every Christmas season, Janet Whitney and her three children make and decorate 
350 to 400 gingerbread-men cookies. The production is a major one that covers 
three tables in their Irvine home. When the icing has dried, they decorate the 
house with their gingerbread creations and give them to friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The gingerbread men are a much anticipated tradition in the Whitney home, as 
is breakfast out every Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids really look forward to our breakfast together and we rarely miss a 
weekend," says Whitney, who is single. "They know they can count on that 
special time with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Family traditions and rituals -- and not just during the holidays -- were 
common years ago. But today, many traditions have been forgotten because of 
increased divorce, extended families living apart, long work hours and the 
interference of television, experts say. This is unfortunate, they add, because 
traditions and rituals can be a reassuring anchor during troubled times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family dinners, holidays, birthdays and special times specific to each family 
give children and adults a sense of security and stability when there's so much 
unpredictability in the outside world," says therapist Joanie Heinemann of 
Coastline Counseling Center in Newport Beach. She says that depression during 
the holidays is often linked to a lack of family traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In family therapy, mental health experts actually prescribe rituals and 
traditions, says Richard Golden, a marriage/family/child counselor in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditions and rituals anchor families, make members feel special and 
communicate value and meaning to kids," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Through their church, Whitney and her children sponsor a disadvantaged child 
every Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, my oldest, who is now 8, wanted to buy toys for himself when we 
went Christmas shopping for the child we sponsor," Whitney says. "Now he even 
offers to give his own toys. The experience has taught him to think of others." 
</P>
<P>
 Rituals and traditions also do the important task of putting boundaries on 
times of mourning and celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditions and rituals, such as funerals and anniversaries, give you a time 
to indulge emotions and then contain them so they don't bleed over into 
everyday life," Golden says. "Rituals can also give participants a valuable 
sense of family history." 
</P>
<P>
 Every August, Maria Gonzalez and her extended family honor her father by 
holding a special Mass in his name around the anniversary of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all attend church in our old East Los Angeles neighborhood, and then we go 
to my mom's house or a restaurant for breakfast or lunch," says Gonzalez, 41, a 
second-generation Mexican American who lives in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After eating, family members travel to the father's grave, where they pray 
silently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all really miss our father," Gonzalez says. "He and my mother were married 
45 years. Although this day is sad and we always cry when we visit the grave, 
it gives us a chance to remember him among ourselves. We also take the 
opportunity to tell the grandchildren about their grandfather." 
</P>
<P>
 Every year before Christmas, Gonzalez and her family also celebrate Las 
Posadas, a re-enactment of Mary and Joseph's journey for shelter before the 
birth of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I get older, family becomes even more precious to me," Gonzalez says. 
"Traditions and rituals are so important because they teach values and create 
wonderful memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditions are what wonderful memories are made of, agrees therapist 
Heinemann. "People won't have warm, fuzzy feelings about the television shows 
they watched, but they will cherish times spent with family." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Means, 39, of South Gate, says she now understands why her parents found 
rituals and traditions so important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditions create family unity and a belief in something," she says. "They 
give you a sense of peace, which is critical in today's stressful world." 
</P>
<P>
 Every other Sunday, Means takes her three daughters to church and out for 
breakfast, then they spend the day together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take the time to review the week and catch up on each other's lives," she 
says. "This keeps us connected." 
</P>
<P>
 Means, who is Mexican American, also has traditions she follows from 
childhood, including cuddling up with Mexican hot chocolate and pan dulce 
(sweet bread) on winter nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot chocolate and sweetbread is a symbol of unity and communication in my 
family," she says. "I've passed this tradition on to my daughters." 
</P>
<P>
 Every holiday season, Means and her mother and sisters get together a week 
before Christmas to make tamales for their Christmas Eve feast. "This is a 
wonderful time when we talk and listen to Christmas music," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 With her children, Means started her own Christmas tradition of making or 
buying each of them a special Christmas tree ornament every year. Her daughters 
will take the ornaments with them as keepsakes when they move out. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Hanukkah, Barry Greene shares special holiday rituals with his family. 
Although these are very important to Greene, of North Tustin, he thinks that 
rituals at other times of the year may be even more so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to remember and practice rituals and traditions during the 
holidays," he says. "Incorporating (them) throughout the year is just as 
important, and we make a conscious effort to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, 44, and his wife, Carol, 46, have taken a trip to the country every 
year since their daughter, now 8, was an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 In late September or early October, they spend a day picking fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make memories on that trip that we wouldn't have if we'd simply gone to 
the market and bought apples," Carol Greene says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenes also believe in using family traditions to educate their child, 
who has gone to vote with her parents in every general and primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year she watched the election results with us and was well-versed on the 
different propositions," Barry Greene says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenes also have important daily rituals. "Whoever drops Sarah off at 
school will tell her to do her best and make herself proud," Barry Greene says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rituals are so important because they give children a sense of belonging and 
a certain amount of security," Carol Greene says. "They are good for adults 
too. I know our rituals and traditions give me a warm, secure feeling."

 My local post office is so nice I almost consider it a getaway. (I have young 
children, so I'm vacation impaired.) It's clean, modern, has ample parking, 
nice trees, fancy machines and a concierge who works the line ("Hello, I'm 
Michael, how may I help you?"). 
</P>
<P>
 The last time I was here another genuinely helpful postal worker overheard me 
fumbling with a worn dollar bill that wouldn't go through a change machine -- 
and scurried over with a clean bill. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular day, I've bribed the kids with the promise of a bagel run 
if they'll just get along for however long it takes to mail the package, but 
the line seems discouragingly long. We're stuck in the outer lobby, back with 
post office boxes that seem to have quadruple digits. 
</P>
<P>
 After two minutes, the woman in front of us silently peels off. Guess her 
relatives aren't worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else is so civilized -- and surprised when the pace of the line 
starts to quicken. But after two more minutes, the children escape to a garden 
bench next to a counter, except my 3-year-old son can't sit still. He does the 
limbo with the plastic rope that forms the lines, then lifts my dress. 
</P>
<P>
 The television monitor mounted on the wall has been playing mildly annoying 
postal commercials. It switches to a message with an equally annoying happy 
holidays theme, but we don't care -- we're near the front of the line, which 
has been moving at a relatively brisk three persons a minute.  
</P>
<P>
 My son shrieks long and loud from the bench, but I can't tell what's wrong 
from where I'm standing, and I'm not about to give up my place at the front of 
the line. I think about pretending he's not mine, but instead I coax my 
6-year-old daughter into bringing him to me. He starts to explain how the bench 
"bit my elbow" when I hear, "Next?"  
</P>
<P>
 The actual mailing takes seconds. I gather the kids, avoid any eye contact 
with the line on the way out -- and resolve to mail all my packages this late 
next year.

 Postal employee Cynthia Crane knows lines. She used to toil at the Inglewood 
postal hub, a sprawling facility where lines and packages tend to pile up. But 
that was before she moved to the office serving the tiny community of Silverado 
Canyon in the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really get crowded here," Crane said Saturday morning, her voice 
almost echoing in the empty office. "When it gets real bad, we have two lines 
with about three people in each." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no lines Saturday at this small outpost, where most patrons are 
greeted by name. One local woman dropped by just after 10 a.m. to check on an 
eagerly awaited package. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, but we'll call you if it comes in," Crane told her as she left. 
</P>
<P>
 Two sorters, one postmaster, one driver and one letter carrier make up the 
entire staff at the post office, which serves about 500 homes. The doors open 
early and close late, so there's time to help folks wrap up their packages or 
make those tough stamp selection decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the kind you lick and the kind you peel," Crane cheerfully told the 
sole customer at 10:15 a.m. "And you can get either the holiday stamps or the 
Legends of the West. I like the holiday ones." 
</P>
<P>
 The service is so good, people drive in to sample it, the same way they visit 
the local diner across the street for the breakfast special. "We have some 
people that come up from Orange, a couple from El Toro," Crane said. "Some 
people just like to go where they know there won't be a line." 
</P>
<P>
 People like Renne Jones, 39, of Lake Forest, who brought her son and a tall 
stack of Christmas cards with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in Lake Forest, but I love Silverado," said Jones. "I use the post 
office here and this branch of the library, too. I don't like crowds. I just 
absolutely don't like crowds at all."

 Woe and misery seemed inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to a post office at Christmastime is a little like visiting Disneyland 
-- except that there, after you spend eternity in line, at least you get to go 
on a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 At the U.S. Purgatory Office, on the other hand, you can only wish there was a 
Matterhorn mountain from which to personally hurl the 247 customers in front of 
you who are sending their packages by registered mail and who are filling out 
the necessary paperwork in an ancient form of slowly written Sanskrit that 
requires the clerk to disappear to a back room for half an hour to translate 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, then, check out the Terminal Annex post office Downtown. OK, there was a 
cartoonish character wandering around the parking lot -- a homeless woman in a 
Santa hat and white high heels -- but the line inside was more like Euro 
Disney: only six people.

-- despite an apparent lack of nitrous oxide tanks behind the counters.

 The place even has a "You Are Here" map of services at the entrance, directing 
people to copy machines, passport windows and a philatelic mart (closed during 
our visit). For art aficionados, there also are murals to admire along the 
building's cavernous halls.  
</P>
<P>
 But be forewarned. Terminal Annex does have periods of interminable waits.

 "It's still early in the morning," a clerk said when asked about the short

 "Come back after noon and it's another story, believe me."

 Just the facts: 
</P>
<P>
 * For 1994, 3.2 billion Christmas stamps were printed.  
</P>
<P>
 * Contemporary Christmas stamps outnumber traditional Christmas stamps, 1.9 
billion to 1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Because Christmas is on a Sunday, the two "busiest mail days" were Dec. 12 
and Dec. 19 when about 500 million cards and letters were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Dec. 12, Southern California post offices canceled about 18.3 million 
pieces of mail. This is 70%-80% above a "normal" Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * The largest volume of mail on Dec. 12 was canceled at the facilities in San 
Diego and Santa Ana -- 2.8 million. In contrast, Pasadena canceled 800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * During the 1994 holiday season, 3.7 billion letters and cards are expected 
to be processed; and 30 million parcels.

 This time of year, I'm always warmed by Christmases past -- like 1991, when I 
went to the Venice post office to mail gifts. At one point during my 90-minute 
wait I found myself seated across from a man with a rather sizable snake 
wrapped around his neck. But I got there first and wasn't about to give up my 
cherished seat just because of some big ol' boa. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Christmas mailing took nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew it was going to be bad this year when I passed the parking lot and it 
had that SigAlert look. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon entering the post office, I noticed lots of people sitting, standing, 
otherwise looking miserable. This was not good. I eyed the number counter on 
the wall. No. 58 was being waited on. I slowly walked to the number machine to 
see what fate awaited me. Argh. No. 79. Dread hit me like a box marked 
"Fragile." 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the time, I prayed for a few customer outbursts. Perhaps No. 60, 
patience long gone, would shout, "This is an outrage!" Maybe a pregnant woman 
would waddle in with the bogus announcement that she was in the last stages of 
labor and wondered if she could cut in line to mail her gifts. Instead, it was 
so quiet you could hear a postage stamp drop. 
</P>
<P>
 For two minutes no number was called, so I decided to brush up on my postal 
knowledge. A certificate of mailing costs 50 cents. Seeds and catalogues are 
third-class mail and books are fourth-class. No envie efectivo in Spanish means 
Don't send cash in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at 10:02, 59 was called. I was about to brush up on money order costs 
and express mailings when 60 was called (10:02), 61 (10:03), 62 and 63 (10:04), 
64 and 65 (10:06), 66 (10:07), 67 and 68 (10:08), 69 (10:09), 70 and 71 
(10:10), 72 (no show) and 73 (10:12). 
</P>
<P>
 For what seemed like an eternity, the numbers stopped. Finally, at 10:15, 74 
was summoned, followed by 75 (no show), 76 (10:15), 77 (no show), 78 (10:16) 
and finally me at 10:17. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty seconds later, my parcel was headed in one direction and I in another 
with the kind postal clerk's words still ringing in my ears, "Have a nice day." 
</P>
<P>
 Would someone just pinch me? 
</P>

SLY'S BIG DEAL: $20 MILLION -- MAYBE A LOT MORE; MOVIES: SYLVESTER STALLONE'S 
AGREEMENT WITH SAVOY PICTURES FOR AN AS-YET UNDETERMINED FILM MAY CAUSE A 
DOMINO EFFECT WITH OTHER STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what is believed to be the biggest deal ever made with an actor, Savoy 
Pictures has agreed to pay Sylvester Stallone $20 million, or potentially an 
unprecedented percentage of total revenues, to star in a yet-to-be-determined 
movie in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 According to informed sources, the deal guarantees Stallone $20 million, or 
20% of total receipts collected by Savoy from all media worldwide -- including 
theatrical, video, network and cable TV -- if those revenues exceed $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry insiders say the agreement is staggering and could cause a domino 
effect in Hollywood, where today's biggest stars -- including Kevin Costner, 
Tom Cruise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks, Michael Douglas and 
Bruce Willis -- command $12 million-$15 million a picture against 15% of the 
distributor's receipts. Stallone is represented by the same company, the 
powerful Creative Artists Agency, that also handles such high-ticket talent as 
Costner, Cruise, Hanks and Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the biggest deal I've ever heard of," says Joe Roth, chairman of the 
Walt Disney motion pictures group. "Sure, this will have a ripple effect on the 
highest level," adds the executive, "because this is the competitive 
environment that the agencies live in. Now agents will feel a need to go after 
this figure for their big clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Canton, chairman of Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures, says: "I'm a big 
fan of Sly's, but I've never heard of such a big deal -- it's shocking." He 
notes, "It not only puts more pressure on agents to deliver big numbers for 
their clients, it puts pressure on the studios to (determine) how high is high 
and when is enough enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Agents insist that their big clients in the right movies guarantee a certain 
amount of revenues and that they are thus entitled to a bigger piece of the 
total revenue pie, which has grown dramatically, primarily due to the demand in 
foreign markets. However, studio executives say they don't buy that argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about revenues, it's about margins and the margins are getting more 
narrow because the cost of making and marketing movies has gone up so much," 
contends Roth, who is certainly not alone in his assessment. Its detractors in 
Hollywood criticize the 3-year-old New York-based Savoy -- a publicly held 
production and distribution company that has been plagued by such box-office 
flops as "Exit to Eden" and "Serial Mom" -- for spending too much on talent and 
material. Eyebrows were raised earlier this year when the company made an 
unprecedented "first-dollar gross" deal with screenwriter Joe Eszterhas and a 
$2-million-plus deal for Tom Clancy's "Without Remorse." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Savoy is desperate and has not been able to deliver to stockholders 
or (theater owners)," says one movie executive. "By saying they have Stallone 
for a movie, essentially they're buying time. This will give the appearance, if 
not the reality, of delivering." 
</P>
<P>
 Other observers, however, insist that the company -- which only released its 
first batch of films over the last 15 months, including the critically 
acclaimed "Shadowlands" -- has hardly had time to prove itself. "Last year was 
only their first year in business," says one Savoy supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Savoy Chairman Victor A. Kaufman and President Lewis J. Korman, who formed the 
company in 1992 with $100 million of investor seed money and just last month 
had to recapitalize after reporting major losses for the year, declined to 
comment for this story. The two have a longstanding relationship with Stallone 
going back to their days at TriStar Pictures when the studio released "Rambo: 
First Blood, Part II" and "Rambo III," and the actor's less successful prison 
movie, "Lock Up." 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone, who reportedly received $12 million and $15 million, respectively, 
for his last two movies, Warner Bros.' "The Specialist" and Cinergi/Hollywood 
Pictures' upcoming summer's release "Judge Dredd," collected a flat fee of $25 
million for the 1990 sequel "Rocky V." 
</P>
<P>
 Because U.S. distributors like Savoy typically split a film's box-office gross 
with theater owners 50-50, Stallone's forthcoming movie for Savoy would have to 
gross more than $200 million at the box office before his percentage would kick 
in. The actor would then get 20 cents on every dollar thereafter, regardless of 
what Savoy's costs for making and distributing the movie are. 
</P>
<P>
 The "play-or-pay deal," which guarantees the actor his fee even if for some 
reason Savoy does not go forward with the project, is not tied to a specific 
movie, but to a "slot" that the star has committed to in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone's representatives -- agent Ron Meyer, president of Creative Artists 
Agency, and attorney Jake Bloom -- always negotiate two slots a year for 
Stallone rather than specific movies. Both refused comment for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor will not be able to make a movie for Savoy until 1996 because of 
prior movie commitments next year, first to Warner Bros., then to Cinergi. He 
still has an open slot for another movie in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallone, whose movies have generally performed better in foreign markets, is 
a much bigger star overseas. "Cliffhanger," for example, grossed $171 million 
overseas and $84 million domestically. He has proven to be a strong box-office 
draw only in action movies. The Savoy deal stipulates he must star in an 
action/thriller movie both parties agree upon. 
</P>
<P>
 His movie career was launched with the two successful action movie series 
"Rocky" and "Rambo" -- which collectively have brought in more than $1 billion. 
But any time Stallone has deviated from action roles, with such movies as 
"Rhinestone," "Lock Up," "Oscar" and "Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot," those titles 
have flopped at the box office and his career has suffered. The success of his 
1993 movie "Cliffhanger" made him realize that action films were his niche. He 
followed "Cliffhanger" with the $100-million hit "Demolition Man," and the 
current action movie, "The Specialist," which has grossed about $80 million to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, he's back on a roll doing films audiences love to see him in," says one 
executive who's a big fan of the star.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: DUMBSPEAK : JOYCELYN ELDERS ISN'T TV'S ONLY 
MASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How can you turn the world upside down?  
</P>
<P>
 -- Claire Bloom to Richard Burton in "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Say what? report . . .  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's recent firing of Joycelyn Elders as U.S. surgeon general 
affirms the hazards of being publicly inarticulate or imprecise when you're an 
outspoken, controversial federal official who gets on television a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of Elders' public health agenda, her inability to express herself 
clearly in the TV age is reason enough to disqualify her from such a 
high-profile post where words can be interpreted as policy. No wonder her 
recent comments during a televised public gathering were enough to sink her, 
especially when taken out of context (ABC's "Nightline" was that rare news 
program that ran a fuller version of Elders' remarks). 
</P>
<P>
 Teach masturbation in schools? Surely, Elders meant teach kids about 
masturbation as an alternative to sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that TV viewers are unaccustomed to dumbspeak . 
</P>
<P>
 The cliche tag, "Only time will tell," still adorns many a TV news story, just 
as the hackneyed "he (or she) will be missed" is mandatory for TV obits, 
especially when the deceased won't be missed. Just about everywhere on TV, 
people who lie down are inevitably "laying down," and reporters continue to 
report on the "mood" of a city, region or nation -- as if able to measure 
public opinion by thrusting an index finger into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the Simpson-Goldman murder case, moreover, just about every 
ruling from Judge Lance Ito is reported locally as a "big blow" suffered by 
someone, as in his decision Monday to reject a prosecution motion for 
disclosure of a reportedly emotional jailhouse exchange between O.J. Simpson 
and minister Rosey Grier. Labeling it a "big blow" to the prosecution, which 
some newscasts did, misleadingly gave it weight equal to another Ito ruling 
Monday, against the defense's request to scale back a hearing on the 
admissibility of DNA evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 And hear this: "There is renewed speculation this morning that O.J. Simpson is 
running out of cash." 
</P>
<P>
 That was KNBC-TV Channel 4 reporter Kelly Mack on Monday, live in the darkness 
outside the criminal courts building . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? Just who would be speculating anew about Simpson's bank account at 
that hour? The homeless in downtown Los Angeles? Hardly. Mack herself? You may 
be getting warmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, this had the ring of reporterese for I'm speculating or reporters 
are speculating, a way of slipping in opinion under the guise of objectivity. 
In this case, of course, the speculation was rooted in Simpson defense 
attorneys' claim that a separate, extended DNA hearing would further cripple 
their client financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Such reporterese is not exclusive to any branch of media. While covering City 
Hall in Louisville, Ky., for example, my colleagues and I practiced it. We 
preferred "City Hall observers say" to "speculation" -- the "observers" being 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack also referred Monday to the much-discussed jailhouse chat between Simpson 
and Grier, saying, "That conversation is said to be incriminating." Added 
Channel 4's Tracie Savage later about comments the accused killer may have 
shouted to Grier: "Sources have said that they incriminate" Simpson. No 
qualification, no elaboration, merely that "they incriminate." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, really. Just who "said" that, and what is their agenda? There's been 
speculation galore about what Simpson said, and it's in the prosecution's best 
interest that the Simpson-Grier jailhouse exchange be seen as incriminating. 
Yet the only public account, coming from a jail guard who says he overheard 
Simpson shout and slam down a phone, omitted details of the conversation. 
Because of Ito's ruling, moreover, they may never be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense sought to exclude the reported outburst from the trial. Infer what 
you wish from that. Yet unless Channel 4 has something substantial to add 
beyond unqualified, fuzzy accusations from anonymous sources -- the station 
admitted being burned by its sources in an earlier Simpson reporting gaffe -- 
it's spewing irresponsible guesswork. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Big Sleep: After greyhounds stop racing, "they tend to be put to sleep," 
said a reporter for "Breakfast Time," a series on cable's FX network. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter was doing a story last week on an admirable program to get people 
to adopt these magnificent, sleek beauties. Good for her. But did she say 
greyhounds tend to be put to sleep? That made it sound almost as if the dogs 
initiated their "sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. They're killed, at a relatively young age, when their owners no longer 
deem then financially profitable. Can't race, can't live. 
</P>
<P>
 And enough already with the feel-good euphemisms -- "destroying" or the even 
more misleading "putting to sleep" -- when it comes to humans slaying animals. 
The "Breakfast Time" reporter urged the adoption of greyhounds, for example, 
"so they don't have to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sleep" you awaken from, death you don't. Greyhounds and other animals are put 
to sleep the way human victims are put to sleep. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sans Lindsay: They sit on stools facing the camera. "This is 'Ford Today,' " 
says the smiling female half of the hosting team as her equally genial male 
partner listens at her side. 
</P>
<P>
 A commercial for Thunderbird minus usual Ford pitchwoman Lindsay Wagner, the 
spot is designed to resemble a morning news segment. Hence its deployment 
largely before and during network morning shows, the apparent purpose being to 
blur lines and fool inattentive viewers into thinking that they're watching 
something they're not. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years now, program-length infomercials have sought to create an 
illusion of credibility by embracing the formats of talk shows or newscasts. 
But this is the first such 30-second spot in some time. It's clever. 
</P>
<P>
 Beware, America. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Deception Today.

PEABO: AT A PEAK, BUT PLENTY PEEVED; SUCCESS NOTWITHSTANDING, BRYSON HAS MUCH 
TO SAY ABOUT PERCEIVED INDUSTRY INJUSTICES, RACISM AND RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Singer Peabo Bryson is frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the veteran soul balladeer's career seems to be at a peak, Bryson 
chafes at many aspects of the same music industry that's brought him fame and 
fortune. To him, the business is racist, age-discriminatory and generally 
lacking in morals and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 An artist carping about the biz certainly is nothing new. What is unusual is 
to hear a man who has enjoyed Bryson's level of success speaking as pointedly 
about perceived injustice as he eagerly does. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent phone interview, Bryson, who performs with Sheena Easton, 
Roberta Flack and James Ingram in the sold-out "Colors of Christmas" program at 
the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts tonight through Friday, seemed more 
passionate about decrying industry pet peeves than discussing his own list of 
achievements -- a list that any artist would envy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson has been a fixture on the R & B scene for almost three decades now, 
scoring with such hits as "Tonight I Celebrate My Love" and "If Ever You're in 
My Arms Again." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he's expanded his fan base into new arenas. In 1992 alone, 
Bryson was featured on recordings that topped four separate charts: "A Whole 
New World," a duet with Regina Belle from the Disney animated movie "Aladdin," 
topped the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts; "The King and I" album, featuring 
Bryson, was No. 1 on the Classical Crossover charts, and Kenny G's "Breathless" 
album, featuring Bryson on "By the Time the Night Is Over," topped the 
Contemporary Jazz charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anything I can't do," Bryson said. "I see myself as a 
true Renaissance man. I don't like one-dimensional concepts of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the rub. For all his success, Bryson, 43, feels stymied by a 
culture that worships youth, glorifies rage and violence in its music and 
refuses to grant acceptance to those who don't play the game the way the 
industry has outlined it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson is best known for singing old-fashioned, romantic soul ballads in a 
lush, subtle baritone in an age when rap and grunge have captured the media's 
attention almost to the exclusion of other musical genres. He has a large and 
loyal audience, yet Bryson feels blacklisted by contemporary pop culture, 
unable to get his music across to an even wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "How shall I put this?" he said. "I'm a great artist. Roberta Flack is a great 
artist. James Ingram is a great artist. Sheena Easton is a great artist. We are 
people who came up through the ranks and paid our dues and managed to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't get played on MTV, and I think there's something wrong about 
that. MTV has become so negative. I think it's fine to say you don't like 
something, but I think when you promote anger and disgust until it becomes the 
most popular, most-watched format, then it becomes detrimental rather than 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "When did the criteria stop being talent? And what are the demographics here 
-- how many people who watch MTV actually have jobs? The thing that really gets 
to me is that adults who have jobs are footing the bill for this indulgence," 
i.e., by purchasing the products advertised on the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson takes particular umbrage at rap. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap "especially angers me as an African American," he said. "It's another 
avenue for genocide. Young African Americans have no idea of their history, the 
history of R & B. (Rap) is the most highly touted, publicized (musical) form of 
our culture at this time, and I don't want it to be the sole representation of 
African Americans in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing positive comes out of it. I don't like the degrading way women are 
portrayed; that really upsets me. (Rappers) don't seem to care whether they 
hurt anybody or anything. Luther Campbell, by his own admission, wouldn't want 
his own kids listening to his music, so why would he want to impose it on mine? 
It's gotten to the point where it's way too narcissistic and greedy out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson also was eager to vent his spleen over a televised tribute to the 
Apollo Theatre that was broadcast earlier this year. The concert featured a 
salute to Marvin Gaye performed by British pop group Simply Red, which also 
sang alongside Sam Moore of Sam & Dave and a very unhappy-looking Bryson later 
in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson says Simply Red should not have been chosen to perform in a salute to 
Gaye. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very disturbed by that," he said. "I don't appreciate Simply Red 
singing those songs like 'What's Going On' and 'Ain't That Peculiar,' and I 
don't understand what the purpose of it was.  
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, if you're going to have a tribute, I would think you would use those 
of us who grew up with that music, internalized it and still use it as a part 
of what we are now. I asked specifically about doing those songs, and I don't 
understand the reasoning behind having him do them instead. And what were the 
rappers doing there, while many (veterans of the Apollo) were conspicuous by 
their omission? Solomon Burke is still around, Eddie Floyd, Wilson Pickett. Why 
weren't they included instead?" 
</P>

 While Bryson feels he has much to bemoan, he never comes across as unhappy or 
defeatist. He raises his arguments in an even, rational tone of voice and is 
quick to pepper his conversation about even the most frustrating topics with 
side jokes and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly and intelligent, Bryson has a strong sense of who he is and where he 
wants to go, even if his ambitions can't keep pace in a musical world that 
revolves around the trends of the day. But if he fails to meet every goal in 
his agenda, it won't be for lack of fighting spirit. 
</P>

 "I guess I (tick) people off because I don't go away," he said with a chuckle. 
"I'm like a tenacious forest fire -- you snuff me out over here, and I'm still 
burning down the back 40 just when you think it's over. I have a great faith in 
God, and because of my great faith in God, I have faith in the self."

 The 16-year-old Saddleback College Summer Stock Company has changed its name 
to create a higher profile. It is now called the Saddleback Civic Light Opera, 
according to producer Geoffrey English. 
</P>
<P>
 English said the summer-stock program has presented more than 50 musicals for 
the past nine seasons. Although most have been Broadway revivals, they also 
have included off-Broadway shows and two original revues: "Stardust" and 
"Jumpin', Jive and Jitterbug." 
</P>
<P>
 SCLO also has announced its 1995 summer season: "Beehive" (June 10-25), billed 
as a county premiere; "Nunsense II" (July 7-23), and "Guys and Dolls" (Aug. 
4-20). 
</P>
<P>
 All three productions, with casts made up mostly of college actors and a few 
professionals, will be staged on campus at Saddleback's 400-seat McKinney 
Theatre in Mission Viejo. (714) 582-4763.

MUSIC; MA TO GO ON RECORD WITH PACIFIC SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superstar cellist Yo-Yo Ma heads the list of soloists scheduled to play with 
the Pacific Symphony when the orchestra records composer Elliot Goldenthal's 
commission commemorating the suffering inflicted by the Vietnam War in April 
for the Sony Classical label, orchestra officials announced Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Soprano Ann Panagulias, baritone Sanford Sylvan, the Pacific Chorale, a 
children's chorus and Vietnamese folk artists also will participate in the 
recording project. Goldenthal's piece, which has not been finished or titled 
yet, will be recorded at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa, orchestra officials said, right after the first public performances of 
the piece there on April 26 and 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Music director Carl St.Clair will lead the orchestra for the recording, 
scheduled to be released in October. Ma will not play at the Orange County 
concerts, although the other soloists will. Pacific Symphony principal cellist 
Timothy Landauer will take Ma's part on those occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra's one-album deal with Sony, partially underwritten by a $50,000 
donation from a Pacific Symphony supporter, represents "quite a significant 
step toward our goal of national recognition, and in this case, certainly, 
international recognition because the distribution offered on Sony Classical is 
extraordinary," Pacific Symphony executive director Louis G. Spisto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ma has appeared with major orchestras and conductors and has won eight Grammys 
for his Sony recordings. Panagulias, who sang Gilda in Verdi's "Rigoletto" for 
the Los Angeles Music Center Opera in 1993, appeared in Orange County a year 
earlier with Placido Domingo in a benefit concert for Opera Pacific. Sylvan 
created the title role in John Adams' "The Death of Klinghoffer" and Chou-En 
Lai in Adams' "Nixon in China," and has sung Figaro and Guglielmo in the Peter 
Sellars' productions of Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro" and "Cosi fan tutte," 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the project will exceed $400,000, to be divided about equally 
between the orchestra and the recording company, Spisto said. The Pacific will 
pay for the musicians' costs, drawing on a $50,000 gift from Mark Chapin 
Johnson of Tustin Hills, president of the Chapin Medical Co. of Corona; a 
three-for-one $55,000 matching grant from the California Arts Council and 
$5,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts Special Project Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The arts council challenge requires the orchestra to raise $165,000 in order 
to receive the $55,000. "We've raised more than half of the project goal 
already," Spisto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Classical will pay for all of the soloists' costs, the cost of the 
chorale, all of the recording costs and the rental of the Performing Arts 
Center for the recording. "Sony is putting up at least (as much), if not more, 
support as we are," Spisto said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-project arrangement with Sony is similar to the deal the Pacific had 
with Koch International Classics when it issued a disc in August. That was the 
first recording of the orchestra led by St.Clair and included Corigliano's 
Piano Concerto with soloist Alain Lefevre and two pieces by Pacific 
composer-in-residence Frank Ticheli. Johnson was a major donor for that 
recording, too, contributing $50,000. It was the first recording by the 
orchestra since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks with Koch about future recordings are under discussion, "although we 
haven't decided the repertoire," Spisto said.

TV RATINGS; NEWTON-JOHN'S 'ROMANCE' WINS THE SUNDAY RACE

 Last Sunday's showdown of powerhouse network movies left Woody Allen for waste 
on ABC, Kirk Douglas reeling on NBC and Olivia Newton-John dancing in victory 
at CBS. Her snowy "Christmas Romance" with co-star Gregory Harrison ranked No. 
7 in the weekly ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 But ABC got the last laugh, finishing the week as the top-rated network again 
with the potent one-two punch of "Home Improvement" and "Grace Under Fire," 
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "Don't Drink the Water," adapted from Allen's 1966 stage play and 
co-starring Michael J. Fox, finished at No. 85 out of 96 prime-time programs. 
ABC's Sunday movies are averaging 16.5 million viewing households each week; 
"Don't Drink" attracted 6.6 million homes, among the lowest ever for an "ABC 
Sunday Night Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas' father-and-son journey with Craig T. Nelson in NBC's well-reviewed 
"Take Me Home Again" fared better, but not great, finishing No. 30.

ARMED EX-O.C. MAN SHOT NEAR WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and AARON NATHANS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Anaheim man brandishing a nine-inch knife was shot by a U.S. Park 
Police officer in front of the White House on Tuesday, marking the third 
shooting outside the presidential residence in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcelino Corniel, 33, a homeless man who had been camped in adjacent 
Lafayette Park, was shot in the chest and leg after charging across 
Pennsylvania Avenue about 9 a.m. and menacing a cordon of U.S. Park Police 
officers, authorities said. Police saw no indication that Corniel was trying to 
hurt President Clinton, who was at work in the Oval Office at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel, who remained in very critical condition after surgery Tuesday night, 
will be charged with assaulting a police officer, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other people camping in Lafayette Park, which is home to dozens of protesters 
and drifters, said that Corniel apparently had been angered Tuesday morning by 
patrolmen who routinely came by to wake them. Corniel jumped out from beneath a 
soiled blanket, shouting: "I'm going to get you!" 
</P>
<P>
 He dashed across the street toward the White House, holding his knife in front 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Park Police officer called for assistance and grappled with Corniel, 
whose knife was taped to his left hand. As other officers gathered, they 
repeatedly demanded that Corniel drop the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 With at least three other officers standing in a semicircle about 10 feet from 
him, a policeman approached Corniel and demanded again that he drop the knife. 
Television videotape of the incident shows that Corniel was moving only 
slightly and not trying to strike the officers at the moment he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Park Police spokesman insisted that Corniel's behavior threatened the 
officers' lives and that the shooting was justified. The homeless man "still 
had the knife," said Maj. Robert Hines of the U.S. Park Police. "He was still 
looking at them. He might have been trying to figure out which one to knife." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shots were fired, Corniel collapsed on the sidewalk about 10 feet 
from the north gate of the White House. He was taken to George Washington 
University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Police characterized the incident as routine urban violence but acknowledged 
that the string of shootings, along with the crash of a small airplane into the 
White House in September, produce the kind of attention that could generate 
copycat incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a contagion theory about these things," said Eric Harnischfeger, 
Secret Service spokesman. "They can draw in other unbalanced individuals. 
That's why we don't want to talk about it too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel was receiving disability payments after being burned over 80% of his 
body, according to police in Anaheim, his last known California address. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Torrance Memorial Medical Center said that the hospital 
treated a man with the same name and birth date after he suffered burns over 
75% to 80% of his body in a 1992 Carson car fire. He was an in-patient from 
Aug. 12 to Dec. 23, 1992, said spokeswoman Laurie Lundberg, and came back to 
the hospital for reconstructive surgery throughout 1993. He was treated the 
last time in May, 1994, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel, a former press operator in Pasadena, had been listed as a missing 
person in August by a sister in Anaheim after he failed to show up for 
scheduled surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The sister "was concerned about his health," said Lt. Vince Howard of the 
Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeless people in Lafayette Park described Corniel as a usually gentle 
man who had been living in the park for several months intermittently. One side 
of his face bore extensive scars from the burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeless people said that he seemed physically as well as mentally ill 
at times. He had drifted away from the park a few months ago after complaining 
of police harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bystanders and callers to TV talk shows complained that officers 
overreacted. Hines said Washington police would independently investigate, with 
the officers involved routinely placed on administrative duty, Newsday 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Police, the Secret Service and District of Columbia police have all 
stepped up security in recent weeks because of the incidents at the White 
House, which appear to have no connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Saturday, an unexplained burst of gunfire left three bullets on the 
south side of the White House and one in the building itself. Police aren't 
sure precisely where those shots were fired from, or why, and have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 A gunman sprayed the White House with 29 rounds from a semiautomatic weapon on 
Oct. 29. Francisco Martin Duran of Colorado has been charged with multiple 
crimes, including attempted assassination of the President, in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a Maryland man, Frank Corder, died when he crashed his small 
plane on the White House grounds Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Vance, a former Secret Service agent, said that the string of incidents 
clearly suggests a heightened security risk at the White House. "The White 
House has always attracted the mentally ill. Only now travel is easier, weapons 
are out there everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 While the authorities did not want to discuss specific security measures, 
Vance said that in these circumstances the Secret Service should consider 
temporarily altering patterns, such as Clinton's morning jog on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Corniel's possessions -- a dirty sleeping bag, a blanket, backpack, yellow 
raincoat, a red magic marker and other belongings -- were removed by Park 
Police as bystanders looked on.

TWO SUPERVISORS RETIRE AMID TALK OF COUNTY LAYOFFS; CRISIS: AT THEIR LAST 
REGULAR BOARD MEETING, RILEY AND WIEDER EXPRESS REMORSE OVER INVESTMENT LOSSES. 
JOB CUTS COULD AFFECT SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS AS SOON AS NEXT MONTH. 
</P>

<P>
 As Orange County officials predicted layoffs as soon as next month, retiring 
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder expressed remorse Tuesday 
over the financial crisis that has pushed the county into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about you, but I wish I had listened just a bit more, questioned 
just a bit more, and trusted just a bit less," said Riley, 82, a former Marine 
general and 20-year board veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tragic, unfortunate and awful to have my county going through this 
ordeal as I leave office," said the 74-year-old Wieder, who had been on the 
board for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Riley and Wieder attending their final regular board meeting, an angry 
group of residents demanded that supervisors cut their pay in the wake of the 
county's $2.02-billion investment loss. They also called for the elimination of 
perks -- such as the board's county-provided cars -- and a reduction in county 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you are bad people or crooked, but just basically decent folks 
seduced by the power of spending other people's money," said Bill Ward, an 
electronics consultant from Costa Mesa. "You have become severely out of touch 
with working taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The crisis will "definitely" result in layoffs, one high-ranking county 
official said -- a prediction echoed by other managers. Among those departments 
expected to be hardest hit by an estimated $10-million-a-month budget shortfall 
are the offices of the county administrator, auditor-controller and county 
counsel, along with the Probation Department and the General Services Agency. 
Officials could not estimate how many county workers might lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed Ernie Schneider, the 
county's top administrative officer, seeking a broad range of documents that 
relate to his dealings with Merrill Lynch, the leading underwriter of Orange 
County bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency has previously sought personal documents from all five 
supervisors, former treasurer and tax collector Robert L. Citron, acting 
treasurer Matthew Raabe and several Merrill Lynch brokers who did business with 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * SEC and Orange County district attorney's office investigators worked side 
by side in the treasurer-tax collector's office, copying documents on microfilm 
as they seek to determine whether anyone broke the law. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Auditor Kurt Sjoberg said he would expand his review of Citron's books 
to include all contracts with outside investment brokers and the fees each 
earned. The auditor's team also will investigate whether the county skirted 
competitive bidding procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sjoberg said he was asked by state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) to 
focus on the county's dealings with Merrill Lynch, which has denied any 
impropriety. The results may be turned over to the state attorney general's 
office if Citron is found to have violated government codes in his dealings 
with brokers, Sjoberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 * In good news for Orange County, the Federal Reserve did not raise interest 
rates after the year's final meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee. 
Another increase in interest rates would have further devalued the county's 
beleaguered investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 * A coalition of local government finance groups convened by the U.S. Treasury 
Department pledged "to work together to promote sound investment policies and 
practices by state and local governments." The group said it will promote the 
use of model investment guidelines and identify possible regulatory or 
oversight issues that require government attention. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ripples from the Orange County debacle continued to be felt as far away as 
Texas, where state officials said they spent $55 million averting a crash of 
their own municipal investment fund, known as TexPool. State Treasurer Martha 
Whitehead said a $2-billion run on the pool by panicky municipalities -- which 
cut its size to $1.47 billion -- seemed to have ended. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) called for a Fair Political Practices 
Commission investigation of Citron. In a letter to FPPC Chairman Ben Davidian, 
Conroy suggested that the former treasurer may have violated the state 
Political Reform Act by accepting gifts from firms that do business with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County began auctioning off the riskier portion of its remaining 
portfolio. Salomon Bros. sold about $1.24 billion of notes and foreign-issued 
certificates of deposit, but the firm declined to say how much the sales netted 
the county. Investment sources said as much as $624 million of the proceeds 
will be used to pay off loans held by Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last securities purchased by the county's investment pool, a 
$600-million fixed-rate note issued by the Student Loan Marketing Assn., was 
among the instruments sold Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron bought the entire Sallie Mae issue Nov. 1. Financial analysts say the 
county almost certainly took a sizable loss on the sale, as it purchased the 
notes for $3.8 million more than their face value and they were most recently 
quoted for sale at 95 cents on the dollar. At that price, the county would 
realize close to a $34-million loss on those notes alone. 
</P>
<P>
 However, traders said the county would benefit in one important way from the 
sale: Because the notes do not mature for 10 years, the sale will cut the 
average maturity of the county portfolio. A shorter average maturity will 
reduce the investment pool's exposure to movements in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sold Tuesday were $24 million in notes issued by the Government National 
Mortgage Assn. and $580 million in certificates of deposit issued by a number 
of foreign banks. The foreign CDs were likely to have been sold at the deepest 
discount, investment sources said, as they were structured notes whose payouts 
decline as interest rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county's new investment consultant, Salomon Bros. is expected to 
collect more than $1 million in fees, along with commissions and a percentage 
of the now-bankrupt investment pool; in all, the firm could be paid more than 
$5 million, according to county records. The county has paid the Wall Street 
firm $500,000, and Salomon will receive $150,000 a month for at least six 
months to continue assisting county officials, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 As the auction of the portfolio continued, the Board of Supervisors faced its 
most vocal and bitter crowd since the county filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen speakers berated supervisors, accusing them of failing to 
exercise oversight and leadership in the crisis, which has jeopardized the 
investments of 187 cities, school districts and other public agencies, along 
with 435 minors whose court settlements were deposited in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "To point out to the public that you feel you lack the expertise to understand 
complex financial transactions does not excuse past performance nor reassure 
the public that you are capable of dealing with the current crisis," said 
Connie Haddad, president of the League of Women Voters of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a countywide taxpayer group known as the Committees of 
Correspondence warned that the group might try to oust the officials if they do 
not show good faith in meeting the demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are giving them the demands. If they want to cooperate, fine," said Bill 
Mello, a Huntington Beach activist. "If they don't want to cooperate, they are 
in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The Committees of Correspondence, which include members of Ross Perot's United 
We Stand group, issued a list of seven demands to the board and asked each 
supervisor to pledge by Jan. 4 to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands include: a 10% reduction in the salaries of supervisors, the chief 
administrative officer and the county auditor; elimination of car allowances; 
cutting board staff expenses by half; contracting county services to private 
entities, and signing a pledge not to accept federal or state assistance or 
raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are responsible for this," Mello said. "They should share in the 
suffering along with everyone else. . . . If this had happened in the private 
sector, they'd all be fired immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the supervisors signed the pledge when given copies at Tuesday's 
meeting. Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he was examining "the contents of the 
proposal." Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said, "I'm serving my constituents," not 
outside interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the downtown Civic Center concourse about three dozen investigators 
continued poring over documents at the treasurer's office, with a now-familiar 
orange van parked outside the building behind yellow crime-scene tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the district attorney's office are seizing documents from 
the treasurer's and auditor's offices that involve any disclosures made to 
investors in the county investment pool. They also are gathering documents on 
specific dealings between the treasurer's office and investment bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wiechert, Citron's attorney, said he remained baffled about why 
investigators would seek a search warrant for the records of the former 
treasurer, who cleared out of his office when he resigned two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC, which last week subpoenaed personal and office documents from top 
county officials, is taking a broader look at whether elected officials steered 
business to Merrill Lynch in exchange for kickbacks. County officials and 
Merrill Lynch strongly dispute the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron is scheduled to testify before the SEC on Jan. 20 in Los Angeles. 
Raabe, who took office after Citron resigned, is to testify Jan. 19, according 
to sources close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the search of county offices continued for a second day, employees 
described an office in a virtual state of paralysis, with authorities carting 
away computers and boxes of records. 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's officials have said they wanted to carry out the searches 
without hampering normal county operations and would leave copies of all 
documents that employees need for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Luster said thousands of pages of records were seized, with no copies 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Several city officials said Tuesday that they had been interviewed last week 
by investigators from the district attorney's office who questioned them about 
whether Citron's staff had misrepresented the risks of investing in the county 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, which invested $48.6 million in the pool, investigators 
"generally wanted to know how the county represented the fund to us," said 
deputy city administrator Richard Barnard.

COUNTY HIRES HIGH-FEE HELP TO STRAIGHTEN OUT FINANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY and ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County, already out more than $2 billion in investment losses, is 
spending millions more to hire experts to straighten out its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. alone will receive more than $1.4 million in fees, according to 
county records, plus commissions and a percentage of the county's investment 
pool, which the investment bank is liquidating. And it is only one of more than 
a dozen firms involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a regrettable fact of life that the county can't hope to extricate 
itself without the assistance of outside help," County Counsel Terry C. Andrus 
told the Board of Supervisors at its regular meeting Tuesday. "There is no way 
we can predict how much this is going to cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Salomon Bros., other well-known firms now advising the county are 
accountants Arthur Andersen & Co. and the Los Angeles law firm of Stutman, 
Treister & Glatt, which has several attorneys working full time on the 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also have hired public relations specialists and have 
agreements with more than a dozen other law firms, some to defend the county 
against a spate of lawsuits being filed by bondholders and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the law firms is one representing acting Treasurer Matthew Raabe. County 
officials said they also expect to approve payment of legal fees for former 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett Wieder said Tuesday that the county had no choice but to 
bring in help from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are our alternatives? If we were not bringing in the top experts to deal 
with this, we would be criticized," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board hired Salomon Bros., she said, "on the advice of our legal counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros.' agreement with the county shows that the Wall Street giant 
received an immediate payment of $500,000 last week and will be paid $150,000 a 
month for at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is also receiving commissions on sales of securities from the 
county's portfolio and will bill the county for other "customary fees," 
according to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the investment bank will receive a fee for managing the county's 
assets. That fee, according to the agreement, is 0.1% of the market value of 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those attending Tuesday's meeting said that what Salomon is being paid 
is exorbitant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the rich New York company that comes into Orange County like a 
vulture, preying on all our misfortune," said Dolores Otting, a Newport Beach 
resident whose family-run trash-collection business has contracts with several 
county school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe that they're getting a commission on the liquidation of the 
fund. I know they are trying to do the best job they can do, but I think we 
need to get a handle on how much this is costing," Otting said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the magnitude of the county's problem, Salomon's fees are "high but not 
outrageous," said the principal of a Bay Area money-management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge portfolio," said the money manager, who asked not to be 
identified. "There are only a few firms that are capable of carrying any pool 
of that size." 
</P>
<P>
 Payments to other experts are costing the county less upfront but will amount 
to hefty bills eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Bruce Bennett, the attorney who helped the county prepare its 
Dec. 6 bankruptcy filing and has been working full time on the case ever since, 
is paid $375 an hour. And several partners for his firm, Stutman, Treister & 
Glatt in Los Angeles, will earn $435 an hour for their work, according to the 
firm's agreement with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the supervisors also voted to hire the Los Angeles law firm of 
Howrey & Simon to handle lawsuits stemming from the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm will bill the county between $178 and $395 an hour for each of its 
eleven attorneys, according to the firm's engagement letter to the county. The 
letter also sets out costs for economists and accounting specialists, some of 
whom are to be paid as much as $200 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounting firm Arthur Andersen, under the guidance of Thomas E. Daxon, is 
billing the county between $75 and $350 an hour for its staff, according to a 
letter from the company to supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Sitrick Krantz & Co., a public relations company, typically 
charges between $150 to $300 an hour, said Sandra Sternberg, a Sitrick Krantz 
senior vice president who is now the county's spokeswoman. The rate the firm 
will charge Orange County has not yet been set, she said, nor does the firm 
know how many hours it will bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee to be paid to former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, hired to be the 
county's financial adviser after the bankruptcy filing, has not yet been made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chapter 9 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, professional fees are included 
in a plan of adjustment submitted to the court and must eventually be approved 
by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Beckett, the county's risk manager, said Tuesday there is no way to 
estimate what the county's total bill will be for legal and other professional 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on how many people try to sue us," he said. "Nothing's normal. 
It's not the kind of thing any of us anticipated."

CLINTON SEEKS LARGER AID PROGRAM TO INCLUDE L.A.; GRANTS: CITY IS LEFT OFF LIST 
OF 'EMPOWERMENT ZONE' RECIPIENTS. VALLEY HAD REQUESTED $700,000 FOR SIX 
PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with California officials' anger over the Administration's decision to 
exclude Los Angeles from the urban "empowerment zone" program, President 
Clinton will ask Congress today to enlarge the lucrative new anti-poverty 
initiative to include Los Angeles and another city, senior Administration 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledged Tuesday that Los Angeles will not be among the six 
cities to receive the multimillion-dollar package of federal grants and tax 
breaks aimed at redeveloping depressed urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the city's 1992 riots helped spawn the new urban renewal effort, it was 
widely presumed Los Angeles would be at the head of the line when packages of 
grants and business tax breaks worth hundreds of millions of dollars were doled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an embarrassing blow, Los Angeles finished out of the running this week 
in the intense competition for so-called empowerment zones after other cities, 
which federal officials said drafted far clearer and financially richer 
blueprints to breathe new life into troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consolation prize, Los Angeles had been offered a package of other 
assistance, and on Monday night, Clinton decided to ask Congress to create two 
more empowerment zones at a cost of $500 million -- enough to include Los 
Angeles and Cleveland, the last two cities dropped from the list, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources said that the six cities to be officially designated as 
empowerment zones today will be New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Atlanta, Detroit 
and the combined urban center of Camden, N.J., and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, more than $700,000 was sought for six projects 
within a 1.8-square-mile empowerment zone including Pacoima and part of Lake 
View Terrace. Proponents, including City Councilman Richard Alarcon, said they 
would simply seek other sources of funding for the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 It is far from certain that the new Republican Congress, which is seeking 
massive cuts in social programs, will agree to expand the program, already 
scheduled to cost more than $3.5 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration and California officials expressed guarded optimism Monday 
that Republicans would support the addition of Los Angeles and Cleveland 
because the funds would be used to provide tax credits to businesses that hire 
workers in depressed urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The promise of tax benefits is much better than nothing and we will do 
whatever we have to do to get them passed," said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif). 
"It's going to be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 California Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), who will chair an appropriations 
subcommittee overseeing urban development programs, was even more cautious: 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say that tax incentives that create jobs would probably have a pretty 
positive reaction. But sometimes a special additive to a tax package makes the 
other folks (who aren't in line to get it) wonder about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has spoken for weeks of expanding the empowerment zone program and 
officials portrayed his decision to seek the legislation as reflecting his 
belief that all eight of the top finishers deserved inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in California and elsewhere saw the promise to seek additional 
benefits as an effort to control the political damage to the Administration in 
a state indispensable to Clinton's hopes for reelection in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political people (in the Administration) are frightened," said one 
ranking Los Angeles city official. "They see this as a problem, that there is 
going to be a backlash. Even if in reality the package is going to be fairly 
beneficial there is a sense (from the decision to exclude Los Angeles) that 
there is a lack of full confidence in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Boxer said Tuesday night that the decision to pass over Los Angeles 
for the program had generated an "outpouring of emotion, anger and outrage." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of White House sensitivity over the program -- which generated a 
frenzy of lobbying from cities around the country -- Clinton is expected at a 
news conference today to label 12 cities as empowerment zones. But the statute 
only allows the Administration to designate six cities to receive the full 
range of benefits from the program, which includes $100 million each for social 
services, and tax incentives worth about $277 million over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The other six cities will receive grants from another pot of money that the 
Administration has established as an alternative source of assistance to cities 
denied inclusion in the empowerment zone project. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles will receive by far the most funds in that group: a grant of $125 
million and $300 million in federal loan guarantees that the city has indicated 
it intends to use to capitalize a community development bank. That bank, 
modeled in part on the South Shore Development Bank in Chicago, would make 
loans to support housing and commercial development in depressed areas of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities on the list to receive funds from this consolation pool of money 
include Cleveland, Oakland, Boston, Houston and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing these funds, sources said, Clinton decided at a 
meeting Monday night in the Cabinet room to ask Congress to make Los Angeles 
and Cleveland full participants in the program. That would mean allocating 
another $500 million so that both cities also could offer the tax credits now 
available only to the six cities formally designated as empowerment zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the fiscal constraints, ideological differences may complicate the 
progress of that proposal in Congress. While Republicans such as former Housing 
and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp initially pushed the empowerment zone 
idea, many conservatives have opposed the Administration's version. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans dislike the large social spending grants included in Clinton's 
program and the structure of its tax breaks. While the Clinton program provides 
tax credits to employers to offset 20% of the cost of hiring new employees, 
Republicans prefer to offer capital gains reductions to entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Mary Leslie, Mayor Richard Riordan's adviser on 
economic development issues, was cautiously optimistic about Tuesday's 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a competitive application, and we were disheartened that we were not 
(initially) given full zone status. However, if the Clinton Administration 
aggressively supports an extension of wage and tax credits to Los Angeles we 
would support that effort," Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the extension of empowerment zone status to Los Angeles would require 
congressional approval, and "there is uncertainty whether a 
Republican-controlled Congress would do that," Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others familiar with Los Angeles' application focused on what had gone amiss 
in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of glaring weaknesses and leadership fumbling apparently hurt the bid 
when measured against other cities', interviews indicate. "There's no way in a 
comparative reading (of Los Angeles' bid) that it comes off favorably . . . no 
way to get (a sense) that this street corner or this neighborhood will look any 
different," said a Clinton Administration official familiar with the selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contended that Los Angeles' bid was delayed and hobbled by one of City 
Hall's chronic ailments -- the difficulty of arriving at a consensus on 
disbursing funds over a vast and diverse political landscape. It took months 
just to decide where the new zone -- covering parts of Pacoima, South-Central 
Los Angeles and the Eastside -- would be located and the funds would be 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 "For months, the dispute was over boundaries," said Michelle Banks, an aide to 
Councilwoman Rita Walters who worked with Mayor Richard Riordan's office on the 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said we needed to address the application as a whole . . . but it was so 
hard to get the boundary issues settled. Everyone wanted their community to 
benefit from the tax credits and social service programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer acknowledged that was a tough, time-consuming 
hurdle. "It was like putting together a puzzle with an abundance of need," she 
said. "We had 1.1 million residents and more than 170 square miles that were 
eligible, but we had to limit it to 200,000 residents and 20 square miles. So 
how do you achieve a consensus about what areas are going to be in the zone? It 
was very difficult work." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Washington who were evaluating the bids took note of the delays 
and political tug of wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the last major city to decide on the boundaries," said a Clinton 
Administration official. "You have to do that before (you) can figure out 
anything else. . . . Other cities had no problem deciding (and) getting people 
behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a first of a series of warnings of trouble ahead for Los Angeles, Housing 
and Urban Development Assistant Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo cautioned state 
officials June 20, 10 days before the application was due, that questions about 
the state's role were hampering the city's chances. At issue was a 5% 
administrative fee the state was planning to charge to process the funding 
under the empowerment zone program. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, unlike other states such as New York, which was offering a $100-million 
matching grant for New York City's empowerment zone bid, California was 
offering no money of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo said that various states and cities were making "difficult choices about 
where to find the funds necessary to make their applications as competitive as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlene Meeks, the state official who was coordinating the applications from 
Sacramento, said the state offered no matching money for Los Angeles or other 
cities because it had none to give.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; A RESOUNDING SEND-OFF; PUBLIC LINES UP FOR PARTING 
SHOTS AT RETIRING RILEY AND WIEDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retired Marine Corps Gen. Thomas F. Riley has no doubt seen pomp and elegant 
send-offs, but there would be none of that Tuesday as he ended two decades on 
the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 No medals, no gushy plaque exchange, no honor guard -- not a Boy Scout in 
sight. Just a guy berating him in an orange mini-skirt with a boombox, 
threatening to play a song meant to disparage the supervisor's manhood. 
</P>
<P>
 At least fellow retiring Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder had the composure to 
throw back her head and laugh, but it was hardly the dignified "swan song" she 
would have wished for as the pair ended their service in public office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my penance," Riley said dryly to the skirted man who called himself 
Will B. King. "Out! Out! Out!" 
</P>
<P>
 A citizenry not often present for the weekday drone that is 
government-in-action turned out at the chambers Tuesday morning, and the end 
result was, at times, carnival-like. 
</P>
<P>
 Just inside the tall, white building on Civic Center Drive, a homeless woman 
in violet sweats stood beside her trash bag of belongings and remained there 
for the duration. Sipping coffee machine cappuccinos outside the boardroom, she 
had a ringside seat as all the suits and TV cameras whizzed by to convene on 
the matter of Orange County being in the poorhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that Orange County two weeks ago filed the largest municipal bankruptcy 
case in U.S. history during his watch, Board Chairman Riley seemed strangely 
surprised at the depth of wrath as people lined up waiting for hours to vent. 
</P>
<P>
 And vent they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Perot followers from his United We Stand organization filled parts of the 
chamber. In an overflow room, a mother and daughter, the latter in a little fur 
coat, unfurled red banners reading Coalition for Accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point the skirted man offered Christmas gifts to the five supervisors, 
"some cold-weather gear in case you become homeless, and you should . . . . 
This should keep you warm." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley pointed out that, as public officials, the supervisors were not allowed 
to accept gifts. This elicited a low rumble of murmurs and snorts in corners of 
the room, perhaps in light of the ongoing investigation into whether the 
supervisors or resigned Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron accepted any 
special favors in return for investing billions via several brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 All that before the general public comments were even launched at 12:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 With Supervisors Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez trying to make the best of a 
tedious situation by throwing in some ad-libs, the meeting's tone grew into 
tense absurdity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in the 'fabulous 5th District' and . . . I'm sorry you have to leave 
under these circumstances. Sincerely," Dolores Otting told Riley, using his own 
trademark description of his political turf. 
</P>
<P>
 But her overriding sentiment was disgust that the supervisors could allow 
millions in public funds to be lost and that "these meetings have come to 
this," meaning the parade of epithets and the antics of skirt man. 
</P>
<P>
 Otting, a waste hauler for several school districts, also sarcastically 
thanked Wieder "for ignoring me" the many times she approached the Board of 
Supervisors, saying it gave her the conviction to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolteachers on holiday break, county employees who'd taken time off to 
appear, the head of the county branch of the League of Women Voters and, of 
course, the skirt man, who complained that the bad press about last week's 
appearance before the board had cramped his chances at a political career. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder took her swats at the press as well, saying the local newspapers were 
the only "blight" on her tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't all supervisor bashing, though. 
</P>
<P>
 A female consultant complimented Wieder for surviving countless political 
crises. All the while, she said, "you've never lost your femininity." 
</P>
<P>
 A voice of levity from the audience came from James Stoddard, who offered to 
repair county typewriters for free and intoned: "You may have to live with 
less, like I do. . . . Live within your means." 
</P>
<P>
 Some spectators who crowded into overflow chambers of the downtown Santa Ana 
boardroom questioned whether you could say leadership was transferred Tuesday. 
But Riley did pass the gavel on to Vasquez as the new board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 By then the gallery was draining, and nobody seemed to much care. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, after playing his boombox outside for a sheriff's deputy, 
skirt man tugged up his ensemble and headed off to the parking lot. "Excuse me, 
ma'am, do you have a dollar so I can catch the bus back to Newport? Some spare 
change?"

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; RILEY AND WIEDER GO WITH HEADS HELD HIGH; 
SUPERVISORS: RETIRING MEMBERS EXPRESS PRIDE IN JOB, SAY THEIR ONLY REGRET IS 
LEAVING BOARD ON LOW NOTE.

<P>
 They didn't want it to end like this. 
</P>
<P>
 After 36 years of county service between them, Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. 
Wieder were supposed to be lauded for their lengthy list of accomplishments 
upon their retirement. But instead of a Marine marching band at the pair's 
final Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday, they were often greeted by catcalls 
from some angry members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 And the supervisors' heartfelt remarks from the dais were upstaged by 
emotional queries from schoolteachers, county employees and taxpayers about the 
futures of their families amid the loss of $2.02 billion from a collapsed 
county investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, the board chairman during the crisis, chose the words of Abraham 
Lincoln for his final speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this 
parting," said Riley, 82, a popular retired Marine brigadier general whose 
legacy includes a terminal at John Wayne Airport and a wilderness park named 
after him in his "fabulous 5th District," a mostly coastal area stretching 
south from Newport Beach to the county line and inland to Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, 74, the only woman supervisor in the 106-year history of the county, 
called public service "an honorable pursuit and the best opportunity to make a 
difference." She has a county park in Huntington Beach and an auditorium in 
Rossmoor bearing her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the past few weeks that have seen county, state and federal 
investigators poring through county financial documents, Wieder said she is 
proud of her accomplishments in her 2nd District, which spreads along the 
county's north coast and inland to Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good," Wieder said after the meeting. "The only thing that was not 
pleasant was the environment in which I'm ending my career. It's tragic that I 
won't be around to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Their closing remarks did draw applause at the end of a tumultuous five-hour 
session that included a parade of speakers to the podium, some of whom 
lambasted the entire board for the financial crisis that has descended on the 
county during their watch. Once again there were calls for resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you still here?" asked Alan Remington of Costa Mesa, who accused the 
board of betraying the public trust. "You should all resign, without benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 But Riley and Wieder also had their supporters, including Arturo Montez, a 
Latino activist who said, "We have not agreed on a lot of things, but we have 
had frank talks -- upfront." 
</P>
<P>
 Developer George Argyros singled both of them out for praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harriett . . . you have served the county a long, long time and have been 
very constructive," he said. "Tom, you have been a real stalwart. It's 
unfortunate you are leaving under these circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Both took office in the 1970s when growth and development were the two issues 
that would dominate the county's agendas for two decades. Riley was appointed 
to the board in 1974 by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, a fact he noted in his final 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan had warned public servants to "trust, but verify," Riley recalled, 
acknowledging that in light of the financial crisis, he should have questioned 
more and trusted less. 
</P>
<P>
 A Marine officer who once served as chief of staff at Camp Pendleton, Riley 
stepped into the 5th District seat and oversaw the incorporation of five cities 
in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were heated, contentious times that ultimately led to a failed recall 
attempt in 1988. But despite it all, Riley was never seriously challenged at 
the polls. The gray-haired Irishman's declining health was what led to his 
stepping down and his own handpicked candidate, former state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson, will now succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only through the development of South County that the preservation of 
Laguna Canyon could be won and open space such as the Ronald W. Caspers 
Wilderness Park and Thomas F. Riley Wilderness Park could be saved, Riley told 
his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pulled together to develop strong plans that took development out of 
pristine open space," Riley said in his closing remarks. "(The parks) will 
preserve Orange County's past for Orange County's future." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, such as Norm Grossman, a Laguna Beach activist and opponent of 
the county toll roads, will always say that Riley was too friendly to 
developers and that too much growth was allowed during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anyone driving through the South County can see it," Grossman said. 
"Growth was allowed to outpace the infrastructure." But he also quickly added 
that both Riley and Wieder are "honorable people." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the tone that Bishop Michael P. Driscoll set as he began Tuesday's 
meeting with an invocation. He called Riley "a man of principle, a man who 
loves his God, a man who loves his people." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, a former mayor of Huntington Beach who began her political career as 
an executive assistant to then-Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, said the economy, 
the environment and social issues "are the cornerstone of everything I've tried 
to do" during her 16-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Her credits include raising public awareness on myriad issues, including 
health care and gang violence where her inspiration, she said, "came from the 
commitment of the citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 She has worked steadfastly for cancer victims, for the business community 
through Partnership 2010 and for women on the Commission on the Status of 
Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "She should be remembered not for what's going on now, but for all the great 
things she did, especially for children's protection and women's issues," said 
Orange County Municipal Court Judge Pamela L. Iles, who was in the audience 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder also established the county's office of protocol 11 years ago that has 
helped promote Orange County "from being just a whistle stop between Los 
Angeles and San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, who will be succeeded by Huntington Beach Councilman Jim Silva, said 
she does not feel responsible for the financial crash because the Board of 
Supervisors was not kept informed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This board was in no position to have changed anything. . . . We didn't have 
an opportunity to know anything different," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And now "all the things are off my wall, I'm moving on," Wieder said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 RILEY AND WIEDER: Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder expressed 
remorse over the financial crisis in their final board meeting before retiring. 
Riley, 82, a former Marine general, is a 20-year board veteran.Wieder has been 
on the board for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 ANGRY CITIZENS: More than a dozen speakers criticized supervisors for lack of 
oversight and leadership. The supervisors, who have been meeting often in 
closed session, faced their most vocal and bitter crowd since the county 
declared bankruptcy Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 AUCTION ROLLS ON: The county kept auctioning off its investment portfolio. 
Salomon Bros. sold $1.24 billion of notes and foreign-issued certificates of 
deposit; perhaps half the proceeds will pay off loans made by Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 SCHNEIDER SUBPOENAED: The county's top administrative officer, Ernie 
Schneider, was subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for 
documents relating to his dealings with the leading underwriter of Orange 
County bond issues. He joins other county officials, including all five 
supervisors, who have received subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
 THE COST OF RECOVERY: Getting out of the fiscal fiasco will cost a bundle. The 
county has already paid Salomon Bros. $500,000, and the firm will receive 
$150,000 a month for at least another six months. The Wall Street firm is 
expected to collect more than $1 million in fees, plus commissions and a 
percentage of the now-bankrupt investment pool that could exceed $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD NEWS: The Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates at a scheduled 
meeting. Another hike in interest rates would have further devalued the 
county's battered investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 THE DOCUMENT HUNT: Investigators continued poring over documents at the 
treasurer's office. SEC and Orange County district attorney's investigators 
copied documents on microfilm as they seek to determine whether anyone broke 
the law.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SCHNEIDER CAUGHT UP IN MIDDLE OF A MAELSTROM; 
PROFILE: COUNTY'S CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR WAS INVOLVED IN OVERSIGHT OF FUND. HE'S 
BEEN CONSUMED BY CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ernie Schneider was on county government's fast track. At 37, he became the 
chief executive assistant for then-County Supervisor Bruce Nestande. At 39, 
Schneider leapfrogged over four older rivals to become head of the 
Environmental Management Agency, the county's planning department and largest, 
most powerful bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 At 42, the Board of Supervisors tapped the tireless West German immigrant to 
become the county's administrative officer, one of the highest-paid government 
positions in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 47, Schneider now finds himself surrounded by an enormous fiscal 
calamity that threatens the economic well-being of 187 governmental entities, 
including the one he has worked for almost 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, more fallout from the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy 
reached Schneider's office, when the federal Securities and Exchange Commission 
subpoenaed him seeking a broad range of documents related to his possible 
dealings with bond brokerages, including Merrill Lynch, the county's top 
underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 What the SEC and other watchdog agencies find in their broadening 
investigation of the county's financial collapse could determine the future of 
one of the area's more respected and knowledgeable government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schneider has incredible attention to duty and an enormous energy level. But 
I think he is dying a little bit every day because he is so conscientious," 
said County Supervisor William G. Steiner. "I would hate to see Ernie Schneider 
become a scapegoat for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Schneider has been in the middle of the situation from the start. He sat 
on the county's investment oversight committee when County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron was pursuing what turned out to be a disastrous 
investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's office received a copy of an internal audit by Auditor-Controller 
Steven E. Lewis released in August, 1993, that assessed Citron's performance as 
treasurer in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis concluded that Citron was bending the law to maximize returns from his 
investments, making risky financial deals and refusing to consult the committee 
that Schneider sat on. The audit also was distributed to the Board of 
Supervisors and the district attorney. Nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The county administrative office as well as several department heads share 
responsibility for placing items that the Board of Supervisors considers on its 
consent calendar, which is usually reserved for routine items that are all 
approved by a single vote. Some of Citron's now-controversial bond issues that 
involved hundreds of millions of dollars appeared on the consent calendar and 
were passed by the board without debate or even a question. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the county's agenda rules, contracts exceeding $500,000 in value 
should be placed on the board's discussion calendar, where there is potential 
for more consideration and debate. Though the CAO's office is required to 
enforce the agenda rules, Citron has the power to place items on the consent 
calendar without the office's review. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the utmost admiration for Ernie Schneider," said Shirley Grindle, a 
longtime government activist who authored a series of county campaign finance 
reforms. "But I don't think he is going to come out of this clean if he knew 
about that audit. He could come in for some severe criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider declined to comment Tuesday except to say that the SEC action was a 
routine request for documents. He has said during the crisis that the oversight 
committee had no power to force Citron to do anything. Sharing duties with 
Schneider on the panel were Citron and Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the CAO nor the Board of Supervisors can be held responsible for what 
another public official elected countywide has done, Schneider has said. 
"Responsibility for managing the pool lies with a separately elected official, 
and that was Bob Citron." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, however, was one of the first people in county government to 
seriously heed warnings about the investment pool after Raabe confronted him in 
early November and threatened to quit. County sources said Schneider then 
formed a management team to review the status of the $20-billion portfolio. By 
then it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fund collapsed more than two weeks ago, Schneider has been consumed 
by the crisis. Long known as a workhorse, he has been putting in even longer 
days figuring out how to keep the county government in operation, and helping 
to make hard decisions about potential cuts in personnel, and county services 
and capital improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider also has briefed the cities, utility districts, and schools that 
rely on funds from the investment portfolio to meet their financial 
obligations. And it was the county administrative officer who personally met 
with Citron at his Santa Ana home on Dec. 4, hand-delivering the resignation 
letter that Citron signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how he is still walking," Supervisor Steiner said. "Everyone else 
on his staff has had some time to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider has a reputation for self-confidence, assertiveness and a 
willingness to accept responsibility, once saying upon his appointment to the 
Environmental Management Agency that "the buck stopped at my desk in this 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Known as a consensus builder with an extensive knowledge of Orange County 
government, he has been praised repeatedly for his management style and the 
treatment of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In his leisure time, Schneider surfs, lifts weights and runs in marathons. A 
favorite lunchtime haunt -- before it closed -- was the Santa Ana YMCA, not far 
from the county administration building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had nothing but positive dealings with him," said Costa Mesa City 
Manager Allan L. Roeder. "He has been upfront and direct with me. That's not to 
say that he tells me what I always want to hear. But I found him to be credible 
in what he tells me." 
</P>
<P>
 Roeder said he does not know whether Schneider committed any wrongdoing or 
ethical breaches related to the investment pool. But he said he and other city 
leaders have been disappointed lately by the total lack of information coming 
out of the county about the fiscal crisis. He added, however, that the 
situation might not be Schneider's fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, a former Marine Corps brigadier general who is 
retiring after 20 years on the board, described Schneider as "loyal, 
trustworthy and courageous" -- words right out of the Boy Scout creed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be disappointed if this challenges his ability to remain as CAO," 
Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who has been critical of Schneider in the past, 
declined to comment Tuesday. Stanton recently moved to take some of the 
responsibility for handling the crisis away from the county administrative 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanton's request, the Board of Supervisors went along with his idea to set 
up a management committee to review proposed budget cuts. On the panel are new 
Supervisors Chairman Gaddi H. Vasquez, Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi and Thomas E. Uram, head of the county Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not Schneider ends up shouldering any of the blame, the job he 
holds could be redefined and his office subject to restructuring. Steiner said 
the board might give the position the same responsibilities as a corporate 
chief executive officer, giving him greater authority over county departments, 
and possibly eliminating some elected positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors has complained in the past that it is difficult to 
oversee and take concrete steps against an elected department head, such as the 
county treasurer, auditor-controller, the tax assessor and the county 
clerk-recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the CAO can't tell the county auditor and county treasurer what to 
do or any elected department head what to do," Steiner said. "If the CAO is 
going to be held to a high level of responsibility, his role has to be 
strengthened." Profile: Ernie Schneider

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CITRON MANAGED SEPARATE POOLS; INVESTORS IN 
'SAFER' FUND WANT THEIR MONEY BEFORE THOSE IN 'COMMINGLED' ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN and JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County treasurer's office records show that Robert L. Citron managed 
two separate funds -- a highly leveraged investment pool and a safer pool 
earning less interest -- but the assets are being liquidated as if there were 
just one fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to treat all of the fund's investors alike has touched a nerve 
among some officials at about a dozen public agencies that specifically 
instructed Citron to put more than $1 billion of their money in less risky 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In many instances, the agencies were forbidden by law from placing their funds 
in the kind of dicey, high-yield bets Citron made. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the question of whether a separate, safer pool existed -- and 
whether its investors deserve to be among the first in line to get their money 
back -- has emerged as a contentious issue amid a storm of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of us are not going to accept that," Jim Kenan, Orange County 
Transportation Authority finance director, said of the decision to treat 
investments in the bond pool and the riskier "commingled pool" equally during 
the bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clearly our understanding that this was a bond fund, no risk. You 
could throw a dart at a board and earn the type of earnings we expected from 
the bond pool," said Kenan, whose agency had $559 million in the bond pool and 
$533 million in the commingled pool as of Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bond fund is a construction fund, a short-term investment, and as a result 
it shouldn't have been subjected to these riskier securities," Kenan said. "We 
expect that to be honored." 
</P>
<P>
 Following a public records request by The Times, county officials on Tuesday 
provided documents indicating that Citron -- who resigned the day before Orange 
County became the largest municipality ever to file for bankruptcy protection 
Dec. 6 -- had at least two distinct funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund No. 683 was the "commingled pool," the larger and more risky of the two, 
with about $6.15 billion as of Nov. 30, according to county records. Fund No. 
690 represented those monies that had been placed into safer securities, the 
so-called "bond pool" which contained about $1.27 billion at the end of last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 A county official who requested anonymity said the code numbers were used to 
track the performance of the various securities in each pool. "The different 
fund numbers were for accounting purposes," the official said. "Each 
transaction was posted to an account." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane M. Eddy, director of public finance for Standard and Poor's rating 
agency, said she had been told by Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe as recently 
as Monday -- and has understood for years -- that the county ran two distinct 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the county had two separate (investment) pools, and 
they were treated separately," said David Wiechert, Citron's attorney. "Anyone 
who received the reports (from the treasurer's office) would see that there 
were two separate funds." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said Tuesday that despite 
internal records showing the two distinct funds, there is no documentation of a 
group of less-risky investments. That, in part, is why investors are being 
treated the same in the liquidation process -- regardless of whether some took 
more risk than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurers in other California counties said Tuesday that they have accounting 
strategies similar to Citron's, keeping separate records internally for their 
bond pool, but not necessarily maintaining separate bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, right now, we have two funds," said Los Angeles County Treasurer 
Larry Monteilh. "At the banking level, they're . . . not going to have detail 
with respect to what's in what account." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Ford, assistant treasurer-tax collector in Sonoma County, called such a 
system "normal practice." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only records on the separation of the pool are here in our office. Nobody 
external could see the difference between the two," Ford said. "Internally, 
there are lots of things that are different, but externally it would look as if 
it's the same fund." 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion over Orange County's "bond pool" stemmed from a meeting last 
Thursday, when Bennett announced at a meeting of investors that all parties 
would be treated the same during the liquidation of the county's assets -- 
regardless of whether the funds were in safer investments. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bennett explained that he had found no evidence of separate accounts, 
some officials mistook him to mean that Citron had pooled all the funds and had 
no way of accounting for whose money was in what type of investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were going nuts," said one official who attended the session. "They 
were hearing for the first time that it was not separated. People holding over 
$1 billion . . . thought they were in very, very safe securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Added a bankruptcy attorney who asked not to be identified: "About a 
half-dozen people nearly lost their lunch when he said that." 
</P>
<P>
 In most instances, the monies in the "bond pool" were there by law: Federal 
tax codes prohibit proceeds from tax-exempt bonds -- such as those sold to 
finance many municipal construction projects -- from being used to earn high 
rates of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proceeds from those tax-exempt bonds earn more than a certain level of 
interest, the excess must be given to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The use of tax-exempt money has to be reported separately. The income from 
that has to be reported separately. And if you make any money on it, you're 
supposed to rebate the difference," said Zane B. Mann, publisher of the 
California Municipal Bond Advisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he has no evidence that Citron violated the tax code, and that 
county officials have more investigating to do before they will be able to 
unravel any discrepancies between the internal and external investment records. 
</P>
<P>
 So while all investors are being treated equally for the first rounds of cash 
disbursements this week, those with money in the "bond pool" may stake a higher 
claim later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still studying. We are still gathering facts," Bennett said. "This is 
something we are going to have to analyze very closely and discuss with a lot 
of players." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenan and several other investors said they will fight any plan that treats 
bond pool and commingled pool investments alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Though county officials believe the overall investment pool has plunged $2.02 
billion in value -- about 27% -- this year, some of the safest securities in 
the portfolio were sold last week for more than 90% of their original price. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're saying there's a 27% loss on this risky pool, if I have to accept 
that, I accept that. But on the bond pool, our loss should not be 27%," Kenan 
said. "It's unacceptable for them to say that 27% of that (bond pool) money is 
no longer there. There's a big difference between a 27% loss on $560 million 
and a 7% loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Another official whose agency put money in the bond pool agreed that "people 
that were told their money was segregated in a safer fund should get it first," 
adding that "they bargained for less risk because they got less interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Short of a vague monthly statement listing the performances of the "bond pool" 
and the "commingled pool," many officials said they received little other 
records from Citron. They received verbal assurances from Citron's office that 
the money would be invested according to the restrictions in the tax codes, and 
assumed he would execute their wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a thing in writing," said Gene Farrell, vice chancellor of 
administrative services at Coast Community College District. "We just knew how 
much interest they were going to pay us." 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials, in hindsight, believe they should have asked for more -- 
particularly after questions were raised about the pool's stability earlier 
this year. But, in part, they were lulled by Citron's longstanding reputation 
as a shrewd and successful money manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we didn't follow up. Yes, we should have," Newport Beach City Manager 
Kevin J. Murphy said. "But I don't know that there was any reason to do 
follow-up until the bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach attorney G. Larry Engel, who represents the interests of the 
city of Santa Barbara, among others, said: "No one expected that after all 
these years that they couldn't rely on the representations of the Orange County 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone assumed his representations were true," Engel said. "Who would have 
ever dreamed that Orange County was going to file Chapter 9? I don't know 
anybody that would have foreseen this disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell said he knew all along there was no separate bank account for the 
safer funds, but that he was satisfied as long as Citron kept track internally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in a squeeze on our $2.6 million anyway till the year 2004," he 
said. "We think they may have this mess sorted out by then." 
</P>

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Pool Tables 
</P>
<P>
 Records show former Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron 
managed funds in at least two different kinds of investment pools--a 
"commingled pool," which contained riskier investments, and a "bond pool," 
which had safer, less leveraged investments. The following 13 public agencies 
had invested the following amounts in the safer of the two pools as of Nov. 30:

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NOTEBOOK; GEOGRAPHY PLAYS A BIG PART IN ONE SCHOOL

 Location, location, location: Officials with the Lowell Joint School District 
are grateful that most of their schools sit across the border from Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The district serves a portion of La Habra, but most campuses are in Whittier 
and other Los Angeles County communities. As a result, the district is required 
by law to invest its money in Los Angeles County's bond pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thanking our guardian angel it worked out that way," said school board 
member Jerry L. Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Enticed several years ago by the high returns earned by the Orange County 
pool, Lowell officials looked at whether the district could put its money in 
the fund. "But we were told that it would be impossible for us because we are 
primarily a L.A. County school district," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 And these days, that suits the district just fine. "We do feel that there but 
for the grace of God go I," added school board member Fred W. Schambeck. 
</P>

 Hitting home: The bond crisis might hit Seal Beach Leisure World residents 
where it hurts: on their phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William J. Doane said the crisis could prevent the City Council 
from its planned reduction of Seal Beach's 11% utility tax, which is one of the 
highest in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in (Leisure World) live for making long-distance phone calls," he 
said. "It's 11 cents for every dollar. People here are on fixed incomes." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Steady kingdom: Disneyland, which is Orange County's largest employer, told 
workers this week that it does not foresee any short-term effects from the 
county's bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 The major ramifications of the bankruptcy filing on Disneyland and the 
Disneyland Hotel, which has a year-round employment base of about 6,000 and a 
summer peak of 12,000, will be delays in making freeway improvements that could 
speed visitors to the park, according to a memo issued by Disney. In 
particular, the memo cites a delay in the release of funds for the Santa Ana 
and Riverside freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 John McClintock, a Disneyland spokesman, said the "special bulletin" memos are 
periodically posted so employees can be kept abreast of important issues that 
could effect the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo does not address prospects for the Disneyland Resort of the future: 
the proposed $3-billion resort that would add a new theme park and hundreds of 
new hotel rooms to the Disneyland site. Walt Disney Co. officials say they are 
watching the situation develop and have disclosed no decisions about their 
plans for the resort. 
</P>

 Local hero: While city leaders across Orange County met in emergency sessions 
over the past two weeks trying to assess the fallout from the financial crisis, 
it was practically business as usual at Garden Grove City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was one of the few in the county that didn't invest in the pool. 
Garden Grove officials said they were uncomfortable with the county's high-risk 
investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, the City Council moved to commemorate its good fortune by 
honoring Anthony Andrade, the city controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade received the Community Spotlight award. The certificate that goes with 
the award lauded Andrade "for demonstrating excellent financial expertise."

 Wallet talk: Lake Forest resident Dianna Baumann brought her fledgling recall 
effort to the Hall of Administration in Santa Ana on Tuesday, where the Board 
of Supervisors held its Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumann was busy handing out flyers, suggesting that residents mail empty 
wallets to county leaders to show their dismay over the financial turmoil. She 
also carried a red placard that stated: "All We Want For Christmas Is For All 
of Them to Resign or be Recalled." 
</P>
<P>
 "We entrusted them to look after our interests," she said. ". . . But they are 
not looking out for the taxpayer's interests."

THE HOLIDAY RUSH; COUNTING ON CHRISTMAS; O.C. MALLS TRY TO OFFER WHAT CONSUMERS 
WANT: SERVICE, SELECTION -- SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumers this holiday season are being choosy about more than quality of 
merchandise, prices and the courtesy of the sales help, retail experts say. 
They're shopping where they feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mall security is something that's come out of the closet," said Mark 
Schoifet, a spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers in New 
York. "There's always been security, but it was something best kept in the 
background. Now, the feeling is that a visible security presence is the way to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Mall owners and retail analysts say that shopping centers are relatively safe, 
with few reported incidents of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The typical regional mall in Southern California can draw 10 million to 12 
million people every year," Schoifet said. "But there's a relatively small 
number of crimes against persons. You're a lot safer in a mall than certainly 
any other retail environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, concern about security is growing. A November survey of Orange County 
residents by UC Irvine found that 44% of respondents said becoming a crime 
victim was their greatest fear. The results correspond with polls taken by mall 
operators across the nation showing that people are increasingly apprehensive 
when they shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest reasons we're going into malls is for visibility," said 
Don Wolfram, a Santa Ana Police Department officer who patrols MainPlace/Santa 
Ana. "We're around shoppers, and they have a good feeling, a sense of safety 
when we're there." 
</P>
<P>
 Because shoppers appreciate the presence of police officers armed with 
handguns, batons and the power to make arrests, cops are walking beats this 
holiday season at five Orange County retail centers: Westminster Mall, Brea 
Mall, Huntington Beach Mall, MainPlace/Santa Ana and South Coast Plaza in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost universally, people are concerned about crime," said Don Beasley, a 
retired 30-year Los Angeles Police Department veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're not making a shopper happy, he or she will go somewhere else," said 
Beasley, who is now corporate director of security for Taubman Co., operator of 
Beverly Center and two other California shopping centers. "I want them to have 
a pleasant visit, to find the kind of shops they want, the best foods, the 
right price points. I also want them to walk out and find their car safely 
ensconced in the parking stall where they left it." 
</P>
<P>
 Taubman has instructed its private security guards to wear high-profile hats, 
a response to consumer research showing that shoppers could not easily spot 
security officers in crowded malls. The company is also bolting police-style 
safety lights atop security vehicles -- yet another way to increase visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other shopping centers are adopting similar strategies. At Huntington Beach 
Mall, for example, a closed-circuit monitoring system is set up in full view of 
the public. Cameras are linked to color monitors at a kiosk in the middle of 
the mall's common area. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, two Santa Ana police officers who patrol MainPlace use golf carts 
to raise their profiles in the mall, and the city's Police Department adds 
mounted horse patrols to canvass parking lots during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall owners and police officials say that bolstering private security forces 
with uniformed police officers has a direct effect on reducing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're armed, and we also carry batons and pepper spray," Wolfram said. "A lot 
of things can go on in malls. We're always training in the use of firearms." 
</P>
<P>
 Being prepared is essential, Wolfram said. Another Santa Ana policeman needed 
stitches after a shoplifting suspect "went berserk while being arrested," he 
recalled. "This guy was 6-foot-4-inches tall and about 285 pounds. He started 
swinging his shopping bag, and our guy got hit in the head." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being a deterrent to crime, police and mall officials say, having 
officers on patrol helps in prosecuting shoplifting cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just gives us more credibility when we go to court," Wolfram said. "You 
can see the juries listen as you tell about your qualifications and expertise, 
and the fact that you work full time in the mall." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other officers assigned to the malls say they spend most of their time 
among the shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm rarely in the office," said Chuck Shinn, a Westminster police officer who 
patrols that city's mall. "I'm more like an officer on a foot beat. You'll 
never know where I am, so if you're going to do something stupid there's a good 
chance I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoplifting is the predominant crime at malls, Shinn said. To combat that, 
some shopping centers, including Westminster's, have police substations 
equipped with holding areas where suspects can be fingerprinted and 
photographed before being transferred to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides high visibility, mall patrol units can also respond quickly if there 
is a more serious incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're there within minutes," Shinn said. "If you have to call in a patrol 
car, you don't always get the same officers, and they don't always know where 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfram concedes that not every police officer is cut out for a mall beat, and 
some find it dull compared to the action on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have a personality that likes to talk to people," he said. 
"You're not there to be a bully. You've got to do a lot of public relations 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 It suits Shinn. He says walking the mall beat isn't much different from the 
days he spent on patrol in Klamath, a tiny town in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "People see you every day in a small town," he said. "They come to recognize 
you as their policeman. Most people feel comfortable when they see a cop 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall cop, in fact, is becoming a part of popular culture. Kevin Fagan, who 
attended Saddleback Community College with Shinn in the 1970s, is now a 
cartoonist who pens Drabble, a comic strip about a hapless college student 
whose father is a shopping center security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinn says he doesn't much care for his friend's creation, who frequently runs 
into trouble of his own making. But Fagan says the character isn't intended as 
a slight to police officers or security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagan said he gave Drabble the shopping center beat because "malls are 
everywhere. Everyone can easily relate to them." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Safe Shopping 
</P>
<P>
 Malls nationwide are generally safe, with very little violent crime. Still, 
incidents do occur occasionally. Here are 10 steps you can take to avoid 
becoming a victim: * Always lock your car. * Hide merchandise and other 
valuables in the trunk. * At night, park in well-lighted areas. * Don't leave 
shopping bags, baby strollers or purses unattended. * At night, walk in groups 
to cars parked in lots. * Keep car keys in hand while walking to your car. * 
Don't hang purses on stall door locks while using restrooms. * Keep an eye on 
young children. Don't let them wander through a toy store while you shop 
elsewhere. * When shopping with children, designate a "meeting place" inside 
the mall in case someone gets separated. * Notify police or security guards of 
any suspicious activity. Source: Orange County Mall Police Officers Assn.
