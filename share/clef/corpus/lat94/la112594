 " For God's sake, how we beat our bodies to give a party, and other people 
give them a box of potato chips, a can of deviled ham and ten cents worth of 
sweet pickles. "  
</P>
<P>
 -- James Beard, in a letter, after Christmas season 1954 * 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years after James Beard complained to Los Angeles cookbook writer Helen 
Evans Brown, most of us would be grateful for those chips and pickles -- or 
their '90s equivalents (focaccia and olives?) -- as long as they were presented 
in friendly company. That's how far the state of entertaining has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 In these lean and mean times, we're so constrained by economical and 
nutritional concerns that it sometimes seems our entertaining is guided more by 
the gray and stern ghost of Fannie Farmer than the charmingly ebullient shade 
of James Beard, who used to laughingly refer to himself as "the butter boy." 
</P>
<P>
 One of America's greatest food writers, Beard, author of 22 cookbooks, died at 
the age of 82 on Jan. 23, 1985 -- 10 years ago this holiday season. (Farmer, by 
the way, lived only to 43.) Reading through the recently published "Love and 
Kisses and a Halo of Truffles" (Arcade: 1994, $25.95), his collected letters to 
Brown, one wonders whether he ever did anything but entertain. And during the 
holidays, Beard was in especially fine form. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1953 letter written the week between Christmas and New Year describes a 
typical dinner party for 20: "The onions belle aurore were superb, and the 
finnan haddie made an even greater hit than before. I also did a big bowl of 
endive, cucumber and celery with ice -- in a big new wheat-pattern ironstone I 
got for Christmas. Then I had the cassoulet made with fine flageolets I found 
in the market. Saturday night I had cooked a goose and I used that, mutton, 
pork and garlic sausage. Instead of sprinkling with crumbs, I used sesame 
seeds. It was really a dandy." 
</P>
<P>
 While that menu might exhaust most of us, for Beard it was just the start of a 
busy week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have three more dinners to give, then finish," the letter continued. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the time of his childhood in Portland, Ore., the Christmas season was a 
busy one for Beard. His mother ran a boarding house, largely by herself -- his 
father was absent for long periods of time -- and the holidays were filled with 
people and food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few people have loved Christmas as (mother) did," he wrote in his memoir, 
"Delights and Prejudices." "Her great joy in the holiday season was infectious 
and for once in the year we were a united family." 
</P>
<P>
 The preparations began in early November, with the making of the mincemeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those days were a fascination to me," he wrote. "First there was the cooking 
of the meat for the mincemeat, which in our home was always beef and beef 
tongue. These were boiled, the stock was reserved for sauces and soups and 
stews, and the meat was finely cut or shredded and chopped by hand, then mixed 
with several kinds of raisins, currants and candied fruits and quantities of 
liquor. We never put apples in the mincemeat until we took it out of the crock 
to use it, because my mother felt it kept better this way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that we would save bottles of liqueurs that had been sent to us as 
gifts but were not to our taste for after-dinner drinking, and they greatly 
enhanced the mincemeat while being themselves overpowered by the other flavors. 
My father always lifted the crust of hot mince pie and put a cube of butter and 
a piece of Roquefort cheese underneath, which I considered a horrendous 
mixture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was in post-Depression New York City that Beard -- a frustrated actor -- 
came to fame, establishing himself as a caterer and cooking teacher before 
finally publishing his first recipe collection, "Hors d'Oeuvres and Canapes," 
in 1940. His love for the holidays never wavered, even as his means of 
entertaining for them changed drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were five for lunch yesterday and we did most of the cooking," he wrote of 
Thanksgiving 1954, spent at a friend's palazzo in Florence. "We stuffed the 
turkey with a collection of things. We had fresh truffles, which we slipped 
under the skin, and made a stuffing with parsley, onion, pureed chestnuts, 
bread crumbs, some rice pilaff left from the day before, mushroom stems, plenty 
of truffle slices and a little Madeira. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We started with some beautiful foie gras , then the turkey and pureed 
potatoes, a salad of endive and beets, the pumpkin pie and cognac and coffee. 
It was a dreamy day, the sun beat in on us and we were very gay and happy, all 
five of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas day was usually spent with family and a few intimate friends, with a 
menu centering around a nice thick Porterhouse steak fried in butter. Later, 
sometimes the main dish changed to a stew of salt cod, a grand poached Italian 
sausage called a zampone (in a letter, he described one as "looking for all the 
world like Mae West's thigh and leg"), and maybe a country ham. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that was almost never served was cranberries, which Beard hated with 
a passion. There was one exception: a recipe for crystallized cranberries -- 
more a garnish than a relish, really. "I liked them," he wrote. "They were 
rich, didn't taste like cranberries and were crisp, runny and gooey, which 
pleased my taste buds. Gino (Cofacci, his long-time roommate), who loves 
cranberries, didn't like them." 
</P>
<P>
 The main course was usually turkey, though, as a cookbook writer, he was not 
above dispensing a little gourmet hoo-haw regarding other meats. In one of his 
essays for American Way magazine (collected in "James Beard's Simple Foods" 
(MacMillan: 1993, $22.95)), he opined: "Being part English and brought up with 
a great many English traditions, I always associate Christmas with two very 
special foods. . . . I want a noble joint of beef . . . served with a golden 
puffy Yorkshire pudding. What a deliciously festive combination. Anglo-Saxon to 
the hilt. Indulge yourself with a really beautiful wine. A fine Bordeaux of a 
good vintage, such as Chateau Latour or a Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, is 
magnificent and carries on the great British tradition of claret with beef." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the royal purple prose wasn't enough to tip you off to this bit of Tory 
humbuggery, rest assured that in the dozen years of holidays covered in his 
letters, this menu is never mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 In life, if not in art, Beard preferred to follow the good-hearted, 
essentially American style of holiday entertaining he learned at his mother's 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were never fewer than twenty guests and sometimes up to thirty or 
forty," he wrote of childhood Christmas Eves in "Delights and Prejudices." "We 
exchanged gifts with all these friends and with friends out of town as well. A 
wassail drink was served -- eggnog or Tom and Jerry, and, during the era when 
it was available, Champagne." 
</P>
<P>
 (The wassail drink was Beard's father's contribution to the festivities and 
you get a sense of the tension between them, when 50 years later, in "Delights 
and Prejudices," he railed: "I take a very dim view of all punches. I know they 
are a necessary evil, but I myself don't wish to absorb any more of the evil 
than is required to be polite. I may have had to dispense a thousand different 
punch recipes in my day (indeed, there is a full chapter devoted to them in 
"Simple Foods"), but I haven't had to drink them, by God!") 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Then, around 11 p.m., the opening of presents began. "In the midst of it, Let 
(the family's Chinese housekeeper) would climb to the upstairs porch, attach a 
large string of firecrackers to a post and light it -- a sure Oriental touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at midnight, the food began: "There was a huge buffet and turkey and 
chicken salad, a vegetable salad, a variety of tiny sandwiches, usually a hot 
Olympia oyster stew and then a variety of sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The late buffet made it certain that guests would linger for hours. I often 
crept away upstairs without anyone's noticing and fell into my bed. Despite my 
fatigue, I can think of no better way to have been initiated into the world of 
Christmas than this one." OYSTER STEW

THE FUR FLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thumbs down to your Newsbites column (Oct. 27) for your shameful absence of 
sensitivity and humanity in promoting the sale of "furry bottle closers, 
handmade of genuine raccoon fur" and rabbit fur "coonskin" caps available at 
Fess Parker Winery and Vineyard in Los Olivos, Calif. Has Fess's wine and 
merchandising hype gone to your heads? 
</P>
<P>
 Acceptance and glorification of needless animal skinning and the opportunists 
who participate in such vanity-driven slaughter should be condemned, not 
condoned.

 Pizza Rest 
</P>
<P>
 Thanksgiving Eve is the third biggest day of the year for Domino's Pizza, 
which delivered about 62% more pizzas nationwide the day before yesterday than 
on your average Wednesday. Obviously, on the two bigger pizza-ordering days -- 
Super Bowl Sunday and New Year's Day -- people eat pizza because they're doing 
other things, but why Thanksgiving Eve? "It's as if they're resting up for the 
big day ahead," guesses spokesman Tim McIntyre. It Just Gives Me a Warm Feeling

 Dat'l Do-It is a line of condiments based on the extremely hot datil pepper, 
grown only around St. Augustine, Fla. The company farms its own peppers -- on 
platforms three feet above the ground, for easier picking (in a charitable 
spirit, it has contracted to have the harvesting done by the American Assn. of 
Retarded Citizens). Available from hot-sauce boutiques and catalogs, or 
directly from Dat'l Do-It at (800) HOT-DATL. Ho! Ho! Ho!

 Christopher Ranch, the biggest garlic producer in Gilroy, Calif., is opening a 
garlic store in Orange County -- but only for the holiday season. From now 
until Dec. 31 they will be selling garlic braids and gift baskets, garlic 
peelers, garlic-faced clocks and lots and lots of garlic and chile pepper 
condiments at the South Coast Plaza Crystal Court, 3333 Bear St., Costa Mesa 
(just follow your nose). Oaw!: Dogs Call for It by Name

 And you thought Americans get silly about their animals. Among the pet foods 
being sold in Europe, the Wall Street Journal reports, are dog breakfast food 
(supposed to eliminate canine morning breath), a garnish called Whiskas Crunch

pet foods in baby-food-type jars, and even Oaw!, an "alcohol-free beer" for 
dogs -- actually a vitamin drink. Why Breadfast?

 The Ahwahnee's Chefs' Holiday brings chefs, winemakers and food lovers 
together every year at the famous old Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. 
The seminars are free (if you reserve in advance) for anyone who visits the 
park when they're going on. The first holiday, featuring winemakers, takes

 Rocky road ice cream just turned 65. In the autumn of 1929, a few weeks after 
the stock market crash, the founders of the young Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream 
company invented it by adding almonds (they originally tried walnuts, which 
were too bitter) and marshmallows to ice cream. At the time, there were no 
miniature marshmallows, so they had to cut up regular ones with their wives' 
sewing scissors.

HANUKKAH; THE HANUKKAH-LATKE CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN NATHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Jews infatuated with the gastronomic side of Judaism, Hanukkah, which 
begins at sundown Sunday, is the preferred holiday, primarily because of the 
food served -- crispy latkes. 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly is the Hanukkah-latke connection? How has the food come to wag 
the festival? 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah celebrates the victory for religious freedom won by the Jewish 
Maccabees over Antiochus of Syria more than 2,100 years ago. Upon returning to 
the ransacked Temple, the Maccabees found just a little bit of sacred oil that 
miraculously lit the Temple menorah for the eight days it took to prepare more 
oil for the eternal lights. The word latke comes from the Russian oladka or 
olad'ia , meaning a sort of pancake or fritter, which goes back to the Middle 
Greek word eladion , a cake fried in olive oil. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to equal the taste of brown, crisp potato latkes served with 
sour cream or homemade applesauce. Moreover, as contrasted with other 
traditional Jewish culinary staples such as gefilte fish, every latke lover 
seems to know how to make these potato pancakes and has strong opinions about 
them. One will swear by a medium-holed grater, another by the larger variety. 
Some prefer pepper; others, salt. Some add apples, others onions or parsley. 
And then, of course, there are the purists who contend that only old potatoes 
will do because new ones don't have enough starch. 
</P>
<P>
 Kartoflani platske is the term used to describe a potato pancake in Ukraine. 
It is probably the same food that the Jews living in the Pale of Settlement in 
the 17th Century adapted for Hanukkah. Because their daily diet consisted of 
boiled potatoes and bread, they wanted to dress the potatoes differently for 
the holiday and thus made a dish cooked in oil to symbolize the main miracle of 
Hanukkah. This potato pancake, already used by Ukrainians with goose for 
Christmas, seemed a good and relatively inexpensive choice. Schmaltz , made of 
rendered goose fat, was the obvious choice of oils. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sephardic (Mediterranean) Jews have their own Hanukkah traditions. Like the 
Jews in Ukraine, their culinary customs were probably taken from the 
surrounding people. Greek Jews claim their loukomades (deep-fried puffs dipped 
in honey or sprinkled with powdered sugar) are more like the cakes the 
Maccabees ate, while the Persian Jews believe their lattice-shapped fritters 
called zulbiya are more similar. The Israeli sufganiot are basically raised 
jelly doughnuts and probably adapted from these same traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Latkes are even more complicated today. They have become a versatile delicacy 
and designer latkes are crisscrossing the country. These high-fashion potato 
fritters can be laced with green onions, spinach, zucchini, carrots, apples, 
and sometimes topped with goat cheese. They are served for breakfast, brunch, 
lunch, dinner or even as cocktail party fare throughout the year. They are a 
welcome treat, eaten plain or fancy; alone or along with brisket, chops, 
sauerbraten or chicken soup; topped with sugar, applesauce, sour cream or even 
salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the ingredients, however they are made and whenever they are eaten, 
the best latkes are thin and crisp. One of the tricks to making them this way 
is to squeeze out as much liquid as possible from the grated potato. Add a 
small amount of flour or matzo meal as filler, if desired, and then gently 
flatten and cook the pancakes on a very hot skillet. The colder the 
potato-vegetable combination and the hotter the skillet, the less fat there 
will be in the final product. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the aroma of these pancakes sizzling on the griddle and eager fingers 
nibbling at the occasional slightly misshaped finished product before it ever 
makes it to the table, the holiday is always a much-anticipated pleasure.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: HONOR ROLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As you cruise through El Monte toward the car dealerships, past the taco 
stands, the Malaysian restaurant, the Vietnamese supermarket, Jolly Jug is the 
kind of place you gape at from your car, a relic from the days when the San 
Gabriel Valley had more duplicate-bridge parlors than Asian noodleshops, a 
souvenir from the time when it was socially acceptable to think drinking was 
kind of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Above the restaurant, the sign soars in the shape of a cheerfully besotted 
king -- or a mustachioed guy in a bowtie who's had one too many and is posing 
with his wife's tiara. There's even a motto: "Southland's Most Honored 
Sandwiches." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, it looks like one of those '40s places that was probably redecorated 
in the '60s and again in the '80s, so the classic roadhouse feel is inflected 
by the kind of window treatments and Tiffany-ish lamps that might suggest a 
place with sprouts on the burgers and mango in the ice tea if it weren't for 
all the smoke in the air -- at Jolly Jug, in tobacco-friendly El Monte, you can 
sometimes feel naked without a cigarette in your hand, even if you don't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 It can seem like a palace of Lotto too, with Keno results flashing constantly 
on the corner TV and reams of entry forms on the tables where you'd expect to 
find paper-napkin dispensers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Jolly Jug is pretty much just a coffee shop, though a coffee shop that has 
Miller on tap, creditable patty melts, and any number of sandwiches that 
include thinly shaved roast beef and gobs of melted cheese. The Spencer steak 
sandwich is the sort of thing you might find at an American-style restaurant in 
someplace like Spain, griddled slices of meat, a little rarer -- and tastier -- 
than you think they might be, tucked into a roll with sweet mayonnaise. Jolly 
Jug is also liberal enough to include pastrami in its definition of a club 
sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 But what better time than the day after Thanksgiving to contemplate the 
specialty here, dip sandwiches with gravy all over them -- heavy, 40-weight, 
tan gravy that clogs arteries, glues your tongue to the roof of your mouth, 
subsumes both bread and meat into mere condiments to the ooze. It's a sandwich 
you wouldn't contemplate in August, but which may seem oddly appropriate to the 
crisp winds of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolly Jug's "Most Honored Sandwich" is less a variation on the Kentucky hot 
brown or the morning-after hot turkey sandwich your mother used to make at 
Thanksgiving, than a hi-cal version of the French dip sandwiches served at 
old-line L.A. places like Cole's and Philippe's: a crisp, light French roll 
sliced in two, dipped in gravy and stuffed with thinly sliced beef, pork or 
pastrami. It's perhaps not a sandwich worth a drive from Torrance, but might be 
worth considering when you're in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you could become a regular, like one guy who doesn't look as if he's 
moved from his booth much since Ike was president. After he left one day, the 
waitress held up the mostly empty sugar dispenser that was on his table, and 
shook it like a maraca by her ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was full when he came in," she said, "and he's like this every day. If 
some doctor ever cuts that customer's vein open, it won't be blood that comes 
gushing out." 
</P>
<P>

WINE: SERVICE POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine that the waiter brings the wine you ordered, but it's already 
uncorked. Do you reject the wine, as convention dictates, and ask the waiter to 
open a new bottle in front of you? 
</P>
<P>
 That is protocol in most fine restaurants, yet there are times when it's 
better to simply accept the already-open wine. 
</P>
<P>
 As Edmund Osterland, a master sommelier and wine consultant, says, "You 
shouldn't be so wine-geeky at simple places that have low prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant etiquette is a subject rarely dealt with in wine literature, and I 
suspect many writers avoid the subject since there's no accepted rule book on 
it. Much appears to be handed down by oral tradition, so the "rules" that 
follow are not universally acknowledged. "However, from discussions with 
restaurant owners and wine stewards, I am confident that the following won't 
get you in much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a good restaurant, you should be handed the wine list as soon as you are 
seated. Unfortunately, you often have to beg for it. At one Hollywood 
restaurant last year, I was told to wait. "We have only one list, and someone's 
looking at it," said the waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're ordering by the glass, it's fair to ask for a sip of one or two 
wines you're not familiar with. With wine going for $8 a glass and up, most 
restaurants permit patrons to try half an ounce (that's a tablespoon) of a wine 
sold by the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 When the wine comes to the table, most of the time you have to take it on 
faith that what you ordered is what's in the glass. Few restaurants pour the 
wine from the bottle at the table. But if in doubt, ask to see the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving sizes of wines ordered by the glass vary. Most restaurants serve six 
ounces in a by-the-glass serving, though some serve only four ounces, and with 
a few special items (such as Opus One, the famed Napa Valley red wine), the 
standard serving is only three ounces. It's my experience that when you order a 
glass of sparkling wine, you scarcely ever get six ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When ordering wine from the wine list, you may need assistance. Osterland 
suggests you open a dialogue with the waiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patron should ask questions," says Osterland. "And the waiter should 
either make recommendations based on the desire of the patron, or bring someone 
to the table who can." 
</P>
<P>
 Osterland says when good waiters are asked for suggestions, they don't simply 
respond with their personal favorites: "They will ask, 'What do you drink at 
home and do you want something like that?' This gives the waiter two bits of 
information: the type of wine the patron likes and the approximate price point 
he's prepared to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 You might say, "I like a rich Chardonnay, like Ferrari-Carano." Or the waiter 
might ask whether you prefer a lighter style of Cabernet, or one with a lot 
more power. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons should be alert to "bait and switch" tactics. They aren't common, but 
they do occur. Three years ago, I ordered a Chianti selling for $25 at an 
upscale Beverly Hills Italian restaurant. The waiter said it was sold out and 
recommended another. But he never told me that the price was $38, even when I 
asked. (And there were cheaper wines on the list he could have suggested). 
</P>
<P>
 In many top-rate restaurants, when a wine you have ordered is out of stock and 
a more expensive substitute is recommended, you are given the replacement wine 
at the same price as the wine you ordered. This is how it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the bottle arrives at the table, the waiter should show you the label. Be 
certain the wine is the one ordered -- proper producer, vintage, special 
designations. For instance, you may order an Inglenook wine, expecting it to be 
from the Napa Valley (where the winery is based), but instead get Inglenook 
Navalle, which is cheaper and contains little, if any, Napa Valley grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fine restaurant, the cork should still be in the bottle when the wine 
arrives. If you're in a small, inexpensive place, though, it may not be. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in a mom-and-pop restaurant where the entire tab will be $10, you 
probably shouldn't be so demanding if the cork is pulled in the kitchen," says 
Osterland, owner of Grape Escape Consulting of San Diego. "As the check price 
goes up, you ratchet up your expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've even had waitresses (at other restaurants) ask me to open the bottle," 
said Manfred Krankl, wine buyer for Campanile in Los Angeles. "In small cafes, 
if they open it in the kitchen, I usually don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
 After the cork has been pulled, the waiter should put it down for you to look 
at it. Long ago the cork was verification that you were getting the wine you 
ordered. Decades ago, fraud was more prevalent than today and bogus labels 
occasionally turned up on some famed wines. The branded cork, with the name of 
the producer and the vintage, was one additional way to make sure the wine was 
what it was supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, you needn't worry about the cork. It's the aroma of the 
wine you're concerned about, not the aroma of the cork. 
</P>
<P>
 After the cork has been pulled, the waiter pours a tiny amount (perhaps a 
half-ounce) for the person who ordered it. This is to smell and taste it, to 
determine whether it is sound. In general, the only reason to reject a wine in 
a restaurant is if it is spoiled. And the patron should know what sort of 
spoilage he is objecting to -- corkiness, oxidation, vinegar, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 If the waiter makes a suggestion on a wine without having asked any questions 
of the patron, and the patron doesn't like the wine, who assumes 
responsibility? "I think the waiter should take it back," says Osterland. "By 
making a recommendation, he is putting his reputation on the line. If the 
waiter says the wine is soft and you find it acidic, the waiter hasn't done his 
job."  
</P>
<P>
 One last tactic is bringing your own wine from home. Many restaurants permit 
it (though in some states it's against the law). Call ahead to alert the 
restaurant you will bring a wine from your cellar and ask if there is a corkage 
charge. (Standard charges range from $3 to $10 per bottle.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Courtesy dictates you don't bring a wine the restaurant already stocks, and 
it's impolite to bring a cheap wine just to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 One last warning: Restaurants in the United States are notorious for not 
training their wait-staffs in wine, so be prepared for some humorous banter 
with the less-well-informed. And don't think that just because the guy is 
wearing a sommelier's cup around his neck on a silver chain that he knows the 
difference between a Pommard and a Pomerol. Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Sutter Home Winery Sauvignon Blanc ($4.45) -- The winery that created and 
still dominates the field of white Zinfandel also makes a line of other 
varietal wines, and this one is surprisingly bold and full of character for so 
low a price. There is a lot of varietal intensity here, with olives, tarragon, 
green and herbal teas and lemon grass all adding interest. (I tasted this wine 
blind, and my tasting notes say, "Is there too much varietal character here?") 
The flavors are fairly deep, and the texture is soft and pleasing. Considering 
that the wine will be discounted to about $3.50, this is worth trying.

A PECK OF PICKLED PEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN T. BARRETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pickled pears are an old-fashioned specialty that I barely tolerated on first 
exposure, nearly 25 years ago, and gradually grew to adore. Now, these piquant 
fruits are an integral part of fall and winter entertaining at my house. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was introduced to pickled pears as a teen, I hardly knew what to make 
of them. This was a stage when my friends and I were usually either 
crash-dieting or wondering where our next snack was coming from. During long 
afternoon gossip sessions in the boarding school dorm room of my good friend, 
Karan, the inevitable question would arise: "Do you have anything to eat?" 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally there would be something good -- a chocolate bar or cookies, for 
instance. More often, the pickings would be slim. But Karan always had a last 
resort: a seemingly limitless supply of home-canned pickled pears. When there 
was nothing else to eat, we'd pry open one of the Mason jars and nibble on the 
sweet, vinegary miniature pears that she'd work out of the jars using whatever 
implement happened to be handy: a pencil, a Swiss Army knife, or even her 
fingers.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, home canning seemed to me to be an antiquated, lost art akin to 
milling one's own flour or spinning wool. A child of the '60s, I was raised in 
a household that had embraced modern, time-saving convenience foods with ardor. 
We grew no produce and neither of my parents did any recreational cooking. My 
parents both remember their mothers putting up preserves and canning 
vegetables, but I had no exposure to the practice until these pickled pears 
became a staple of my high school diet. I remember thinking they made a strange 
snack, but I ate them anyway, out of sheer desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pickled pears, I soon learned, were put up by the housekeeper, Mrs. 
Morgan, at Karan's grandmother's house in Amagansett, Long Island. (This was 
around 1970, when Amagansett was a secluded seaside community, well outside the 
social whirl of neighboring East Hampton.) The miniature pears, which 
presumably were Seckels or a close relative, grew on a tree near the entrance 
to the main house.  
</P>
<P>
 During my teen years, I had the good fortune to visit the Amagansett place 
often and consumed the pickled pears at the source. I came to appreciate their 
sweet-sour, cinnamon-spiced flavor and the way they complemented meats, 
chicken, cheeses and other dishes. And I loved the way the pears looked in the 
jars: dainty, miniature replicas of the more familiar Bartletts, complete with 
tiny stems and a few seeds, which could be eaten or not, as you wished. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, I revisited Karan's family home in Amagansett and we 
reminisced about the dishes served to us there as kids. After searching through 
a handwritten book of recipes kept in the kitchen, we finally found a very 
cursory version of the pickled pear recipe; it omitted any mention of pears, 
presumably on the assumption that if you intended to prepare the recipe, you 
were faced with a whole heap of them. I tried the recipe at home, tasted the 
results and was immediately transported back to when I was a boy-crazed, 
perpetually hungry teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, a pear tree is not necessary in order to prepare this recipe. 
Seckel pears from the Pacific Northwest, sold in two-pound bags at many 
supermarkets, pickle beautifully. The pears are generally sold a bit unripe; 
you'll get the best results from this recipe if you use Seckels that are nearly 
ripe, but not overripe. (You can't judge by the color; Seckels don't turn 
yellow but instead keep their greenish color even when fully ripe. Taste one to 
determine ripeness.) If Seckels are not available, any small, firm-fleshed pear 
will work, although you may have to adjust the length of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow plenty of time for the laborious peeling of the pears; the remainder of 
the recipe takes almost no time at all. AMAGANSETT PICKLED PEARS 
</P>
<P>
 6 pounds Seckel or other small pears or more; recipe yields enough liquid to 
pickle up to 10 pounds of pears 
</P>
<P>
 6 cups white vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 8 cups dark brown sugar, packed

 Some people think commercially canned cranberry sauce can't be improved upon; 
the following recipe is not for them. Here is a different way to enjoy the tart 
flavor of cranberries with roasted fowl, pork or sausages. From "Fancy Pantry" 
by Helen Witty (Workman Publishing: New York; 1986). SWEET AND TART PICKLED 
CRANBERRIES 
</P>
<P>
 2 (12-ounce) packages fresh cranberries

<P>
 1 tablespoon coriander seeds 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon coarsely broken cinnamon sticks

loosely in square of cheesecloth. Pound bundle lightly to bruise spices. Add 
spice bag to vinegar mixture. Bring mixture to boil, stirring until sugar has 
dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmer syrup 5 minutes. Add cranberries to syrup and cook over low heat, 
uncovered, shaking pan often, until thoroughly heated and skins have cracked, 
about 7 minutes. Pour cranberries, spice bag and syrup into bowl. Cool mixture, 
then cover bowl and leave at room temperature several hours or overnight. 
</P>
<P>

 After visiting several markets reputed to carry Malay products, I found Shun 
Fat in Monterey Park had the best selection.It carries various brands of 
Malaysian-style curry powder, the fermented shrimp preparations belacan and 
petis udang , and spicy sambals , as well as the necessary dry spices for curry 
and the rice noodle soup, laksa . Most items are in the Indonesian section, but 
some are found in a separate curry section along with the general seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "wet" department you'll find lengkuas , (the ginger-like rhizome known 
as galangal in English), lemon grass and Asian basil.

 A stream of golden batter swirls in a delicate pattern onto a sizzling 
skillet. Seconds later, Norani Nasir peels a mesh-like pancake from the 
searing-hot pan. She is making a stack of roti jala to serve with her rich, 
saucy coconut milk-based chicken curry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of our favorite dishes for high tea in Malaysia," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 These lacy-looking crepes -- roti , a Hindi word for bread, and jala , Malay 
for fishing net -- typifies the cultural interweavings that make up Malaysia's 
cuisine. With its South Indian-influenced curries, its Chinese-inspired noodle 
dishes and its many culinary similarities to Indonesia, Thailand and even 
Vietnam, Malaysia clearly deserves its sobriquet "The Crossroads of Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 The cuisine is full of surprises -- you even find occasional European touches 
such as the high tea Nasir mentioned, a heritage from the days of British rule. 
 
</P>
<P>
 All this diversity makes food shopping easy for Nasir, who recently moved to 
San Marino from Malaysia. She says that though the Los Angeles region has no 
strictly Malaysian markets, she finds the ingredients for the dishes her family 
loves at markets that cater to people from other Southeast Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As she swirls more roti batter into the pan, Nasir explains that her family is 
living here temporarily while her husband is on assignment as an adviser to 
Malaysian students in Los Angeles. Already, her reputation as a great cook has 
started to spread throughout the L. A.-area Malaysian community. And as head of 
the hospitality committee for Perwakilan, a Malaysian women's social club, she 
and other volunteer cooks organize banquets for community holiday parties and 
receptions for dignitaries, such as Malaysia's secretary of state.  
</P>
<P>
 Cooking wasn't always a passion for Nasir. "After high school, I reluctantly 
decided I had better learn to cook so I could get married," she confesses. In 
typical Malay style, she perfected each dish by the see-and-copy method. 
Learning to handle the batu lesong -- a granite mortar and pestle -- was 
essential. After all, the ground spice pastes called rempahs are the absolute 
soul of Malay cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was living with my auntie while my parents worked in Singapore and she let 
me follow her around the kitchen," Nasir says. In those days, cooking 
traditions were handed down from one generation to another without using 
printed recipes. Measuring cups and spoons were never standard kitchen 
equipment. Everyone cooked by agak-agak , a term that is best translated as 
"estimate and guess." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Kota Tinggi, Nasir's home town, was a sleepy place. It's located 
in Johor, peninsular Malaysia's southernmost state, and the equatorial climate 
and easy-going, semi-agrarian lifestyle made for very pleasant living. Although 
stores sold staples and Indian shops made prepared mixtures of freshly ground 
spices for curries, most foods were bought at the old-fashioned pasar besar , 
or central market. This was a bazaar-like affair with stalls run by local 
entrepreneurs where hard bargains were driven with the fast-talking vendors 
over fish or piles of bananas and vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 The market's pork stalls were always separate from the fish and poultry areas 
because Muslim Malays do not eat pork. The meat they use must also have been 
butchered in a religiously sanctioned way. (Now Nasir's husband gets their 
halal meat -- the Islamic equivalent of kosher -- at a halal butcher on 
Vermont). 
</P>
<P>
 As Nasir grew up, Kota Tinggi moved into modern times along with the rest of 
urban Malaysia. In the new "flood-free zone," people lived in modern houses 
instead of the classical Malay kampung homes built on stilts. Practical though 
the traditional houses were for keeping things cool -- to say nothing of 
keeping them dry during the monsoons -- some people preferred modern dwellings. 
"Our kitchen was equipped with gas, but some people still had charcoal stoves 
at home," Nasir remembers. Shopping became more modernized too. Shops stocked 
canned coconut milk and packets of mixed spices just as you find in Malaysia's 
supermarkets today.  
</P>
<P>
 Nasir grew up shuttling back and forth between Johor and Singapore, which is 
just a short drive by causeway across the Johor straits. If her cooking seems 
similar to Singaporean Malay food it's no surprise since the regions, though 
now politically separate, have been culturally linked for centuries. The dishes 
in both areas lack the blast-furnace chile heat of many other Malay cooking 
styles.  
</P>
<P>
 Ask about her favorite dishes and Nasir has a hard time choosing. Finally, she 
decides that roti jala and laksa are her family's favorites. The latter, a rice 
noodle soup dish, is the Malay equivalent of spaghetti in meat sauce -- just 
about everyone eats it. Nasir has her own version and it is, of course, 
Johor-style, a rich coconut milk broth with a hint of chiles, a little sour 
tamarind and a garnish of fresh herbs and vegetables. It is very different from 
its more famous relative, Penang-style laksa based on a clear, chile-hot sour 
tamarind broth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When she moved to the United States, Nasir brought all sorts of non-perishable 
ingredients with her. But now that she's explored the Asian markets of the San 
Gabriel Valley she's beginning to find more ingredients like belacan and petis 
udang , two fermented shrimp preparations used as seasoning.  
</P>
<P>
 "I get almost everything at either Hawaii Market, Hong Kong Market or 99 
Ranch. They usually have all kinds of vegetables like daun pisang (banana 
leaf), sawi (mustard greens) and brinjal (eggplant)."  
</P>
<P>
 Fresh herbs? "No problem," she says. There is daun selas , a minty-tasting 
Southeast Asian-style basil, and daun padanus , the broad fragrant leaves of 
the screw-pine (pandanus), which flavor desserts. Nasir reports she can even 
buy fresh petis , an odorous tree-grown bean that most non-Asians find hard to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A glance around Nasir's kitchen reveals crock-pots, a microwave and other 
cookware that is becoming as popular in urban Malaysia as it is here. And 
lately, she's been known to work from written recipes exchanged with women from 
her Perwakilan club or from magazines. Even so, she hasn't given up on her 
old-fashioned mortar. Occasionally she uses it because it smooths out certain 
rempahs better than her blender ever could. And when she tries a recipe, the 
agak-agak method of her traditional cooking often comes in handy, for it really 
is an excellent way to perfect the taste of a dish.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way to get the lacy effect that Nasir does for her roti jala is to 
use the tool the Malays usee, a special four-hole cup that releases several 
streams of batter at once into the hot oil. Unfortunately, the tool isn't easy 
to find in the Southland. You can get the same effect, however, by puncturing 
holes in the bottom of an aluminum foil muffin cup or a foam coffee cup. Don't 
make the holes too thin. They should be the size of standard knitting yarn.  
</P>
<P>
 Another option: It is said that some Malay cooks simply dip their hand into 
the batter and allow it to trail off their fingers into the pan.  
</P>
<P>
 The roti themselves are the main part of the meal. Malaysian-style chicken 
curry serves as a sort of dip to flavor the pancakes. Fold the finished roti 
into quarters like triangles to serve.  
</P>
<P>
 ROTI JALA 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 Oil 
</P>
<P>
 Sift 2 cups flour into mixing bowl with salt. Sift remaining 1 cup flour into 
separate bowl and set each bowl aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Blend milk, water and eggs in large bowl until smooth. Gradually beat in 
flour-salt mixture. Batter should cling to wooden spoon. Add additional sifted 
flour, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 8- or 9-inch non-stick skillet and film lightly with oil. When pan is 
hot, scoop about 1/2 cup of batter into punctured cup and swirl in circles onto 
pan to form lacy pancake covering about 2/3 of surface. Allow pancake to set 
before peeling away from pan. Makes 6 servings.

<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 263 calories; 435 mg sodium; 74 mg cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 46 grams 
carbohydrates; 9 grams protein; 0.17 gram fiber. MALAYSIAN-STYLE CHICKEN CURRY  
</P>
<P>
 5 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 8 shallots, halved 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-inch) piece ginger root, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon Malaysian-style hot curry powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3 1/2-pound) chicken cut onto 12 to 16 pieces 
</P>
<P>
 2 (13 1/2-ounce) cans coconut milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon salt, or to taste  
</P>
<P>
 Roti Jala 
</P>
<P>
 Puree garlic, shallots and ginger in blender or food processor or with mortar 
and pestle. Mix in curry powder.  
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large, deep skillet. Add garlic-curry mixture. Cook over medium 
heat about 4 minutes, until mixture is fragrant. Add chicken and fry, turning 
several times to coat all chicken with curry. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour in coconut milk. Over medium-low heat slowly bring mixture to simmer 
while lifting and pouring ladles full of coconut milk back onto itself in pot. 
This step is important to ensure even heating of milk and to avoid separation 
of coconut oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook chicken about 45 minutes or until chicken is tender. Add salt.  
</P>
<P>
 Serve each portion in wide soup bowl with several Roti Jala on side. Eat by 
dipping roti into sauce. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving, without Roti Jala, contains about: 
</P>

GOOD COOKING: THE REMAINS OF THE BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The romance of leftover turkey begins to fade a few days after the feast. 
First pickings bring pleasure, but what about the rest? 
</P>
<P>
 Before you do anything else with the leftover turkey, find the little morsels 
of meat called the oysters. They are on the underside of the turkey, right in 
the center, at the base of the backbone. There are two, one straddling either 
side of the bone. Each oyster is about two bites of the tenderest, most 
succulent dark meat on the whole bird. They're the reason that I offer to carve 
the turkey every year -- so I'm assured that no one else beats me to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the strategy for the rest of the bird: Cooked turkey will stay fresher if 
it's left on the bone until you use it. Once it's cut, it dries out more 
quickly. The turkey must be wrapped airtight, either in a plastic food bag or 
foil. If your refrigerator space is limited, cut off the legs and wings and 
wrap them separately. Leftovers can be refrigerated up to four days. 
</P>
<P>
 You might consider freezing some sliced or chopped turkey meat (also the 
carcass) until you can face it with renewed enthusiasm. Wrap in foil, then seal 
in an airtight food bag (to prevent off-odors and freezer burn) and label 
clearly. The meat can be frozen up to two months. It's best to thaw, still 
wrapped, in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before you go for this long-term strategy, however, consider the following 
recipes: Asian turkey salad, broiled open-face turkey sandwiches with mushrooms 
and cheese and turkey-vegetable soup with orzo. They are easy preparations -- 
and unlike most typical post-Thanksgiving leftovers, they don't require 
cranberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a quick salad to get on the table. It's also the perfect sequel to 
Thanksgiving dinner because it's light and refreshing.  
</P>
<P>
 ASIAN TURKEY SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-inch square) piece ginger root

 2/3 cup diced sweet red pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup thinly sliced green onions 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups chopped iceberg lettuce 
</P>
<P>
 Finely mince garlic and ginger in blender or food processor. Scrape down sides 
of container. Add vinegar, honey and oil. Mix well. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Put turkey, fried rice noodles, celery, sweet red pepper and green onions in 
2-quart bowl. Add dressing. Toss until well-mixed and evenly coated. Add 
iceberg lettuce. Toss until well combined. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve 
chilled. Makes 2 servings.

 Served with a green salad, this turkey sandwich topped with sizzling cheese 
makes a nice supper or lunch.  
</P>
<P>
 BROILED OPEN-FACE TURKEY SANDWICH WITH CHEESE AND MUSHROOMS 
</P>
<P>
 4 slices challah or brioche bread 
</P>
<P>
 Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Sauteed Mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
 8 full slices turkey breast meat 
</P>
<P>
 6 ounces Muenster or Monterey Jack cheese, sliced thin 
</P>
<P>
 Generously spread 1 side of each bread slice with mustard. Spread Sauteed 
Mushrooms evenly over mustard-covered side of each bread slice, about 1/3 cup 
per slice. Top each with 2 turkey slices. Top with cheese slices, about 1 1/2 
ounces on each. Put sandwiches on baking sheet.  
</P>
<P>
 Bake on center oven rack at 350 degrees until cheese is melted, about 10 
minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Turn on broiler and set rack about 6 inches from heat source. Broil until 
lightly browned and sizzling. Serve hot. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 530 calories; 770 mg sodium; 144 mg cholesterol; 24 grams fat; 26 grams 
carbohydrates; 50 grams protein; 0.93 gram fiber. Sauteed Mushrooms  
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound mushrooms, trimmed, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup beef stock or broth 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 medium green onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil and butter in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When 
hot, add garlic and mushrooms. Cook, uncovered, mushrooms, about 3 minutes, 
stirring often. 
</P>
<P>
 Add beef stock, salt and pepper to taste. Simmer until mushrooms are just 
tender but still have texture, about 2 minutes. Add green onions. Toss until 
well-combined. Remove from heat.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a thick and sustaining soup that makes a great supper. The depth of 
the broth flavor -- from the turkey stock used as a base -- makes the soup. 
Serve with biscuits or cornbread. If you want, you can tackle the soup a few 
weeks after Thanksgiving, following the freezing instructions in the story 
above.

BACK TO BASICS: SHORTCUT STRUDEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was growing up, my mother had a friend who made strudel from scratch. I 
remember visiting Giselle Sauerwein's home and watching her carefully stretch 
the dough until it completely covered the round dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
 She worked from the underside, palms down and hands slightly clenched, so the 
flat planes of her knuckles coaxed the dough outward from the center. Moving 
around the table as she worked, she eventually produced dough as thin as tissue 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually she rolled the dough around an apple filling, but sometimes cherries 
or poppy seeds were tucked inside. The resulting desserts were sublime, 
particularly when served warm with vanilla ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt there are many people today who have the time or skill to make strudel 
by the traditional method, but a good facsimile can be made using packaged filo 
dough. It's available fresh in specialty grocery stores and some supermarkets; 
frozen filo can be found in almost any market. For best results, thaw the filo 
overnight in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove the filo from the refrigerator a couple of hours before you plan to 
make the strudel, but leave the package sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a template out of wax paper gives you a quick guide for forming the 
filo into a square, helps with the folding and rolling techniques and minimizes 
cleanup. Cut two 26-inch lengths of wax paper, overlap the long sides about a 
half inch and tape the two pieces together. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a ruler and the end of a sharp skewer, draw an 18-inch square in the 
center of the wax paper. Place the template on a work surface with enough room 
next to it for the filo dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine the filling ingredients and toss together until the apple slices are 
evenly coated. This will prevent them from turning dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Open the filo dough and carefully unroll it on a sheet of wax paper or plastic 
wrap. Separate half of sheets, re-roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate or 
refreeze for another use. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly cover the remaining half of the filo sheets with wax paper or plastic 
wrap, then a damp towel, to prevent them from drying out and becoming unusable. 
(The towel should not touch the dough.) 
</P>
<P>
 Place one sheet of filo along the upper edge of the template drawn on the wax 
paper. Overlap a second sheet enough to form an 18-inch square within the 
guidelines. Brush the filo with melted butter (Step 1) and sprinkle with a 
scant tablespoon of toasted bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Layer the remaining filo (Step 2), two sheets at a time, each time alternating 
the direction they are placed. Brush each layer with butter and sprinkle with 
crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Place the reserved filling in a 12x4-inch rectangle about three inches from 
one edge of the dough (Step 3). Using the wax paper to lift the dough, fold in 
the sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin at the end near the filling and roll up the filo dough jellyroll fashion 
(Step 4), encasing the filling. It may be easier to lift the dough with the wax 
paper as you roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Place the roll seam-side down on a greased jellyroll pan and brush with melted 
butter (Step 5). Bake until golden brown, then cool about 30 minutes before 
slicing diagonally (Step 6) for serving. APPLE STRUDEL 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-pound) package filo dough 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons raisins 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped blanched almonds 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

</P>
<P>
 2 medium apples, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup melted butter 
</P>
<P>
 If filo dough is frozen, thaw overnight in refrigerator. Remove from 
refrigerator 2 hours before beginning preparation, but leave package closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut 2 (26-inch) lengths of wax paper. Overlap long sides of wax paper about 
1/2 inch and tape together. Using ruler and end of sharp skewer, draw 18-inch 
square in center of wax paper to use as template. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine raisins, almonds, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and 2 tablespoons 
bread crumbs in medium bowl. Add apples and toss until slices are evenly 
coated. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Open filo dough. Unroll carefully on sheet of wax paper or plastic wrap. 
Separate half of sheets, re-roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate or refreeze 
for another use. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover remaining half filo with sheet of wax paper or plastic wrap, then damp 
towel, to prevent drying. Towel should not touch dough. 
</P>
<P>
 Place 2 sheets filo, overlapping enough to form 18-inch square, on template. 
Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with scant tablespoon of bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Layer remaining filo, 2 sheets at time, alternating directions. Brush each 
layer with butter and sprinkle with bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Place filling in 12x4-inch rectangle about 3 inches from 1 edge of dough. 
Using wax paper to lift dough, fold in sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at end near filling, roll filo jellyroll fashion, encasing filling. 
Continue to roll, lifting dough with wax paper.

GARDEN FRESH: CHEERFUL CHERVIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its intriguing flavor of anise, touched with parsley, with light-green 
leaves dainty as a fern's, with a habit of growth as easy as child's play, why 
doesn't chervil grace every garden and table?  
</P>
<P>
 In France, it does. Whether the cuisine is haute or simple, chervil's lacy 
leaves are as essential for flavoring and garnish as parsley's in the 
English-speaking world.  
</P>
<P>
 With its anisey overtones, chervil has much the same affinities as tarragon: 
eggs, fish, white meats, grilled steak, carrots, beets, potatoes, cucumbers, 
tomatoes, peas, and anything creamy, especially cheese. Chervil is subtler than 
tarragon, its complex flavor lingering on the tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And chervil belongs in salads. In 1699 in "Acetaria," the great English salad 
fancier John Evelyn noted, "The tender tips of chervil should never be wanting 
in our sallets, being exceedingly wholesome and cheering of the spirits." 
Cheerful is apt for chervil in every aspect -- Greek sources of the word are 
thought to mean glad leaf. In Gallic cuisine, together with parsley, tarragon 
and chives, chervil has been elevated to a classic in the quartet called fines 
herbes . An omelet aux fines herbes couldn't be simpler, yet it makes an 
extraordinarily delicious and elegant late breakfast or light luncheon served 
with Champagne and toast.  
</P>
<P>
 Make an omelet one serving at a time in a heavy flattish seven- to eight-inch 
skillet that's well seasoned (i.e., not new). In a bowl, beat two large fresh 
eggs with a fork until yolks and whites are blended. Stir in two tablespoons 
each of finely chopped fresh chervil, parsley, tarragon and chives. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt half a tablespoon of unsalted butter in a skillet over high heat. Before 
the butter colors, drop in the eggs. At once use the fork to draw set edges of 
the eggs toward the center of the pan, at the same time tipping the pan so 
runny egg fills the empty spaces. When the eggs are set on the bottom but still 
soft on top, fold the omelet in half, then drop a hazelnut-size lump of butter 
into the bare side of the pan. When the butter has melted and any uncooked egg 
set, turn the omelet out onto a heated dish then drizzle with the butter.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Use a brush to quickly smooth the butter over the omelet or serve as is -- the 
butter adds a gorgeous nutty taste. Season with salt and freshly ground white 
pepper and serve at once. 
</P>
<P>
 An omelet is cooked in about one minute. Fragile through and through, chervil 
doesn't tolerate heat. Add it at the last minute to something hot. It will 
release its oils at once. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does chervil dry satisfactorily -- but it freezes well. When you have a 
wealth of leaves, make chervil ice cubes of about three parts water to two 
parts chervil leaves and tender stalks, whole or chopped. Once frozen, 
double-bag the cubes so surfaces are protected from other odors. You can drop a 
cube into a simmering vegetable, soup or stew just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, freeze chervil in butter. Cream softened unsalted butter with as 
much chopped chervil as you can stuff into it. Chill in a block until firm, 
slice off pats, then freeze pats between sheets of freezer paper in doubled 
bags. Butter will hold its quality six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also keep chervil in mild-tasting oil in the refrigerator for 10 days. 
And its flavor makes one of the best herb vinegars: tuck a dozen stalks into a 
wine-size bottle of white wine vinegar.  
</P>
<P>
 It is customary in France to pull chervil's fine leaves from its stalks and 
use them whole rather than chop them. I think the stalks are so tender that 
it's a waste not to use them. Harvesting from the outside of the plant (the 
plant renews itself from the center) I snip stalks off a couple of inches from 
the base. Then I quickly rinse and chop the bunch. Chop chervil by hand, not in 
a machine -- a furious blade smashes delicate leaves in the chopping. 
</P>
<P>
 To enjoy chervil -- unless you can find it in a gourmet produce department or 
from an herbsman at a farmers market -- you must grow it yourself. Chervil 
leaves and stems are too fragile for shipping by the bundle.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chervil springs readily from seed -- you can have a small harvest in six to 
eight weeks. Let flowers of some plants go to seed, as plants self-sow readily 
in the garden. My chervil-of-the-moment is the third generation of plants in 
that place.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are several sorts of chervil. Plain chervil looks like minuscule 
flat-leaf parsley and curly-leaf chervil looks like flat leaf parsley furled. 
True curled chervil is hard to find. It's been my experience that you can order 
curled chervil but you'll be sent the plain -- annoying. Brussels Winter 
chervil is a cultivar said to have larger leaves and be slower to go to seed -- 
it may be. I've grown it, but after so many years of seeds from different 
sources and so much volunteering, all I know is I have flat-leaf chervil and I 
love it. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the parsley family, chervil is an annual -- that is, it dies at 
the end of one season. It flourishes in cool weather in any soil, although it 
does best in earth that's fertile and kept on the moist side.  
</P>
<P>
 Customarily, chervil is sown in early spring then again in late summer -- it 
dies down in heat. One of the many happy things about life in Southern 
California is that we can stretch the growing season. We can sow chervil now, 
whether in the ground or in pots. Containers should be 12 inches deep and 
anywhere from one gallon on up, depending on the number of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 To germinate, seeds need soil or a soilless medium at 55 degrees, and they 
need light, so don't cover them. Just keep them moist until they sprout, then 
cover with a veil of soil. Plants are supposed to be about eight inches apart, 
but I sow sparsely and never thin them. Chervil doesn't like being 
transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they're on their feet, ideal circumstances for chervil is an air 
temperature between 0 and 75 degrees. Indoors, you can keep pots in an east 
window. Outdoors, chervil can take full sun in cool climates, but wants dappled 
sun or bright shade elsewhere. Since edible plants for shade are few and far 
between, chervil's the more valuable in the garden -- it makes a charming 
fill-in or ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the books say it can grow one and a half -- even two -- feet tall 
when flowering, our chervil has never been more than 10 or 12 inches high. 
They're an airy mound when not in bloom, then small white stars shoot up on 
stems above it. When seeds form, they're long and thin with sharp ends -- 
something like an elongated dill seed. They, too, can be used in cooking. If 
you sow a pinch of seeds every couple of weeks until warm weather approaches, 
you'll have chervil all year round. Then, in the ground, self-sowing kicks in, 
and you won't have to think about chervil again. As the weather warms, leaves 
can turn reddish bronze, very pretty.  
</P>
<P>
 As with its leaves in cooking, the chervil plant is ruined by too much heat 
but embraces cold. In our garden after a snowfall, the ferny mounds shake off 
ice crystals and are perky as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm bound to add that chervil plants can seem capricious. A friend who's a 
devoted gardener said he hasn't yet got the secret of chervil's success -- and 
in the beginning, a couple of sowings in our garden came to nothing. Because 
it's so amiable and because demand for chervil seed is not enormous, my 
suspicion is that when chervil doesn't come up or grow well, it's because the 
seeds are either old or they've been covered in sowing or they've been sown 
when the air is hot.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get started with this glad leaf, you, too, will wonder why chervil 
doesn't grace every garden and table -- and be delighted it graces yours.

 For a first course that's light, unusual, and whets the appetite, you can do 
no better than a clear broth speckled with chopped chervil and threaded with 
angel's hair pasta. If not homemade, use canned ready-to-serve broths, not 
murky powders, cubes or strong condensed soups. I made this soup recently to 
precede a hearty oxtail stew followed by chicory salad, with fresh pineapple 
sherbet for dessert. When a friend called the next day to schmooze about the 
evening, I was pleased that the first mention was of my soup. CLEAR CHERVIL

VANILLA IN LOBSTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people think of vanilla as a flavoring for pastries and ice cream. But 
smart cooks use vanilla beans in roasted lobster and even steep the fragrant 
pod in cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
 To a generation of North Americans brought up on vanilla wafers and vanilla 
custard, this use of a tropical flavoring in savory dishes may seem outlandish. 
But it's common practice among French chefs around the world. Patrick Gateau, 
chef of the Carl Gustaf Hotel in St. Barthelmey, French West Indies, scrapes 
the tiny black vanilla seeds into a dulcet sauce for salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla is the fruit of a giant tropical orchid, a perennial vine that can 
grow to lengths of 350 feet. The edible part of the plant is a long, slender 
pod that contains millions of tiny black seeds. Native to the rain forests of 
southern Mexico and Central America, vanilla is one of the most important 
ingredients that the New World added to the global larder. (Other such foods 
include chocolate, chiles and tomatoes.) Today, the spice is cultivated 
throughout the tropics, from St. Lucia and Brazil to Madagascar, Java and 
Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Spanish landed in Mexico, vanilla already enjoyed the status of a 
princely flavoring. It was a frequent flavoring in the frothy beverage 
chocolatl . The Aztecs called vanilla tlilxochitl . Our word comes from the 
Spanish vainilla , literally "little scabbard," an apt description of the 
bean's sword-like shape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike chiles and chocolate, which became immediate hits in Europe, vanilla 
took a while to catch on. For a century after its import to Spain, it was used 
almost exclusively as a flavoring for chocolate. It wasn't until 1602 that 
Queen Elizabeth I's apothecary, Hugh Morgan, suggested that vanilla could be 
used as a flavoring. The 18th-Century French found a curious use for the 
fragrant spice -- they used it to scent tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla grows best on hot, humid mountainsides in the tropics. The beans ripen 
at different times, so each plant must be picked over repeatedly until all of 
its 40 to 50 pods reach the proper degree of maturity. At this stage, the pods 
will be yellow-green in color, four to 12 inches long and up to one inch in 
diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, the vanilla bean has no flavor at this stage. The distinctive scent 
is acquired through a lengthy curing process. The traditional method calls for 
the pods to be dipped in water, baked in the sun, then swaddled in blankets to 
"sweat" and ferment overnight. Three weeks of this process, followed by several 
months of drying, reduces the bean to a slender, shriveled, dark-brown pod 
bursting with tropical fragrance and flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important chemicals responsible for the bean's haunting aroma 
is vanillin, a compound that forms tiny white crystals on the pod's surface as 
the vanilla bean ferments. The French call these crystals givre (frost), and 
they are an important indicator of a high-quality vanilla bean.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of quality is length: The long, slender beans from Madagascar and 
Tahiti are considered superior to the short, stubby beans from the Caribbean. 
But fresh vanilla beans of any size will have more flavor than the bottled 
extract most of us grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla beans are generally sold by the piece in glass tubes or bottles. When 
buying them, seek out fat, flexible pods that feel heavy in your hand. Avoid 
dried-out or brittle beans. According to Gateau, the best vanilla comes from 
Taa in Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla beans aren't inexpensive (I recently paid $3 for a bottle of two 
pods), but a little can be made to go a long way. To use a vanilla bean, cut it 
in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Scrap the tiny black seeds with the 
point of the knife into the dish you're preparing. A half vanilla bean is 
sufficient to flavor two cups of custard, ice cream or applesauce. Place the 
bean in the milk over low heat and let it infuse for 20 minutes, then make your 
custard or ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The infused pod can be rinsed off, dried and placed in a jar of granulated or 
powdered sugar. In a few days, you'll have a wonderful vanilla-flavored 
sweetener. If you prefer the convenience of vanilla extract, you can make your 
own by steeping a few vanilla beans in a flask of vodka. Just store it away 
from light. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla has the ability to bring out chocolate's sweetness without making it 
seem cloying. The French like to pair vanilla with fruit, adding the perfumed 
pods to jams, compotes and applesauce. The most famous vanilla dessert is 
probably creme brulee, a silken custard invented at Cambridge University (where 
it was known as plain old "burnt cream") and recognizable by its telltale 
dotting of vanilla grains and caramelized sugar topping. 
</P>
<P>
 But desserts are only a starting point. Vanilla has a remarkable way of 
bringing out the natural sweetness of savory dishes, especially seafood. The 
celebrated French chef Michel Guerard has been known to add a few drops of 
vanilla to hollandaise sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some people may remain skeptical about adding vanilla to savory dishes. The 
following recipe, a specialty of the Carl Gustaf Hotel, is designed to make 
them believers. Save the vanilla pod for making flavored rum or sugar.  
</P>
<P>
 PATRICK GATEAU'S ROASTED SALMON WITH VANILLA SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, with skin 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound spinach, stemmed and rinsed 
</P>
<P>
 Vanilla Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Season salmon to taste with salt and pepper. Heat oil in non-stick oven-proof 
skillet and brown salmon pieces, skin side down, over high heat. Place skillet 
and fish in oven. Roast salmon at 400 degrees until cooked to taste, 10 
minutes. To test for doneness, press fish with finger. It should break into 
flakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Steam spinach in steamer or in covered pot with small amount of water until 
tender, about 2 minutes. Drain and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, arrange spinach in centers of 4 plates. Place 1 piece of fish on 
top. Spoon Vanilla Sauce around fish and serve at once. Makes 4 servings. 
Vanilla Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons minced shallots 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup fish stock or bottled clam juice 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1 scant tablespoon honey 
</P>
<P>
 1 vanilla bean 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Melt butter in saucepan. Add shallots and cook over medium heat until tender 
but not brown, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to high. Add wine and boil until 
about 1 tablespoon liquid remains. Add fish stock and boil until about 2 
tablespoons liquid remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk in cream and honey and bring sauce to boil. Cut vanilla bean in half 
lengthwise with paring knife. Scrape tiny seeds into sauce with tip of knife. 
Discard vanilla pod. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.

SOUP OR SALAD

<P>
 Rice, beans and chorizo usually add up to a delicious, long-simmering stew or 
soup. However, the mix is also excellent when served at room temperature as a 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
 As curious as it sounds, rice, bean and chorizo salad is a great dish. First 
of all, it transforms leftovers. Extra cooked rice, a half can of beans or bits 
of vegetables get a great make-over in this recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also relatively fast. For those who want a dish bursting with flavor but 
don't have two hours to cook it, this is the answer.  
</P>
<P>
 The base of this salad is chorizo, but other uncooked spicy sausage, crumbled 
into small pieces, can be substituted. The key to success when using sausage is 
to cook it thoroughly and drain it completely before mixing it into the other 
ingredients. Otherwise it will be greasy and unpalatable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Complete the Tex-Mex accent of this entree by adding cilantro, green onions 
and sweet red pepper. The combination is as good-looking as it is delicious. 
RICE, BEAN AND CHORIZO SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound chorizo 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup converted rice 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup cooked black beans (rinsed, if canned) 
</P>
<P>
 1 small sweet red pepper, cored, seeded and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped green onions 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Break chorizo into small pieces and place in medium pan. Cook over medium 
heat, stirring frequently, until thoroughly cooked, about 10 minutes. Remove 
meat with slotted spoon onto paper towel-lined plate to drain completely, then 
place in salad bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat in pan. Add rice and saute 2 minutes. Add 
water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until rice is 
tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, add black beans to chorizo in salad bowl along with sweet red 
pepper, cilantro and green onions. Add rice when tepid. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir together vinegar and oil in cup. Pour over rice mixture and toss gently 
but well. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Makes 2 servings.

 NEVER TOO BOARD: Four-term County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who soon will 
become the senior member of the board, has no shortage of hats to wear. . . . 
He's on boards for the county's Transportation Authority, Housing Authority, 
Sanitation District and El Toro Re-Use Planning Authority -- as well as the 
county Law Library. He also hosts a cable-TV public affairs show. . . . This 
week, the Fountain Valley Republican got even busier: He was appointed by Gov. 
Pete Wilson to serve on the non-salaried board of the state Film Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE CAME ANYWAY: Popular Mexican actress-singer Lucero was a huge hit at a 
recent Anaheim mariachi concert, but she says she had strong misgivings about 
showing up because of California's support of Proposition 187. . . . Lucero 
says her fellow country people urged her to boycott because of the measure. But 
says Lucero: "I wanted to show support for Latinos who live here." 
</P>
<P>
 DON'T ASK: When Election Day victor Caryl Lee takes over from incumbent Dan C. 
Dutcher in Municipal Court in Westminster, that will make 19 women judges on 
Orange County benches -- just 18% -- with still just four on the Superior 
Court. . . . That's fewer than when Appellate Court Justice Sheila P. 
Sonenshine (above) was on the Superior Court bench in the early 1980s. How many 
women judges should there be? . . . . Remarked Sonenshine: "I can't say a 
number. When no one ever has to ask the question, then there will be enough." 
</P>
<P>
 TOO JUDGMENTAL? Sonenshine was the only Santa Ana appellate justice on the 
November ballot. Though she's highly respected by lawyers and colleagues, you 
couldn't tell it by the ballots: She was confirmed, but more than 225,000 -- 
almost 47% -- voted against confirming her for a 12-year term. She chose not to 
speculate on their thinking when asked. But one in the legal profession 
suggested: "Some people just don't like judges."

 CHARITIES: Valley charities have experienced a roller-coaster year. Many 
nonprofits were devastated by the earthquake but others found that it was 
actually a blessing in disguise. . . . The earthquake derailed plans and pushed 
off scheduled events, causing a loss of funding. Volunteer ranks dropped as 
people either were too busy putting their lives back together, or moved away. A 
Special Report on Valley charities begins on B1. 
</P>
<P>
 SCHOOL PRAYER: As Republicans and Democrats wrangle over the politically 
charged issue of school prayer, the students who will be most affected by the 
proposals are engaged in their own debates. The answers are no easier to come 
by in seventh or 12th grade than they are in Congress. (B1) . . . "In a way 
it's kind of good, maybe it will start people's day off better; but in a way 
it's kind of bad because some people don't have a religion and you can't force 
it on people," said North Hollywood High student Akila Baskin. 
</P>
<P>
 GIVING THANKS: It is a uniquely American holiday, but there are as many 
different ways to celebrate Thanksgiving as there are different kinds of 
Americans. A Special Report on the many reasons Valley residents have for 
giving thanks and the many ways they do it begins on B1. . . . Christy Nierva 
and Nina Bisquera (above) enjoy a holiday meal at El Torito in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSE CALLS: Death is never further away than a moment of ill luck or 
inattention. In a frightening instant, a Jeep spun out of control on the San 
Diego Freeway -- and a family survived without a scratch. . . . The Around the 
Valley column looks at the fragility of life. (B5) 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSE QUARTERS: It was about as far away from home as most could imagine, but 
for the 3,700 inmates of the Peter J. Pitchess jail Thanksgiving passed behind 
bars. . . . Cooks at the jail served up more than a ton of turkey and 4,800 
slices of pumpkin pie. (B4) Aaron Curtiss

 BOUNCING BACK: Quaint little roadside stands spilling over with harvest fresh 
from nearby fields are part of the charm of Ventura County. . . . But this 
year, the Medfly infestation near Camarillo and subsequent malathion spraying 
have hurt produce sales. Merchants say they are only now beginning to rebound, 
nearly eight weeks after the first fruit fly was found (B1). . . . Sales -- 
which had plunged by as much as 50% -- slowly crept up after some farmers 
launched campaigns to regain consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 WINNING WAYS: Jack Farrell's coaching style may be unconventional, but 
apparently it works for the Thousand Oaks High School boys' cross-country team 
(C12). . . . The Lancers have won six Southern Section major-division titles 
since 1980. The school also swept the boys' and girls' Division I titles, 
making Thousand Oaks the first program to win both major-division section 
titles in the same year. . . . A spirit of dedication helps, Farrell said. 
"It's a team with a very low whine factor." 
</P>
<P>
 LIVING HISTORY: The hard work is done, and tonight Dudley House in Ventura, a 
restored, Victorian farmhouse, will celebrate with a gala grand opening (B1). . 
. . Organizers hope the 103-year-old house will serve as a living museum, 
offering visitors a glimpse of how Ventura County farming families lived in the 
late 1800s. . . . Preservationists are pleased to have saved another local 
historic structure. In the city of Ventura, nine places have been declared 
historic landmarks by the county's Cultural Heritage Board. 
</P>
<P>
 HOLIDAY PURSUITS: Moviegoers are expected to begin lining up at theaters this 
weekend as the holiday season opens. . . . In Ventura County, some theater 
owners expect just a trickle of patrons because people will be busy with 
another post-Thanksgiving pastime -- shopping. "A lot of people drop off their 
kids while they hit the stores," said Katie Thompson of Oxnard's Carriage 
Square Cinema. Adrianne Goodman

 Just as the top burghers of Stockton were voting not to let their townsfolk 
carry concealed weapons, the city parents of the peaceable town of San Juan 
Bautista, north of Salinas, found to their dismay that they already owned 
concealed weapons enough for a small insurgency movement. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Bautista doesn't even have a police department anymore--they had to 
disband it because they couldn't afford it. But before the SJBPD folded, 
someone bought it a concealable, fully automatic 9-millimeter machine gun that 
can spray 1,200 rounds a minute and be fitted with a silencer. At that rate, 
the gun could shoot everyone in the town of 1,630 in a little over one 
minute--quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Other weapons turned up too--10-millimeter pistols and a sniper rifle--to the 
great perplexity of the City Council, which had already refused to sell the big 
gun to gun dealers and a movie company. So the city decided this week to 
destroy its "mistempered weapon." San Juan Bautista is now patrolled by one 
sheriff's deputy, who finds a .357-caliber revolver adequate to the task.

 I'd New York if I could find it there in New Jersey: First, the New York Times

 When the space shuttle set down at Edwards Air Force Base in October, the

 And last Sunday's magazine cover story on the wonders of New York (what, 
again?) asked the press agent's question, what could rival the up-and-surgent 
42nd Street as the capital of the world? "The Tokyo Stock Exchange? CNN Center? 
The intersection of the Hollywood and Santa Monica freeways?" 
</P>
<P>
 We would never suggest that, in part because we are a modest people, and in 
part because there is no interchange of the Hollywood and Santa Monica 
freeways.

 Animal rites, simian and sylvan: Koko the verbal gorilla--she who can "sign" 
several hundred words and understand about 2,000, which would put her in an 
honors program these days--may have saved the forest primeval. Residents' 
opposition was joined by a plea from the Gorilla Foundation in Woodside that 
logging 36 adjacent acres of old-growth redwoods on the San Francisco Peninsula 
could induce a heart attack or imperil Koko's breeding chance--and the state 
agreed to deny a logging permit.

 RoboDeer, a kind of audio-animatronic deer, has a forest beat to keep real 
deer from illegally becoming venison. Robo has already taken a bullet from a 
man who mistook it for the real thing, backed up his pickup to illuminate Robo 
with the headlights, and cranked off eight shots. Game wardens videotaped the 
encounter and charged the man with four offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rewired from his battlefield wounds, RoboDeer--one of three donated by the 
Mule Deer Foundation--is on duty again, a decoy for snagging poachers, who kill 
about 60,000 to 70,000 deer each year here.

 Now Oakland is embarking on the same experiment--and lest you think that 
parking meter currency is necessarily small change, the Oakland "cash key" will 
be selling in denominations of $10, $20 and $50.

 Here, in car heaven, we still do it the traditional way. We swear that meter

 Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) should be denied the chairmanship of the Foreign 
Relations Committee because of remarks he made about President Clinton, two 
Democratic lawmakers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) and Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) urged incoming Senate 
Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) to withdraw support for Helms' chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms has been strongly criticized by several Democrats, including Clinton, 
for his remark that the President was so unpopular with the military that "he'd 
better have a bodyguard" if he visited North Carolina bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms said in a statement Tuesday that he had made a mistake. 
</P>

 In a telephone interview, Kerrey said he sent a letter to Dole outlining his 
concerns about Helms' remarks about the President. The letter was also signed 
by Daschle, who is seeking the post of Senate minority leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole had said Wednesday that Helms' comments about the President should not 
keep him from becoming chairman.

DAVID BERG; FOUNDER OF CONTROVERSIAL SECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leader of the Children of God, a controversial Christian sect that began 
in a coffeehouse near the Huntington Beach pier and later became involved in 
conflicts with the law around the world, is dead, his followers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Berg was 75, said Rachel Scott, a spokeswoman for the organization 
speaking from Leire, Leicestershire, in central England. The group claims a 
membership of 6,000 adults and 3,000 children in 50 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg had been in hiding since 1971, and Scott said she was informed of his 
death two days ago in a telephone call from Berg's wife, Maria. Scott said she 
did not know what country Berg was in when he died, or when he died. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fell asleep in his sleep, peacefully," Scott told Associated Press, 
quoting Berg's widow. "He was getting weaker and weaker; he died of old age, 
basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Berg will now the lead The Family, as Children of God now calls itself, 
a statement said. She is to continue living in hiding, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been with this organization 23 years, and I don't know where they are," 
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a traveling preacher, Berg organized the Children of God as a small, 
Christian commune in 1968. Berg, himself the child of evangelists, preached an 
anti-Establishment, apocalyptic creed. 
</P>
<P>
 As the movement grew, Berg, known to his followers as Father David and Moses 
David, started spreading a bizarre collection of prophecies. The comet 
Kohoutek, he predicted, would doom America. He charged that Jews and blacks 
were conspiring to ruin the world. 
</P>
<P>
 What made Berg and his followers stand out, however, was their fervent 
espousal of a free-love gospel to gather new converts, which eventually 
escalated into allegations of sexual abuse of children in a number of 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has been investigated by authorities in Argentina, France, Spain, 
Australia, Venezuela and Peru on charges of forced menial labor, child abuse 
and using prostitution to attract recruits, but no members have been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the group -- with a new, more wholesome and conservative image 
-- has returned to Orange County.

E. HAWKINS; U.S. DANCE INNOVATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Erick Hawkins -- the grand old man of American dance, who burst into stardom 
with Martha Graham in the 1930s only to break away 20 years later to 
choreograph a style of his own that helped shape modern ballet -- has died in 
New York City at 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates said that Hawkins, who suffered a crippling stroke in 1988 that 
forced him into a wheelchair but sapped none of his vigor and enthusiasm for 
the art he pursued for 60 years, succumbed to prostate cancer on Wednesday 
after a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his infirmities, Hawkins continued his work almost until the end, 
directing students at Hunter College in New York earlier this year as they 
experimented with new steps in "Each Time You Carry Me This Way," a dance he 
choreographed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, President Clinton awarded him the National Medal of the Arts, 
citing the "unique talent" that had enabled Hawkins "to place dance in a larger 
cultural and philosophical context." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Trinidad, Colo., Hawkins earned a degree in the classics at Harvard 
University before studying modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg and George 
Balanchine, the latter generally considered one of the greatest choreographers 
of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 While performing as a charter member of Balanchine's Ballet Caravan in 1936, 
Harkins met premier choreographer Martha Graham, joining her company as her 
first permanent male dancer and remaining a principal performer in her troupe 
for a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many works in which he created roles were "American Document" in 
1938, "Letter to the World" in 1940, "Appalachian Spring" in 1944 and "Stephen 
Acrobat" in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins and Graham married in 1948. It was a troubled union, one that Hawkins 
later called "a dumb mistake on my part. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The age difference alone (she was 15 years his senior) made for problems," he 
said. "But the worst part was Martha's jealous fury over my success. One time, 
a critic singled me out for a favorable notice. . . . For the next week, my 
life was unbearable." 
</P>
<P>
 There were artistic differences, too -- Hawkins espoused a "free-flow" 
approach, while Graham was more disciplined. Nonetheless, he admitted that she 
was a source of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martha taught me to live with courage," he told an interviewer years later. 
"She had a vision and she went after it. . . . I've always been grateful to her 
because she unleashed the imagination so that in inventing movement, I was 
reckless in trying to find new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 After two tempestuous years, Hawkins and Graham divorced and he went on to 
form his own dance company, working in collaboration with composer Lucia 
Dlugoszewski. 
</P>
<P>
 The Erick Hawkins Dance Company won kudos for its innovative artistry -- 
espousing Asian modes of time, space and perspective years before such 
viewpoints became fashionable -- but for years it struggled financially, 
largely shunned by mainstream audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were tough years, but they paid off," Hawkins said later. "Somehow, we 
kept going. Somehow, we always had just enough money and recognition. . . . 
Somehow, all that slow growth made me dig deeper. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to learn to keep away from negativity, from cynicism, from becoming 
jaded," he said. "When we stay in anger, envy or frustration, we cannot 
function. . . . People, like plants, must be allowed to flower." 
</P>
<P>
 With concert works such as "Here and Now With Watchers" in 1957, "Geography at 
Noon" in 1964, "Tightrope" in 1968 and "Classic Kite Tails" in 1972, there came 
a modest measure of financial success and renewed recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, do you get attention for the right reasons?" he asked an 
interviewer a few years later. "All this vainglorious stuff is sickening. I'm 
not interested in that." 
</P>
<P>
 He may not have been vainglorious, but the trim, craggy-faced performer 
certainly was vain. 
</P>
<P>
 When, in 1977, Horst Koegler's Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet listed 
Hawkins' year of birth as 1909, it drove him into a rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "God damn him," Hawkins exclaimed, pounding a table with his fist. "That date 
is not true." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was. And although he continued dancing well into his 60s, finally, in 
1976, he had to leave the performances to others, concentrating all his efforts 
on choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 The works continued: "Plains Daybreak" in 1979, "New Moon" in 1991, "Each Time 
You Carry Me This Way" in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his last efforts, completed earlier this year, was "Many Thanks," which 
he said was choreographed in appreciation of the many people who touched his 
life and made it possible for him to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm grateful," he said.

PLOCK, POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I woke up this morning in my block apartment building just over a mile from 
Petrochemia, the largest oil refinery in Poland, I could not help believing 
that your correspondent must have experienced a particularly bad day here in 
Plock. While "Plock, Poland -- For Better or for Worse" (World Report, Nov. 1) 
adequately describes the difficulties Plock has had adjusting to free-market 
reforms as well as the town's accomplishments, the article exaggerates certain 
negative aspects, which is unfair to this city by the Vistula that is trying 
very hard to deal with these changing times. It falsely reinforces the Western 
stereotype of Eastern Europe by portraying Plock as a heavily polluted and 
backwards industrial wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
 During my eight months in Plock, I have smelled very rarely the "rotten egg" 
odor with which Dean Murphy so graphically introduced his article. Indeed, the 
air quality in Plock has improved dramatically over the last few years, and it 
is much better than in many other Polish cities and certainly far superior to 
the air quality in Los Angeles. Also, Plock is not a city in which horse-drawn 
carts regularly "plod" down the main streets. I wonder how long the 
photographer must have waited for the right moment to take the picture of the 
horse-drawn cart.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the economic hardships of recent years, the signs of progress in Plock 
and the pride of its people are hard to miss. The evidence is in the freshly 
painted buildings on the city's main shopping boulevard. It can be seen in the 
work crews who busily are repairing the city's streets and installing new brick 
sidewalks. It is in the decorative Western-style displays which are being 
placed in retail store windows. Some pictures of these things would have been 
more representative of what is really happening here in Plock.

SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WARILY LOOKS AT INCOMING CONGRESS; GOP MAY BACK RESEARCH 
IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST BUT BALK AT OTHER FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once the post-election bluster and posturing fade, the new Republican majority 
in Congress will have to come to grips with the harder reality of budget making 
and governing. History suggests that certain underlying national priorities and 
imperatives will ultimately blunt some of the rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal research and development budget is a case in point. Even during 
the Reagan years, that budget grew by 26% after inflation, according to the 
American Assn. for the Advancement of Science. To be sure, much of that was 
related to President Ronald Reagan's military buildup. But the trend continued 
under Reagan's Republican successor, George Bush, who shifted toward civilian 
needs after the Cold War. President Clinton has pushed still further toward 
non-military purposes, flirting with establishing an American industrial policy 
by supporting commercially exploitable research. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Republican vow to cut federal spending has potentially profound 
implications for American science and technology. The $73 billion spent on 
research and development represents a sizable portion of the $500-billion 
discretionary part of the annual domestic budget that is not committed to 
entitlements.  
</P>
<P>
 The academic science community sheds no tears for at least one result of the 
November elections: the departure of Rep. John D. Dingell as chairman of the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee. His hard-nosed probes of alleged waste and 
misdeeds by scientists, universities and national laboratories made the 
Michigan Democrat a bete noire of science. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming lineup of Republican chairs in key science committees is still 
unclear. But it appears that most of the key players are likely to be 
Republican moderates who understand that the federal government plays an 
essential role in supporting basic scientific and medical research that cannot 
be done by private industry. They include Reps. Jerry Lewis of California, John 
E. Porter of Illinois, F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin and Sherwood 
Boehlert of New York and Sen. Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 These Republicans probably will help protect the budgets of such agencies as 
the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and NASA, as 
well as the research budget of the Defense Department, which still pays for 
more than half of federal research and development. However, we are concerned 
that conservative "no-nothings" could still damage potentially lifesaving 
medical research. Clinton and the new Congress should resist efforts to renew 
puritanical and self-destructive curbs on research into sexual behavior or to 
reimpose restrictions on key medical research that uses fetal tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Republicans are likely to protect key basic research in the national 
interest, they will surely demur when it comes to Clinton's efforts to use 
government to enhance American economic competitiveness by supporting certain 
emerging technologies. They have vowed to kill the new Advanced Technology 
Program, an arm of the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards 
and Technology. This program, the fastest-growing in government, gives 
companies grants to pursue research into "enabling" technologies related to the 
information superhighway, environmental monitoring and other civilian endeavors 
leading to new products. 
</P>
<P>
 To many Republicans, this amounts to "industrial policy," or undue 
interference in the free market. To the Clinton Administration, it is a modest 
answer to the heavy-handed role that European and Japanese governments take in 
advancing their strongest industries. Our view is that this program should be 
modified to give the government some return if the investment pans out for the 
companies getting the grants. But Congress should not let ideological blinders 
prevent the nation from giving this experiment enough time to see whether 
government can indeed help stimulate American economic prowess. For decades, 
Republican and Democratic administrations alike bolstered defense industries in 
times of hot and cold wars. Why not the new peacetime technologies?

THE WEAPON OF CHOICE; DIPLOMACY IS A WINNER AS U.S. GETS KAZAKHSTAN'S 
MILITARY-GRADE URANIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The foreign policy crises that make headlines are those that involve 
slaughter, starvation and flight. Sadly the list is long: Haiti, Somalia, 
Bosnia, Rwanda, Burundi, East Timor and others. But when foreign policy experts 
list the major threats to international security, scarcely any one of these 
tragedies is at the top. What tops a great many such lists is nuclear 
proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 This fact is what makes the quiet, admirably professional negotiation that led 
to U.S. acquisition of half a ton of weapons-grade uranium from Kazakhstan a 
greater security achievement than any of the Clinton Administration's other 
recent foreign policy successes. This lethal material could have been used to 
make dozens of bombs, and it was recovered from a region from which nuclear 
material was making its way onto the black market last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War counts only if nuclear war -- the almost unimaginable 
horror that made the Cold War what it was -- also is ended. The termination of 
the decades-long armed standoff between the United States and the former Soviet 
Union has ended the likeliest scenario for nuclear Armageddon. Unfortunately, 
the collapse of the Soviet Union and of the totalitarian control that Moscow 
had maintained over its citizens has greatly raised the potential for nuclear 
smuggling and nuclear blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the worst anxieties have centered around Kazakhstan. Because this 
now-independent republic lies at the interior of what was the Soviet Union, it 
was home to many weapons installations. But it is a Muslim country to which, 
for cultural reasons, emissaries from Iran and Afghanistan have relatively easy 
access. Islam is no more equated with terrorism than any of the other major 
world religions; at the same time, terrorism by Muslim extremists is too large 
a fact of international life to be passed over in discreet silence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration negotiators, led by Ambassador William H. Courtney, 
a former nuclear arms negotiator, deserve credit for a service to the cause of 
international security. Their success comes as a reminder that if, as Prussian 
general Karl von Clausewitz said, war is "a continuation of political 
relations, a carrying out of the same by other means," then the reverse is also 
true. Some military or national security goals can only be pursued by political 
relations, and nuclear non-proliferation is one. No increase in military 
spending could accomplish what this negotiating team has accomplished. Whatever 
the social chaos in Kazakhstan, whatever the certainty of exporting its nuclear 
war-making capability, U.S. military intervention would remain out of the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 As we confront nuclear terror in the form it will take in the years ahead, 
brilliant diplomacy will by far surely be the defense "weapon" of choice.

TRUE GRIT AND TRUE INSPIRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A memo to Huong Tran Nguyen's college instructor: Your foolish, racist remark 
has been proved wrong decisively. However, your words have proved to be one 
heck of a motivator. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen arrived in the United States as a student while the Vietnam War was 
raging. She says a college instructor told her she would never be as good a 
teacher as the white aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
 That remark spurred her to prove to the instructor and to prove "to myself 
that there was not a goal I could not reach if I put my mind to the task," 
Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 So over the years Nguyen taught elementary and high school in San Diego, as 
well as teaching reading to older students for the San Diego Job Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to Westminster, home to many of Orange County's Vietnamese 
Americans, and taught in Long Beach, where she established Polytechnic High 
School's language program for students with limited language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Nguyen received deserved recognition, with the Walt Disney Co. 
honoring her and 12 other teachers across the nation for their "teaching 
skills, rapport with students and ability to inspire." Nguyen and her high 
school each received $25,000, and the Long Beach Unified School District 
received $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards were a reminder that we are fortunate to have such teachers to 
inspire us with dedication and determination. As teachers are asked to do more 
important things for our society with fewer resources, society owes them a 
profound debt of gratitude.

U.S. ARMS EXPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your story "U.S. Weighs New Arms Sales Policy" (Nov. 15) omitted an important 
implication of the revised policy. Taking into account domestic economic 
considerations in approving arms exports isn't going to increase sales to 
democratic nations -- they are already welcome to buy all they can afford. 
Economic considerations will instead be used to justify weapons sales to 
potentially repressive or aggressive regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interests of the U.S. arms industry, are we about to start exporting 
tanks and missiles to countries like Croatia, Burma and, before long, Syria? As 
both Iran and Iraq demonstrated, selling weapons doesn't buy allegiance to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 With arms exports by Russia down, it is depressing to see our government 
encouraging U.S. producers to fill the gap. Arms spending is a terrible waste 
of resources in this era of massive social and environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be politically smart for the Administration to give a boost to the 
defense industry, but it stinks from another point of view. It takes a long 
time to change global attitudes about fundamental issues like arms spending, 
but someone has to set them in motion. When is President Clinton going to begin 
thinking beyond two-year time frames?

FED INTEREST RATE INCREASE

 Re "Fed Hikes Interest Rates; Increase Is Biggest of the Year," Nov. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 I am sooooo confused! I thought that "inflation" was having my costs go up 
without any offsetting value. The Federal Reserve Board's increase in the prime 
rate and discounts will increase the cost of living for everyone with a 
variable rate mortgage, everyone carrying a line of credit, everyone with a 
credit card balance, everyone in business borrowing money, everyone building 
homes and everyone buying homes without any offsetting value -- and they are 
doing this to avoid "inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 My cost of living is guaranteed to go up without any offsetting value because 
of the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, based on the "possibility" of it 
going up due to inflation next year? What am I missing?

 The hike in interest rates put into effect by the Federal Reserve Board, and 
the Republican takeover of House and Senate committees close a vicious 
equation: Our financial masters make it clear they intend that at least 6% of 
us will always be unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Our political masters insist that the unemployed, after two years, shall 
receive no support. If the unemployed cannot support their children, then the 
children will be taken from them. If the unemployed steal to feed their 
children, or to keep their children from being homeless, then they must go to 
prison, for a long time, to learn their lesson.

 What inhumanity! What hypocrisy, claiming the past elections as a triumph for 
Christian values.

 Robert Kuttner's overly simplistic view (Commentary, Nov. 14) of recent 
Federal Reserve Board actions displays a surprising ignorance of economics and 
the complex reasoning behind interest rate adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the oft-repeated "natural" rate of employment as dictating Fed action, 
Kuttner completely ignores relevant currency and monetary policy issues. The 
dollar's long-term slide against the yen and German mark, and the causal effect 
on the real value of U.S. debt and trade deficit are of crucial importance in 
Fed decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that the Federal Reserve Board is "denying Clinton the fair fruits of 
his economic program" and should be held "democratically accountable" to 
politicians and an electorate with myopic agendas and little concept of 
economics further demonstrates this article's absence of credibility.

 If the American people are unhappy with the pace of our economic recovery, 
don't blame President Clinton. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, a Republican 
appointment, is obsessed with sacrificing a potentially strong economic rebound 
at the altar of exaggerated inflationary fears. It is my hope that the 
President will not reappoint Greenspan, when his present term expires, early 
1996.

 At last! A thoughtful criticism of the Fed. Kuttner's piece is right on! I 
believe it was Harry Truman who said, "What we need is more one-armed 
economists. Every time you ask one a question, they give you an answer followed 
by 'on the other hand.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The divergence of opinion among economists is reason enough to examine the 
track record of those in charge. Greenspan wrote letters to the bank regulators 
asking them to exempt 14 savings and loans from the more Draconian regulatory 
provisions of the law due to their great expertise in dealing in sophisticated 
investments. Of those 14, only two are left in business. The remaining dozen, 
including Lincoln Savings, were turned over to the Resolution Trust Corp. He 
subsequently was appointed to his present position at the helm of the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone should question his judgment in raising interest rates based upon 
clearly flawed economic assumptions, today! 
</P>

<P>
 Kuttner very accurately points his finger in the direction of the saboteurs of 
President Clinton's economic plan, Greenspan and his team of economic advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that a U.S. economy, gradually pulling itself from the morass of 
recession, is being cavalierly choked off by Greenspan, just because he and 
members of his bandwagon have their way. It is all the more ironic that the 
President is stymied to act. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it is high time Congress came to the rescue to empower any U.S. 
President with the choice of picking his economic team, including the choice of 
who his Federal Reserve Bank chairperson will be -- after all, the President 
assumes the sole responsibility for the fallouts from his presidency, including 
what economic picture is portrayed by his Administration.

WHY WORRY ABOUT GOVERNMENT? WE'RE ON AUTOMATIC FAST FORWARD; FUTURE: THE 
DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY IS SET BY FORCES BIGGER, STRONGER THAN ALL OF 
WASHINGTON.

 An ideological battle has been raging between conservatives and liberals in 
the United States and Western Europe -- a battle that would be comical, if not 
for its ferocity and for the millions of dollars dissipated on political 
campaigns. Implicit in this conflict is the assumption that whoever controls 
Congress or occupies the White House will determine the direction the country 
takes on such fundamental issues as immigration, crime, "traditional values," 
the future of the family, the work ethic, welfare reform and the size of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 On these issues, it hardly makes a difference who is President or controls 
Congress. These tracks are propelled by long-term irreversible forces such as 
decentralization, diversification, technologization, globalization -- and are 
hardly affected by ideology or partisan politics. Here are some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Millions of legal and illegal immigrants will continue to cross national 
borders no matter what policies are adopted or how massive the barricades. It 
is absurd to think that in our global age, when a mounting avalanche of 
information and goods and dollars pours across borders every single day, that 
somehow people would stay and marinate in their ancestral homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 If it no longer matters how many Portuguese or Belgians translocate freely 
across Europe, or how many Indonesians and Thais work in Malaysia, why does it 
matter how many Mexicans work in the United States or how many U.S. citizens 
work in Canada? In our burgeoning global economy, there are no "illegal 
immigrants" -- only irrelevant borders. In our global age, territoriality is 
hopelessly anachronistic. 
</P>
<P>
 * It is ridiculous to continue emphasizing such traditional values as "hard 
work" and the "work ethic" (and by the same token, disdain welfare), yet invest 
billions of dollars every year on automation and ever smarter machines that 
permanently jettison millions of jobs and disassemble the old labor-intensive 
economics. Hard work was a precondition to survival at one time and therefore 
glorified. In our times of global surpluses and smart self-replicating 
machines, hard work is dumb economics. Hard work is a deterrent to greater 
prosperity. We can now produce more while working less. We are like the 
Japanese who overdose on hard work not because there is any longer the need, 
but simply because of workaholic programming.  
</P>
<P>
 In postindustrial societies, tens of millions of people are now on light-work 
schedules -- temporary jobs, part-time jobs, telecommuting, shared jobs, flex 
time, etc. These are steps in the right direction. Rather than insist that 
everyone work simply to satisfy puritanical, workaholic traditions, why not 
deploy our smart machines to create greater prosperity for everyone so that 
people can work less and coast more?  
</P>
<P>
 * The persistent emphasis on family values is yet another dead issue that sets 
off peoples' alarms. Even if every federal and state office in the United 
States were occupied by the Christian right, the nuclear family would still 
continue its downward slide. Nothing can reverse this trend.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1950s, the traditional nuclear family has dropped from representing 
around 85% of American homes to less than 10%. How illogical to think that 
profound changes could unfold in all areas of society but not in our homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the people attached to the nuclear family invest in the thriving 
genetics industry and in new reproductive technologies, perhaps unaware that 
their investments are eroding age-old patterns of procreation and parenthood. 
Rather than attempt to salvage a 20th-Century lifestyle that is in an 
irreversible tailspin, why not encourage new lifestyles to ensure intimacy and 
continuity in our new environments? 
</P>
<P>
 * Government will continue to have less and less impact on peoples' lives. The 
trend everywhere is away from traditional concentrations of power. The more 
centralized the sources of information were, the more powerful the centers of 
authority (family, church, government). As information decentralizes, the 
relative power of government declines. This is particularly evident in 
postindustrial societies like ours. Since the 1960s, the most profound 
transformations in the United States have been spearheaded by forces and people 
outside government -- the women's movement, the biological revolution, the 
globalization of life. Government no longer routinely sets the pace and is less 
able to decelerate the profound recontextings going on everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter who occupies the White House or Congress, trends that started 
decades ago are now on automatic fast forward. No one can derail them. An 
administration may call itself conservative or liberal, but the environment in 
which it operates and which propels it is revolutionary.  
</P>
<P>
 In the postindustrial world, elections are no longer an accurate gauge of a 
society's direction. This is as misleading as assessing the popularity of the 
Vatican by the size of crowds that greet the Pope in the streets and not paying 
attention to the fact that these crowds then go on to ignore church teachings 
on divorce, abortion and women's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 It is absurd to want better technologies and a growing economy, yet still call 
for "traditional values." Technology and values are part of the same continuum 
-- you cannot decouple the two. If you want advances in one area, you have to 
accept advances in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than dissipate millions of dollars on nasty campaigns that attempt to 
freeze frame the past, we should encourage new values and lifestyles and 
policies which will bring us greater cohesion, abundance, leisure and growth as 
we prepare to liftoff to a new century.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; REALITY BITES 'SENDING' COUNTRIES; PROP. 187 
FALLOUT WILL LEAD TO REGULATION OF EMIGRATION FROM LATIN AMERICA AND THE 
CARIBBEAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a graduate professor of political 
science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about everything that could be said and written about Proposition 187 was 
published or stated before the Nov. 8 election, with one possible exception: 
what the actual consequences of approval might be for the home countries of the 
soon-to-be disentitled migrants, the 15 or so nations of Latin America and the 
Caribbean that generate migratory flows representing, over time, more the 5% of 
their total population. Leading this category are Mexico, most of Central 
America, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and the Caribbean states. (Colombian and 
Caribbean emigrants are concentrated in the American East, but the ripples of 
Proposition 187 will be nationwide.) For all these countries, the change in 
immigration altitudes in the United States will have a crucial impact. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a shift in U.S. immigration policy may have a paradoxically beneficial 
impact on Latin American immigration policy. Already Mexican President-elect 
Ernesto Zedillo, in a quick swing through El Salvador and other Central 
American nations last week, was forced to acknowledge that Mexico's treatment 
of undocumented Salvadoran migrants is not much better, and often worse, than 
U.S. behavior toward Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 This problem is far more widespread than is suspected, and extends beyond the 
case of Central and South Americans passing through Mexico on their way north. 
Bolivians and Paraguayans in Chile, Argentina and southern Brazil, Colombians 
in Venezuela, Peruvians just about everywhere -- all suffer many of the same 
manifestations of extortion, discrimination and human-rights abuses that 
Mexicans are subjected to in the United States. In the coming confrontation on 
the fallout from Proposition 187 and in subsequent negotiations on migratory 
matters, Latin American self-righteousness will appear particularly unseemly in 
the light of wanton abuses by immigration authorities south of the Rio Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly and more important, most Latin American governments, and above all 
Mexico, will now have to retreat from what had been a notably successful 
posture on emigration issues for nearly half a century: looking the other way. 
For Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Cuba (in 
its own way), Ecuador and Peru, emigration has not only not been a problem; it 
has functioned largely as a partial solution to many of these nations' domestic 
dilemmas. True, the unemployment safety-valve theory is not totally accurate; 
most emigrants have jobs and leave to seek better-paying ones. And there is a 
high cost involved for a society that sees its most dynamic and adventurous 
souls depart for another land. But by and large, the advantages of large-scale 
outflows, legal or not, far outweighed the drawbacks, which were, for the 
governments in question, minor indeed: the indignity of abuses committed 
against Latin American nationals by U.S. authorities, employers or rival 
minorities, and the political fallout from confronting or caving in to 
Washington on these issues.  
</P>
<P>
 The new attitude in the United States is adamantly for change in immigration 
policies, ranging from the Draconian remedies of Proposition 187 to the less 
emotional recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform. These, 
along with the Border Patrol's stepped-up policing across from Tijuana and its 
blockade in El Paso, all indicate that Latin American governments will no 
longer have the luxury of looking away. The plight of "undocumented" Mexicans 
and other nationals in the United States -- their actual or perceived 
disentitlement to constitutional protection or even civil decency -- will be 
seen in the home countries as outright abuse, forcing governments to "do 
something." Even so, migration will continue; more rigorous enforcement of U.S. 
laws and borders will make crossing more difficult and expensive but not 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Herein lies the third consequence of Proposition 187. It will in all 
likelihood put migratory matters where they have never really been in 
hemispheric relations: on the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central American presidents who met with Zedillo have already taken a 
first step with their Mexican counterpart by deciding to include the migration 
issue on the agenda of the Western Hemisphere summit in Miami next month. Many 
business and political leaders in Mexico are now espousing the stance that very 
few (including this writer) staked out during the NAFTA debate: that Mexico 
should have pressed for a chapter on immigration, even if that meant 
complicating the treaty's ratification. 
</P>
<P>
 But negotiations on migratory problems between generating and receiving 
countries are a complicated process. They generally end in a basic trade-off, 
as happened most recently between Washington and Havana: expanded legalization 
of out-migration in exchange for sharing the responsibility of regulating it. 
This does not necessarily mean that Mexico should patrol its own borders, as 
Fidel Castro basically agreed to do with the beaches of Cojimar. Nor does it 
imply that the United States, after a decent interval, would begin, for 
example, to accept far more legal immigrants from El Salvador than it publicly 
acknowledges, as it had done with the Cubans in Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does signify that the governments of Latin America must soon face a 
cruel conundrum. They will have to negotiate the numbers of their countrymen 
who wish to leave, by inference leaving the others to a cruel limbo. And in 
order to reach agreements with the United States on these flows and their 
legality, they will be obliged to become involved in regulating them, by 
volume, destination, season and profession or type of skill. None of this will 
be easy or pleasant -- or palatable to large segments of Latin American public 
opinion. But if California's record of anticipating swings in U.S. public 
attitudes is any indication, it will be probably be unavoidable: The sentiment 
behind Proposition 187 seems to be here to stay, even if its details and 
mechanics are not.

TODAY'S GOP ISN'T LOOKING SO GRAND TO ITS WOMEN; POLITICS: THE EMPHASIS ON 
REGULATING PERSONAL BEHAVIOR IS OFFENSIVE TO THE PARTY'S TRUE TRADITIONAL 
VALUES.

 The polls were barely closed Nov. 8 before Republicans all over the country 
uncorked the champagne, and the celebrating hasn't stopped since. 
</P>
<P>
 Having won with the male vote in 1994, Republican strategists -- who are, not 
coincidentally, all themselves men -- will undoubtedly continue to rely on this 
group as the key to 1996. A key component of their strategy involves catering 
to the religious-right groups claiming credit for this year's Republican 
victories. The so-called gender gap, which helped Democrats take so many races 
in 1992 by winning a majority of the women's votes, proved inconsequential this 
year. The social issues that tend to be a priority for women voters were not 
factors in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Republican movers and shakers believe that they've overcome the 
problems that cost them the executive branch in 1992, they're in for a rude 
awakening come November, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping counsel only with those like themselves, these men are ignoring the 
gradual change in the national electorate over the past decade, which has seen 
a steady erosion in party loyalty. Human nature being what it is, they will 
probably continue to do so until they've lost enough national elections that 
they're supplanted by a younger, more in-touch -- and, dare I say it? -- 
perhaps more diverse group of strategists. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: Since 1989, I have spoken with many lifelong Republican women 
all over the country who have re-registered as Democrats or independents 
because they perceive a party dominated by religious extremists as no longer 
representing their interests. Others remain registered Republican but privately 
confide to one another that they're ashamed to admit it to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Even many Republican women candidates themselves shy away from too close an 
association with the party. During the Washington mayor's race, Republican 
nominee Carol Schwartz was quoted in the New York Times as saying she 
considered herself "a Republican in name only." The article went on to 
characterize Schwartz as a fiscal conservative and strong supporter of tough 
crime control who nevertheless favors abortion rights, gay rights and easier 
access to drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, such beliefs would have been seen as exemplifying the true Republican 
principles of individual liberty and personal responsibility. By today's 
Republican standards, they're considered radical and liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Continued acceptance of an anti-abortion platform, along with other 
religious-right doctrines that repudiate the essential tenets of Republicanism, 
will doom the national party to the same situation the Democrats found 
themselves in from the McGovern years until 1992, or worse, to a slow and 
painful demise. In future years, political historians may view the religious 
right as a Trojan horse that the Republican Party initially welcomed with open 
arms, only to see itself destroyed as that minority cost Republicans national 
elections by driving away mainstream voters.  
</P>
<P>
 The ranks of women voters turned off by the present Republican Party 
transcends any one social or economic group. A recent Times Mirror study 
revealed that the middle of the national political spectrum is now dominated by 
a largely female swing vote. Terming this group "new economy independents," the 
study reported that this segment is composed of almost one-fifth of all voters 
and is not anchored in either party.  
</P>
<P>
 These women's conflicting political values make them a potential source of 
votes for either party. At the same time that they associate themselves with 
fundamental religious beliefs, favor mandatory sentencing for violent criminals 
and dislike government regulation, they are also pro-choice and highly tolerant 
of homosexuality. Because many are financially pressured single mothers, their 
priorities differ in crucial ways from those of men in the same socioeconomic 
group. For example, they solidly support government spending on job-training 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The male Republican movers and shakers haven't bothered to take these women 
into account and are likely to continue to overlook them in 1996, an oversight 
that will very likely cost them the presidency. But it's still not too late for 
them to wake up and start reaching out to other potential Republican 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm not holding my breath. Chances are, come November, 1996, when I and 
other women arrive at the voting booth, we will once again find ourselves 
looking at the top of the ballot -- and reluctantly pulling the Democratic 
lever.

<P>
 It has been close to 100 years since President Theodore Roosevelt stood 
beneath the majestic stone archway at the north entrance of Yellowstone 
National Park and proclaimed the democratic ideal that has become the informal 
credo of the national park system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the preservation of the scenery, of the forests, of the wilderness life 
and wilderness game for the people as a whole, instead of leaving the enjoyment 
thereof to be confined to the very rich who can control private reserves," 
Roosevelt declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The people have enjoyed, in numbers that annually outstrip the National Park 
Service's ability to accommodate, look out for or clean up after. But the 
numbers don't tell the whole story. In Yellowstone and elsewhere in the park 
system, Roosevelt's vision of democracy does not square with reality. 
</P>
<P>
 As the nation's population has grown increasingly diverse, the system's 368 
parks, monuments, historic places, seashores, waterways and recreation areas 
have remained largely the province of middle- to upper-class white people. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Native Americans each make up 
a tiny fraction of those who visit the nation's most treasured natural 
preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for a handful of urban parks, the national park system would be 
white and elitist," said Gary Machlis, a Park Service sociologist whose office 
has surveyed 20,000 visitors at 60 parks. Those surveys indicate that nearly 
50% of visitors had household incomes of more than $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by the trends, National Park Service Director Roger Kennedy said in a 
recent interview that the parks must attract a broader slice of the American 
people or eventually risk losing taxpayer support for their $1.5-billion annual 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kinds of people who saved the parks in the first place are declining 
relative to the rest of the population," he said. "That requires us to reach 
out our hands and make new friends and allies in the fight to continue to take 
care of the wonderful resources that we are in charge of protecting. The 
survival of these places depends on our success in building a new 
constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of ethnic imbalance also has troubling implications for the future. 
If coming generations of Americans, 50% of whom won't be white by the middle of 
the next century, are indifferent to the nation's most spectacular outdoor 
places, what will happen to public support for protecting natural resources? 
"No diversity. No biodiversity," one Park Service official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The imbalance is partly a byproduct of one the parks' great virtues -- their 
remoteness from the clamor of urban life. With minorities and immigrants 
typically clustered in large cities, only the more affluent are likely to know 
about the parks, let alone go to them. Moreover, some minorities that do use 
them express wariness about traveling to remote places through rural America. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Service officials shoulder some of the responsibility for the absence of 
diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're victims of our own isolation," Kennedy said. "We need to make stronger 
connections with school systems. We need to start putting visitor centers in 
the middle of cities. We can't assume that you already know it's neat to go 
camping in the Santa Monica Mountains because you have a family camping 
tradition that Grandpa started." 
</P>
<P>
 "What if Grandpa wasn't around? What if he was living somewhere south of 
Chihuahua?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even before ethnicity was an issue, there was an air of exclusivity about the 
national parks that belied Roosevelt's ideal. The feeling was encouraged from 
the earliest days, when the railroads built grand hotels in Yellowstone and 
Glacier parks to entice well-heeled travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "During Yellowstone's first 50 years, it catered largely to the first-class 
trade," William C. Everhart wrote in a 1983 history of the Park Service. "It 
was operated in a way to discourage the less favored." 
</P>
<P>
 A brash English journalist named Rudyard Kipling captured the spirit when he 
curled his lip at the prospect of sharing the parks with common folk. Arriving 
at Yellowstone on July 4, 1889, Kipling stepped into a rowdy mob of holiday 
visitors and immediately recoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in Yellowstone park and I wish I were dead," Kipling moaned. "The 
tourists -- may their master die an evil death at the hand of a mad 
locomotive." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1920, Yellowstone was receiving 20,000 visitors annually. Last year, 3 
million came. In all, Americans made 270 million visits to national parks in 
1993. The grand hotels are still there with room prices of more than $200 in 
some cases. On the other hand, park entry fees average about $5 and their 
cabins, motels and campgrounds offer some of the best travel bargains in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 But if their modern popularity suggests that the parks ultimately did become 
places for the "people as a whole," as Roosevelt put it, the demographics say 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Park Service survey at nine sites found that minorities made up 7% of 
visitors. (They constitute one-quarter of the nation's population.) The survey 
looked at several of the most popular parks, including the Great Smoky 
Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee, Grand Teton in Wyoming and 
Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies reveal a similar pattern in California. A 1991 review of visitors at 
Yosemite, conducted by researchers at Texas A & M University, found that more 
than 80% of visitors were white, less than 6% were Asian American, less than 5% 
were Latino and less than 3% were African American. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites accounted for 95% of the visitors to the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area in the Los Angeles Basin, according to a 1992 Park 
Service study. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the trends don't hold true for foreign visitors, who arrive in 
droves, often in the most inhospitable weather. One explanation officials give 
is that a package tour of parks offers foreign tourists an economical way to 
see the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities who do visit the parks often express a strong attachment to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like the parks," said Margaret Juarez, a Los Angeles doctor of 
Mexican ancestry. "The people who work in them are special. They are so open 
and helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 But Juarez is apprehensive about traveling to parks outside the Southwest. "I 
look Indian. When I go to one of the parks in Arizona, I'll stay at a hotel on 
a Navajo Reservation where I know people are going to think I am one of them. 
But I haven't gone to any of the parks in Wyoming or Montana, and I guess that 
has something to do with the feeling of apprehension about going into unknown 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the pressure to lure more Americans is creating a problem for the 
Park Service just when it is trying to ease overcrowding by reducing traffic 
and scaling back lodging and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas A & M study of Yosemite also reported that overcrowding was a main 
factor cited by Californians of all races who avoid the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, an increase in incidents of violence and occasional racial flare-ups 
at parks, including Yosemite, have soured some segments of the public on 
diversity initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bringing more minorities into the parks would probably raise the crime rate," 
said one letter that is typical of several responses to an article promoting 
diversity in National Parks, a magazine published by the nonprofit National 
Parks and Conservation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Park Service administration is not the first to grapple with the 
issue of diversity. For more than 20 years, the agency has tried to reach out 
in various ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1970s, it began creating big city parks such as Gateway National 
Recreation Area in New York City and Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 
San Francisco close to ethnically mixed urban neighborhoods. The Park Service 
also expanded the number of monuments honoring nonwhite historic figures such 
as Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Atlanta monument honoring King has become a magnet for black 
visitors, long years of segregation still cast a shadow over many parks, 
especially in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 At Florida's Canaveral National Seashore, for example, Supt. Wendell Simpson, 
an African American, said 95% of visitors are white. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking longer than anyone thought for the stigma (of segregation) to 
wear off," he said. "I was hoping my presence here would change things, but 
after four years I cannot say it's made that much difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the South, the cost of getting there has been the main reason 
minorities haven't traveled to the parks. But poverty is not the barrier it 
once was. By the beginning of this decade, minorities were traveling almost as 
much as whites and likely to take longer trips, according to travel industry 
surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Norma Pratt, president of a 300-member association of black travel agents, 
said she has seen virtually no interest among black tourists in the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people two generations away from sharecropping are interested 
in going back to the fields on their vacations," said Pratt, adding, "When 
people who have been poor a long time suddenly can afford a vacation, they're 
going to want to spend it on something a little more luxurious than a 
campground in the middle of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Yosemite Ranger Sheldon Johnson, an African American, said he thinks attitudes 
about vacationing in the wilds would change if people saw some of the country 
that he has been living in for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has worked at four Western parks and, at times, was the only black 
employee. The social isolation would get to him, he said, if the outdoor life 
weren't so appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being up here, and I love teaching other people about the wilderness," 
said Johnson, who conducts a nightly interpretive program on coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other minority employees readily agree that there are cultural 
obstacles to enjoying the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many minority Americans are urban dwellers susceptible to the same creepy 
crawly unease felt by any city dweller contemplating a first trip to the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's everything from bugs to snakes to dirt to the idea that you may have to 
travel through rural America, where you might not be made to feel welcome," 
said Jerry Belson, a black former assistant superintendent at Yosemite who 
directs Park Service operations in southern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Belson knows firsthand what it's like not to feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, he asked to be transferred from Yosemite after unpleasant 
experiences in a neighboring community. His daughters' high school gave the top 
prize in a Halloween contest to two children in Ku Klux Klan outfits and a 
third who was in black face with a noose around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made it known we wanted the principal fired," Belson said. "Then my kids 
started getting harassed and we decided we'd had enough." 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other minority Park Service employees make a point of 
distinguishing between those experiences and the treatment they receive from 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life inside the park is very rewarding," Belson said. "It's like family. It's 
the reason I can stand in front of people and tell them that despite some of 
the experiences I've had I would strongly recommend a career in the Park 
Service." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he believes the Park Service could go a long way toward making minority 
visitors feel more comfortable simply by hiring more minority employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Park visitors are comfortable with people they can relate to," Belson said. 
"If you're not going to have people of color working in the parks, you are not 
going to attract people of color as visitors."  
</P>
<P>
 Only seven of Yosemite's 600 permanent employees are black. Twenty-one are 
Latino and five are Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the Park Service's professional staff, including rangers, is 87% 
white, 6% African American, 4% Latino, about 1% Asian American and about 1% 
Native American. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Service officials insist that they are trying to diversify the work 
force, but point out that low starting salaries -- around $14,000 for a ranger 
-- and shabby living conditions at many parks have hampered their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Park Service has been looking for new ways to highlight 
the role of minorities in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, it opened the Manzanar National Monument at the site of a World War 
II detention camp in Central California. Its purpose is to tell the story of 
Japanese Americans who were interned there. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, it changed the name of Custer Battlefield National Monument 
in Montana to Little Big Horn Battlefield. This was part of an effort to make 
Native Americans feel more welcome at a site long identified with the last 
stand of an army officer engaged in driving them off their ancestral land. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are also evaluating a plan for a monument in southeast Idaho to pay 
tribute to Shoshone Indiansmassacred by the U.S. Cavalry in 1863. And they 
contemplate a site that would pay homage to the Underground Railroad, the 
network of black and white abolitionists who smuggled slaves out of the South. 
</P>
<P>
 At established sites, the Park Service is exploring the past with a pointedly 
populist flavor. With the aid of letters and oral histories, the American 
experience is being presented from the perspectives of ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be interesting for a minority person to go to a site dedicated to a 
President or a general or a captain of industry," said James Horton, a special 
assistant to the Park Service director. "But you won't hold their attention 
long if you don't let them see their own history writ large in these places." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is happy with what the Park Service is trying to do. Some critics 
accuse it of trying to turn the parks into open-air classrooms for anti-white 
revisionist history. Agency officials insist they are not promoting any 
particular point of view, but admit they risk alienating people who think that 
national parks and monuments -- unlike universities -- should stay away from 
social commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gwaltney, superintendent of Booker T. Washington National Monument near 
Roanoke, Va., acknowledged that some of the exhibits on race have been 
unsettling to some visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the teachers who bring their students here found it a little 
frightening," Gwaltney said. "There are images of the Klan and racial violence, 
and some of the teachers thought this was pandering to anti-white hatred. We 
felt it was an important element of the times, the post-Civil War period, that 
helped to shape Booker T. Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 But the warts-and-all approach to history at the parks clearly has its 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Susan, a Japanese American who recently visited Manzanar and the 
Pearl Harbor memorial in Hawaii, dedicated to the Arizona, the battleship sunk 
by the Japanese. Susan, who didn't want her last name used, said she thought it 
proper that the Park Service chose to honor both. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me sad to go to those places," she said. "But I was also glad that 
they have chosen to acknowledge what did happen. It's good the government 
doesn't want to hide things from people." The Parks 
</P>

ALLIES SEEK DMZ IN BID TO SAVE BIHAC; BOSNIA: SERBIAN REBELS ADVANCE ON MUSLIM 
TOWN; TAKEOVER COULD WIDEN WAR. 250 U.N. PEACEKEEPERS HELD HOSTAGE. NATO COULD 
USE AIR STRIKES TO ENFORCE WEAPON, TROOP BAN.

<P>
 The United States and its European allies moved Thursday toward declaring the 
strategically important Bosnian town of Bihac a demilitarized zone in a 
last-ditch effort to prevent it from falling to rebel Serb troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came at a high-level meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization in Brussels as Serbian forces began moving into outlying areas of 
the largely Muslim town, climaxing a two-week siege. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, in a further defiance of the West, Bosnian Serb troops 
surrounded and effectively took hostage about 250 French and Canadian U.N. 
peacekeeping troops at six locations around Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian nationalist leaders have warned they will stage an "all-out war" if 
the Western allies continue to try to impede their advance on Bihac. U.N. and 
Serbian envoys negotiated Thursday in a thus-far unsuccessful effort to work 
out a truce. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO action took the form of an agreement to use air power to enforce a 
demilitarized zone if the United Nations uses its authority to declare one. 
Western sources said they expect U.N. officials in New York and Croatia to 
announce such a step today. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by NATO essentially embraced a proposal that the Clinton 
Administration has been pressing for days. Until Thursday, however, the allies 
had resisted, fearing Serbian reprisals against European U.N. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Bihac is regarded as crucial because a takeover of the town by Serbian 
nationalists is considered likely to prompt the Bosnian government to pull out 
of negotiations for a permanent peace accord and could widen the war.  
</P>
<P>
 Croatia, which borders the Bihac area and has a large ethnic Serb minority of 
its own, has hinted that fighting might well break out in its own territory if 
Bihac is lost to the Bosnian Serb troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote in NATO on Thursday, which followed a nine-hour meeting that was 
interrupted by telephone conferences with U.N. officials, was essentially an 
agreement in principle to use NATO air power to help enforce a demilitarized 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far in the 2 1/2-year-old Bosnian civil war, however, U.N. leaders have 
hesitated to approve NATO air strikes, for fear of Serbian reprisals against 
the U.N. peacekeeping troops -- most from Europe and none from the United 
States -- on the ground in the war-ravaged country. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides paving the way for establishment of the demilitarized area, NATO's 
policy-setting North Atlantic Council also voted to extend the "no-fly zone" 
over Bosnia about four miles north into neighboring Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was designed to enable NATO warplanes to prevent the Serbs from using 
airfields in Croatia as staging areas for bombing raids against Bihac, as they 
had until Monday, when NATO jets bombed Serbian runways there. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the so-called "weapons-exclusion zone," as such arrangements are 
called in Bosnia, were left to be hammered out by officials of the U.N. 
Protection Force in Bosnia, which controls U.N. peacekeeping troops. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Western officials said the zone includes an area within a two-mile 
radius of Bihac's center, with the addition of a section to the north that 
contains a large Muslim population. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the allied dictum, both sides -- the Bosnian Serbs and the 
largely Muslim Bosnian government -- would have to keep their troops, tanks and 
artillery out of the weapons-exclusion zone or risk attack by NATO warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations and NATO have already set up similar zones around Sarajevo, 
Bosnia's capital, and Gorazde, a major city. The restrictions in Sarajevo, 
however, apply only to heavy weapons and not to ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's action by NATO marks the most sweeping warning that the allies have 
given the Serbs in connection with the siege against Bihac, which has been 
intensifying since early November, when Muslim forces began recapturing some 
Serb-held territory in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday and Wednesday, squadrons of NATO warplanes launched air strikes 
against Serbian targets -- including an airfield in Croatia from which Serbian 
aircraft had been bombing Bihac -- but the attacks were largely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 European governments have been reluctant to take more aggressive action for 
fear that rebel Serb leaders would retaliate and attack French, British, Dutch 
and Canadian peacekeeping troops, who are only lightly armed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Europeans have warned that if their own ground troops are attacked, they 
will expect the United States to send U.S. forces in to help rescue them, as 
President Clinton has promised. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had initially proposed an exclusion zone with a six-mile 
radius, but the allies rejected that as too provocative. Two miles, they said, 
would more than cover the town. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Europeans began to have second thoughts after Serbian 
nationalists troops finally started closing in on Bihac. They now are reported 
likely to back the U.S. plan, albeit reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the promise to enforce a demilitarized zone, NATO officials also 
condemned the recent Serbian attacks on Bihac and urged all sides to continue 
their diplomatic efforts to work out a truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasushi Akashi, the chief U.N. envoy in the former Yugoslav federation, said 
Thursday that he had worked out a possible cease-fire in talks with Serbian 
leaders in Belgrade, but local Serbian nationalists had not yet accepted the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cumbersome procedure involved in Thursday's NATO action, spokesmen 
for the organization left no doubt that the allies were alarmed by the 
continuing rebel Serb threat to Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Shea, NATO's chief spokesman, told reporters at a briefing that the 
alliance had been "extremely preoccupied" by the deterioration of the situation 
there and stood ready "to use its air power" to protect the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied officials said creation of a demilitarized zone around Bihac would be 
done under existing U.N. authority and would not require approval of another 
resolution by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they said Security Council approval would be required to extend the 
"no-fly zone" into Croatia -- a move that could run into opposition from 
Russia, which is one of the five permanent members of the council and has veto 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has already raised objections to Wednesday's NATO air attack on 
Serb-controlled missile sites, contending that military action by the West 
could only lead to "prolonged bloodshed" in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Willy Claes, NATO's secretary general, said Thursday that the West had no 
desire to get into a war, but he said Wednesday's action had come under 
authority of a previous U.N. resolution, which Russia had backed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's push by Serbian nationalist forces surrounding Bihac effectively 
trapped thousands of civilians in the town. Fighting also flared in Sarajevo as 
Bosnian Serb forces shelled the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate indication when the Serbs might free the 250 French and 
Canadian peacekeeping troops whom they had detained. U.N. officials said the 
peacekeepers had not been harmed.

SAN DIEGO: READY FOR PRIME TIME AT LAST?; IMAGE: CITY, REJECTED BY GOP IN '72, 
PUSHES HARD FOR PARTY'S '96 CONVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 New York is the Big Apple, Dallas the Big D, and New Orleans the Big Easy. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to hosting national political conventions, San Diego -- the 
pretty, sunny ingenue of cities tucked away in the nation's southwest corner -- 
is the Big Hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone among the nation's biggest cities, San Diego has never hosted one of 
these quintessentially American events that have mixed democracy and tomfoolery 
since the short-lived Anti-Masonic Party met in Baltimore in 1831. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego came close once to hosting one of the quadrennial wingdings, 
painfully close. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972 the city was chosen -- and then spurned -- by the Republican Party, 
which feared the taint of a political scandal and radical demonstrators. The 
insult of losing the convention has smoldered in the civic breast ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that slight may finally be rectified: San Diego, New Orleans and San 
Antonio are finalists for the 1996 Republican National Convention, with the 
decision expected in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the inside is willing to say which of the three cities is the 
front-runner. But there is cautious optimism locally that this may be the year 
that San Diego finally is welcomed into the family of truly big cities, those 
places that Mayor Susan Golding calls "the 500-pound gorillas capable of 
handling a major political convention." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Gov. Pete Wilson -- former San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson in these 
parts -- is riding the crest of a recent landslide and being talked up as a GOP 
presidential contender. And don't forget that California has 54 electoral 
votes, the most of any state. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego also has a gleaming new convention center, a forest of new high-rise 
hotels and a revitalized downtown, and is at the forefront of political and 
economic issues dear to Republicans: Pacific Rim trade, NAFTA, conversion from 
lunch-bucket industries to high-tech and biotech, spurring small business 
growth, keeping government lean and battling illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 If San Diego emerges triumphant in the big-bucks competition to snag the 
convention, it may, at long last, provide a modicum of salve to the political 
wound left by the debacle of 1972. The city had been selected by President 
Richard Nixon to host the convention that year where he would accept his 
party's nomination for four more years. Nixon considered San Diego his lucky 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of arduous planning, the complex preparations were nearly 
complete, the bunting was ready to be draped, and the party hats and souvenirs 
were at hand. Wilson -- then in his maiden year as a fiscally conservative, 
socially moderate, environmentally hip mayor -- was eager to show the world 
that San Diego was major league. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen. Ninety days before the convention, the Republicans abruptly 
dumped San Diego and switched to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The official story was that the party was worried about labor troubles, a 
shortage of grade-A hotels with room service, problems at the San Diego Sports 
Arena, and a mob of anti-Vietnam War protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor was a scandalous memo from International Telephone and 
Telegraph lobbyist Dita Beard that got leaked to columnist Jack Anderson. Beard 
had bragged to her bosses that she could get an antitrust investigation against 
ITT dropped in exchange for a $400,000 contribution to the GOP convention in 
San Diego. The Sheraton ITT hotel in San Diego was to have been one of the 
convention headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 When the cancellation was announced, the civic sting was palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people felt it was a slap in San Diego's face," remembers John 
Lockwood, the city bureaucrat who was in charge of convention preparations and 
was dining in the White House with the head of the Secret Service and Sammy 
Davis Jr. when the cancellation was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a major blow to the city's psyche," remembers David Nuffer, a longtime 
Chamber of Commerce leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "A civic black eye," recalls Larry Thomas, who was Wilson's press secretary at 
the time and is still a Wilson political insider. 
</P>
<P>
 A story atop the front page of the San Diego Evening Tribune told a tale of 
confusion among the citizenry at the turn of events, including a banner spotted 
on a downtown building that asked plaintively: "What the Hell Happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 So enormous was the disappointment that Wilson went into full damage control. 
</P>
<P>
 Gently chiding the honchos of his own party, the mayor unilaterally dubbed San 
Diego as America's Finest City, a sobriquet it carries to this day. He decreed 
that San Diego would hold an America's Finest City Week festival to celebrate 
"the delight that is San Diego" during the same week the Republicans were in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage, however, was done. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be 16 years before San Diego officialdom would again summon the 
courage to even consider bidding for a national political convention. A flicker 
of interest at City Hall in bidding for one of the 1988 conventions died when 
construction of San Diego's waterfront convention center fell behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 1992 Republican convention, the GOP asked San Diego to enter the 
bidding at the eleventh hour, although conventional wisdom held that Houston, 
home to the sitting President, was a lock. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego officials, reluctantly and warily, made a bid. A flurry of press 
leaks said San Diego would get the nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston got the convention. The suspicion in San Diego was that the 
Republicans had only been toying with San Diego to get Houston to sweeten its 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, decision-making time for the 1996 Republican convention is approaching, 
and San Diego is in full pursuit, this time from the very opening of the 
competition. No last-minute entry, nothing shy, nothing halfway. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP leaders have already made one preliminary decision: New York was dumped 
from contention when its Republican mayor committed political heresy by backing 
Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, the community Zeitgeist says that at long last, the city may 
have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the same city it was in 1972," said City Manager Jack McGrory, 
repeating what has become a municipal mantra. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago, San Diego was not ready for prime time," said John Kern, a 
San Diego political consultant. "Now we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Among its virtues, San Diego has the nation's balmiest summer weather and a 
long list of tourist attractions: beaches, golf courses, the world-famous San 
Diego Zoo, Sea World, the Wild Animal Park, and a downtown night life that, 
while not nearly as jazzy and sexy and tasty as New Orleans, is hardly Dubuque. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the mix a telegenic Republican mayor, a willingness to remodel the 
convention center to fit the demands of network television, and a plan to raise 
millions of dollars from private donors to underwrite the Aug. 10-16 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're eligible to be married and you have been left at the altar like San 
Diego was, first in 1972 and then four years ago, you realize that things can't 
go on like this forever," said Reint Reinders, head of the Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. "They can only make you dance through the hoops so many 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to some the whole convention hustle is very San Diego, mixing giddy 
boosterism and deep-seated insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego is trying to act grown-up, but it just doesn't know how," said San 
Diego political consultant Ann Shanhan-Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another example of San Diego's constant need to have its self-image 
reaffirmed from the outside," said author Francine Phillips. "It's like, 'If 
they give us a convention, maybe we're OK after all.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips is the co-author, with talk-show host Roger Hedgecock, of a sassy 
paperback, "If We Say It Enough We'll Believe It," billed as "San Diego's 
Finest Book About America's Finest City." The humiliation of 1972, she said, 
left the city with a "communal cringe" at the idea of hosting a political 
convention and being the object of worldwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of want it, but we kind of don't want it," she said. "San Diego is 
looking over its shoulder, worrying, 'My God, what if we do actually get it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 No such ambivalence, however, is suffered by Mayor Golding. She wants the 
convention, thinks San Diego deserves the convention, and has made securing it 
a major priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego is the sixth-largest city in the country," she said, "and it is a 
great convention city." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a sticking point with San Diego's bid, it is the convention 
center, which, despite its stunning appearance and light, airy interior, is a 
bit small by the standards of national political conventions. The New Orleans 
Superdome it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has offered to rearrange, remodel and stretch the main ballroom to 
seat 19,400 and provide enough sky boxes to accommodate the networks and the 
VIPs. But the party's magic number, to take care of all the officeholders, 
party faithful and sundry fat cats, is a minimum of 20,000 and preferably more 
like 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some thought of using San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium for the final 
session, when the presidential candidate pledges his troth to the party, but 
the late-afternoon sun would force the candidate to squint or wear sunglasses, 
a no-no for television. 
</P>
<P>
 To trump New Orleans, San Diegans merely mention the summer weather: muggy 
there, gorgeous here. Humorist P. J. O'Rourke, a reluctant attendee at the 1988 
Republican convention in New Orleans, called his visit "like taking a sauna in 
a high-crime drainage ditch." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the GOP is inclined to win one for the Gipper, San Diego wouldn't mind 
in the least. Ronald Reagan was recruited to narrate a 16-minute video called 
"Sailing to Victory" touting San Diego as the perfect convention site. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an article of faith with business and political leaders that a political 
convention, with its gavel-to-gavel media coverage, is an unsurpassed 
opportunity for a city to strut its stuff and get the kind of attention that 
attracts tourists, business investors and blue-ribbon bond ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 The same was true in 1972 when Wilson saw the convention as a priceless 
opportunity to show the world that San Diego, long considered a cultural and 
political cul-de-sac, had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The convention was supposed to be Wilson's way to show the world that San 
Diego was no longer a sleepy Navy town and was going to be a force, both in the 
state and nation," said Bill Ritter, an organizer of anti-war protesters in San 
Diego in 1972 and now a correspondent for "Good Morning America" on ABC-TV. 
"Instead the city got caught up in a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritter and the other demonstrators went to Miami. G. Gordon Liddy's plan -- as 
related in John Dean's book "Blind Ambition" -- to kidnap and drug protest 
leaders and hold them in Mexico during the San Diego convention was never 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon all that was left of the convention-that-never-was were a few gags and 
trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
 A publicist gave Wilson a book supposedly detailing all the wonderful things 
the Republican Party had done for San Diego. The pages were blank. 
</P>
<P>
 John Beatty, who was then a reporter at KGTV Channel 10 in San Diego and is 
now editorial director at the station, had the presence of mind to save an 
ashtray and some drinking glasses with the emblem "Welcome Republicans. San 
Diego. 1972." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of stuff your kids throw away as soon as you die," Beatty said 
the other day.

SOUTHLAND, AND EVEN 2 TURKEYS, GIVE THANKS; HOLIDAY: ANNUAL VEGETARIAN EVENT 
HAS LIVE BIRDS AS GUESTS. ELSEWHERE, OBSERVANCES ARE MORE CONVENTIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The turkeys were fashionably late. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was one Thanksgiving dinner even they could enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Its sponsors spent nearly 90 minutes Thursday nervously scanning the parking 
lot at Rancho Park's picnic grounds in West Los Angeles, hoping to catch any 
sign of the stars of this health-conscious bash. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a faint cheer could be heard from across the picnic grounds. It 
quickly swelled to a roar and sustained applause worthy of matinee idols. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drumstick," a year-old tom, and "Fricassee," a 4-year-old Louisiana redbreast 
hen, had arrived -- riding in their crates like sultans in sedan chairs. They 
were here for the fifth annual "cruelty-free, cholesterol-free" vegetarian 
Thanksgiving celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Drumstick had been destined for someone's dinner table on Thursday, said Louie 
Moonfire of Malibu, the bird's vegetarian owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a production model that came from a farm with half a million turkeys 
that were slaughtered last week," Moonfire said. "I picked him out." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Fricassee, well, she is a special bird indeed -- "the oldest living 
turkey in captivity," according to Moonfire. "I raised her from an egg." 
</P>
<P>
 The birds were immediate hits and were given free run of the picnic, standing 
calmly for children and adults to pet them and perching on tables where their 
fans could admire them. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of nearly 200 vegetarians -- who ranged from toddlers to 
octogenarians -- gathered to celebrate the gospel of meatless diets under sunny 
skies and temperatures in the mid-70s that prompted some to strip down to 
halter tops or T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This dinner is for vegetarians who don't want to go to their friends', 
family's or neighbors' homes and see a carcass on the table," said Melissa 
Bergstron, a board member of the Vegetarian Society Inc., another sponsor of 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Dining with the health-conscious can have its drawbacks, though, as one man 
carrying a bag of charcoal briquettes under his arm discovered. He spent a 
quarter of an hour fruitlessly searching for someone with a match to start his 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 While the vegetarians' potluck picnic featured tables laden with a dazzling 
array of salads, fruit dishes, vegetables and juices, more traditional 
Thanksgiving meals with turkey and all the trimmings were served at missions 
and shelters across Southern California to thousands of homeless and needy 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of formerly homeless people put on a modest event intended as a 
sharp counterpoint to the customary mass holiday feedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Genesis I, a self-governing homeless village of geodesic domes 
just west of Downtown, sponsored their own free Thanksgiving dinner and invited 
"non-homeless guests," including volunteers and supporters of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The meal, coming on the heels of the first anniversary of the community's 
opening, was expected to feed several dozen people. "Probably we are the only 
group . . . where homeless are deliberately and conspicuously feeding 
non-homeless as well as homeless people," said Ted Hayes, a leader of the 
24-resident, privately financed project. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said he and other residents hoped to "stop this crazy cycle" of huge 
holiday feeding events. "It continues to generate in the minds of homeless, 
'I'm helpless. Woe and pity is me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It's self-perpetuating," said Hayes, arguing that more small-scale homeless 
shelters and feeding programs should be developed that encourage self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The vegetarians at Los Angeles' Rancho Park embrace that spirit of 
self-reliance and accepting responsibility, but they said they cannot condone 
what they see as the ultimate cruelty to animals: eating them. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman wore a T-shirt with the lengthy message: "Sad, but true. A 
meat-centered diet damages health, promotes cruelty to animals, wastes natural 
resources, pollutes the environment, contributes to world hunger. A plant-based 
diet provides your family with all the nutrition it requires." 
</P>
<P>
 A man who identified himself only as Jingles, "an animal freedom fighter," 
spread his animal rights buttons, T-shirts, bumper stickers and other wares on 
a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heart attacks: God's Revenge for Eating His Animal Friends," read one of his 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animal flesh is obtained through violent means," said Marr Nealon, an actress 
who chairs EarthSave L.A., one of three groups sponsoring the vegetarian 
picnic. "When one eats what was obtained in a violent way, one tends to project 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of town, the message was more basic: food and company for 
those in need. The Midnight Mission on Skid Row marked the 80th anniversary of 
its first Thanksgiving dinner. By mid-afternoon, the mission had served nearly 
2,000 meals, and a long line of people snaked down the block and around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started in 1914," said the mission's managing director, Clancy Imislund. 
"An old guy came down here and fed about 20 guys. We've been here ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 volunteers were involved in serving, as well as preparation of 
120 turkeys. "We had to turn away a number of (volunteers), all our shifts were 
full," Imislund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the biggest Thanksgiving feed in the Los Angeles area involved the 
county jail system, where approximately 20,000 inmates across the county dined 
on roasted turkey, all the trimmings and pumpkin pie. 
</P>
<P>
 A department spokeswoman said the jail staff began preparing the meal three 
days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who were expected to take advantage of the holiday fare was O.J. 
Simpson, awaiting trial on charges that he murdered his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Deputy Fidel Gonzales said the menu for all 
inmates would be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, meanwhile, thousands of hungry celebrants showed up for free 
Thanksgiving meals at area shelters, restaurants and soup kitchens, where much 
of the talk centered on cultural and ethnic diversity in light of the recent 
passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to support these kinds of gestures of generosity that cut across the 
suspicion and hatred that seem to be so apparent these days," Msgr. Jaime Soto, 
vicar for the Latino community at the Diocese of Orange, told the crowd 
gathered outside Casa Garcia Mexican Restaurant in Anaheim. Volunteers expected 
to serve 10,000 turkey dinners there by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for all of us to put that aside for at least one day 
to be generous with one another and thankful, not only for the gifts we have to 
share, but for having neighbors to share them with," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the traditionally prepared turkey, mashed potatoes, vegetables 
and pumpkin pie -- all cooked under a tent -- restaurant owner Frank Garcia 
said he was offering an ethnic twist: his special recipe for stuffing made with 
Mexican tortilla chips, rice and bread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loves it," said Garcia, who's been feeding the needy on 
Thanksgiving for eight years. "Today I'm eating with everybody and it makes me 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 That spirit seemed pervasive as volunteers circulated among the ethnically 
diverse crowd seated at folding tables, offering them drinks of lemonade and 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We volunteer because we have a lot to be thankful for," said Judi Flaherty of 
Anaheim, who said she's been serving food there for five years. "Thanksgiving 
is just one day in the year. You can always have your friends and family over, 
but it's nice to give yourself to your community." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a nearby table, Vincente Palacios, an immigrant factory worker from 
Mexico, smiled broadly as he ate his turkey dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the human warmth," he said. "You can see a lot of people from a lot of 
different places enjoying the same food. I think it's beautiful."

STARVATION, ISOLATION KILLING CHILDREN OF MEXICO INDIANS; FAMINE: OFFICIALS ARE 
AT ODDS OVER CAUSE AND NUMBERS, AS POVERTY-STRICKEN YOUNG TARAHUMARA ARE HARD 
HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A month before Guillermina Lirio died, her parents knocked on the door of the 
Indian boarding school, the only place they knew to seek help in this village 
high in the mountains of northern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-year-old was losing weight rapidly. With two older children to feed and 
almost no corn from this autumn's harvest, the Tarahumara Indian family had 
little to eat. The hungry baby cried constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Elena Guerra, a 22-year-old psychology student volunteering at the 
school, tried that afternoon and night to nourish the little girl with suero , 
a concentrated liquid nutrient, from the limited medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 When Guillermina was not better the following morning, the three adults 
carried her to the highway to hitchhike to the church-run Santa Teresita Clinic 
in Creel, 24 miles away. They waited all day by the road with the crying baby. 
They did not get a ride until nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 At the clinic, for 27 days, Guillermina received suero with antibiotics, and 
the nurses tried to give her milk. She died Sept. 11 of gastrointestinal 
disease, infections and severe malnutrition. That month, back in Rejogochi, a 
village of 25 families, there were three other deaths from starvation-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermina was one of 20 children who died of diseases related to 
malnutrition in a two-month period at the Santa Teresita Clinic, said Sister 
Virginia Briones, head of pediatrics there. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of children at the clinic are in various stages of treatment for 
malnutrition, several of them in critical condition. This is the time of year 
when the Tarahumara usually still have food from their harvest. Briones fears 
that the problem will get worse as undernourished children are unable to fight 
off the usual winter illnesses of pneumonia and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some places, blood is spilled with bullets," she said. "Here, my 
children's blood is being spilled with hunger." 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths have provoked a macabre argument -- with federal officials on one 
side and medical missionaries and the opposition party state government of 
Chihuahua on the other -- over how many children have died and how many of 
those deaths were really caused by starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 On one level, what is at stake is whether the federal government should 
declare the state a disaster area and provide relief funds. The deeper issue is 
the same one raised by the Jan. 1 Indian uprising in the southern state of 
Chiapas: How should a country aspiring to be a world economic power and 
ostensibly proud of its Indian heritage address the unremitting poverty of its 
native population of approximately 8 million? 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that poverty, the 60,000 Tarahumara are exceptionally vulnerable to 
Chihuahua's two-year drought, the worst in 40 years, according to a state 
government report. In Chihuahua, the state capital, the drought has meant 
bumper stickers urging people not to waste water. In the mountains, among the 
Tarahumara, it has meant hunger and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reports say more than 40 children have died since July. But because the 
Tarahumara live in remote villages scattered among the majestic canyons and 
wind-chiseled rock formations of the Sierra Madre, no one knows the exact toll. 
Many children die without ever seeing a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Briones said, malnutrition weakens children, making illnesses 
that would be routine in well-fed children fatal. Starvation may not be listed 
as the cause of death in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Those ambiguities have led to bitter arguments reminiscent of the United 
States' Vietnam-era obsession with body counts. Last month, Chihuahua Gov. 
Francisco Barrio angrily and publicly rebutted a federal report that only one 
child had starved to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions have become all the more acrimonious because of a mystique 
surrounding the Tarahumara that gives them a higher profile than most Indian 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tarahumara are famed as long-distance runners, and their territory is a 
requisite stop on any political campaign trail. The women's long, pleated 
floral skirts and bright scarves and the men's simple cotton loincloths make 
for striking photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 People now call the Tarahumara retiring and peaceful, but they were once 
alternately allies and enemies of the Apaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The last significant Tarahumara uprising occurred in 1918. Since then, they 
have responded to outside aggression by fleeing farther into the mountains. 
They have been forced into areas that are at best marginal for growing corn, 
the mainstay of their diet, according to William L. Merrill, a Smithsonian 
Institution anthropologist. Since 1977, Merrill has studied the Tarahumara, 
particularly in Rejogochi, a collection of log homesteads scattered in a wide 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing season here is from mid-April to mid-October. The success of the 
crop depends almost entirely on rainfall, Merrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, it did not rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no harvest," said Felipe Ramirez, a 24-year-old native of Rejogochi 
who teaches first grade at the 35-student boarding school. He picked about 110 
pounds of corn from his one-acre plot. Last year, the plot yielded 10 times as 
much, and the corn lasted only half the year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, Merrill calculated, the average household harvest was 1,320 
pounds, and even that often ran out before the next crop was ripe. Ramirez said 
he expects that he will be able to support his wife and 1-year-old daughter on 
the $110 a month that he earns teaching. But few others here have steady 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most villagers earn a little money by working at the communal sawmill, taking 
turns because there is not enough work to go around. They supplement that 
income by poaching wood from the nearby national forest, Ramirez said. Those 
who are able work in the fields in neighboring Sinaloa, a major farming state. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers here insist that the problems this year are far worse than the 
normally precarious conditions in the Sierra Tarahumara, as the region is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alicia Perez, a 20-year-old nurse at the government clinic in her hometown 
of Basihuare, a predominantly non-Indian community six miles away, said she 
believes conditions were worse two years ago. That year, a plague destroyed the 
bean crop and the government clinic had not yet been built. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that there have been a lot of advances in the two years since the 
clinic was built," she said. "You are always going to find that in the 
Tarahumara region, people are very poor." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the poverty, infant mortality rates among the Tarahumara are so 
high, according to a state government report, that women on average give birth 
to 10 children in the hope that half will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the villagers, the state government, run by the center-right opposition 
National Action Party, insists that this year is exceptional. The state's dams 
are at only 16% of capacity, and more than one-third of the rain-fed crops were 
lost this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Barrio's request that the federal government declare the state a disaster 
area was denied, but Mexico City has sent help, promising $18 million in farm 
subsidies and $1.5 million for health care, in addition to 500 tons of food. 
Two pediatrics residents arrived last month at the Santa Teresita Clinic, 
courtesy of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, state officials say that is not enough and hint that the federal 
government has political motives for refusing more aid. But the reaction was 
similar when the Huicholes Indians in the Pacific coast states of Nayarit and 
Jalisco faced a famine two years ago. Aid came almost exclusively from private 
U.S. charities, while government officials said they were working on long-term 
solutions to poverty in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain finally provided the real relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The examples of the Tarahumara and Huicholes support the point that President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari made at his final "state of the nation" address 
earlier this month. In commenting on the rebels who took up arms in Chiapas, he 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "If poverty alone causes uprisings, other regions of the country and a large 
part of humanity, living under similar or worse conditions, would be in a 
constant state of revolt. No, poverty in itself does not explain armed 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Mexicans no longer fear an uprising following the example of the 
Chiapas Indians, many remain profoundly disturbed by events here. Reviewing 
Salinas' address, opposition legislators said that "the current administration 
is concluding in the midst of misery, as faithfully attested by what is 
occurring in Chiapas and the Sierra Tarahumara." 
</P>
<P>
 On an individual level, Briones, a gregarious, energetic woman, was working at 
a hospital in the central Mexican city of Aguascalientes a year ago when she 
felt called to become a missionary, perhaps in Africa. Instead, she spent six 
months in a Tarahumara village 10 hours from Creel by dirt roads and now runs a 
nursery for children suffering from the diseases she had expected to find in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those children was Julia Batista, a 2-year-old weighing barely 14 
pounds whose bones were sharply defined through her wrinkled skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Briones carefully rocked the whimpering Julia in her arms as a nurse's aide 
changed her sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a country is advancing," she said, "we should see it not only in 'state of 
the nation' addresses and trade treaties, but in deeds."

NEWS ANALYSIS; TRADE PACT FOES FLY THE BANNER OF SOVEREIGNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For opponents of the sweeping world trade agreement that faces a critical 
congressional vote next week, it is not the impact on vulnerable industries and 
their workers that is keeping them awake at night. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a more fundamental, deep-seated fear of diminished American sovereignty 
that is giving many House and Senate members the shakes, a once-potent theme 
that has been relatively dormant in U.S. politics for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative opponents fret that the proposed World Trade Organization would 
undermine America's ability to control its borders and manage its economic 
destiny. The accord, they say, would force the nation to sacrifice domestic 
prosperity and self-determination as it bends to the will of global economic 
elites. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the critics see this fearful future embodied in the new global trade 
regime, which will succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year 
if the trade pact takes effect. Opponents express concern that the World Trade 
Organization will become a secretive super-government with the power to 
override U.S. consumer, environmental and trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Such charges underscore the extent to which the debate over a somewhat arcane 
trade agreement has been overtaken by resurgent populist fears of increasing 
internationalism and foreign intervention in U.S. affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic nationalism, a movement with a long and colorful history in this 
country, is on the march again. And the trade pact is standing in the way.  
</P>
<P>
 Former independent presidential candidate Ross Perot is widely credited with 
rekindling nationalist sentiments during the 1992 campaign. Yet to a surprising 
extent, it is the newly dominant Republican Party -- the traditional 
torchbearer of free trade -- whose cry of alarm has become the loudest. Many 
leaders on the Republican right, including unsuccessful presidential candidate 
Patrick J. Buchanan, say they believe that the party must reach out to former 
Perot voters by pursuing a populist -- and nationalistic -- political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot's base -- white, middle-class voters suffering from stagnant wage growth 
and declining job security -- share a deep sense of anxiety about the nation's 
economic future. Many have become suspicious of free trade and international 
entanglements. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the debate within the Republican Party over the trade issue is 
an element of the party's larger struggle over how to consolidate its hold on 
angry white men.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was generally agreed after the 1992 elections that whoever could corral 
the Perot voters would become the dominant party," Buchanan said. President 
Clinton "lost his opportunity to capture those people, and now the Republicans 
may be about to throw their opportunity away by supporting GATT." 
</P>
<P>
 More traditional pro-business and internationalist Republicans disagree. They 
worry that indulging anxious voters by opposing the trade agreement could cause 
the party to regress to its old isolationist roots. Many GOP moderates view the 
vote next week as an important indicator of the future direction of Republican 
foreign policy.  
</P>
<P>
 "The party is definitely split on GATT," said Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), a 
leading supporter of the trade pact in the House. "We've never had unanimity in 
the party on trade, but we are seeing a real erosion of Republican support for 
free trade this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it comes from an opportunity to give President Clinton a black eye, 
to refuse him a legislative victory," Kolbe said. "But much more troubling to 
me is this reversion to populist isolationism. Since World War II, we have been 
a party that is very pro-defense and strongly committed to involvement in the 
world. But I sense that something is changing in the party. And the GATT vote 
is a test of where we are going as a party." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the issue has produced fissures within both parties. Many of the 
same liberal Democrats who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement 
because of its potential impact on U.S. jobs and the environment plan to vote 
against the new accord on similar grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders and consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader say the agreement 
would open U.S. markets to a flood of cheap goods made by child workers in 
Third World sweatshops and undermine product-safety standards and workplace 
laws. Many Democratic lawmakers also oppose the pact because of home-state 
concerns. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), who opposes the agreement because 
of its expected impact on South Carolina's textile industry, engineered a delay 
in the vote until next week's lame-duck session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more at work here than protectionist politics and regulatory zeal. 
Indeed, Republican opposition seems to reflect a broader shift in the party's 
outlook on the United States' role in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the trade agreement was crafted largely under Republican 
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, many conservatives see it as the 
latest in a series of efforts to enmesh the United States in a thicket of 
international rules and multilateral organizations. Such entanglements, they 
contend, severely limit America's ability to focus on its own national 
interests and domestic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican internationalist, free-trade tradition is clashing with the 
older Republican tradition of isolationism and anti-multilateralism, and that 
is all coming to the fore in the GATT debate," said Sandy Masur, director of 
international affairs for Eastman Kodak Co. and a spokeswoman for a business 
coalition that favors the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 Above all, they see parallels between the World Trade Organization and the 
United Nations, which they believe has usurped U.S. independence on national 
security affairs. In fact, opposition to the agreement comes at a time when 
House Republicans, in their "contract with America," are proposing to prohibit 
the placement of U.S. troops under U.N. command.  
</P>
<P>
 "The World Trade Organization and sovereignty are the big Republican issues in 
GATT," said Joe Cobb, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative 
Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Declares Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon): "The new GATT depends on the 
surrender of American independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that the one-nation, one-vote World Trade Organization, which 
would preside over a new process for resolving trade disputes, will force the 
United States to accept rulings that go against U.S. economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the current trading system is "power-based," giving the United States 
and other major economic powers considerably more influence in the 
dispute-resolution process. The new system would be "rules-based," they say, 
giving small, Third World nations too much clout.  
</P>
<P>
 "The United States benefits most from an open system, where it is free to use 
its superior political and economic strength as it sees fit," Hunter said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though the structure of the new trade governing body was proposed by U.S. 
negotiators long before Clinton took office, some conservatives argue that the 
President's acceptance of the arrangement demonstrates his willingness to 
subordinate U.S. interests to international organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 With Republican votes critical to passage, the Administration has scrambled in 
recent days to assuage conservative fears on the sovereignty issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House lobbying efforts are focused on the Senate, where the vote is 
likely to be much closer than in the House. (Supporters will need 60 votes in 
the 100-member Senate to waive budget rules. The pact's tariff reductions are 
expected to reduce federal revenue and increase the federal budget deficit, 
thus violating an agreement in Congress on deficit reduction.) 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the pact are likewise concentrating on the Senate, urging members 
to delay the vote until after the new Congress convenes next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, concerned about growing 
grass-roots opposition to the pact, struck a deal this week pledging his 
support in exchange for a special U.S. review panel that would monitor 
international trade decisions. If the panel decides that U.S. interests have 
been jeopardized, it could trigger a congressional vote on U.S. withdrawal from 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "An understanding has been reached with Sen. Dole to reaffirm our United 
States sovereignty and to make sure that reaffirmation will be protected in the 
GATT process," Clinton said. "That means that the WTO will be accountable and 
fair and will meet our expectations."  
</P>
<P>
 But Dole's long reluctance to embrace the agreement demonstrated that 
Republicans are treading cautiously, trying to find a balance between the 
interests of the party's traditional base in the business community and its 
growing populist and nationalistic wing. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, is a political dilemma that Republicans are likely to face on a 
wide range of issues, from immigration to tax and budget policies, as they try 
to become a majority party capable of holding together constituent groups with 
conflicting interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Issues like immigration and trade are tough ones for the Republican Party 
today," said political analyst Kevin Phillips. "The Republican Party, like the 
Democratic Party, is badly split between its elites and its grass roots." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan said: "The free-trade consensus in the Republican Party has collapsed 
-- and there is no doubt in my mind which side on this issue is the growing 
force within the party."

GOP TARGETING HUGE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In August, a New Mexico jury handed down a $2.7-million punitive damage 
verdict against McDonald's Corp. because an elderly woman said she had been 
burned by hot coffee that she spilled on her leg. The jury had already awarded 
her $160,000 to cover medical bills and pay for her suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra award was intended to punish the big hamburger company for making 
its coffee too hot. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, a San Francisco law firm was hit with a $6.9-million punitive 
verdict because one of its partners had sexually harassed a female employee. A 
week later, an Alaska jury hit Exxon Corp. with a $5-billion punitive verdict, 
this on top of $3.8 billion that the company had paid out in fines and damage 
verdicts for the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, a jury in Las Vegas handed up a $5-million punitive verdict, on 
top of a $1.6-million compensatory award, against the Hilton Hotels Corp. 
because it failed to prevent drunk Navy and Marine aviators from molesting a 
woman attending the Tailhook Assn. convention. 
</P>
<P>
 To corporate attorneys this latest round of huge punitive verdicts shows that 
despite a decade of clamoring for reform, the legal system is still out of 
control.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting worse, not better. It's become a giant lottery," said Washington 
attorney Theodore B. Olson, who has repeatedly challenged punitive verdicts 
before the Supreme Court.  
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly, this month's elections have given the business community 
newfound optimism. Republican candidates for Congress and state offices 
reported that one of the biggest applause lines was to attack "crazy lawsuits." 
Now, after capturing control of Capitol Hill and 15 new statehouses, they are 
promising the most sweeping changes ever in the nation's liability laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the federal level, the climate for tort reform has never been better," 
said Sherman Joyce, president of the American Tort Reform Assn., a lobbying 
coalition whose members range from Boeing Co. and Exxon to the American Camping 
Assn. and the Ski Industries Assn. "The prospects also look good all across the 
country," he said, noting that Republicans made big gains in California, 
Illinois, Michigan and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The big losers are the trial lawyers, consumer advocates who until this year 
have fought off significant changes in the liability laws. While a majority of 
senators has favored federal restrictions on product-liability lawsuits, those 
measures were blocked by a handful of key Democrats allied with the trial 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next Congress, the Republicans promise to pass a series of 
"common-sense legal reforms," including the first-ever federal limits on 
product-liability suits. Their "contract with America" proposes to "discourage 
frivolous lawsuits" by making the losers pay the defendant's costs and to put 
"reasonable limits on punitive damages." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In product-liability cases, such as the hot-coffee case, the Republican 
proposal would limit the punitive award to three times the actual damages or 
$250,000, whichever is higher. Because the jury in the coffee case said the 
scalded woman was due $160,000 to pay for her injuries, it could then award her 
$480,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted that a trial judge in Albuquerque later reduced the 
punitive verdict against McDonald's to $480,000, three times the actual damages 
voted by the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer advocates say big punitive verdicts -- or even threats of such 
huge awards -- are needed to force giant corporations to change their ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of money to send a message to Exxon, GM (General Motors Corp.) 
or McDonald's," said Pamela Gilbert, director of Congress Watch for consumer 
advocate Ralph Nader's Public Citizen project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The McDonald's case is a perfect example. This (punitive verdict) was 
actually two days of their profits from selling coffee. It was big enough to 
get their attention and to get them to change their practices so they won't 
scald consumers with coffee that's too hot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbert says she realizes that the consumer groups face an uphill battle 
in stopping new federal product-liability legislation in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP and business lawyers say they will press a liability-reform bill next 
year that, besides limiting punitive damages, would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Free retailers and distributors from most product-liability suits. Now, 
those who are hurt by defective products usually sue not only the manufacturer 
but whoever sold the product. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bar punitive damages against the makers of drugs, vaccines and medical 
devices that have been tested and approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
and airplanes that have been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
While the injured could still win damages to cover their medical bills and 
their suffering, they could not get punitive damages unless the product-makers 
deceived federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce damage awards if the injured person misused the product or altered it 
in a significant way.  
</P>
<P>
 * Prohibit lawsuits in which the plaintiff's use of alcohol or illegal drugs 
caused an accident or an injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the bill say it would help U.S. manufacturers by establishing a 
uniform federal law on liability.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you are making a product now that is sold in the 50 states, you have to 
deal with 50 different sets of laws," said William Fay, executive director of 
the Product Liability Coordinating Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the initial Republican proposal, even if it becomes law, would not 
necessarily affect most civil lawsuits that do not involve products. For 
example, the suits involving sexual harassment at the San Francisco law firm 
and at the Tailhook Assn. convention arose under state law and would not be 
affected by the proposed federal restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 However, leaders of the business coalition say they hope the federal proposals 
will be adopted by many states. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest fights are likely to focus on limiting punitive damages. Until the 
1970s, it was generally understood that the criminal-justice system meted out 
punishment and civil lawsuits compensated the injured for damage or losses. But 
these days, big-time punishment usually comes from angry juries in civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of this trend say punitive damages have at least three drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 First, those being punished often did not cause the damage. Certainly 
officials of the Hilton Hotels Corp. did not molest Paula Coughlin, the former 
Navy lieutenant who was assaulted at the Tailhook convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of verdict suggests there is something very wrong with the legal 
system," said Yale University law professor George Priest. "Obviously, everyone 
feels badly for her, but why should the hotel be held responsible? Not the 
officers? Not the Navy? It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the winners often get an undeserved windfall. Jurors in the San 
Francisco case were told that several women were harassed by attorney Martin 
Greenstein. They handed down a $50,000 compensatory verdict in favor of Rena 
Weeks, who worked for Greenstein for 25 days. Then they added on the 
$6.9-million punitive verdict, which Weeks and her lawyers will share. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the punishment in civil cases depends entirely on the whim of the jury, 
unlike the criminal-justice system where penalties are spelled out in law. 
Typically, plaintiff's lawyers ask the jury to "send a message" to a 
corporation by handing down a large monetary award. 
</P>
<P>
 Both critics and defenders of punitive damages agree that a 
multimillion-dollar verdict is akin to a lightning bolt -- spectacular but 
rare. They disagree, however, on whether these lightning bolts send a valuable 
warning to potential wrongdoers or instead force corporations to pay exorbitant 
settlements to ward off outrageous jury verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America says civil lawsuits 
against corporations and the threat of big punitive damages have given 
"Americans the safest workplace and the safest environment" among the 
industrialized nations.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you take the deterrent effect (of punitive damages), it lets the 
bottom-line mentality predominate," said Larry Stewart, a trial attorney in 
Miami. "The American people want to see the wrongdoers held accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics say a growing number of verdicts are outrageously high and go 
far beyond any clear sense of punishment for wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, between January and September of this year, juries in Alabama 
handed down 11 separate multimillion-dollar punitive-damage verdicts, many of 
them against insurance companies because an agent -- or someone posing as a 
company agent -- used deception in selling a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, an agent for the Prudential Insurance Co. greatly overstated 
the value of an annuity policy that a couple purchased for their retirement. 
When the company learned about the agent's deception, it offered to return all 
the premiums, but the couple sued. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 6, a jury in rural Barbour County awarded them $430,000 in 
compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive damages. Another couple, whose 
$12,000 premium payment was stolen by an agent, won $800,000 in compensatory 
damages and $24.9 million from the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. In 
both cases, the trial judge upheld the verdicts.  
</P>
<P>
 Another suit against BMW, the German auto maker, gives new meaning to the old 
pitch of getting "cash back" with an automobile purchase. A doctor who bought a 
new BMW in 1990 was dismayed to later discover that his car had been damaged 
slightly during shipping from Germany. The company spent $600 to refinish the 
car but did not inform him because the problem was minor. He sued and won 
$4,000 in compensatory damages and $2 million in punitive damages, which were 
upheld by the state Supreme Court in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system is totally out of control in Alabama," Priest said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Legislature once enacted a $250,000 limit on punitive damages, 
but it was struck down by the elected judges of the state's high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alabama was once the bastion of the states-rights movement, its 
newspapers have been proclaiming that the "legal lottery" there now "requires 
federal reform."

RECRUITING A POLITICAL ASSASSIN: IRAN'S KGB-LIKE SPIES AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. REMPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From that first meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, when recruiting agents offered 
him $600,000 and a new house in Tehran, Fariborz Karimi seemed a most unlikely 
assassin. The Iranian agents asked him to kill a man who was his mentor and 
surrogate father. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was precisely that close relationship that so attracted the Iranian 
secret service agents. Few prospective recruits had such easy access to the man 
they wanted eliminated -- the exiled former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar, 
whose public criticism of the Islamic regime had earned him a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 One recruiter handed Karimi a small vial half-filled with white powder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me to mix it in Bakhtiar's vodka," Karimi said. "He said: 'It is 
colorless. No one will know. They will think he had a stroke.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi recalls with vivid dread the chill he felt when the vial was thrust on 
him. "I laughed like it must not be real, but I was terrified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was even more frightened later by the calls he received from Tehran, from 
Ali Fallalian, then chief deputy of VEVAK, the Iranian secret service. The 
Iranian spy boss grew impatient as time passed, making Karimi worry that he 
might become a target of retaliation if he failed to commit the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, faced with an order from Tehran to complete the job -- "do the act" 
-- Karimi fled to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in Los Angeles -- one continent and an ocean removed from the scene of 
what he regards as his harrowing ordeal -- Karimi, the reluctant 
assassin-recruit, still lives in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Not because someone might tap him again to complete the lethal assignment. 
Bakhtiar is already dead. He was killed in a Paris suburb by a three-man 
Iranian assassination team that slit his throat in 1991, nearly two years after 
Karimi refused to poison the old man's vodka.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Karimi fears retaliation because he has agreed to testify in the Bakhtiar 
murder case on trial in Paris and because he has already provided extensive 
information about Iran's secret service to the FBI and French anti-terror 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 In a confidential 185-page investigative report submitted to the French 
Justice Ministry last spring, Karimi's account of early VEVAK contacts was 
cited by the French investigative magistrate, who declared the Iranian 
government had a direct role in the conspiracy to kill Bakhtiar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported earlier this month that the investigative report and 
interviews with French investigators disclosed allegations that Iran operates 
an international terror network that targets dissidents and resistance leaders 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran denies those claims. And the cases against some of the accused Bakhtiar 
assassins and accomplices continue in a Paris court, where Karimi is expected 
to testify by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The full untold story of Karimi's encounter with Iranian secret service agents 
sheds new light on Tehran's long-suspected role in ordering and carrying out 
political assassinations around the world. It also provides a rare first-hand 
account of the recruiting methods of Iran's increasingly sophisticated, 
KGB-model spy network. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed to tell his story on condition that some personal details be omitted 
that would identify where he lives and works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi was born in 1961 to a politically active family -- advocates of Iranian 
democracy, critics of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, open supporters of Bakhtiar 
even in the days when he was imprisoned by the shah's regime. 
</P>
<P>
 And Karimi was barely 18 years old when the Islamic revolution toppled the 
shah and swept Bakhtiar, the shah's last desperate choice for prime minister, 
from office. Karimi's family was no less critical of the new regime. Two years 
later, Karimi's father and an uncle were arrested and subsequently executed by 
the revolutionary government. 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi himself was arrested twice before fleeing to France, where the exiled 
Bakhtiar had already set up the National Iranian Resistance Movement. He was 
immediately part of the movement's inner circle, director of its youth 
organization and a member of the executive council. Bakhtiar paid him a monthly 
wage of about $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good life in Paris," Karimi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manoushur Akasheh, then in his mid-40s, had also worked for Bakhtiar's 
resistance movement, first in Kuwait and then Paris, where he and Karimi became 
good friends. They often enjoyed the night life of Paris in their off hours. 
But the older man had a family and increasingly burdensome debts. Apparently in 
financial distress, Akasheh finally returned to Iran and the assistance of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some months later, in the fall of 1989, Karimi heard from his friend. Akasheh 
was traveling to Frankfurt and wanted Karimi to meet him in Germany. Karimi was 
puzzled. How could it be that such an open opponent of the government was now 
free to travel in and out of Iran so easily? 
</P>
<P>
 Bakhtiar, already suspicious that Akasheh had made some sort of peace with the 
Tehran government, told Karimi bluntly that his friend was "working with them 
now."  
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Bakhtiar wanted Karimi to go to Germany. "Go meet him. Whatever 
he proposes, don't say anything positive or negative," Bakhtiar advised.  
</P>
<P>
 When Karimi boarded a Paris train for Frankfurt, he was traveling as a spy for 
Bakhtiar's resistance movement. He was to gather intelligence about Akasheh and 
his new relationship with the Iranian government. 
</P>
<P>
 What Karimi would soon learn was that back in Tehran he had been handpicked to 
become the assassin of Bakhtiar. 
</P>
<P>
 There was obvious logic in the choice. Akasheh knew that Karimi had routine 
access to Bakhtiar, that he was trusted by the opposition leader (who often 
called him Fariborz rather than the customary Mr. Karimi), that he was a 
bachelor with expensive tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Akasheh also knew that Karimi was very fond of Bakhtiar and that 
their families had a long history of cordial and loyal relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important, however, was the fact that Karimi was a friend of 
Akasheh. In retrospect it seems likely that as part of his restitution with the 
Iranian authorities he had once condemned, Akasheh agreed to help recruit a 
Bakhtiar killer from among his former resistance colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very much like the old KGB to compromise one who then compromises a 
friend and so on," said one French investigator in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Akasheh was not alone in Frankfurt, but he tried to reassure Karimi that the 
other two men with him had nothing to do with the Islamic republic. They were 
caviar salesmen, he insisted. Karimi believes that they were secret service 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man appeared to be a disgruntled student, declaring that he wished 
only to return to Iran because "Europe is not home for Iranians." Karimi 
thought he was also an agent making a crude appeal to Karimi's own sense of 
nationalism and lost homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first proposal required Karimi to simply return to Tehran and denounce 
Bakhtiar in the media. For this, Karimi would be handsomely rewarded and 
forgiven of all past sins against the revolutionary government. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Bakhtiar's instruction to make no commitment for or against any 
proposals, Karimi simply said he would consider it. His failure to reject the 
plan, however, may have encouraged them to press for a more drastic commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi said that on his second morning in Frankfurt, he was awakened by a 
telephone ringing in the next room of the apartment he was sharing with 
Akasheh. He pretended to sleep through the call, but he heard Akasheh's voice 
saying softly: "Let me do it my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Alone later that day, Akasheh confronted Karimi. Holding out a copy of the 
Koran, Akasheh insisted that Karimi swear an oath that he would never divulge 
what Akasheh was about to tell him. "As long as you live I will say nothing," 
Karimi said he agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to kill him," Akasheh said. Karimi knew he meant Bakhtiar. 
"Someone will do it. If you want to make some money, you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The offer: $600,000, a house in Tehran and "anything else you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi said he protested. "I can't kill him; he is my father." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, as a favor to Akasheh who pleaded with him, Karimi agreed to 
listen to a further appeal by phone from Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Fallalian was already a prominent member of the Iranian intelligence 
service when he called Karimi in Frankfurt the next day. (He now heads VEVAK as 
Iran's minister of intelligence and security.) Karimi recalls it was an oddly 
cordial conversation during which Fallalian even apologized for "the necessity" 
to execute his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'Hi, how are you. . . . I've heard about you. I know there have been 
problems between us, but things are changing. . . . I hope we will meet soon 
after the action you have accepted to take. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 That was the moment Karimi felt the first chill. They assumed he had agreed to 
be their killer. Could he back out now without jeopardizing his own life? 
Karimi decided to stick with Bakhtiar's initial instruction against making any 
commitments, responding simply: "Well, see you soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Being handed the vial of white powder produced the second chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi believes that his friend knew he would never kill Bakhtiar but that 
Akasheh "went through the motions" of trying to recruit him in order to satisfy 
Iranian authorities. Clearly, Akasheh was on a mission for VEVAK in Frankfurt, 
Karimi says. 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi still had the vial in his pocket when he returned to Paris and was 
summoned immediately to Bakhtiar's suburban home for a report. Feeling an 
obligation both to keep his oath of silence to Akasheh and to warn Bakhtiar at 
the same time, Karimi responded somewhat obliquely that he was not sure what 
the meetings were all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think either they want me to become a terrorist or they want to get rid of 
you," Karimi told Bakhtiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakhtiar nodded and ordered Karimi to move into his home immediately. A team 
of French police maintained a 24-hour watch on the compound. Karimi lived there 
for the next 46 days, the vial of white powder always in his room.  
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted me there for my safety. He was being my father," Karimi said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the young man finally grew weary of Bakhtiar's constant attention to his 
coming and going. "I told him his home was like a jail. I had to go," Karimi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Bakhtiar aide offered Karimi a ride back to his Paris apartment. 
Farydoun Boyerahmadi drove an older model red BMW. Two years later, Boyerahmadi 
would use the same car to drive two suspected VEVAK agents to Bakhtiar's home, 
escort them past the French police guards and, police allege, help them kill 
Bakhtiar with knives from the exiled leader's own kitchen. (Boyerahmadi is now 
a fugitive, possibly living in the United States.)  
</P>
<P>
 Karimi was still unpacking when the phone rang in his apartment. Tehran had a 
few questions. He was to be at a specific public telephone on the street 
outside his apartment at 11 a.m. the next day. He would get a call from 
"Hosein." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his previous conversation with Fallalian, Karimi knew that was 
Fallalian's code name. The next morning he heard Fallalian's voice again on the 
line. Again the tone was cordial, but a bit more strained: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, how are you? Why didn't you contact us? We know you have been in 
Bakhtiar's home. . . . We're waiting to hear from you. . . . When are you going 
to do this action? . . . Of course, you must select the time and the place. . . 
. Why did you not take the action when you were a guest in his house?" 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi now knew he could not simply ignore his dilemma. By accident or design 
he was, he realized, "associated with a bunch of terrorists." And he saw no 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of that day I started feeling very frightened. I've been frightened from 
that day to this," Karimi said in a recent interview in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 More calls came from "Hosein" in the weeks that followed. Karimi kept putting 
him off with vague complaints that he was in no position to take "that action." 
He said Fallalian remained patient but persistent -- very persistent. The calls 
came more frequently, always at a different pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi hit on a plan. The only way to get VEVAK off his back without killing 
Bakhtiar was to find a convincing way to end his relationship with his patron. 
He drafted an open letter distributed to the Iranian media that accused 
Bakhtiar of being a tool of the shah's old secret police, SAVAK. He also took 
critical shots at the Islamic regime in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to burn every bridge he had to Bakhtiar and to the Tehran government. 
Then he moved to London and dropped out of sight. "I had to quit to save my 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakhtiar was apparently stunned by Karimi's public gesture and abrupt 
departure, telling Boyerahmadi at one point that "Fariborz is no longer my 
son." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Fallalian eventually tracked down Karimi in London. About five 
months later, Karimi got another call from "Hosein," this time out of patience 
and in no mood for excuses. This time the tone was not at all cordial: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why have you done this? You are a charlatan. . . . You are playing with us. . 
. . You had a lot of time to do the action." 
</P>
<P>
 And the deputy chief of VEVAK ordered Karimi immediately to take steps to 
repair his relationship with Bakhtiar so he could finish his mission. 
Reluctantly, Karimi returned to Paris, but only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew I was leading them on. I knew they had told me secrets about their 
plan to kill Bakhtiar. I was afraid they would kill me," Karimi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled to Canada. Then, after staying a few days with friends in Quebec, 
Karimi walked into a forest and came out in Vermont. He was promptly arrested 
by immigration authorities and applied for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Karimi was in the United States when Bakhtiar was murdered in August, 1991, 
along with his private secretary, a young man Karimi regarded as his "best 
friend in the world." Even before the arrest warrant was issued for Boyerahmadi 
and two suspected Iranian assassins, Karimi said he knew his former colleague 
was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Bakhtiar associate had been assassinated in the spring of that year, 
and there was widespread speculation in the resistance movement that Bakhtiar 
himself was next. Colleagues suspected colleagues of treachery. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Bakhtiar aides warned him that Boyerahmadi could not be trusted, but the 
resistance leader dismissed their concerns as tribal jealousies. Boyerahmadi, 
in turn, confronted Karimi, asking if he had been approached to kill Bakhtiar. 
Karimi denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if they pay me, I would kill him," Boyerahmadi told Karimi in what was 
taken at the time as a facetious remark. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Karimi believes that Boyerahmadi took his place in the plot and, in doing 
so, "saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "He pushed himself in (to the conspiracy) and took the (assassination) job 
away from me," Karimi said. "They didn't need me. They forgot about me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Karimi fears that his years of obscurity ended when news accounts broke of 
his conversations with French authorities and FBI agents. Still, he agreed to 
talk about his experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am afraid. But the truth is important," Karimi said. "The Islamic republic 
did this terrible act (against Bakhtiar.) I will let my story be the knife that 
stabs them back."

GROUP OF VIRUSES TIED TO TYPE OF DIABETES; SCIENCE: INSULIN-DEPENDENT FORM OF 
THE DISEASE MAY BE TRIGGERED IN GENETICALLY SUSCEPTIBLE PEOPLE BY POLIO-RELATED 
AGENTS, RESEARCHERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA and Florida researchers have produced strong new evidence implicating a 
common class of viruses in causing Type 1, or insulin-dependent, diabetes -- a 
discovery that could eventually lead to new ways of preventing the disease that 
affects as many as 1 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys 
insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Researchers know that only people with 
a specific genetic profile are susceptible to this autoimmune attack, but there 
has been great debate about the identity of the agent that triggers the immune 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two studies in this month's issues of the Journal of Experimental 
Medicine and the Journal of Clinical Investigation strongly implicate Coxsackie 
viruses, polio-related viruses that cause upper respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
 One report shows that Coxsackie viruses trigger diabetes in genetically 
susceptible mice but not in those that have a different genetic profile. The 
second study demonstrates that the autoimmune reaction is triggered by a 
similarity between a Coxsackie virus protein and a protein in the pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
 The two studies provide "a strong case of guilt by association," said UCLA 
molecular biologist Daniel L. Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only inferential data so far, but it's pretty strong inferential data," 
added Dr. Noel Maclaren of the University of Florida. "I think the case is 
really seriously beginning to build" that Coxsackie viruses are the key 
triggering agent. 
</P>
<P>
 If the viruses are shown to be a primary cause of the disease, vaccines 
against them could probably prevent diabetes, the researchers said. But "before 
we can start working on such a vaccine, we need to have a fairly clear smoking 
gun" strongly confirming that the viruses cause diabetes, said Dr. Joan Harmon, 
director of the Diabetes Research Program at the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have a 30-year history of interest in Coxsackie viruses as a 
diabetes cause. Epidemiological studies in the 1960s, for example, showed that 
Coxsackie outbreaks in various regions were followed by an increased incidence 
of diabetes. Studies also showed that perhaps 60% of newly diagnosed diabetics 
had antibodies to the virus.  
</P>
<P>
 More recently, researchers such as Maclaren and his Florida colleague, Mark 
Atkinson, have demonstrated that people in the very earliest stages of diabetes 
have antibodies against a specific protein, subsequently shown by Kaufman and 
others to be an enzyme called glutamic acid decarboxylase, or GAD. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Kaufman and Allen J. Tobin of UCLA demonstrated that a small 
segment of GAD is structurally similar to a segment of a Coxsackie protein. 
Their interpretation was that when the immune system attacks this viral protein 
in fighting off a Coxsackie infection, it also inadvertently attacks GAD, which 
is found on the surface of insulin-secreting pancreas cells. Ultimately the 
cells are destroyed and diabetes results.  
</P>
<P>
 The new papers buttress this hypothesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Maclaren and Atkinson wanted to show that the structural similarity between 
the two proteins was not simply coincidence. To achieve that, they broke the 
GAD molecule down into 36 shorter fragments, one of them the segment similar to 
the Coxsackie protein. 
</P>
<P>
 When they exposed blood from several patients in the early stages of diabetes 
to each of these fragments, they observed that the anti-GAD antibodies strongly 
attacked the segment similar to the viral protein and reacted only weakly with 
the other fragments. This reinforced the idea that the attack on GAD was 
triggered by a Coxsackie infection. 
</P>
<P>
 To further explore this relationship, Kaufman and his colleagues exposed two 
types of mice -- one group that was genetically susceptible to Type 1 diabetes 
and one that was not -- to a Coxsackie virus. They found that, shortly after 
the infection, the susceptible group developed antibodies not only against the 
Coxsackie protein but also against GAD. The mice then developed diabetes. The 
non-susceptible mice, in contrast, developed antibodies only against the viral 
protein and did not develop diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the genes that control diabetes susceptibility in mice are similar to 
those in humans, Kaufman said, the observation suggests that Coxsackie viruses 
can trigger the disease in humans as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers agreed, however, that further studies will be necessary to 
actually prove that Coxsackie viruses cause the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Maclaren cautioned that Coxsackie viruses may not be the cause of all Type 1 
diabetes. About one in every five diabetics, he noted, does not produce an 
immune response to GAD, and the disease in those cases may have been triggered 
by some other agent. Possible triggers that have received a lot of attention 
include the nitrosamines used as a food preservative and a protein in cow's 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really homing in on the cause of this disease," said Dr. Richard Kahn, 
vice president for research at the American Cancer Society. "This could very 
well be the major, perhaps the only, environmental trigger for diabetes. "

BIRDS OF A FEATHER; RESTORING HISTORIC AIRCRAFT IS A LABOR OF LOVE FOR 
VOLUNTEERS AT GILLESPIE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Klein is "the baby." He's 67. 
</P>
<P>
 The other members of the 11-man crew are a little older -- most of them 
veterans of military service during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 What binds them together is a love affair with airplanes, especially old 
airplanes. Klein, Joe Gwizdak, 70, Art Dickman, 82, and their companions gather 
regularly at an old hangar in a quiet corner of Gillespie Field to help patch 
donated aircraft back together for the San Diego Aerospace Museum, 
headquartered 12 miles away in San Diego's Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun," said Gwizdak, who served as a gunnery instructor on B-17 
and B-25 bombers during World War II. "Working on planes you've heard about all 
your life, it's just great." 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft they're currently restoring are a mixed lot, ranging from an F-14 
Tomcat jet fighter retired by the Navy earlier this year to a P-51 pursuit 
plane from World War II to a 1929 Kinner Bird biplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Different members of the team have different specialties. Ira Corpening, once 
a B-17 pilot stationed in Italy, studied upholstering on the GI Bill after the 
war and now does much of the fabric work. Dickman is a skilled mechanic and 
woodworker. Dick Weixeldorfer, who formerly ran an auto repair shop, does most 
of the painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwizdak said the restoration team reports to the hangar Mondays, Wednesdays 
and Fridays, often starting at 7 a.m. and working until supper time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always kind of chomping at the bit until I get down here," he admitted 
with a grin. "But if we came every day, the chores wouldn't get done and the 
wives would complain. Three days a week is just right. My wife can do her thing 
and I can do mine." 
</P>
<P>
 The men, all retired, volunteer their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "A younger fellow -- he was about 35 -- came down here awhile back, was 
interested in what we do, indicated that he'd like to work with us," Gwizdak 
said. "Then he asked how much he'd be paid. I told him, 'Nothing.' He said, 
'You come down here and do all this work for nothing? You must be crazy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gwizdak and Klein took some visitors on a tour of the Gillespie Field hangar 
earlier this month. They pointed out some of the museum's jet-age aircraft -- 
the F-14, an A-6E and an A-7 from the Navy, and a nose section salvaged from an 
Air Force B-52 bomber -- but they devoted most of their time to the planes 
built before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one is a French-built Morane Saulier from the 1930s that was used in the 
movie 'The Blue Max,' " Gwizdak said, pointing to a small, fragile-looking 
silver plane with open cockpits. "George Peppard, who starred in the film, 
owned it and flew it. It's one of the best aerobatic planes you can find." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein showed the visitors a stripped metal frame that looked sort of like an 
elongated bird cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one here is an American Eagle biplane, built in 1929," he said. "It 
looked like hell when we started. We're rebuilding the whole thing. We don't 
have any plans for it, so as we took it apart, we took a lot of photographs. 
That's what we're working from." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said the American Eagle should be flyable when the restoration work is 
completed, although he doubts that anyone will attempt it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a Curtis OX-5 engine in it, and they tend to quit on you," he said. 
"That might be OK if you were out over the plains of Iowa, where you can land 
anywhere, but not around here." 
</P>
<P>
 As Dickman checked the clamps holding some reglued wing ribs on the wood and 
fabric Kinner, Klein shot a disdainful glance at the P-51 -- a sleekly 
glamorous hot rod from World War II that has become the darling of collectors 
and airplane racers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a toy now, not a war bird," he said with a snort. "Before we got it, 
somebody took the armor and fuselage fuel tank out, removed the gun ports on 
the wings and put a second seat in it. It's real pretty, but it's not the real 
thing anymore."  
</P>
<P>
 He told the visitors about one he worked on a few years back that was "the 
real thing" -- a Spad 7 from World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we took it apart, we found a message that someone had written on one of 
the wing ribs when they built it," he said. "It said, 'Screw the Kaiser.' "

PUBLIC STRIKE FOLLOWS TRAGIC INDIA STAMPEDE; PROTEST: SHOPS, OFFICES AND 
SCHOOLS IN NAGPUR CLOSE IN SYMPATHY FOR 113 VICTIMS. OFFICIAL RESIGNS IN 
DISGRACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a shiver of outrage and horror, residents closed shops, offices and schools 
Thursday in a central Indian city where 113 people perished after 
baton-swinging police charged a protest march, and a government minister 
resigned in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 60% and 70% of the businesses in Nagpur, 375 miles south of New Delhi, 
were shut by the sympathy strike, said C.K. Gouri, an officer in the city's 
police control room. Schools and colleges locked their doors for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as criticism of their conduct mounted and a report circulated that the 
accidental discharge of an officer's gun might have caused the mayhem at 
Wednesday's march, police arrested 10 people, including the demonstration's 
organizer, on charges of provoking rioting and accidental deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramilitary units were positioned across Nagpur to prevent any more violence. 
"Police are on full alert," spokesman S.K. Kammath said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest information, officials said, 113 people died after 
being trampled in a panicky stampede, and 46 of the estimated 500 injured were 
still hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead succumbed to shock, massive internal injuries and asphyxiation, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout India, the tragedy topped newspaper front pages. Due to its timing 
and the fact that very poor and low-status people were the victims, the event 
could prove to be political dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, where Nagpur is located, Maharashtra, is one of India's richest and 
most populous and is supposed to hold local elections by next March. Its chief 
minister, Sharad Pawar of the ruling Congress (I) Party, is a former defense 
minister and aspires to become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims of Wednesday's stampede were from one of the lowest rungs of 
India's caste-conscious, polarized society. Known as adivasis , a Hindi word 
meaning "original inhabitants," they are poor members of tribes who generally 
dwell in the country's central highlands and forests. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 50,000 of them gathered Wednesday on a square in Nagpur, where 
the Maharashtra state legislature was meeting in its winter session, to demand 
that their legal status be changed so they can benefit from the special quota 
of government jobs, legislative seats and school admissions reserved for 
so-called "scheduled tribes," among the most destitute and uneducated strata in 
India's diverse society. 
</P>
<P>
 One subgroup in the caste already has the beneficial status, adding to 
demonstrators' sense of injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's stampede began after marchers tried to break through police 
barricades and reach the state legislature. The police charged, their bamboo 
canes flailing in the air. Some of the frightened marchers tried to retreat, 
crushing others underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Press Trust of India news agency said the dead included 24 children. 
Seventy-five others were women. In a statement, Pawar said the tragedy could 
have been averted if militant adivasi leaders had not placed women, children 
and old people in the vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming "moral responsibility" for the deaths, the state's minister for 
tribal development, Mudhukarrad Pichad, resigned. The demonstrators had 
demanded a meeting with either Pawar or Pichad, but that demand was not met. 
</P>
<P>
 The United News of India agency quoted an unidentified eyewitness as saying 
that marchers had collided with a policeman as officers began their baton 
charge, the policeman's gun fell and went off accidentally. "The gunfire scared 
the people, and they began running into alleys," UNI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawar announced a judicial probe of the tragedy and tried to calm tempers by 
promising $3,240 to the family of each victim and government-paid medical care 
for those who were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pawar's foes called for his resignation, and the Hindu nationalist 
Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, whose Parliament members donned black armbands, 
called Thursday's strike. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, weeping people in Nagpur searched for friends and relatives at 
the state-run hospital. At a stadium, leaders of the ill-fated protest read the 
names of the missing to an anxious crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Dhan, chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and 
Scheduled Tribes, was heading to Nagpur to investigate the protesters' 
complaints.

WINEMAKING; MOLDOVANS SEEK TO JOIN RANKS OF MONDAVIS; WORLD'S ONLY UNDERGROUND 
WINE CITY READY TO STAKE CLAIM TO FAME IN THE WEST.

<P>
 The subterranean street signs read "Riesling" and "Cabernet." A wall sculpture 
of the god Bacchus reigns over the reception room. And the bottles, barrels and 
vats stretch forever, lining a vinegar-scented warren of moldy tunnels that 
extends for 80 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 A strange and magical Kingdom of the Grape, the labyrinths under the 
quarry-and-prison town of Krikova amount to one of the biggest wine cellars in 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
 For Moldova -- the tiny, wine-rich former Soviet republic between Ukraine and 
Romania -- they provide a Disneyland-like claim to fame, a typical product of 
the Kremlin's love for all things gigantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only underground wine city in the world," boasted Andrei 
Kholostenko, director of Moldova's national wine collection at Krikova. "The 
police here only work until lunch, because after lunch they're too drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 From the remains of Nazi leader Hermann Goering's collection to a 1902 vintage 
Passover wine, from tasting rooms that have hosted the likes of Soviet leader 
Leonid I. Brezhnev to the untrammeled kitsch of velvet-wrapped champagne 
bottles, the cellars of Krikova are full of minor marvels. 
</P>
<P>
 If only things above ground were as delightful. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are masses of problems," said Valentin Bodiul, the tough-talking 
director of the Krikova -- sometimes spelled Cricova -- cellar and the wine 
association that supplies it. "All the former Soviet republics are going 
through tough economic times because of the broken ties. This is a very 
difficult period." 
</P>
<P>
 For Krikova, broken ties meant that its Ukrainian bottle supplier started 
charging world prices for clunky bottles that fail to meet world standards. 
Substitute suppliers in Hungary and Austria had to be found. The Soviet 
collapse also meant that the loyal Russian and Ukrainian connoisseurs who long 
considered Moldovan reds among the best were suddenly nearly out of reach -- 
beyond border guards who demanded novelties like customs fees and export 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 And it turned out that the rest of the world was not exactly holding its 
breath for a sip of Krikova's unique red sparkling wine nor its light white Vin 
Nobil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When the democratic revolution began and we got sovereignty, our first 
leaders said 'We'll fill the world with our wine,' " Bodiul recalled. "That was 
a dilettante's approach. The market is full of great wines. And we can expect 
only a small part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 While Krikova neglected the Russian market, dirt-cheap French and Spanish 
wines filled it, and the Moldovans are only now regaining their place. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikova's troubles actually began even earlier. In contrast to the Kremlin 
chiefs who happily sipped and nibbled at Krikova, Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev launched his famed anti-alcohol campaign soon after coming to power 
in 1985 and oversaw the destruction of one-third of Moldova's vineyards -- 
almost 200,000 acres, Bodiul said. It will take years, possibly decades, to 
restore them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moldova is in the midst of a typical post-Communist economic crisis 
that keeps subsidies to winemakers at a minimum and, Kholostenko said, forces 
the government to commandeer most of the hard currency that Krikova earns on 
its exports to buy imported medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Krikova's management found the money for French champagne-making 
equipment and plans its own bottling plants; slowly, painstakingly, it is 
working on developing the quality and image it needs to sell in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikova is already beginning to make inroads into the European market and 
exports more than 1 million bottles per year, mainly of its oaky red wines, to 
the United States, largely through distributors in the Midwest and Washington, 
D.C. "It is hard to race against such leading countries as America -- 
especially California," Bodiul said. But "already today, the factories 
physically can't keep up with all the orders of Western firms." 
</P>
<P>
 Krikova has shifted from its tacky, Soviet-era plastic stoppers to Portuguese 
cork, and touts its lack of chemicals in the health-conscious West. 
</P>
<P>
 In the red wine arena, Krikova claims to already be pressuring France's 
Bordeaux region. Bodiul said that, at a recent wine competition, some enraged 
French winemakers accused their Krikova rivals of pouring Bordeaux wine into 
their own bottles, so delicious was the bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in the most promising sign of Krikova's potential, it is making plans 
to expand the wine cellars from the current 80 miles to nearly 300. "We'll 
suffer another two or three years," Kholostenko said. "But we'll get out of 
this."

INDIA; PAGEANT VICTORIES INSPIRE DEBATE OVER WOMEN'S ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If China boasts the world's fleetest female swimmers, France the most select 
of vintages and Ukraine the greatest pole vaulter, where do the world's most 
comely women come from? 
</P>
<P>
 From India, of course. It's as official as these kinds of things ever get. 
This year, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, Aishwarya Rai, 21, an architecture student with gray-green eyes 
from Bombay, bested contestants from 86 other countries to become Miss World 
1994. Back in May, raven-haired model Sushmita Sen, 18, of New Delhi became the 
first Indian to be chosen Miss Universe. 
</P>
<P>
 For India, it was an unprecedented winning combination. Some people felt as 
jubilant as if the country had received an armful of Nobel Prizes or Olympic 
medals. The unexpected honors paid to two young Indian women were also debated 
for what they signaled about India -- its international image, the place of 
women in its society and its attitudes toward sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a victory for the nation. The Indian subcontinent has come into the 
limelight," said a happy Deepa Bhatia, an executive in the advertising section 
of Femina, a woman's magazine. Before going international, Sen won this year's 
title and Rai was the runner-up in the annual Femina Miss India pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheering was loud but not unanimous. Some in India brand beauty contests 
as the epitome of Western prurience or sexism. After Sen's triumph in Manila, a 
publication of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) blasted the whole idea of 
such contests as foreign and immoral, and accused Sen of denigrating the rich 
cultural tradition of Bengal, the land of her forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new Miss Universe rode a buggy in a victory parade through New Delhi 
in September, an incensed lawyer filed a criminal complaint against her for 
"insult and dishonor to the national flag." Sen had held onto the Indian 
tricolor as she danced and threw kisses to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that peevishness greeted the beaming Rai's victory last weekend in Sun 
City, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bombayite, recipient of prizes and gifts worth more than $500,000, said 
her first goal would be to show "compassion for the underprivileged." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, India, for what you did for me, for this opportunity," she said, 
fighting back tears, after the diadem was placed on her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Indians saw the back-to-back titles as international acceptance of their 
notions of womanhood and style as the country increasingly opens up to the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time has come for the women of the West to stop and look back at India, that 
Indian women are not lagging behind in any manner. They have both talent and 
beauty," said Kavita Dewidi, an apprentice in Odissi, the traditional dance 
form in the eastern state of Orissa. 
</P>
<P>
 But a New Delhi social scientist said it is important to separate image from 
reality, and not to forget the perilous lives many Indian women lead. Feminist 
researchers say a rape is recorded every 54 minutes in India. Girls' enrollment 
in school is 30% to 40% lower than that of boys. Of the 12 million girls born 
each year, a quarter may not live to celebrate their 15th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that promotes India and brings it recognition is something great, 
and if these ladies have managed to make a dent in the Western mind that India 
is not a mythical place with tigers running round on the streets, it's a great 
thing," said the social scientist, who spoke on condition she not be 
identified. "But their lives are completely divorced from what is happening 
with most Indian women."

29 IN EXILE AFTER E. TIMOR PROTEST AT EMBASSY ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After holding out for nearly two weeks on the grounds of the U.S. Embassy in 
Jakarta, 29 protesters from the disputed territory of East Timor left Indonesia 
on Thursday for political exile in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our political decision is to let them all go," Foreign Minister Ali Abdullah 
Alatas said, according to the official Antara news agency. The government had 
earlier hinted that one of the group might be detained in a murder 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bedraggled protesters were given new clothes at the embassy and then taken 
in a Red Cross bus to the airport for the flight to Lisbon. As they left the 
embassy grounds, the protesters waved at journalists outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The group brought worldwide attention to their cause by scaling an iron fence 
outside the embassy on Nov. 12 as political leaders from Asia and America were 
arriving in Jakarta to hold regional trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators, who remained in a parking lot adjacent to the main embassy, 
asked for a meeting with President Clinton or Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher to press their demands for the freedom of Jose (Xanana) Gusmao, 
leader of the East Timor independence movement, who is serving a 20-year prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 While no senior U.S. officials met with the group, Christopher said Clinton 
raised the East Timor issue in his talks with Indonesian President Suharto. But 
there was no progress reported in efforts to find a political solution to the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 East Timor is a former Portuguese colony that was seized by Indonesia in 1976, 
an annexation never accepted by the United Nations. The territory has been the 
subject of numerous accusations of human rights violations by the Indonesian 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 As the protesters left the embassy complex, calm was reported returning to the 
university campus in Dili, the capital of East Timor. Security forces fired 
tear gas on the campus grounds Thursday after students pelted police with 
stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Dili has been in turmoil for two weeks, with frequent and violent clashes 
between Timorese protesters and Indonesian security forces. Most Timorese are 
Roman Catholic, while the Indonesians are predominantly Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indonesian government announced Wednesday that 30 Timorese arrested during 
the unrest will be brought to trial for their involvement in the disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement 
that it was concerned about the fate of 200 demonstrators reported missing in 
East Timor in the past two weeks.

MAJOR THREATENS TO CALL VOTE OVER EU FUNDING REBELLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebel legislators have driven John Major and his Cabinet into a "suicide 
pact," a threat to call a national election if he loses a vote next week on 
paying more for the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about real democracy, and people fought and died for that," said Bill 
Cash, ringleader of the dozen or so dissidents who are pushing their embattled 
prime minister to the brink for the second time in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Major agreed in 1992 to raise Britain's share of the EU budget, starting with 
an increase of $120 million, on top of next year's contribution of $3.75 
billion. By 1999, Britain would contribute $390 million more than had 
originally been promised. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, the anti-EU group appears to have sufficient support to defeat 
Major, who commands a slender 14-seat majority in the 651-member House of 
Commons. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many observers predict that Major will scrape through on a 
combination of votes from nine Northern Ireland legislators and cold feet by 
some dissidents at the prospect of the unpopular Conservatives losing power in 
an election. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the hard-core rebels, Cash, 54, is on the right of the party, 
articulate, diligent, and loathes the closer integration of the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 To Major, the persistent "Euro-skeptics" are an awkward squad putting him 
through a replay of the struggle over the Maastricht Treaty on closer European 
union, which Parliament ratified in mid-1993 only when the prime minister 
threatened to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Major has made implementation of the deal a sign of confidence in his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire 22-member Cabinet will resign and call a national election if the 
bill is voted down, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Euro-skeptics say Major and Clarke are bluffing, and argue that if Major 
loses on Monday, he will be challenged for the party leadership and there won't 
be a national election. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation comes at a bad time for Major, whose party is far behind the 
opposition Labor Party in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Another rebellion against Major is rumbling over a second increase in an 
unpopular tax on home heating fuels.

TURKEY, CRANBERRY, CHEESE WITH THE CAMEL

 American troops far from family dinners and Thanksgiving football games were 
treated to a hotel feast and an exotic dance, courtesy of a group of Kuwaitis 
grateful for U.S. protection. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,800 U.S. troops wolfed down roast turkey and cranberry sauce in a 
huge hall at a five-star hotel, while sword dancers in white robes and 
checkered headdresses performed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great, better than sitting in the barracks," said Spec. Jay Nix, 23, 
from Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 At the entrance, Bedouin tents were set up, and soldiers had their photographs 
taken beside camels. 
</P>
<P>
 The $87,500 tab was picked up by a number of Kuwaiti families and companies 
that wanted to show their appreciation for the troops, most with the 24th 
Infantry Division based in Ft. Stewart, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 They flew to Kuwait last month to counter an Iraqi military buildup just north 
of the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildup raised fears that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein planned to repeat 
his August, 1990, invasion of the emirate. But Iraq pulled back after the 
United States rushed tens of thousands of troops to the region, and Russia 
promised Baghdad to campaign to ease U.N. sanctions imposed after the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Faisal Kazemi, 51, was one of the hosts. He brought his two young 
boys to dine with the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the least we could do for our American friends who came quickly to 
support Kuwait, and who fought the Gulf War to free us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dinner guests were scheduled to leave by mid-December. Only a few 
hundred will stay to maintain heavy weapons in Camp Doha, north of Kuwait City. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-hour extravaganza, complete with prizes and live music, was the idea 
of an American couple, Sheila and Lionel Gittens, of Mt. Holly, N.J., who have 
lived in Kuwait for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Gittens said she wanted to give her countrymen and women a chance to 
familiarize themselves with Kuwaiti culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Spec. Terry Beyer, 28, of Freeport, Ill., said the Thanksgiving dinner was his 
first foray outside the camp since he arrived Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought the party and the food were wonderful. Only one thing was missing 
though, he said: beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol is banned in the Muslim country.

AT LEAST 2 DEAD IN FIRE AT POLISH MTV CONCERT 
</P>

 Fire swept through a shipyard concert hall in the Baltic port city of Gdansk 
on Thursday night, killing at least two people and injuring 200 others gathered 
to watch a telecast of the MTV European Awards, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A shipyard spokesman said "many more" of the 700 ticket holders were feared 
dead, while unconfirmed reports on Polish television put the death toll at 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out about 9 p.m., when an unidentified man carrying a bottle of 
gasoline jumped on the stage during a warm-up concert by the Polish band Golden 
Life, the spokesman said. It was not immediately clear how the gasoline 
ignited, but the fire quickly consumed the wooden hall and set off a stampede 
of panicked concert-goers, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities evacuated the area near the shipyard, best known as the birthplace 
of the Solidarity mass labor movement, because of fears the fire could spread 
to nearby chemical storage sites.

COVER-UP ALLEGATIONS MAY SPLIT RULING MEXICO PARTY; SCANDAL: ANALYSTS FORESEE 
PRI RUPTURE AFTER PROSECUTOR QUITS, CHARGING INTERFERENCE IN MURDER 
INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The party that has governed Mexico for 65 years faced potentially its worst 
crisis Thursday, with analysts and opposition leaders speculating that the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party could rupture after the dramatic resignation 
of Mexico's deputy attorney general and his allegations of a murder cover-up at 
the highest levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In a torrent of political commentary after Deputy Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz 
Massieu's Wednesday resignation, Mexican analysts said the party could split 
under the weight of the emerging scandal. Ruiz Massieu charged that top party 
officials had blocked his investigation into the Sept. 28 assassination of his 
brother, then the party's second-ranking leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Even short of a rupture, most commentators agreed that Ruiz Massieu's 
accusations will force President-elect Ernesto Zedillo to choose between the 
party's old guard and the progressive factions that Ruiz Massieu appears to 
represent. Zedillo, a 41-year-old reform-minded economist, will take office 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruiz Massieu is sending the president-elect a virtual ultimatum," Sergio 
Sarmiento, a prominent political analyst, wrote in a Thursday editorial in the 
Mexico City newspaper Reforma. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarmiento echoed other predictions of a deep party conflict in an interview 
with Mexico's English-language daily, the News. "The way Ruiz Massieu announced 
his resignation creates tremendous pressure within the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (or PRI) that could lead to an actual split," he told the 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the speculation focused on the possible emergence of a new party from 
among ruling-party reformists, probably led by Ruiz Massieu and former Mexico 
City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis, who discussed the possibility in a recently 
published book. Camacho Solis, who most recently served as head of a peace 
commission formed to negotiate a political settlement with armed guerrillas in 
the southern state of Chiapas, dropped out of active party politics after a 
public falling out with Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu thanked the leaders of Mexico's two main opposition parties 
during his emotional resignation speech Wednesday, and later he met with 
opposition members of the Mexican legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI President Ignacio Pichardo and the senator who replaced the party's 
murdered secretary general, Maria de los Angeles Moreno, emphatically denied 
Ruiz Massieu's allegations. But opposition leaders leaped to defend the deputy 
attorney general and invite him to future political strategy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree with the conclusions Mario Ruiz Massieu drew that there no longer is 
any doubt that this assassination was political from the start and that its 
motive was political," declared a statement from the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party, or PRD, which placed third in August's national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the largest opposition force, the conservative National Action 
Party, or PAN, called Ruiz Massieu's denunciations "the strongest blow ever 
received by the ruling party," adding hopefully that it could mark the 
beginning of the party's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Party President Carlos Castillo Peraza called a press conference to express 
PAN's "admiration" for Ruiz Massieu and his "valor and dignity." Castillo also 
called for the resignation of Mexican Atty. Gen. Humberto Benitez, who 
strenuously denied his deputy's charges that he too was part of a conspiracy to 
block the murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to calls from the opposition and other supporters of Ruiz Massieu, 
Zedillo stressed in a press conference after meeting President Clinton in 
Washington on Wednesday that the probe into the assassination of Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu will continue until the crime is solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo, who called the deputy prosecutor's charges "very grave," made no 
further comment after he returned to Mexico on Thursday.

DEATH SENTENCE ORDERED IN ISRAEL SUICIDE BOMBING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Israeli military court Thursday sentenced to death a Palestinian for 
plotting a suicide bus bombing that killed six people last April. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sentence is upheld, Said Badarneh, 24, of the militant Muslim Hamas 
movement, would become the second person to be executed in Israel.Nazi 
mastermind Adolf Eichmann was hanged in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The court deliberated for five hours before announcing its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas warned that if Israel carried out the sentence, it would be costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel will pay a high price for that," Imad Falouji, one of the top Hamas 
leaders in the Gaza Strip, said when asked about the ruling. "They are 
committing a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Israel) will encourage our Islamic fighters to make more suicide 
attacks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge court sitting in Janin in the West Bank said Badarneh, of the 
West Bank village of Yabad, sent the suicide bomber to blow up a bus in the 
central station of Hadera in northern Israel on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty people were wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas, which rejects Israel's right to exist, said at the time that the attack 
was to avenge the February massacre of Arab worshipers by a Jewish settler in 
the West Bank town of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence can still be overturned by a military court of appeals or by the 
Israeli army commander responsible for the occupied West Bank. There have been 
several cases of death sentences imposed by Israeli military courts being 
reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio quoted the judges as saying they were aware the world community 
opposed capital punishment. But it said the court made a point of saying long 
jail terms had so far failed to deter a wave of suicide attacks by Islamic 
militants.

RABIN, ARAFAT TRY TO RESTORE PEACE PROCESS MOMENTUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, in an 
air-clearing meeting after a month of crises, attempted here Thursday to 
restore the cooperation that underpins the search for peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin -- who did most of the talking in the cordial, 45-minute session -- said 
the two discussed the agenda for negotiations that open next week on 
Palestinian national elections and on an accompanying pullback by Israeli 
troops from Palestinian towns and villages on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man, however, would do more than describe their private, one-on-one 
session as positive. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders, who had just received a Spanish peace prize for their efforts 
to end the Arab-Israeli conflict, had wanted to move beyond the recent clashes 
in the Gaza Strip between Arafat's supporters and radical Muslim 
fundamentalists and the continuing attacks by the radicals upon Israeli 
soldiers and civilians, in both Gaza and Israel itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace process is in a continuous crisis and is really in danger, great 
danger even, of stalling," an Arafat adviser commented. "We need to recover the 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Israeli and Palestinian officials, the issues before the two 
leaders were threefold: 
</P>
<P>
 * Negotiations on the Palestinian elections, originally envisioned for last 
July, and the Israeli redeployment that is to precede them on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * The development assistance needed by the Palestinian Authority, which Arafat 
heads as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 * The tense situation in the Gaza Strip, where further protests are expected 
today by supporters of the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, and the 
militant group Islamic Jihad to denounce the killing last Friday of at least 12 
people during clashes with the Palestinian police. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Arab mediators secured a temporary truce between Hamas and Fatah, the 
PLO's largest faction, that is meant to prevent violence from erupting. But 
even the mediators have doubts about whether the truce, worked out at the 
senior political level, will keep order in the street, which is increasingly 
dominated by youthful, armed activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow is a test for all sides," said Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab and 
PLO activist, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The truce calls for all factions to leave their weapons at home while 
negotiations on a larger political settlement between Hamas and Fatah continue. 
Only the Palestinian police are to carry weapons in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatah members plan a counter-rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is extremely delicate, extremely delicate," the Arafat aide 
said. "We must get through this weekend, and then next week -- in negotiations 
with the Israelis and with the international aid donors -- (and) recover the 
momentum toward peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat called again on Thursday for national elections for the Palestinians on 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, both as a way of establishing the credibility of 
his appointed government and settling the balance of power between the 
competing Palestinian political factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most important means of reinforcing the peace process and 
guaranteeing its continuation and achieving its goals is by enabling the 
Palestinian people to choose their representatives and political bodies, 
freely, through an honest election process under international supervision," 
Arafat told the awards ceremony in this northern Spanish city. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin noted at an earlier press conference in Madrid, however, that first 
there must be an agreement on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian 
towns and villages on the West Bank and that this will be difficult because of 
the need to protect the 125,000 Jewish settlers living there. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat also called on the World Bank to release more of the $2.4 billion 
pledged last year by the international community to finance Palestinian 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 With donors scheduled to meet next week in Brussels, Rabin urged Arafat to 
meet their requirements for "transparent and accountable" handling of the 
funds, and he pledged Israel's support in getting the aid. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than their declarations, however, was the evident mutual effort 
to clear the air after the turmoil in Gaza and to accelerate the negotiations 
that had bogged down in the recriminations over who was responsible for the 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 In unusual public praise for Arafat, Rabin described him as a man committed, 
like himself, to turning a century of conflict into an era of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that Chairman Arafat is of the same mind -- that man can live in 
another way," Rabin said. "Enough of hostility which knows no end. If we did 
not believe this, we would not stand here together this evening and be awarded 
this distinguished prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that a hundred years of bloodshed would not be wiped out in a single 
handshake, with a smile before a camera," Rabin said as he accepted the Prince 
of Asturias peace prize from Prince Felipe, the Spanish crown prince. "But we 
did not believe just how bitter would be those enemies of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 In a gesture to Rabin, Arafat toned down his rhetoric and even omitted his 
usual call for Arab East Jerusalem to be the capital of an independent 
Palestinian state, confining himself to a description of the city as sacred to 
Muslims, Christians and Jews alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Israeli officials now express open pessimism about the chances that the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace process will survive without a sudden, drastic 
improvement in the fortunes of the Palestinian governing authority in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to blaming the international donors for failing to deliver 
promised aid, the Israelis blame Arafat for incompetence in governing and 
vacillation in dealing with the Islamic militants and other opponents of the 
peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat came to Spain looking for reassurance from Rabin that Israel will twist 
the arms of international donors in Brussels, where donors are expected to 
agree to speed up the delivery of aid to the Palestinian Authority. Both Rabin 
and Arafat believe that an adequate flow of aid into Gaza is vital for the 
continued health of Arafat's ailing government.

PHONE TRANSCRIPTS PLAY ROLE IN FBI PROBE OF CISNEROS; CABINET: AGENTS ARE 
REVIEWING TAPED CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN HUD SECRETARY, EX-MISTRESS TO DETERMINE 
IF HE LIED ABOUT PAYMENTS TO HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It's going to be dicey," the Cabinet nominee confided in a telephone call to 
a close acquaintance. "The FBI is crawling all over everything." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, his mood seemed to have brightened. The FBI agents were 
"gossipers and scandalizers," he said in another telephone conversation and 
"real bad at tracking down financial things." 
</P>
<P>
 According to transcripts of the calls now in the hands of federal 
investigators, Henry G. Cisneros expressed those thoughts in early 1993, not 
long before he was confirmed as President Clinton's secretary of housing and 
urban development. 
</P>
<P>
 The excerpts from two telephone conversations are among 86 between Cisneros 
and his former mistress, Linda Medlar, who secretly recorded the calls and 
prepared transcripts of them. She later gave some of the transcripts to a 
tabloid television show, which paid her $15,000 for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The full 40 hours of recordings and the transcripts are being reviewed by FBI 
agents and lawyers from the public-integrity section of the Justice 
Department's criminal division. The investigators are trying to determine 
whether Cisneros told FBI agents the truth about his financial relationship 
with Medlar when they questioned him before his Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to that question could determine not only whether Cisneros can keep 
his job but whether he deliberately misled federal investigators and Congress 
and should face criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents are now about a month into the 90-day preliminary inquiry, which Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno will rely on in deciding whether to seek appointment of an 
independent counsel to conduct a full-scale investigation. But indications are 
that because of the sensitivity of the case, the FBI may take the rare step of 
going beyond 90 days to complete the preliminary inquiry. The law provides for 
an extension of up to 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar's transcripts -- which may be the subject of a legal challenge from 
Cisneros' attorneys on authenticity grounds -- suggest that he was concerned 
that his payments to Medlar could sink his nomination. Copies of most of the 
transcripts -- parts of which previously have been made public -- were obtained 
by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The recorded calls introduce potentially embarrassing details that the FBI 
appears not to have known when it questioned Cisneros as a Cabinet nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Cisneros apparently agreed to have Morris Jaffe, a controversial 
San Antonio entrepreneur and Democratic contributor, make payments to Medlar on 
his behalf, as has been reported previously. In one conversation, according to 
the transcripts, Cisneros urged Medlar to accept between $5,000 and $17,000 
from Jaffe, although he then expressed concern about the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 That Cisneros, a married man, carried on a long relationship with Medlar was 
not news to Clinton's Cabinet selection team. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship began in 1987, when Cisneros was mayor of San Antonio and 
Medlar was his employee. The romance was revealed -- and confirmed by Cisneros 
-- in a front-page story in a San Antonio newspaper in October, 1988, several 
months after Cisneros had announced that he would not seek another term. By 
then, Medlar had left Cisneros' office. She subsequently was fired from 
consulting jobs for two other politicians because of publicity about the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 What the public did not know, however, was that after the romance ended in 
late 1989, Cisneros began sending money to Medlar to compensate her for lost 
income resulting from the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 While neither side disputes that the payments were made, they disagree on the 
amount and regularity of them. Medlar has insisted that by mutual consent, 
Cisneros agreed to send $4,000 a month until her teen-age daughter graduated 
college -- a recognition that she could not find work and that her health had 
suffered because of the publicity about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros' Washington lawyer, Cono R. Namorato, said the payments were 
irregular and that Cisneros never kept a record of them. As to whether Cisneros 
had any obligation to pay Medlar, he said: "I can't answer the question. . . . 
That is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar has filed a civil suit in Texas state court over the arrangement, 
seeking $256,000 in support payments from Cisneros that she claims are owed her 
under terms of a verbal agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagal Wheatley, Cisneros' Texas attorney, has filed a motion to dismiss the 
lawsuit on grounds that "there is no legally enforceable contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Transcripts of the Cisneros-Medlar conversations indicate that he was deeply 
concerned that the payments could derail his selection for the Cabinet job. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the transcripts, both agreed that continuing regular payments to 
Medlar would be more difficult financially, as well as politically, if he 
accepted a Cabinet post at a salary much lower than he earned in private 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the future financial arrangement, the two agreed that they would keep 
it secret. According to the transcripts, the two were willing for federal 
officials to know that Cisneros had made payments to her in the past but wanted 
them to believe that no financial arrangement existed for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big problem is future payments," Cisneros said in one transcript. He 
added that he "clearly gave the impression" to Clinton aides and FBI agents 
screening his background that no more payments were being made to Medlar. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, when Medlar asked how he would handle questions about the 
payments at his Senate confirmation hearings, Cisneros replied, according to 
the transcripts: "The subject probably is not even going to come up."  
</P>
<P>
 Later, according to the transcripts, he told Medlar: 
</P>
<P>
 "If it does, I'll tell them what we agreed and the only person in the world 
who can sink me at that point . . . and I'm talking contempt of Congress -- 
jail -- is you." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the matter was not raised publicly at the hearings by the 
Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Chairman Donald W. Riegle 
Jr. (D-Mich.) declined to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes also reveal Cisneros' deep concern about possible discrepancies 
between the tens of thousands of dollars he already had provided and a much 
lower figure -- as well as a different understanding of the payments -- in the 
minds of FBI agents who interviewed him in 1992 and early 1993 before his 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a transcript dated Dec. 12, 1992, Cisneros told Medlar that 
federal officials "wanted to know the total amount of what I had done in 
increments" and "I told them: 'Well, it came to $10,000 -- $15,000 over a 
year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar's lawyer, Bruce Magness of Lubbock, Tex., said the payments at the time 
actually amounted to more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the same transcripts, Cisneros said he had told authorities that 
the largest single sum he had ever given Medlar was $2,500 -- even though his 
regular monthly payments had totaled $4,000 starting in January, 1990. That was 
in addition to $16,000 he gave her in 1992 for a down payment on a house in 
Lubbock and $7,500 later that year to cover her medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Magness said that in March, 1990 -- two months after the payments started -- 
Medlar began secretly taping her phone conversations with Cisneros, upon the 
advice of a friend. They reasoned that because he already had reneged on a 
promise to divorce his wife and marry Medlar, she should keep an accurate 
record of their relationship. Their affair had ended by that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros made sporadic payments to Medlar during his first year as HUD 
secretary -- starting in January, 1993 -- but no payments have been received 
since last January, Magness said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts indicate that Cisneros had some concerns about the money paid 
to Medlar by Jaffe on Cisneros' behalf. At one point, according to the 
transcripts, he declined to act as a go-between, expressing concern that Jaffe 
would be required by law to disclose any money he gave to a federal official. 
Instead, he urged Medlar to approach Jaffe herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlar eventually made such a call and subsequently received a $5,000 check 
from Jaffe marked "loan," according to transcripts of a conversation she had 
with Cisneros in December, 1993. (Another source familiar with the payment said 
that it actually was $7,600.) Later she said she received $12,000 more from 
Jaffe through a small company owned by her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Transcripts show that Cisneros referred to Jaffe as "a savior." 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing illegal in any of the actions attributed to Jaffe. He 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the reported conversations in 1992 and early 1993, Cisneros assured Medlar 
repeatedly he would not take a job in Washington unless he could find a way to 
continue supporting her financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros is quoted as assuring her in a transcript dated Nov. 22, 1992: "I 
would not do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros' lawyer, Namorato, acknowledging that he was "speculating," said 
Cisneros may have made some of the statements captured by the tape merely to 
calm Medlar. "I'm speculating, but she seems like a very erratic person. He may 
have been minimizing the whole thing to her for fear of setting her off." 
</P>
<P>
 The authenticity of the tape transcripts may be challenged because of Medlar's 
own description of how they were prepared. In a sworn statement in late 
September as part of her civil suit, she said the transcripts were prepared by 
her sister-in-law, who checked with Medlar when she could not hear some words. 
</P>
<P>
 The accuracy of the transcripts may not matter. The FBI, following standard 
procedure, is making its own transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the account of the relationship that Cisneros gave FBI agents in 1992 
and 1993, there are no verbatim transcripts. Rather, agents wrote reports of 
the interviews based on their notes -- a standard FBI practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if discrepancies are found in the explanation Cisneros gave FBI agents, 
the preliminary inquiry would have to determine whether they were "material," 
and the kind of matter that prosecutors would normally pursue under the federal 
criminal code that outlaws lying to federal agents.

SUIT CHALLENGES ASSISTED-SUICIDE LAW IN OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of doctors and patients is suing to block Oregon's new law allowing 
physician-assisted suicide, saying it is unconstitutional and will pressure 
sick people to end their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure narrowly approved by voters Nov. 8 would allow doctors, under 
certain conditions, to prescribe lethal drugs to patients with less than six 
months to live.It is to take effect Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something needs to be done to protect the patients from this bill," said Dr. 
Gary Lee, who is suing with another doctor and several disabled or terminally 
ill patients. "The safeguards are really inadequate. When people become 
seriously ill, when they are diagnosed with cancer, they become vulnerable to a 
lot of factors," Lee said. "They may become depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Thomas Alderman, who filed the federal lawsuit Wednesday in Eugene, 
said the measure violates the Constitution's equal protection and due process 
guarantees, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was expected by supporters of the suicide measure.

ARKANSAS GOVERNOR ASSAILS WHITEWATER PROBE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Jim Guy Tucker denied criminal involvement in the Whitewater affair and 
suggested that the special prosecutor was either deliberately leaking 
information for political purposes or was "recklessly loose" in his procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, a Democrat, summoned reporters to the Arkansas governor's mansion late 
Thanksgiving afternoon to denounce a report in Thursday's Los Angeles Times 
that quoted unidentified sources as saying Whitewater special prosecutor 
Kenneth Starr is expected to seek an indictment against Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done nothing that would justify an indictment," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had absolutely no indication from the special prosecutor that an 
indictment is under consideration. I have not received any notice that I am a 
target of an investigation, nor have I been interviewed by the special 
prosecutor or asked to testify before the grand jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming governor, Tucker was a businessman who financed some of his 
enterprises with loans from Madison Guarantee Savings & Loan, controlled by 
James B. McDougal, a partner with President Clinton in the failed Whitewater 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Tucker loans came from an investment company owned by David Hale, who 
has accused Tucker and President Clinton of pressuring him to make fraudulent 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, visibly angry, said leaks from Starr's office and other government 
agencies were "illegal," but "near routine." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested the leaks were "deliberate and are done for political purposes" 
or "the result of recklessly loose procedures" in Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker said the effect was "tainting or influencing the grand jury members or 
future jury members."

ANATOMY CLASS NOT FOR THE QUEASY; EDUCATION: COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DISSECT 
HUMAN CADAVERS IN PREPARATION FOR MEDICAL CAREERS. 'IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE 
CLASS, I'D BE NOWHERE,' ONE ALUMNA SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's a panic button inside the refrigerator where eight bodies are stored 
for scientific study at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the door closes and students get the heebie-jeebies, then they can just 
push it -- like this," said Kathleen Conroy, faculty coordinator of the student 
cadaver team that dissects human remains daily. 
</P>
<P>
 When she hits the button, the door opens swiftly, allowing a hasty exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Passersby unfamiliar with the college's dissection lab -- seeing a body laid 
out on one of the stainless-steel tables -- almost always do a double take, 
said Sharon Daniel, a professor of biological sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most ask, 'Is it real? Are the bodies real?' " said Daniel, who with the help 
of associate professor Ann Harmer has made the class a success among science 
students interested in medical occupations.  
</P>
<P>
 This is an independent honors class, the only one of its kind at an Orange 
County community college. Students can study damaged kidneys, blackened lungs 
and swollen livers in training that goes beyond what a textbook can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 After examining body parts over the years, Conroy, 32, has come to an 
optimistic conclusion: "It's amazing what can go wrong but doesn't. It's 
amazing how many healthy people are walking around." 
</P>
<P>
 Paloma Robbins, 23, a newcomer to the 17-member class, is thinking about 
becoming a physician's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Rey Mojares, 23, has his sights set on medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 And 19-year-old Garrick Owen, fresh from Orange High School, said that genetic 
research could be in his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Tammie Keller, 22, a former Orange Coast College student who took 
the class and is now rewriting syllabuses for graduate students in physical 
therapy at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. She also helps dental 
students by exposing the cranial nerve system on human specimens so they can 
get a look at where all their numbing injections are going. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the class, I'd be nowhere," Keller said in a telephone 
interview. "You can't get the same experience anywhere around. There's nothing 
like it. I took 500 hours and in the end it was so interesting, I couldn't keep 
away from it. It was a way of keeping my sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Not just any Orange Coast College student can register for the cadaver 
prosection class, as it is officially known. They must be invited by 
professors, and a five-unit human anatomy class is a prerequisite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dissecting preserved cats is a good preamble, but you don't really start 
learning until you've prosected a human body," Daniel said.  
</P>
<P>
 The bodies are provided by the UC Irvine and UC San Diego medical schools, 
which have willed-body donation programs. Autopsies are not performed on the 
bodies, and once the dissection and study are completed, the medical schools 
pay for cremation and the scattering of ashes at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 What type of people donate their bodies for student exploration? 
</P>
<P>
 "They come from all walks of life," said William Collins of UC San Diego's 
medical school. "Men, women, even entire families will donate, but you really 
don't know when your time is coming, so it's better to plan ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said older donors often remark that they have had such healthy lives 
and good medical care that willing their bodies to science is their way of 
giving something back. He said the donor program has two requirements -- that 
donors be of average weight and height and that they do not die of a 
communicable disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But do the donors know that community college students, in some cases, will be 
performing rudimentary dissections? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes, we're upfront with them," Collins said. "But most people who sign up 
for the program don't care; they just want their bodies to be used." 
</P>
<P>
 The donors remain anonymous, but students give the bodies nicknames. One is 
called "Jacques" because he was an oceanographer; another is "Master Poe," for 
no reason at all. A third is called "Vanna" and a fourth, is called "Tiny." But 
students say they mean no offense; disrespect, it is just their way of 
identifying the specimens, which is easier than using numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every student in this class is serious and appreciates and respects the human 
body," Conroy said.

BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD; ARCHITECTURE: WALT DISNEY FIRST MADE HIS MARK IN 
CARTOON FEATURES, AND THE COMPANY THAT BEARS HIS NAME IS BUILDING A UNIQUE 
SHRINE TO ITS RENEWED SUCCESS IN THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Someone in the universe may be unaware of the Walt Disney Co.'s renewed 
success with animated films since Ariel, the Little Mermaid, flippered onto 
movie screens, lunch boxes and pajamas in 1989. But probably not many people 
who drive nowadays on the Ventura Freeway through Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 There, freeway adjacent, the word ANIMATION is splayed in 14-foot-high letters 
across a new building that experts describe both as an instant landmark in the 
often featureless sprawl of Southern California and as a very public symbol of 
an art form that has conquered the worldwide marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 How could the Disney studio's new animation building not be eye-catching? Its 
entrance is topped by a two-story version of the cone hat worn by Mickey Mouse 
in the "Sorcerer's Apprentice" segment of "Fantasia." Its freeway side has an 
enormous, striped facade that reminds some commuters of a film reel with 
sprocket holes and others of a Mohawk haircut. Lighted at night, it resembles a 
1930s cruise ship improbably sailing the adjacent Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter whatever else the company ever did or will ever do, the 
contribution that Walt Disney made in animated films is one of the most 
important things in 20th Century culture," declared architect Robert A. M. 
Stern during a recent tour of the structure he designed. "So a building about 
animation should be animated, it should be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It also should be a place where 625 animators and other employees can continue 
Disney's primacy in family entertainment, according to Disney Co. Chairman 
Michael D. Eisner. Since 1986, Disney animators have worked in anonymous and 
increasingly crowded Glendale warehouses. "I think if there ever was a group 
that deserved a new building in American business, this group of artists 
deserve their own building," Eisner said on an inspection visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently unmatched for corporate patronage of high-profile architecture, 
Eisner has won attention for commissioning hotels, offices and amusements in 
California, Florida and France from such superstar designers as Stern, Frank 
Gehry, Robert Venturi and Arata Isozaki. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the startling results is the company's Team Disney headquarters in 
Burbank, designed by Michael Graves, which resembles a classical sandstone 
temple with giant statues of the Seven Dwarfs. Graves also created outlandish 
hotels at Disney World in Florida, one topped by five-story-high swans, another 
with Gargantuan dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics complain that Disney-sponsored architecture around the world is 
hokey, garish and just another publicity tool for an image-jealous company. 
"Architorture" was one Florida magazine's description of Stern's Disney World 
casting center, a fun-house version of a Venetian castle covered in 
gold-and-white diamond patterns. Other reviews have praised such Disney 
projects as Gehry's planned ice rink in Anaheim, which will look like two 
hillocks sheathed in aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company chairman concedes that architecture is sometimes part of 
marketing, although he insists the effect is pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it makes you smile, which I think is good for our company. If it 
makes you gag, then I think we've gone too far," he said. "But I think our 
buildings make you smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts liken the animation building's hat to so-called programmatic 
architecture: those wackily beloved Los Angeles structures that announce their 
identity, such as the hot dog stand formed like a frankfurter, the 
doughnut-shaped bakery, the Brown Derby restaurant. In the sorcerer's hat, 
Disney vice chairman and animation head Roy Disney will have a cartoonish 
office, a 60-foot-high cone with one small window and chandeliers curved like 
Mickey Mouse's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's using the identity of a product as a sales device. As far as 
architecture (goes), we have a long, glorious tradition of that in California," 
UC Santa Barbara architectural history professor David Gebhard said of the new 
building, located at 2100 Riverside Drive, across the street from the main 
studio lot. 
</P>
<P>
 What's also unusual is that movie studios, except for the Universal Studios 
tour, tend to be walled compounds with few hints of interior goings-on, added 
Gebhard, who is co-author of a seminal guidebook to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole tradition of studio complexes have been locked enclaves that try to 
protect their secrets and illustrious personalities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new $54-million, 243,000-square-foot building presents a public face, 
albeit behind metal fences crowned with hundreds of Mickey profiles. In its 
green, beige and terra cotta colors, its signs and movie theater-like entrance, 
it consciously mimics the 1940s Disney Studio buildings designed by Kem Weber. 
</P>
<P>
 Another inspiration for its swooping forms, Stern said, is the Pan Pacific 
Auditorium on Beverly Boulevard, an icon of Streamline design destroyed in a 
1989 fire. "I love the modernism of L.A. around the 1930s and '40s . . . so we 
tried to bring that back to life. And it's nice to do out here, because it's 
disappearing pretty rapidly," said the New York-based architect, who is on the 
Disney corporate board.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-seven years after Walt Disney revolutionized entertainment with "Snow 
White and the Seven Dwarfs," Eisner stressed that "the company has a right to 
say we're here. We don't have to be hidden in a warehouse anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But except for invitation-only visits to its 139-seat screening room, the 
building will be closed to the public to shield projects, Disney officials say. 
A reporter was guided through its three above-ground floors, but was not 
allowed into the basement, where high-powered computers and video equipment are 
being readied for the animators' move-in, which is to continue through January. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred miles of fiber-optic lines will link artists' desks to help 
produce at least one animated movie a year, including the upcoming 
"Pocahontas," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and a sequel to the 1940 
"Fantasia." 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as you can, this is set up for the satellite, computer, electronic 
world," explained Eisner. "But you know what? With all of that, you still have 
to have a guy sitting there drawing a picture and doing a gag and saying, 'Is 
that funny?' There's never a computer or satellite or a fiber-optic thing 
that's going to tell you whether there's an emotion, whether it's funny and 
whether there's a beginning, middle and an end. And without that, I don't care 
how many computers you have." 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. Disney's four animated megahits since 1989 -- "The Little 
Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin" and "The Lion King" -- have grossed 
more than $1.4 billion in domestic and international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not include home video sales or the seemingly endless merchandising 
deals on toys, T-shirts and towels. In the past decade, the animation 
department in California has increased fivefold, to about 800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Animation's continuing success has been a bright spot in an otherwise painful 
year for Disney, one marked by financial troubles at Euro Disney, a retreat on 
plans for a history theme park in Virginia, the death of company President 
Frank G. Wells in a helicopter crash, the bitter resignation of studio head 
Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Eisner's own bypass surgery. So, with the animation 
building about to open, Eisner seemed relieved to discuss his love of 
architecture for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Under exposed insulation and air-conditioning ducts, animation employees will 
have loft-like work spaces that are less expensive to build than traditional 
offices and intended to encourage interaction. Two-story-high glass atriums, 
vaulted windows and a towering glass lobby flood in natural light still prized 
by artists in this Macintosh era. Lounges are furnished like 1939 living rooms 
and picture rails are everywhere for hanging sketches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this building has its built-in funkiness, and once the animators and 
the story people and the computer people and the artists all come in, they will 
put their personality on it," Eisner suggested. "Come back in a year and there 
will be Ping-Pong tables and Frisbee games. And if somebody draws Pocahontas on 
the wall, we are not going to have a breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Stern, who teaches at Columbia University, added: "This is a very 
high-tech building in which the high-tech is kept very much in a recessive 
position. No one wanted to be inside a kind of rocket lab." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern's UC Irvine fine arts building and Pasadena police headquarters quietly 
echo Mediterranean palaces. His elegantly shingled Long Island beach houses 
revived and exaggerated old East Coast styles. 
</P>
<P>
 His Disney projects are larger, like the monumental hotels in Florida and 
France that mimic turn-of-the-century beach resorts and a cowboy movie set. He 
previously placed a giant "Sorcerer's Apprentice" hat atop Euro Disney's 
now-demolished preview center. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Harris, director of USC's master's degree program in architecture, 
thinks such styles might be wrong for a church or an insurance company. "But 
this is an entertainment company, so it seems to me like an appropriate thing," 
Harris continued. "I think Disney Studio wants to be associated in peoples' 
minds with upbeat, fun, positive, if not kitschy, kinds of feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Press reviews of the animation center are not in yet. Meanwhile, local 
reaction is mixed. A nearby Burbank homeowner denounced it and the dwarfs' 
statues as proof that the studio now wants a "glitzy" presence: "I think Walt 
would be twirling in his grave," the resident declared. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Burbank Chamber of Commerce lauded it, with a spokeswoman predicting 
that people will pull off the freeway to take photographs of the hat. "We 
expect it," she said, "to be quite a tourist attraction."

PARADE BACKERS ARE HOPING TO RECAPTURE THE ZIP OF DOO DAH; ENTERTAINMENT: A 
FAMILY-STYLE VERSION OF THE MADCAP EVENT RETURNS SUNDAY TO OLD PASADENA IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO WIN BACK ALIENATED FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Oh, but for the slap-happy days of the Doo Dah Parade's old Couch Potatoes 
entry, Sic semper potatum reclinus ("Thus always reclines the potato"). 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena's bad-boy parade is in a slump, no longer able to rest on its 
quarrels with the Tournament of Roses Parade (via the Torment of Roses act) or 
with the Moral Majority (through the Immoral Minority's jackets with fringe on 
the left arm, symbolizing its left-wing-fringe stature). 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's parade bombed as a small event requiring tickets costing up to 
$10. Recently, a group of Old Pasadena merchants unsuccessfully tried to can 
the parade, and word began to float around that Doo Dah might be done for. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year's 19th annual Doo Dah is trying to reinvent itself in its own 
schizophrenic way, as a half-screwball, half-family affair. No more mock 
pregnant nuns, no Macho Dog exposing private parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, an all-girl Catholic high school dance team will sashay alongside the 
Cal Trans-Vestites, a parody of public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not wild and crazy stuff, it's not the Mardi Gras, by any means," said 
Thomas Coston, director of the Light-Bringer Project, a Pasadena arts group and 
Doo Dah's co-sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Main Street of the '90s. It's a chance for everybody to get out 
and have a day of fun and meet their friends. It doesn't have to be more 
complicated than that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, which moved for the first time to the front of Pasadena City Hall 
last year, will return to the streets of Old Pasadena on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at 11:30 a.m., the shortened one-hour parade will move in a mingled 
procession and end with a music festival in Memorial Park, featuring Dread 
Zeppelin, a reggae band fronted by an Elvis impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade founder Peter Apanel admits that the 1993 event was a mistake, that 
this year could be the Doo Dah's do-or-die time. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still demonize me for what I did last year," said Apanel, 43, of South 
Pasadena. "In the short run, we're hoping that we could quickly overrun the 
stigma from last year and get most of the Doo Dah people back in the fold, but 
clearly there's been a residual PR problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The Doo Dah started on a whim, cooked up by Apanel and friends in a bar. In 
1978, the first parade had a handful of entries, including an accordion-playing 
urban cowboy, apropos of nothing. By the late 1980s, the parade had turned into 
a parody of itself, with live TV coverage, corporate sponsors and more than 
40,000 spectators and 100 entries. In a twisted case of inmates taking over the 
asylum, some spectators started to pelt entries with hardened tortillas and lob 
marshmallows at the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to gain control, and keep the parade out of debt, Apanel 
tinkered with Doo Dah's format for the first time last year. He cut back 
entries, charged up to $10 per ticket and put on a mini-procession around 
Pasadena City Hall. The event made no profit and drew a disappointing 2,500 
spectators and 30 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino resident Dante Field, a parade regular as the cosmetics-loving Lady 
Steve, said he would prefer tortilla-tossing hordes to last year's spectators, 
some of whom watched with folded arms and stony eyes that demanded their 10 
bucks' worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a point, it feels that they're not laughing with you but at you," said 
Field, 41, a recreation therapist. "I would take (tortillas) a thousand times 
over the dullness of the last one." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Synchronized Briefcase Drill Team hung up its suits after last year's 
bust. In past years, the wing-tipped team had lost steam after one-too-many 
spectators had fired squirt guns at them and blasted them with shaving cream, 
said drill team member Jerry Rogers, 38, of Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a group of Old Pasadena merchants recently submitted a petition 
with 100 signatures asking city officials to yank Doo Dah's parade permit. 
Merchants objected to the Doo Dah's messy aftermath, some of its campy entries 
and the parade's timing on a busy holiday shopping weekend, said Ray Leier, 
president of the Old Pasadena Business and Professional Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's parade was revamped, partially in response to some of the 
concerns, Apanel said. For the first time, he is working with a co-sponsor in 
an attempt to recruit more community-based groups. With more local participants 
who care about the community, the event is less likely to get out of control, 
Apanel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of this year's 75 entries are community groups, including a feminist 
history entry from Alverno High School, a Catholic girls school in Sierra 
Madre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get our point of view across, and we're not doing it in a 
silly way," art teacher Jane Jacobs said. "It's going to be straight. I think 
there's room for all sorts of things in the Doo Dah Parade." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will move quickly through the streets, with the focus on the 
festival at Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators are expected to join in, thereby leaving less of a mess behind and 
blocking storefronts for a shorter period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Streets will close only when the entourage passes various intersections, 
rather than closing streets for the duration of the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena police officers, who have overlooked high jinks in previous Doo Dah 
parades, will not hesitate to make arrests this year for common infractions 
such as throwing tortillas, which was banned by the City Council in 1992, Lt. 
Rick Law said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doo Dah regular Jacki Thompson knew the parade was in trouble when the 
Salmon-ettes entry high-tailed it back to Alaska after one particularly rowdy 
year. But she will be there for the ninth time this year, with her 76-year-old 
mother and friends, as the polyester-proud Lounge Lizards. She hopes old Doo 
Dah fans will be back, the ones who know the Lounge Lizards routine and run 
into the streets for the shoulder-to-shoulder chorus line from "New York, New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it'll ever go back to what it was," said Thompson, 36, a 
quality control inspector for medical products, "but all we can do is take it 
one Sunday at a time." Doo Dah '94 
</P>
<P>
 * Time: Sunday, starting at 11:30 a.m. and ending about 12:30 p.m. After the 
procession, a music festival will run from 1 to 4:30 p.m. at Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Old Pasadena. Starts at Memorial Park, Raymond Avenue and Holly 
Street, goes west one block on Holly, south one block on Fair Oaks Avenue, west 
two blocks on Union Street, south one block on Pasadena Avenue, east three 
blocks on Colorado Boulevard and north two blocks on Raymond, ending up back at 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Format: Doo Dah will move in a mingled procession, with spectators expected 
to join in, so the streets will not be blocked during the event. Afterward, 
performance groups and the reggae band Dread Zeppelin will perform at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Entries: 75. No entry fee, but a $10 donation is requested from each 
participant. Entries must register; no sign-ups on parade day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parking: $3 for the day in city lots.

A MAGAZINE THAT CELEBRATES THE HEROES OF EVERYDAY LIFE; JOURNALISM: NEW CITY, 
PUBLISHED WITH A U.S. GRANT IN AN ANTI-DRUG CAMPAIGN, TRIES TO BE THE 'DIARY OF 
A COMMUNITY,' ITS EDITOR SAYS. PARENTS OF STUDENTS ARE THE TARGETED AUDIENCE.

<P>
 Liliana Renteria never thought she'd end up on the cover of a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highland Park mother of a Monte Vista Elementary School student isn't 
glamorous like the models on the cover of Vogue. She doesn't make national 
security decisions like the politicians on the covers of Time and Newsweek. She 
hasn't starred in a sitcom or written a tell-all novel like the celebrities on 
the cover of People. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the editors at New City/Pueblo Nuevo magazine, it's about time people 
like Renteria got some press. And during its first full year of publication, 
the quarterly magazine has made a habit of celebrating the uncelebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Renteria made the spring, 1994, cover because of her involvement in a Monte 
Vista Elementary parents' group seeking to understand and offer alternatives to 
prostitutes who were soliciting customers at a local supermarket. Calling 
themselves the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Steering Committee, she and 
other parents sought cooperation from neighborhood social services and law 
enforcement to help guide the women toward a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people from our own community," Renteria said. "So we must help 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Editor John Godges sees New City as "more than just a paper. It's like the 
diary of a community." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling itself "the magazine for a drug-free Los Angeles," New City 
distributes 8,500 copies quarterly, the majority of which go to families of 
school children in the Pico-Union district, Echo Park, Hollywood, San Pedro and 
East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our readership comes from communities that are often neglected or politically 
powerless," Godges said. "No one expects them to be important. Advertisers 
eschew these neighborhoods. The beauty of this magazine is that it's a quality 
magazine for a community that probably couldn't support it" financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Each issue of New City costs about $10,000, most of which goes for printing, 
yet the magazine has taken no advertising. The magazine survives because it is 
the official publication of the L.A. Alliance for a Drug-Free Community, a 
nonprofit organization that administers a Department of Health and Human 
Services grant for a five-year anti-drug campaign in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides documenting the work of small school committees, New City features 
articles on alcohol advertising in minority neighborhoods, the relationship of 
violent crime to drug use, and editorial pieces on how communities can act 
together to effect change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Printed on thick, expensive paper with a glossy cover, the magazine has a 
decidedly upscale feel. That's because Godges wants readers and the people the 
magazine writes about to feel like their stories are just as important as those 
that appear in the national media. The more people who read the stories, the 
more likely they are to participate in the alliance's programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magazine is intended to be a tool for organizing, to allow people from 
far-flung neighborhoods to find out what is going on elsewhere so that we can 
build a true alliance among communities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every story in New City is translated into Spanish, Armenian or Vietnamese, 
ensuring that parents of students at targeted schools -- many of them 
immigrants -- won't feel excluded from the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We design it so that if we happen to be writing stories about four different 
communities that have different cultures, we can translate it into English, 
Armenian, Spanish or Vietnamese with a common meeting ground of English," 
Godges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Renteria, for example, does not speak English, nor do many of the parents 
involved in Monte Vista Elementary's parent committees. Renteria, who 
associates describe as a forceful and eloquent speaker, might otherwise have 
been relegated to the role of yet another voiceless Spanish-speaking parent, 
ignored by administrators and angered by not being able to participate in her 
son Isaac's education. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Carranza, a parent leader at Santa Monica Boulevard Elementary, said the 
appearance of an article about her efforts to improve relationships between 
Latino and Armenian parents and children in the Hollywood area played a big 
part in getting people involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really proud of that," she said. "And a lot of parents came up to 
me afterward and said 'Oh, we saw you in the magazine.' It was good that the 
article was in there to encourage them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carranza's group, the Building Cultural Bridges Committee, sponsored two 
well-attended cultural awareness nights featuring music, poetry and dances 
performed by Latino and Armenian students. After the presentation, parents of 
both ethnicities shared dinner in the school's playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The responses are very warm, " said Godges. "It's as if the people are 
students receiving their yearbook. They really take ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 New City gets its reporting done inexpensively by hiring bilingual student 
journalists with a desire to document the communities where many of them were 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pueblo Nuevo is a very warm magazine," said reporter Pedro Carillo, who has 
written for the magazine since its inception. "It deals with a lot of personal 
issues and conflicts. So that brought me to the alliance. It brings you back to 
earth. You could make a feature out of any one of these parents."

HOLIDAYS; HE SHOPS, SHE SHOPS; LIVING UP TO THE STYLE OF A MOTHER WHOSE GIFTS 
ARE PERFECT CAN LAY A CLOUD OVER THE SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 My mother's Christmas cheer hovers like a gray cloud, a shadow from which I 
might never emerge.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman is always thinking of the holidays. She called in February to 
announce that she had found the perfect gift for Aunt Sue. A summer trip 
through New Mexico yielded a trinket she is certain I will love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you finished your shopping?" she asked several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On this, the day after Thanksgiving, I have yet to begin.  
</P>
<P>
 The reason is clear: The suffocating abundance of her Yuletide spirit has left 
me seasonally dysfunctional. I am paralyzed by ghosts of Christmas past. Like 
the year when I was 14 and she not only gave me a coveted ticket to the Rose 
Bowl, but also arranged for me to go with the Stanford University marching 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the year, much later, when she bought me an electric keyboard.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't play the piano," I told her. 
</P>
<P>
 She shrugged. "Maybe you'll learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, I did. She knew I wanted to play music before I knew. 
</P>
<P>
 If her gifts were not always splendid, they were always plentiful. The 
Christmas mornings of my childhood brought dozens of carefully wrapped boxes 
under the tree, some containing items that I already owned. I would open a 
present only to find a paperweight that had been missing from my desk for a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is mine." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," she would say. "I just think people should get as many presents as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any surprise the holidays bring me dread? I am haunted by the certainty 
that I will never be as adept at Christmas as she is. I will never live up to 
her legacy. So many names on my list, so much pressure. I envision Christmas 
morning, loved ones unwrapping the presents I have chosen for them, expectant 
smiles dissolving. 
</P>
<P>
 "And his mother is such a wonderful gift-giver," they will muse. 
</P>
<P>
 My predicament approaches the state of victimization. 
</P>
<P>
 First comes denial, the rationalization that 29 shopping days still separate 
me from my Gargantuan task. Days tick by. Anger sets in, hackneyed ranting and 
raving about the undue commercialization of a blessed event. Finally depression 
arrives, leaving only a thin hope that if I wait until the last-minute, panic 
will inspire me. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will no doubt end the way it always ends. I will take my place among 
loathsome creatures who retreat to the bland comfort of the shopping mall and 
paw through crowded shops, placing faith in a combination of desperation and 
high-visibility retail. 
</P>
<P>
 My gifts will be serviceable but not inventive: A butter dish in the shape of 
a turkey. A wind chime or semi-intriguing garden ornament. A picture book for 
my grandparents: "Above the Grand Canyon" or "Beneath the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
 I have a theory that grandparents own picture books only because they have 
lived so long and accumulated so many possessions that no one can think of 
anything else to give them. No one, that is, except my mother. Two years ago, 
she gave my grandmother a quilt-making kit, which provided my grandmother with 
a rewarding hobby and the rest of us with handmade quilts the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 I can see Mom now, wrapping a Hopi Indian blanket she found for next to 
nothing at a garage sale last spring. It will look perfect on the wall of my 
brother's den. She has no doubt received, by mail order, a rare edition of "The 
Scottish Gardening Companion" that Cousin Vickie will treasure for years to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 I should seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Home Shopping Club offers a 12-step program. But the thought of 
becoming dependent on Tootie terrifies me. I should have visited shopping malls 
in August, not actually buying but browsing, taking notes. Is it too late? 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of qualified and eager salespeople waiting to assist me, I 
tell myself. And, after all, it is the thought that counts. With each purchase, 
I might chant: "This gift is good enough, it's smart enough and, doggone it, 
people like it." 
</P>
<P>
 But as December approaches, as the Salvation Army rings damnation from every 
store entrance, my procrastination shows signs of settling into rigor mortis. I 
am considering religions that do not celebrate the birth of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Christmas gift from my mother has come in the mail. It sits on the 
dining-room table, a leering presence. I cannot bring myself to strip away its 
brown packaging to reveal the cheery wrapping paper she no doubt purchased at 
half-price last January. 
</P>
<P>
 She called the other day to make sure it arrived safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking that your grandfather might like country music if he gave 
it a listen. Something like the new Willie Nelson album," she said. "Have you 
gotten anything for him yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 How she mocks me.

HOLIDAYS; HE SHOPS, SHE SHOPS; BUYING PERFECT PRESENTS DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF 
MONEY, JUST A KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR LOVED ONES' DEEPEST WISHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The theory is simple. Great presents persuade the recipients that this is 
exactly what they wanted, even if they didn't real ize it until the wrapping 
flew. The trick, though, is knowing the secret heart of your recipient, not 
always easy when family and friends live a continent away. 
</P>
<P>
 I got the jump on Hanukkah and Christmas this year by spending two weeks 
visiting my mom and multitudinous sibs on the East Coast. Thus, buying family 
presents should be a cinch since their likes and dislikes, their needs and 
moods are so much clearer to me since I've seen them so recently in the flesh, 
instead of experiencing them as I usually do, through a phone darkly. 
</P>
<P>
 We have never spent large sums of money on gifts for one another and aren't 
going to start now, lord knows. The gift-giving laurel has always gone to the 
Ward who comes up with the present, however modestly priced, that causes its 
recipient to behave the most like a 5-year-old who just found his or her first 
two-wheeler under the tree. Our motto has always been, "If it won't induce a 
goofy grin, don't buy it." Another consideration when shopping for the family: 
Gifts have to be easy to ship. Nobody wants a boxful of shards. 
</P>
<P>
 First on my list and closest to home is my son, age 20-something. "Eric, what 
do you want for Hanukkah?" I asked recently. "Nothing," he answered. Now you 
and I both know that's a half-truth, at best. But not to worry. This child has 
always been easy to buy for, not the least of which reason is considerable 
generosity of spirit. I like to believe it's because he always got enough good 
presents but, for whatever reasons, he always acts as if whatever you give him 
is terrific. He reads and so believes books are fine gifts, he is always happy 
to get additional software, and he thinks of gift certificates to the Virgin 
Megastore or whatever as an opportunity to buy precisely what he wants, not as 
a failure of the giver's imagination. Probably he would still really like the 
puppy he began asking for early in the 1970s. But he's not getting Rover again 
this year. A TV set is a possibility, so he can watch MTV and I don't have to. 
But I'll probably give him shares in a no-load mutual fund, perhaps the growth 
fund Berger 100. Call me sentimental, but I think nothing says loving in an 
uncertain world like teaching your child about dollar-cost averaging. 
</P>
<P>
 From a gift-giving point of view, my mother is a toughie. She is an 
accumulator who would rather have a kidney removed than throw anything out. 
None of her offspring feels comfortable adding to the store of stuff that she 
has to spend so much of her time and energy dealing with. Another problem is 
that she is not really happy about the fact that she is older than the rest of 
us, and she doesn't care to be reminded of it, thank you. If Whistler's mother 
would have liked it, my mother will hate it. And mom won't hesitate to tell you 
what you can do with your lap rug, either. So this year I'm giving her the 
biggest bottle I can find of her favorite perfume, Chloe, and one thing she 
isn't expecting. I'm going to make it a point to spend more time with her. Not 
for her. For me. 
</P>
<P>
 I have one sister, four years younger, and I know exactly what to get her. A 
one-time history major, Chrissie has a favorite monarch the way some people 
have a favorite singer or actor. She is mad about England's King Charles II. 
Chrissie can quote you chapter and verse about his bawdy reign (1660-1685) and 
provide you with fingernail sketches of actress Nell Gwyn and the other 
lovelies who amused the Merrie Monarch.  
</P>
<P>
 What Chrissie doesn't realize she wants most for Christmas is her very own 
copy of "Forever Amber," newly released on videotape. What an utterly perfect 
big sister I am to give her a copy of the classic Twentieth-Century Fox film 
(1947) starring Linda Darnell as the fictional royal mistress, Cornell Wilde as 
the heartless cavalier who ruins her and George Sanders as King Chuck. Amber 
pays an unspeakable price for her indiscretion, but the Ward girls have always 
been notorious fools for love, and I know Chris will treasure it. 
</P>
<P>
 The older of my younger brothers, John, is uncannily like my late father and 
so is easy to buy for. My dad was greatly gifted about everything except 
staying alive -- fly fishing was only one of the dozens of things he did 
enviously well -- and so you could always buy him something that related to one 
of his talents, thus, making him, as well as you, feel grand. My brother John, 
his namesake, is the kind of person who walks into the back yard of his 
150-year-old farm house and says to his 3-year-old daughter, Hannah, "Let's see 
if we can call the birds." And then, unbelievably, he starts to make chickadee 
noises and, even more incredibly, chickadees start gathering in the nearby 
trees. Did I mention that he built the dulcimer he plays? 
</P>
<P>
 What my brother really wants this year is a 19th-Century left-handed broad ax. 
He found a reasonably priced one recently in an antique shop in Lancaster 
County, Pa., the Amish country near our childhood home, and it is just what he 
needs to chisel great-room beams from fallen trees for the ambitious addition 
he and his wife, Maureen, have planned for their house. But my guess is Maureen 
will get it for him as his big present (it's only $65, but the addition is 
going to cost them every penny they have). Instead, I'm going to give the two 
of them a romantic dinner out without their two adorable children, Hannah and 
John IV, who is 9 months old. I can think of a dozen things to get the kids, 
but I think I'll go with a classic: the newly released tape of Disney's "Snow 
White and the Seven Dwarfs." Eventually, Hannah and I will be able to have 
thoughtful discussions of Disney's misogyny. Meanwhile, I can't wait to hear 
her pipe, "Someday My Prince Will Come." Young Johnny will be happy if we let 
him chew on the box.  
</P>
<P>
 My baby brother, Jeff, is also a collector, especially of Baby Boomer 
memorabilia, and, thus, another piece of cake. A friend once thrilled him with 
a Bob's Big Boy bank, and his most beloved possessions include animation cels 
and a Mickey Mouse lamp. But there is another side to Jeff besides the inner 
child, and that is the inner accountant. Like me, Jeff loves to balance his 
checkbook and arrange his bills according to due date. This year he started his 
own copy-writing business, run out of his home, and so I'm going to give him 
the gift that keeps on giving, at least for the six years that the IRS suggests 
that you keep your tax records: "Quicken," the popular financial-planning 
software.  
</P>
<P>
 At this stage in my life I only buy a Christmas gift for one of my friends -- 
Maureen. She has been a boon companion for a thousand years. She drove me to 
and from college every day when we were girls hungry to know everything (and I 
couldn't drive), and she has stood by me through deaths and divorces and the 
other exigencies of modern life. She has never once pointed out to me that, for 
a smart woman, I am capable of doing some really dumb stuff too. Over the years 
she has given me several gifts for which I will always be grateful, including 
making a Christmas one year for me and my son when we really needed one. She is 
the kind of friend Shakespeare wrote about. I only hope he was lucky enough to 
have one like her. Our love for each other was forged in the course of campus 
debates about the nature of life and art, of what is good and what is lasting. 
So I know she will love her present: Harold Bloom's controversial book, "The 
Western Canon: The Books & School of the Ages." 
</P>
<P>
 The dean of American literary critics, Bloom makes the case for what he 
regards as the 26 greatest writers the Western world has produced, including 
far too many of the famous "dead white European males" to please people who 
believe literary greatness cannot exist without reference to contemporary ideas 
of social justice. Best of all, Maureen and I can argue about the book, after 
we both read it. (I propose we start by addressing the question, "Was Bloom 
temporarily insane when he omitted Dostoevsky?") 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I have one more big gift to buy. But if I tell you what it is, the lucky 
guy who is getting it might find out, and then it wouldn't be a surprise.

HOLIDAYS; MALLS MAKE TIMELY COMEBACK; MANY STORES HAVE COMPLETED QUAKE RECOVERY 
WORK TO REOPEN IN ADVANCE OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If you haven't shopped much since last holiday season, you might be surprised 
at what you find -- or don't find -- at area malls. The Jan. 17 earthquake took 
its toll, and some malls, most notably Northridge Fashion Center, are still 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have opened new stores in record numbers and still others in recent weeks 
have bulldozed through construction deadlines, reopening damaged anchor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Fashion Center, considered by many as ground zero for the disaster, 
still has 200 stores closed, but The Broadway and Sears stores reopened earlier 
this month. Seven other businesses on the mall's periphery have been open since 
soon after the quake: Fidelity Federal, Coco's, Just Tires, Bank of America, 
Great Western Savings, Pizzeria Uno and Sears Auto Center. The Bullock's store 
is expected to open in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the mall is scheduled to have a grand reopening on March 15," 
General Manager Lloyd Miller says. "We've been putting in seismic-upgraded 
columns and foundations and new skylights that run the entire length of the 
mall." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's parking structures will open next year, beginning with the south 
structure in January, the east in March and the west in June. There is no 
opening date scheduled for the north structure. 
</P>
<P>
 While sales have plummeted at Northridge Fashion Center, other area malls, 
especially those farther away from the epicenter, have picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales are up anywhere from 20% to 55% over last year," reports Louise 
Marquez, marketing director of Panorama Mall in Van Nuys. Woodland Hill's 
Promenade reports a 25% increase in sales in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Panorama Mall in Van Nuys was fully operable a day after the earthquake, 
except for The Broadway, which reopened in May. New stores added since the 
quake include GTE Phone Mart; Just for Kids, a children's used-clothing store; 
Town Style, a men's clothing store, and the Sunglass Source. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Promenade, the Saks Fifth Avenue store closed and is being replaced by 
the AMC Promenade 16 Theaters, due to open in October. New stores include Bath 
and Body, a women's toiletry shop, and Favoritz restaurant, which serves 
Continental cuisine and opened earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Management at all area malls hope for increased buying in December, citing a 
healthier economy and extra cash now that many residents' disaster aid checks 
have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate and lure shoppers, some malls have taken the opportunity to 
rearrange or expand stores after the quake did its own remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 At Topanga Plaza, the Robinsons-May, for example, reopened Nov. 10 with 
expanded housewares, consumer electronics and furniture departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's brand-new, inside and out," says Annette Bethers, marketing director. 
Also, Montgomery Ward reopened in September, and Mrs. Fields Cookies reopened 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 New stores include the Museum Company, which sells museum reproductions; Bare 
Escentuals, a skin and bath shop; Enzo Angiolini, a women's shoe shop; 
Bostonian, a men's clothing store, and a women's accessories shop called the 
Landau Collection. Two other stores are slated to open before January -- 
Starbucks Coffee and Rampage, a women's fashion store. 
</P>
<P>
 What's missing at Topanga Plaza? Pastille, a women's clothing store, and 
Stride Rite Shoes have both closed during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Robinsons-May stores that reopened in July at Sherman Oaks Galleria 
were also updated, and merchandise has been rearranged. Men's apparel and home 
furnishings are found in one store and women's apparel is sold at the other. 
All other stores opened 11 days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of the 140 shops at Sherman Oaks Fashion Square will be open by 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullock's store reopened completely in October, after temporarily 
occupying the former I. Magnin store that closed before the quake. The Broadway 
reopened some of its departments in late June and was back in full swing by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavily damaged parking structure, which reopened in stages, became fully 
operable Nov. 1. The square's sales have been down about 30%, Vice President 
Brian Pickering says, "but we expect a great Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Reopened stores are too numerous to list, but brand-new shops include three 
women's fashion stores -- Rampage, Susie Tompkins and 818 Freight -- and a 
girls' clothing store called Friends. Benetton, Guess and Ann Taylor have 
opened and The Gap plans to before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 After the New Year, look for the grand opening of Banana Republic and the Body 
Shop, a skin care and bath shop. Bebe, high-end women's fashions, and Baby 
Guess will both expand operations after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the shopping status at other area malls: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Fallbrook Mall will open three new anchor stores -- Ralphs grocery 
store, K mart and Burlington Coat Factory, selling men's and women's apparel, 
by the summer. (The Ralphs across the street at Fallbrook Avenue and Victory 
Boulevard will close.) The now-vacated Sears will soon open an outlet store in 
the vacant Builders Emporium space across the street on Victory. 
</P>
<P>
 New stores include Famous Footwear, a family shoe store. Mall management is 
negotiating with a number of restaurants. Stores that closed include 
Clothestime, Jarman Shoes and Nintendo video games. 
</P>
<P>
 * At Glendale Galleria, 264 shops and five department stores opened the day 
after the quake, but the west parking structure suffered moderate damage. It 
reopened Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galleria's new stores include several restaurants: Wazwan of India; 
Ruby's, a '50s diner; Crocodile Express, serving Italian cuisine; Auntie 
Anne's, a pretzel shop; Cleo & Cucci, serving continental cuisine; Surf City 
Squeeze, a juice bar, and Monterey Pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new stores include a stamp store named Stamp Stamp Stamp; KCET Store of 
Knowledge; San Rio Surprises, which sells toys and gifts; FAO Schwarz Toy 
Store; the Franklin Mint; Optical Fashion Center; Merle Norman Makeup; 
Christopher Ranch, a gourmet food store; Creation Sci Fi, which sells "Star 
Trek" memorabilia; 1928 Vintage Shop, which sells vintage clothing and jewelry; 
the Museum Company, which sells museum reproductions; the Body Shop, and First 
Issue, a women's apparel shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen other stores relocated or have been remodeled in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood reports that the mall will be demolished 
after Jan. 1, except for anchor store Robinsons-May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Media City Center in Burbank has added On the Earth, a women's accessory 
shop, and Steve's Ice Cream. All stores opened within one day after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antelope Valley Mall in Palmdale added Victoria's Secret, a women's lingerie 
shop, and Video Concept, a video and movie memorabilia store, in September. 
Bath and Body reopened earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Valencia Town Center's stores opened within a week of the quake and the mall 
has since added Eddie Bauer, the Disney Store, Pretzel Time, Lisa's Beauty 
Supply, the Lollipop Tree (children's clothing), Vans Shoes, Hickory Farms and 
Maternite by Mothers Work, a maternity wear store.

 Hanukkah represents the Jewish fight for freedom. Around 175 BCE (before the 
Christian era), Antiochus Epiphanes, King of Syria, tried to wipe out Jewish 
religion by forbidding observance of Jewish rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 He sent troops to Jerusalem to desecrate the holy temple by installing idols, 
sacrificing a pig at the altar and sprinkling the blood on sacred items. Jews 
who took sanctuary in the temple were forced into slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the small village of Modi'in, a man named Mattathias couldn't stand to 
see one of Antiochus' officers desecrate a Jewish altar. Mattathias stabbed the 
soldier and fled with his five sons, including Judah Maccabee, and a band of 
followers into the hills above Jerusalem, where they became guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 After a final battle at Emmaus, on the road to Jerusalem, the Maccabees 
vanquished the Syrian forces and joyfully marched into a ravaged Jerusalem. In 
the temple, they found the sacred Torah scrolls torn and scattered. 
</P>
<P>
 After cleaning the temple, the Jews wanted to relight the temple's official 
seven-branched menorah, but could find only one tiny flask of oil. Legend has 
it that there was only enough to burn one day, but by a miracle, it burned for 
eight days. Today, a candle is lighted each night for eight nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no separate religious services for Hanukkah, special 
prayers are said in synagogues during this time and the festive occasion is 
marked by songs, food and gift giving. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Maccabees returned to Jerusalem and relighted the menorah, they 
issued new coins to commemorate the occasion and to show they were free people. 
Today, children often receive Hanukkah gelt -- which can be real money or gold 
foil-wrapped chocolates that look like the ancient coins. 
</P>
<P>
 A popular Hanukkah game is to spin the dreidel, a four-sided top. Four Hebrew 
letters on the sides of the top stand for the words nes gadol hayah sham, which 
mean "a great miracle happened there." 
</P>
<P>
 According to legend, the top was created during Antiochus' reign so that when 
Jewish people gathered to study the forbidden Torah, they could pretend to be 
playing a game when the soldiers came. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday is also known as the Festival of Lights because of the lighting of 
the candles. ROBERTA G. WAX

HOLIDAYS; BRIGHTER FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS; POPULARITY OF DECORATING FOR HANUKKAH IS 
GROWING. IT CAN SERVE TO PUBLICIZE THE OBSERVANCE AND HELP CHILDREN FEEL 
POSITIVE ABOUT RELIGION.

 Deck the halls with lights and dreidels? It's not exactly traditional Hanukkah 
decor, but many Jewish families are cele brating the holiday with more than 
just sparkily blue and silver tinsel garlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor menorahs that light up, two-foot-high Stars of David and strings of 
dreidel lights are some of the ways San Fernando Valley families highlight the 
Festival of Lights. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bliss family of Agoura, the idea of decorating their house for 
Hanukkah began, as it so often does, with their three children, who adored 
helping a neighbor decorate for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids wanted something to represent our holiday," said Marsha Bliss, so 
husband Richard designed and built a six-foot-tall electric menorah for their 
front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that a giant lawn menorah might not be kosher, they checked with their 
rabbi, who reassured them that even the Talmud, the Jewish book of laws, 
exhorted people to publicize the holiday, and that anything that made children 
feel positive about religion was good. 
</P>
<P>
 When their giant menorah was stolen one year, the entire community came 
together to help build others that are now sprinkled throughout the Agoura 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bliss said her children, 13-year-old twin boys and a 16-year-old daughter, 
still enjoy setting up the menorah and turning on one bulb each night of the 
eight-night celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blisses also outline a large picture window in blue and white lights, 
framing a more traditional menorah, or Hanukkiah, inside, while streamers, 
mobiles and nearly every decoration the kids ever made spruce up the family 
room. Presents are spread around a two-foot-high wooden Star of David. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased popularity of Hanukkah decorating is reflected by retailers, who 
are stocking a wider range of the holiday decor and paper goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernice Cooperman said when her family opened Shalom House in Northridge 24 
years ago, you were lucky to find a small selection of menorahs and some blue 
and white streamers. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, menorahs fit every taste and pocketbook -- from inexpensive $15 
models to funky Noah's Ark and baseball ones to fancy sculptured $400 works of 
art. Other popular sellers include plastic "Happy Hanukkah" banners that cover 
the front door, electric menorahs and strings of lights shaped like menorahs 
and dreidels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hanukkah has really come into its own," said Ilene Levy, manager of Party 
King in Tarzana, where hot items are garlands, banners and cutouts of dreidels, 
menorahs and even stick-on pictures of famed Jewish warrior Judah Maccabee. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Jewish people still are hesitant to make too big a deal over Hanukkah, 
saying it is not really an important religious holiday and fearing that 
decorating likens the holiday too much to Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always the hesitation that this would be perceived as Jews trying to 
be like Gentiles," said Rabbi Menachem Bryski of Chabad of the Valley, which 
hosts yearly menorah kindling ceremonies at local malls. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "part of the observance of Hanukkah is to publicize the 
miracle, to share it. When we light the menorah in our own home, Jewish law 
tells us to do it near a window or doorway." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah decorations will be downplayed this year at the North Valley Jewish 
Community Center nursery school, where "we used to go all out," said Bernice 
Lieberman, director of early childhood education. This year, she said, "we're 
stressing the freedom of choice and trying to get away from the commercialism." 
</P>
<P>
 Roslyn Rozbruch of Sherman Oaks loves making the house look festive, as do her 
daughters, Danielle, 6, and Erica, 2, who help put up garlands, mobiles and 
Hanukkah cards. She hangs blue and white Hanukkah "socks" near the fireplace, 
but her husband draws the line at putting up lights, saying that would be too 
"Christmasy."

HOLIDAYS; LIMITS OF GIVING; EXPERTS DISCOURAGE PROVIDING TOO MANY TOYS FOR 
KIDS, BUT MANY PARENTS THINK IT'S FINE. 
</P>

 Melody Meyer vividly remembers a friend's dismay at the mountains of toys in 
the Meyers' Canoga Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She walked in and goes, 'I never remembered toys being scattered from one end 
of your house to the other,' " said Meyer, the mother of two daughters, age 5 
and 3 1/2. "Of course, that's coming from a person who doesn't have any kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer admits that her children have too many toys. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say kids have far more toys today than ever before, and the situation 
cuts through all economic classes. Television advertising plays a major role, 
but the driving force, they say, is parents, grandparents and other family 
members who are trying hard to please youngsters -- and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed at some of the things that parents tell me they've given their 
children for gifts," said Dr. Willa Olsen, a Northridge pediatrician. "From 
birth to 3 years old, it seems like, for the most part, (presents) are given 
for the parents' pleasure, not the child's." 
</P>
<P>
 With Christmas only a few shopping trips away, the situation for most families 
is going to get worse before it gets better. But there are ways to keep the 
number of toys under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Fish, professor of child development at Cal State Northridge, said 
children respond best when limits are set and adhered to, whether it's the 
amount of television they view, how much candy they eat or how many toys they 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can keep reminding yourself that you have a better sense of what is 
appropriate than your child does, even if the TV tells them otherwise," Fish 
said. "Also remember that when given too many things to attend to, a kid can't 
select and concentrate on the use of a given toy. Clutter increases a child's 
anxiety and nervousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Fish recommends the following general guidelines when considering toys for 
children: 
</P>
<P>
 Birth to 6 months. Mobiles are popular items, but make sure they are 
constructed in a way that an infant can enjoy them. "If, for example, the angle 
of the animals is vertical so that we as adults can see these delicious images 
and the child can only see the underside, this is not a good toy," Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not be lulled into buying any toy because of its colorful appearance. 
Children under 6 months are more enamored by the contrast between black and 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 "As adults, we usually choose pastels and other colors that are pleasing to 
the eye, but that's not necessarily to (the children's) benefit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months to 3 years. Consider the three S's: size, sanitation and surfaces. 
Like it or not, children are going to explore the world with their mouths. Toys 
should be big enough so that they cannot be swallowed, but can be easily 
washed. 
</P>
<P>
 Once children begin walking, they enjoy pull toys. Toy telephones and other 
items that foster imaginative play are also recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Preschool age. A good set of unit blocks will get years of use. "Children 
automatically learn spatial relationships and mathematics with blocks," Fish 
said. "Imaginative play is also continuing to blossom, so anything that helps 
connect them with the world that they are beginning to become familiar with is 
useful." 
</P>
<P>
 Fish also recommends toys that develop motor skills, such as tricycles and Big 
Wheels. But what can parents do if their home already resembles Toys R Us? 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Kolb, a West Hills mother of two, keeps a large plastic container in 
each room of the house so that Nicole, 3 1/2, and Andrew, 16 months, have a 
place to stash toys. Kolb acknowledges that her children have too many toys 
but, she said, "if you can't have fun under (age) 5, when can you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kolb said the system works for her family because the kids share with each 
other and guests, and put their toys away each night. Items such as blocks have 
been rotated in and out of the mix at different times when the children request 
them. "They take care of their stuff because if they break it, they know it's 
leaving the house and it's not coming back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And rather than looking at television advertising as an enemy, Kolb said it 
has become a valuable learning tool. "It used to be that every commercial 
brought the response, 'I want that,' " Kolb said. "But we're trying to instill 
the lesson that you can't have it all. You have to be more selective and be 
conscious of the cost of things. It was a problem at first, but it seems to be 
working itself out." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer, too, has found a solution. She said her children's toys will continue 
to be scattered throughout her home -- but they will be strewn about others' as 
well. The Meyers will be donating some of their toys to their church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going through our toys this week," she said. "And we're going to give a 
lot of them away to families that can really use them." Helping Needy Children 
</P>

families during the holidays are:

 Teacher Rocky Karbel fingers the golden "R" hanging from a chain around her 
neck. She flicks her wrist, jangling the tiny hearts on her bracelet, and picks 
up the embroidered denim jacket, showing off a few of the many gifts she has 
received over the years from students. 
</P>
<P>
 Expensive presents are swell, said Karbel, but the gifts that really touch her 
are the cards, pictures and personal notes of appreciation from her charges -- 
and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds corny," said Karbel, who teaches first grade at Riverside Drive 
Elementary School in Sherman Oaks, "but the gifts that mean the most are the 
ones with pictures of the kids and a nice note." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers often top the holiday gift list of appreciative parents and students, 
and it doesn't take much to make them happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching is such a giving and all-consuming profession that it is nice to 
know you are appreciated," said Arlene Schneider, a second-grade teacher at 
Dearborn Street Elementary School in Northridge. "A gift isn't necessary, but 
words of . . . thanks mean so much." 
</P>
<P>
 In these days of belt-tightening budget cuts, many San Fernando Valley 
teachers buy a lot of their own school supplies -- sometimes even paying for 
field trips -- so anything that can be used in the classroom is always 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Books, arts-and-crafts supplies, stickers, rubber stamps and ink pads, and 
gift certificates to educational supply stores always come in handy. 
School-related gifts that pleased in the past included books donated to the 
school library in honor of the teacher, globes, microscopes and a camera and 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 Mugs and plaques emblazoned with "1 Teacher" were the craze for a while, but 
the creative gift basket is the latest gift-giving trend and is being 
well-received. 
</P>
<P>
 Karbel recalled, for example, a Hanukkah-themed basket that included potato 
pancake mix, a frying pan and a stuffed blue-and-white bear, while a 
kindergarten teacher said a basket stuffed with finger puppets, cassettes with 
read-along books, puzzles and stickers is a gift she uses over and over in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers are as individual as their students; what pleases one could seem odd 
to another.  
</P>
<P>
 A North Hills fifth-grade teacher said he enjoyed receiving sweaters and 
shirts, but others said clothing is a very personal gift and tough to buy for 
someone you don't know well. 
</P>
<P>
 Karbel, who has been teaching for 24 years, said that because she shares so 
much of her personal life with her students they know just what she likes. A 
baseball nut, she has received sports memorabilia, gift certificates to sushi 
restaurants and decorative items in her favorite colors, green and purple. 
</P>
<P>
 One year an imaginative mom had all the children draw pictures and sign their 
names on fabric. The mom then turned the fabric into two large pillows that 
rest in a place of honor in Karbel's den. 
</P>
<P>
 Common gifts include stationery, picture frames, inexpensive jewelry, 
household knickknacks, perfume, bubble bath, desk accessories and, of course, 
the ubiquitous coffee mug. 
</P>
<P>
 Less well-received gifts have included a certificate for a facial, hors 
d'oeuvre forks, an obviously previously worn blouse, cosmetics and light-up 
religious figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In schools that serve low-income families, "Giving a teacher a gift is a real 
luxury," said Brenda Stern-Roter, a teacher for 18 years who teaches third 
grade at Kittridge Elementary School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 She values the notes, photos and pictures she receives, such as the one she 
got her first year of teaching from a boy whose card had a poem about 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, who has been teaching for 25 years, summed up the general 
sentiments of teachers: "Whatever a child wants to give to their teacher comes 
from their heart, and I really appreciate the thought." Favorites Remembered

 This year, instead of circling parking lots, fighting over tie racks and 
fidgeting in department store lines, try bypassing the mall for holiday 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor centers and gift shops at local museums and ecological and 
educational organizations stock a surprising array of innovative, high-quality 
and hand-crafted items. Offerings range from Guatemalan jackets in the gallery 
store at Cal State Northridge, to turquoise jewelry at the Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum, to homemade jams and jellies at St. Joseph Medical Center's 
farmers market. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only can you pick up neat gifts, but a portion of the money spent may 
benefit a cause. And since many shoppers never think of looking for presents in 
museums, nature centers or missions, there are rarely crowds to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few places to try. None of these charge admission for those who 
want to shop only: 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum store, 4700 Western Heritage Way, in 
Griffith Park, across from the Los Angeles Zoo; 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday; closed Christmas. (213) 667-2000. 
</P>
<P>
 This festive store is stocked with clothing, toys, tapes, videos, artwork, 
crafts and memorabilia -- all with a Western theme. You'll find cowboy duds for 
children and adults, including hats, vests, chaps, spurs and boots, as well as 
silver and turquoise jewelry, belt buckles and bolos. Works by Native American 
artisans, including pottery, beadwork, rugs, moccasins, kachina dolls and 
feather headdresses are also available. The large book section includes titles 
on Western architecture, history, cooking, humor and fiction. You'll even find 
cowboy gift wrapping paper.  
</P>
<P>
 Natural History Museum gift shop, 555 N. 3rd St., adjacent to Media City 
Center, Burbank; 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. (818) 557-3562. 
</P>
<P>
 This gift shop specializes in kid stuff, but don't look for Power Rangers or 
Barbie dolls. Instead, you'll find educational books, toys, stickers, puzzles 
and construction kits. There's lots of bug stuff too: rubber bugs, containers 
to collect and house bugs, books about bugs and an "Insect Lotto" game. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area visitor center, 30401 Agoura 
Road, Suite 100, Agoura Hills; 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.

</P>
<P>
 Ecologically themed books, posters and videos are the specialty. You'll find 
titles on natural history, wildlife and Native Americans, as well as a good 
assortment of children's books that promote environmental responsibility. Pick 
up hiking, biking or walking trail maps and guidebooks for the outdoor lover on 
your list, or buy a specialized field guide.  
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Payne Foundation, 10459 Tuxford St., Sun Valley; 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m. Wednesday through Saturday. (818) 768-1802.

a huge assortment of California indigenous trees, shrubs and flowers, including 
giant coreopsis (which has a large daisy-like bloom and grows in the Santa 
Monica Mountains), several fuchsia varieties, monkey flowers and California 
lilacs. Also for sale are dried flower arrangements, wildflower seeds, 
gardening books, field guides and "California Native" T-shirts and sweat shirts 
that sport a bright orange poppy on the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers Markets, 3rd Street and Orange Grove Avenue, Burbank; 8 a.m. to 12:30

</P>
<P>
 As many as 40 farmers, bakers and growers sell their wares at these outdoor 
markets, offering fresh fruits and vegetables, plants, flowers, home-baked 
breads and homemade jams and jellies -- everything you need to put together a 
gift basket of goodies. About a dozen artisans also sell crafts at the Van Nuys 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Mission gift shop, San Fernando Mission, 15151 San Fernando Mission Blvd., 
Mission Hills; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. (818) 361-0186. Just about everything in 
this shop -- from lapel pins to Christmas ornaments -- is religious-themed. 
Even the 500-piece jigsaw puzzles portray such works of art as Da Vinci's "Last 
Supper" and Raphael's "Madonna of the Chair." The store has a good assortment 
of Nativity scenes, toys and California history books. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge Art Council gallery store; 18111 Nordhoff St., Art Annex

 There are reasons why a man's wife balks at a blender or toaster under the 
tree, logical explanations as to why Dad might groan when he opens a box of 
generic underwear. There is absolutely nothing personal about such presents. 
The more a gift is individually suited to the recipient, the more special the 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 One grand example of this gift genre: commissioning an artist to paint a 
portrait. Reseda resident Jim Gaines, who has been painting for 60 years, now 
devotes most of his time and creative energy to portrait work. His 
oil-on-canvas works start at $1,500 for an unframed, single subject from a head 
and shoulder view and can run as much as $3,000 for two subjects or one with a 
three-quarter view. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines says the surprise element is one of the biggest draws of his business, 
particularly when lovers or spouses arrange it for their significant other. 
"It's the greatest thing in the world," he says. "People are very moved by it, 
it's a powerful thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gaines prefers to re-create the image from a roll of black and white 
film, working from his memory to capture a person's coloring, he can work from 
a good color photograph.

 What better time than Christmas to present someone with a connection to his 
family's past? Giving someone a "branch" of the family tree is a uniquely 
personal gift. Glendale genealogist Jan Jennings traces the roots of ancestors 
for an hourly rate of $25. 
</P>
<P>
 The time required to unearth the information varies, depending on whether or 
not the subject's family has been living in the United States for years or 
whether the subject is a first-generation American. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the cases of immigrants from this century, Jennings says she can trace 
records dating to the 1920 census. She needs a minimum of parental names, but 
prefers to have the grandparents' names as well. The more she has to work with, 
the less time-consuming the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, who has 13 years experience, has presented families with books 
written about their lives and has managed to trace some families back as far as 
six generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really neat present because it is so very personal," said Jennings. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Custom shirts are another example of a truly individualized gift. The Custom 
Shop in The Promenade mall in Woodland Hills makes dress shirts in a variety of 
fabrics using individual measurements. The shirts can be made for men with 
chest sizes ranging from 30 to 62 inches. The store's traditional-style shirts 
can also be made for women but there are no special, feminine styles available. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The store offers cotton-blend fabrics as well as luxe Sea Island and Egyptian 
cotton in 250 colors and patterns. Prices range from $49.50 to $79.50 per 
shirt, depending on the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who order only a single shirt, however, pay a $25 cutting fee, so it 
pays to order several. However, if a customer orders one shirt, likes it and 
wants to order more, the store will waive the previous fee when the second 
order of five or more is made. 
</P>
<P>
 The one glitch in arranging for custom shirts as a gift: getting the required 
measurements. Penn Taliaferro, manager of The Promenade store, says one clever 
woman strolled in with her husband on the pretense of simply getting the 
measurements on file for the future. Later in the week, she stopped back to 
place her Christmas order. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Having a fragrance created for a significant other is another unusual idea. At 
Body Scents in Encino, employees trained in the art of scent making can create 
fragrances for men and women. Owner Joyce Wilkoff or one of her staff will ask 
if the man or woman for whom the gift is intended likes flowery or sweet 
aromas. The buyer is then given choices to smell. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's "aromatherapy" experts then begin to mix with similar "notes," as 
the individual scents are called.  
</P>
<P>
 The final solution can be housed in crystal and silver perfume flasks, as well 
as some antique fabric bottles; prices for the containers range from $40 to as 
much as $70 for the precious metal containers. All hold approximately one 
ounce. Fragrances themselves are priced from $8.50 to $27 per ounce. The store 
offers labels to affix to bottles that read "Created for . . .."  
</P>
<P>
 If a customer orders a spritz instead of a pure oil compound, the volume 
increases because alcohol is added; many women buying scents for men opt for 
this. Spritz solutions are $13 for about four ounces. Although men are a little 
nervous about having their own scent at first, says Wilkoff, once a woman gives 
it to him, "he really loves it." 
</P>
<P>
 Body Scents (located inside Flair Boutique) 17237 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (800) 
782-9672. 
</P>
<P>
 A tailor-made story is a special gift for a child that can be created by 
anyone with a home computer and somewhat sophisticated printer. The idea is to 
write an original story about a child and plug his or her name into it. Print 
it out in large type, and add some pictures or original art. Buy a folder, 
punch holes in the sheets and secure them to the binder and voila: an instant 
personal story.

HOLIDAYS; GAMES REMAIN AMONG FAVORITES

 Everyone loves a good contest of luck and skill. Toy dealers fill up their 
shelves with new board games and old reliable classics knowing that a game 
isn't just a game -- it's an investment that keeps on playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take $20 and buy a stuffed animal which ends up sitting on a ledge 
collecting dust. Or you can buy a game that you'll use over and over again," 
says Doreen Ford, manager of Uncle Tom Toys in Montrose. "Good games provide 
play value -- they're inspiring and fun." 
</P>
<P>
 A whopping 134 million games were sold last year in the United States, 
according to Jody Levine of the Toy Manufacturers of America. That amount is up 
6% from the previous year, and it's significant, Levine says, because the toy 
industry overall showed only a 1% increase. "People are buying games more than 
ever," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that games make ideal gifts, says Abrahim Victory of Ventura 
Toys in Sherman Oaks. They're educational, enjoyable and encourage parties, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, entire families can get in on the fun, as the Smiths of Studio City 
testify. Parents Howard and Illisa play simplified versions of Life and 
Monopoly with their 5-year-old son, Josh. "He'll play on one level and we'll 
play on another," Illisa says. "We make sure playing the game is interesting 
for us, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Brown, owner of Buddy Brown Toys in Studio City, endorses this attitude, 
pointing out that "kids want to play their favorite games over and over again. 
This can get tiresome for adults."  
</P>
<P>
 All good toy stores keep their shelves stocked with a healthy inventory of 
classic games, like Scrabble, Chutes and Ladders, and Risk. "These old games 
are great perennials -- we are never without them," says Brown.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the old favorites, toy makers have introduced an array of new 
games that stores are recommending this year. Labeled by age, these run the 
gamut from wordplay to treasure hunts to exercises in manual dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
 Several novel games for younger kids feature a motorized toy with a simple 
premise attached. Gator Golf (Milton Bradley, ages 4 and older, $20) is a 
favorite among local toy dealers because it transforms any room into a 
miniature golf course. When kids succeed in putting a ball into the motorized 
gator's mouth, he flips his tail and hurls it back, then spins into a new 
position for the next player. 
</P>
<P>
 Two popular new games this year are based on movies: "The Lion King" and 
"Beethoven's 2nd." In the Lion King Matching Game (Milton Bradley, ages 5 and 
up, $7), little lion buffs get a chance to create, and re-create, an African 
scene.  
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven's 2nd (Parker Brothers, ages 4 and older, $10) revolves around the 
adorable litter of cinematic St. Bernards. Kids race around a brightly colored 
board catching the runaway pups.  
</P>
<P>
 For those who think they have a steady hand, there is a new stacking game 
called Bottle Topps (Parker Brothers, ages 8 and older, $16). A wooden milk 
bottle is the base on which players must carefully balance wooden milk caps on 
top of one another.  
</P>
<P>
 In a more technical vein, Beakman's World (Pressman, ages 8 and older, $15) 
aims to make science fun for the youthful set. Based on the popular TV show of 
the same name, this game challenges players' scientific knowledge and skills.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, several store owners predict that Crack the Case (Milton Bradley, 
ages 12 and up, $20) will be the hot party game for this year. Where and When

HOLIDAYS; WORD ON YOUNG READERS; BOOKSTORE OWNERS SUGGEST CHOICES FROM POP-UP 
BOOKS TO MYSTERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Urged on by TV advertising, kids clamor for Gymnast Barbie or the Dr. Dreadful 
Drink Lab, while books for young people go largely un-hyped. Luckily, 
youngsters of all ages love them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley is well-supplied with stores specializing in 
children's books and run by people with a passion for peewee-league 
page-turners. Three of these shops shared their suggestions for sure-fire 
holiday gift books, new and old. Some feature holiday themes, the rest have 
year-round appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 At Animal Cracker in Encino, owner Abbey Faranesh named a couple of favorites 
for preschoolers: the pop-up book "Worms Wiggle," by David Pelham, illustrated 
by Michael Foreman (Simon & Schuster $9.95), and "My Getting Ready for Bed 
Book" by Harriet Ziefert, illustrated by Mavis Smith (Harper & Row, $13.95).  
</P>
<P>
 For 4- to 8-year-olds, Faranesh likes Douglas Wood's "Old Turtle," with 
pictures by Chang-Khee Chee (Pfeiffer-Hamilton Publishers, $17.95 hardcover), a 
fable about a wise turtle who promotes understanding of the earth and its 
creatures. She also recommends Natalia Romanova's "Once There Was a Tree" 
(Dial, $13.95 hardcover), a story about the life force of trees, with 
illustrations by Gennady Spirin. 
</P>
<P>
 For the same age group, there's also the whimsical "Fanny McFancy, A Passion 
for Fashion," by Patricia Thackeray, with pictures by Sandra Forrest (Green 
Tiger Press, $12.95 hardcover). 
</P>
<P>
 Among her holiday picks for 4- to 8-year-olds is "The Wild Christmas 
Reindeer," written and illustrated by Jan Brett (Putnam, $14.95 hardcover). For 
older children, she suggests the adapted-for-TV classic "Sarah Plain and Tall," 
by Patricia MacLachlan (Harper, $3.50 paperback). 
</P>
<P>
 For young people with poetic inclinations, she offers the anthology "Talking 
to the Sun" (Henry Holt, $22.50 hardcover), which is illustrated with paintings 
from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  
</P>
<P>
 Another good source of children's reading material is Lewis for Books in 
Reseda, which stocks electronic titles as well as traditional books. "Demand is 
growing for CD-ROMs," says owner Nancy McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
 The field is young, but one of McMillan's early favorites is "Planetary Taxi," 
by Robert Mohl and Margo Nanny (Voyager, $39.95 CD-ROM), in which children ride 
through the galaxy and learn about various heavenly bodies. She is also excited 
about two just-released CD-ROMs: the educational adventure "Science Navigator" 
(McGraw-Hill, $149.95) and "Peter and the Wolf," a new take on the ever-popular 
tale, which is also available in book form. (Time Warner, $58.95 CD-ROM, $29.95 
hardcover). 
</P>
<P>
 For purely literary pleasure, McMillan notes that "the Jan Brett books are 
very popular for ages 4 and older, and even really young children will enjoy 
her marvelous illustrations." Among the titles McMillan cites are Brett's 
latest, "Town Mouse, Country Mouse" (Putnam, $15.95 hardcover) and "The Twelve 
Days of Christmas" (Putnam, $3.95 hardcover). 
</P>
<P>
 For first- and second-graders, McMillan recommends Judy Barrett's "Cloudy with 
a Chance of Meatballs," illustrated by Ron Barrett (MacMillan, $3.95 
paperback). 
</P>
<P>
 The 10- to 13-year-old crowd, McMillan reports, loves R.L. Stein's Goosebumps 
mysteries. These include "The Girl Who Cried Monster" (Scholastic, $3.25 
paperback). "They're a little scarier than Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys," 
McMillan says, "but kids love them."  
</P>
<P>
 Toddlers can cut their teeth -- literally -- on "Hey Diddle Diddle," written 
and illustrated by James Marshall (Farrar Straus & Giroux, $5.95), says Christy 
Meisner of Burbank's Secret Garden Book and Toy. "It's a board book with a 
rattle built into it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meisner recommends three books with both read-aloud and read-it-yourself 
appeal for the 3- to 8-year-old set: "The Roly-Poly Spider," written by Jill 
Sardegna, illustrated by Tedd Arnold (Scholastic, $13.95 hardcover); "A Tooth 
Fairy's Tale" by author-illustrator David Christiana (Farrar Strauss, $16), and 
"Pigsty," by author-illustrator Mark Teague (Scholastic, $13.95 hardcover). 
</P>
<P>
 For kids 6 and older, Meisner suggests "Ship of Dreams," written and 
illustrated by Dean Morrissey (Abrams, $17.95 hardcover), about a little boy 
who stays up to meet the Sandman. She also recommends "The Book That Jack 
Wrote" (Viking, $14.99 hardcover), illustrated by Daniel Adel, written by John 
Scieszka, who wrote "The Stinky Cheese Man." Meisner calls the new book "a 
madcap variation on 'The House That Jack Built.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two of her holiday favorites are "A Taxi Dog Christmas," by Sal and Debra 
Barracca, with pictures by Alan Ayers (Dial, $14.99 hardcover), and "The 
Christmas Star," by writer-illustrator Marcus Pfister (North-South, $16 
hardcover). 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday-themed or not, kid-lit critics agree that many of the best books for 
youngsters deliver an uplifting message. Even in a traditional format, they can 
be highly interactive and still have the power to captivate long after that 
mechanical bunny's batteries are dead. Where and When

HOLIDAYS; LUXURIES AT ANY PRICE; FOR JUST $5 YOU CAN GIVE SPICES MANY WOULD 
CONSIDER AN INDULGENCE. OR YOU CAN SPRING FOR ELEGANT $170 STATIONERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the streamlined '90s, few people grant themselves many luxuries. So, in a 
world where buying necessities takes up the bulk of income, even the smallest 
luxury feels like a major indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 Mention the word cashmere and most people immediately associate the soft, 
caressible fabric with indulgence. At Casual Corner stores, including the one 
in Topanga Plaza, $79 will buy a woman's long-sleeve cashmere sweater. It's an 
unheard of price for something typically costing $100 or more. Casual Corner, 
6600 Topanga Canyon Blvd., (818) 348-6600.  
</P>
<P>
 And here's a nice idea for a man's cashmere gift: socks. Most are priced in 
the $20 to $50 range per pair. The J. Crew store in Woodland Hills offers red, 
green, black, gray and cream-colored socks that sell for $18 a pair. J. Crew, 
6100 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Woodland Hills (818) 888-2739.  
</P>
<P>
 For those whose tastes run to more intangible extras, a series of floral 
presents delivered monthly is another luxury gift idea. This is particularly 
appropriate for people who appreciate flowers and feel they have enough "stuff" 
in their lives. At The Wild Flower in Northridge, $100 will buy as many as five 
floral gifts and their delivery. The Wild Flower, 8300 Tampa Ave., Northridge, 
(818) 885-1212.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, with so many guests parading in and out during the holidays, fancy 
pure linen Damask hand towels combine luxury with practicality. Strouds, which 
has several stores in the Valley, carries imported versions. Each sells for 
$16.99. 
</P>
<P>
 A much greater luxury awaits the recipient of a gift certificate for a 
massage. At Skin Spa in Encino, several 1 1/2-hour packages are available for 
about $100. One particularly fragrant offering is the Spa Jouvance. It includes 
a body polishing, cocooning heat wrap and half-hour massage. Skin Spa, 17401 
Ventura Blvd., (818) 995-3888.  
</P>
<P>
 For the avid letter writer on the gift list, an engraving plate used to create 
fine personal stationery is another welcome extravagance. At Love 'n Kisses, a 
Sherman Oaks gift and stationery shop, engraved stationery is available. And 
though a set of 50 sheets and envelopes plus an engraving die might run as much 
as $170, it's possible to just give the plate itself. One name die, as it is 
called, costs $23. Love 'n Kisses, 15030 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 
995-1965.  
</P>
<P>
 The gourmets in the crowd will always appreciate a basket loaded with pricey 
spices. At Cost Plus in Woodland Hills, a variety of Indian herbs and 
seasonings in festive packages sells for about $5. There are Spice Islands 
bottles (also sold at grocery stores) filled with precious saffron threads, 
heady orange peel and other unusual flavoring elements. Cost Plus, 21825 Erwin 
St., Woodland Hills, (818) 999-3501.  
</P>
<P>
 A gift certificate for car detailing is another novel indulgence, but one that 
Southern Californians can relate to. At Steve's Detailing and Car Wash in 
Woodland Hills, two special holiday gift certificates are available. The 
mini-detail package, $49.95, includes an exterior wax and wash with wheel 
cleaning and interior services. For $99, a similar exterior service is 
supplemented with more elaborate attention to the interior. Steve's Detailing 
and Hand Car Wash, 6326 Canoga Ave., Unit F, (818) 999-0199.

HOLIDAYS; PROGRAMS GIVE SKIERS A LIFT; SEVERAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RESORTS ARE 
USING ADVANCE-TICKETING SYSTEMS TO CUT DELAYS ON THE WAY TO THE SLOPES.

<P>
 For skiers, making one's way down the mountain is heaven. Making's one's way 
to the mountain is, well, often an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
 That long, cold, lonely wait in line to purchase a lift ticket is the final 
hurdle, yet maybe the most difficult. There you stand, skis in hand, for as 
long as 30 minutes -- so close, yet so far from the slopes. And watching all 
those lucky skiers already frolicking in the snow doesn't make the wait any 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your first experience at a ski area, hassling the parking and then going and 
standing in a long line . . . nobody wants that," said Phil Edholm, general 
manager of Ski Sunrise near Wrightwood. 
</P>
<P>
 That much is clear at Snow Summit, where skiers tend to make their feelings 
known. "Part of my job is to answer customer-complaint letters," marketing 
assistant Bonnie Tregaskis said. "And one thing I know that people don't like 
is waiting in line. I'd be upset too." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, getting from Point A to Point Ski figures to be a lot faster at 
several Southern California resorts, thanks to new advance-ticketing systems 
that enable customers to purchase lift tickets before ever pulling their skis 
out of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster and RealTime, a Manhattan Beach marketing network, have launched 
programs in which lift-ticket arrangements can be made over the telephone or by 
visiting a local sporting goods store. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster's system will be in force exclusively at Bear Mountain. RealTime 
is affiliated with Mt. Baldy, Mt. Waterman, Ski Sunrise and Snow Summit. And 
Snow Valley plans to expand its advance-ticketing program that originated last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Such programs, ski-industry sources say, may soon make the lift-ticket window 
a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Automated advance-ticket technology is definitely the wave of the future in 
the ski industry," said Margi La Porte, sales manager at Snow Valley. 
"Nowadays, you want to offer guests a convenience as much as you want to offer 
them ways to save money. Five or 10 years down the road, we're going to see 
everybody on this kind of system." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow Valley's "Park-and-Ski" package began as a pilot program in which skiers 
were able to purchase lift tickets in advance at nine Southern California 
sporting goods stores. This season, availability will be expanded to more than 
100 stores -- including Big 5, Oshman's and Newport Ski Co. -- from San Diego 
to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "People loved it," La Porte said. "We expect it to be 10 times more effective 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 RealTime's system is similar in that lift tickets are available for purchase 
at 21 sporting goods stores, including Sport Chalet, Chick's Sporting Goods and 
Newport Ski Co. The system involves the use of ATM-like kiosks from which lift 
tickets are obtained via credit card with the touch of a few buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 RealTime also includes an electronic catalogue system by which ski equipment 
and apparel can be purchased from manufacturers, and a television information 
system that provides up-to-the-minute ski-related news and snow reports at 
local and national ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 RealTime's system also will be in force at several Lake Tahoe-area resorts, as 
well as in areas in Utah, Colorado and the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been developing this system for two ski seasons," said Dick Sells,

 Ticketmaster's Permanent Ticket is a reusable plastic card -- similar to an 
ATM card -- that is worn like a lift ticket on the slopes and activated by 
making a telephone reservation with a credit card. The card includes a personal 
identification number and an electronic bar code that is scanned with a 
hand-held computer by chair lift operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance-ticket arrangements may differ in names and stipulations, but the 
premises are the same: Park the car, head for the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to get the lift tickets into people's hands faster," La Porte of 
Snow Valley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't take computer technology to accomplish that at Mountain High in 
Wrightwood. All it takes is a stop along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrightwood Ski and Sports, an accessory shop located only two miles from the 
resort's lift-ticket windows, has long been one of the best-kept secrets among 
resort regulars, said promotions director Tracy Henry. At the shop, skiers not 
only can purchase lift tickets but also obtain ski rentals for Mountain High. 
Few skiers are aware of the convenience, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, it's something new and unique with each ski area," Henry said. 
"We just didn't feel any (advance-ticketing system) was necessary." Mountains

 In a city as culturally diverse as Los Angeles, the holiday season harbors 
celebrations that are far removed from Santa and silver bells. Some churches 
and temples offer a twist on traditional festivities while others celebrate 
birthdays of gurus and other important dates of spiritual leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Epiphany is a festival, not unlike Christmas, that originated partly to 
incorporate the baptism of Jesus in Eastern churches. The feast is celebrated 
on Jan. 6 by various Armenian churches, among other denominations. This year, 
the congregation at the Armenian St. Peter Apostolic Church in Van Nuys is 
hoping to once again celebrate the Epiphany in its sanctuary, which sustained 
$1 million in damage from January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dome's stained-glass windows shattered, and the roof has had to be 
completely renovated," says Father Shnork Demirjian. The renovated sanctuary of 
the 28-year-old church, the largest Armenian church in the Valley, will be 
inaugurated with the Epiphany services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Epiphany celebration begins at 10:30 a.m. and includes the liturgy, hymns 
with a choir and an immersion of a cross into a font of blessed water, 
commemorating the baptism. From 3,000 to 4,000 usually attend the service, 
which lasts until 1 p.m. Following the celebration, attendees meet in the 
church hall for cognac and chocolates. "That part isn't religious, it's just a 
custom," Demirjian says.

 A meditative spin on New Year's Eve can be found at several area Hindu and 
Buddhist temples. Hindu Temple Society of Southern California in Calabasas will 
begin New Year's Eve at 9 p.m. with devotional songs and the traditional 
burning of camphor. The observance lasts until midnight.  
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Day, Hindus from across Southern California come to visit the 
temple's shrines to Siva, Ganesha, Hanuman and Lakshmana, among other deities. 
The temple is open New Year's Day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

 At Buddhist temples, some monks traditionally chant through the night of Dec. 
31 as an auspicious way to bring in the new year. At the Maitthri Vihara 
Buddhist Meditation Centre in Sun Valley, monks begin chanting and reciting 
Buddhist teachings at 6 a.m. on Dec. 31 in a special room called a manadapa . 
They finish 24 hours later at dawn on New Year's Day. Although others are not 
invited to chant along, you can reap the benefits of the monks' focused prayer 
at a New Year's Day service that begins at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At the service, water that was placed before the monks is used to anoint 
attendees, who also drink the blessed liquid. A short discourse on Buddha's 
teachings is given by the center's abbot. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At North Hollywood's Wat Thai Temple, the public begins gathering at 10 p.m. 
on Dec. 31 to join in chants with monks until midnight.  
</P>
<P>
 "For new people, we have printed sheets of chants so all are welcome," says 
Sumanatissa Barua, a monk. The midnight hour is observed by three strokes on a 
large gong. The monks chant "Jaya mangala ga ta" as the gong is sounded. "It 
means 'victory of the virtuous,' " says Barua. "And a hope that everyone will 
have happiness and prosperity in the new year." (The traditional Thai new year 
is celebrated every April 13.)  
</P>
<P>
 At 9:30 a.m. on New Year's Day, hundreds of people gather in the temple. 
Buddhists "give merit to their ancestors" by offering food and gifts to monks 
and the elderly, Barua says. 
</P>
<P>

 Other temples celebrate the enlightenment of Sakyamuni Buddha (also called 
Gautama Buddha) on Dec. 11, the closest Sunday to the actual date, Dec. 8, 
called Bodhi Day. Buddha's enlightenment is celebrated by other Buddhists on 
the first full moon in May. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Haongwanji Buddhist Temple in Pacoima, a service begins at 9:30 a.m. 
Dec. 11 and lasts about an hour.  
</P>
<P>
 "We focus on the historical aspects of the enlightenment," says the Rev. 
Kakuyei Tada, who officiates at the 50-year-old temple. 
</P>
<P>
 After the service, light refreshments are served in the temple hall. The 
Pacoima temple belongs to the Jodo Shinshu sect of Japanese Buddhism and falls 
under the organizational name Buddhist Churches of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The temple also will observe the new year with a short service that begins at 
7 p.m. Dec. 31. Bells are rung 108 times to "signify the elimination of our 
evil minds, since there are supposed to be 108 evil minds as taught in Buddhist 
Scriptures," Tada says. 
</P>
<P>
 A Jan. 1 service begins at 10 a.m. and lasts about one hour. It includes 
meditation, chanting, singing and a short sermon.

 The birthday of the Sikh's 10th and final guru, Guru Govind Singh, is 
celebrated shortly after the new year on Jan. 7 at the Los Angeles Sikh Temple 
in North Hollywood. The Sikh religion was founded in the late 15th Century by 
Guru Nanak and his nine successors, called the 10 gurus. Govind Singh founded 
the fraternity called the Khalsa ("pure"), which remains the Sikh's principal 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration begins at 11 a.m. Jan. 5 when five holy pupils read 
continuously from the Dasam Granth, a holy book that Govind Singh introduced 
before his death in 1708. The continuous reading, called the akhand bath, is 
completed on Saturday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 Sikhs and the public visit the hall, which accommodates more than 500 people, 
during the reading. Various Sikh scholars will speak during the two days. Call 
for times. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's 11 a.m. service includes religious music called kirtana, poetry and 
songs. A free dinner is served between 1 and 3 p.m.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: HOLIDAYS; DEALS ON DOLLS; AT THIS TINY SHERMAN OAKS SHOP, 
CLOSE TO A THOUSAND OF ONE OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE TOYS ARE JAMMED INTO A TINY 
SPACE WITH OTHER GIFTS.

 When it comes to collecting things, dolls come in third in the nation, right 
after coins (No. 2) and stamps (No. 1), says Harold Goldman, owner of The Doll 
Shoppe. Once you visit this tiny little shop, you will understand why so many 
people are into dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a doll collector, chances are you already know about this place. 
For those of you who are not, a visit could turn you into one. Close to a 
thousand dolls are jammed into space that's no more than 20 by 20 feet. Add 
some stuffed animals and gift items and you have quite a bit of clutter, so 
allow yourself time to sort through it. 
</P>
<P>
 To your left as you enter are Precious Moments stuffed animals, many of which 
are limited editions and not readily available elsewhere. A wonderful white 
goose lists in "The Blue Book of Dolls" (Hobby House), the bible of the doll 
world, for $62, but the price here is $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Then check out the ceramic gift items. A Cookie Monster dish is $12.95 (list 
is $25), and a combination teapot and cup in the shape of a birdhouse is 
$12.95. There's a lion on a musical carousel that normally retails for about 
$70. The Doll Shoppe's price is $39.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the gift-ware case, a small collection of John Hine cottages (a la 
David Winter's ceramic houses) are heavily discounted. The Casa de Columbo, for 
instance, which sells elsewhere for $99.95, is $49.95 here. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the dolls, which run from $3 to $2,000, and the prices for all of 
which, except the most current (such as the new Holiday Barbie), are 
considerably less than the book: For the balletomane, Sleeping Beauty, an 
all-porcelain ballerina, is $129 (book $199) and Giselle on a wooden base is 
$149.99, compared to $199. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera buffs will love the series featuring characters from "Madame Butterfly," 
"Rigoletto" or "Carmen," with a musical jack-in-the-box playing a familiar aria 
from each opera. The book price is $150, but it's $89.95 here. 
</P>
<P>
 Some celebrity dolls were priced from $50 up to $150. I loved the Lucy doll 
for $79.95. The best buy in the store the day of my visit was $69.99 for 
Patricia Rose's Miss America doll, which lists for $195. 
</P>
<P>
 Former retirees Ruth and Harold Goldman say they are thoroughly enjoying the 
doll business that they opened a little more than two years ago. Ruth handles 
the repairs, and Harold enjoys negotiating purchases. It's partly due to his 
talent in buying that the prices here are so good.  
</P>
<P>
 You will see figures from Madame Alexander, Ashton-Drake, Seymour Mann, 
Pauline and Dynasty -- all well-known in the doll world -- and in almost each 
instance Doll Shoppe prices are at least 40% lower than the book. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending a good two hours in the company of The Doll Shoppe's 
inhabitants, one can easily understand why dolls of all ages become enamored 
with doll collecting. Where to Shop

HOLIDAYS; SHOPPING BY THE BOOK; MORE PEOPLE ARE RELYING ON CATALOGUES AS A 
CONVENIENT AND TIME-SAVING WAY TO MAKE THEIR GIFT PURCHASES. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 For some, it's not a full parking lot at the mall that causes shopping stress, 
but the busy signal on an 800 telephone order line for a favorite catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of Americans are turning to catalogues to buy their holiday 
gifts. As of last year, more than 8,000 catalogue companies issued 12 billion 
catalogues, with more than $55 billion in total sales. This year, the industry 
expects a 7% increase in sales. While the cost of the products -- especially 
after including sometimes hefty shipping and handling fees -- may not make 
catalogue shopping a bargain, for many it means convenience, safety and time 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy La Sota of Agoura Hills has loved shopping by catalogue since childhood, 
when she and her brother would comb through the giant Sears catalogue, folding 
down pages to designate their must-haves. Now, catalogues are La Sota's primary 
source for gift-buying, especially for items produced by museums and gardening 
merchandisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a safe way to shop because you don't have to act immediately," said La 
Sota, who will study any catalogue that comes in the mail. "You can do 
comparison shopping between catalogues and keep coming back to the item before 
deciding to buy."  
</P>
<P>
 La Sota, 42, said she finds catalogue shopping can expand her options, 
especially for such specialty items as bird feeders or jewelry. And when she 
comes home after a day at work, she appreciates the fact that catalogue 
ordering phone lines are often open long after local stores are closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Pereira, 72, of North Hollywood is a seasoned catalogue shopper who 
especially likes to order several months before Christmas. She said she 
dislikes shopping because of the crowds and lines and appreciates catalogues 
because they provide a wide range of ideas. She also finds catalogues provide 
her with a sense of complacency. After reviewing a haul of the season's 
catalogues, she feels confident she knows the available range of merchandise as 
well. "I like knowing what my options are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Michiels, 60, of Agoura considers herself only an occasional catalogue 
user. Every year, she orders five fruitcakes from a Texas mail-order bakery, 
usually sending in the order early in November to ensure prompt delivery. But 
Michiels said the convenience is not always worth the effort because the cost 
and hassle of returning merchandise that does not fit or misses the mark can be 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 La Sota remembers the time the delivery person literally threw a package over 
her front gate and she heard the sound of a new china dinosaur cookie jar 
breaking. It was slated to be a gift for her then-sister-in-law, and returning 
the merchandise and getting a replacement -- paid for by the mail-order company 
-- in time for the holiday involved an inordinate amount of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Pereira avoids catalogue items for friends and relatives who she knows are 
most likely to return things. For them, she shops at local stores that will 
wrap the gifts so their point of purchase is easily identifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pereira, the biggest down side of becoming a confirmed catalogue shopper 
is the junk mail, which can be considerable because catalogue companies often 
sell names to others interested in potential buyers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pereira has discovered another negative about catalogue shopping. In reviewing 
her stack of catalogues for last-minute shopping, she noticed an especially 
delicious-looking box of chocolates, a gift she has decided to order for 
herself. Mail-Order Advice 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent catalogue shoppers offer this advice when buying mail-order gifts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the catalogue to see if there is a deadline for ordering to ensure 
delivery by Christmas. Some catalogues offer free or low-cost express delivery 
for last-minute orders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try to order when the company's computers are up and running, so order 
takers can ensure the availability of merchandise and the expected date of 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Note the company's mailing charges for the total amount you spend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask catalogue merchandisers if they provide free gift wrapping or boxes. If 
buying more than one item from a company that will wrap the gifts, ask them to 
surreptitiously note the contents of the packages to help avoid surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider having the companies send gifts directly to friends and family out 
of the area to minimize shipping costs. If you are traveling by air, have gifts 
shipped to the home where the celebration will occur so you won't have to lug 
the presents along.

HOLIDAYS; GIFTS WRAPPED IN LOVE; MEMORIES OF CHRISTMASES PAST RECALL AN EXCESS 
OF BOOTY. BUT IT'S THE FAMILY SENTIMENTS THAT LINGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When I was child, my brother and I raked in loot so major that we were the 
envy of all our friends. 
</P>
<P>
 So packed was the area under the tree that it was nearly impossible for Kitty 
to maneuver his way around the boxes to drink out of the Christmas tree stand. 
Toy French vanities, white velvet robes with ermine collars, life-size 
mechanical merry-go-rounds complete with ornate horses, a "fire station" 
playhouse with an emergency sliding pole: This was the stuff of which our 
childhood was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Old photographs document the lavish scenes. One picture, which a friend of 
mine dubs the "heiress" shot, still serves as a reminder of my parents' 
"no-holds-barred" approach to the holidays. But though the material take sounds 
excessive, the intrinsic value of what was given came not only from the wallet 
but from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 One rule assured appreciation -- and grounded the Christmas morning chaos to 
some degree: Gifts had to be opened one at a time and admired by all. It was 
not until I was much older that I grew to revere this family tradition. 
Comments of delight -- feigned or otherwise -- were often followed by a 
catalogue of reasons for why the gift was so appropriate. In short, it was a 
celebration not only of the recipient but of the giver as well.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until four strangers came over for Christmas dinner one year that I 
fully comprehended my parents' unabashed generosity, which extended beyond the 
pile of presents. We shared turkey and trimmings with a couple and their two 
children whom my brother and I had never met. My mother, a real estate agent, 
barely knew them either but had recently sold their home because the man had 
lost his job. The children told my brother and me that they didn't have any 
presents that year because their daddy wasn't working. My brother and I, though 
enamored with our new toys, each gave the little boy and girl a few to add to 
the gifts my parents had put under the tree for them.  
</P>
<P>
 At the LaFavre household, levity was never in short supply either. Now as well 
as then, a few silly gifts are given to celebrate some family member's quirks. 
My brother, for instance, during his teen-age years used to consume an entire 
box of Kraft macaroni and cheese as a daily after-school snack. Only half in 
jest, my mother bought him a couple of giant cup-style "troughs" with handles; 
she dubbed them the "hungry man" set. 
</P>
<P>
 Odd gifts perhaps, but terribly entertaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most memorable gifts my brother and I received as children carry 
with them a value fully known only to us as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 My father once spent weeks on a secret garage project for my brother. The 
covert operation involved the making of a battlefield fortress for some green 
plastic army men. Dad made huge mountains out of papier mache. He drew 
topographical details with tiny toothpick points. He made little bushes out of 
Spanish moss specially plucked from the trees of Louisiana during a family 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same spirit, my mother once spent two months working in secret on a 
quilt to give me for Christmas. She cut out small squares of fabric and 
hand-stitched them together in the middle of the night, after putting in full 
days selling real estate. I readily admit that when I received the quilt at age 
14, it was impossible for me to comprehend the sacrifice she had made.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, fine as it might have been, I no longer have the luxe velvet 
robe with the ermine collar. But I still treasure the quilt, and the memory of 
the real gift my mother gave me when she made it.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually my brother and I got into the handmade groove, too. When my father 
opened his own business, money was tight and Mom declared that every gift had 
to be made to curb expenses. Rocks found on hikes were painted, stands were 
made and the creations were wrapped up and put under the tree. It still gives 
me a lift to return home and see, on my father's dresser, those little painted 
rocks I gave him when I was 10. 
</P>
<P>
 As a high schooler, I passed the tradition on to my girlfriends. We made a 
pact to craft presents for each other, and arranged a little Christmas dinner. 
I still have the stocking one pal made for me with my name painted on it. As my 
gifts, I made papier mache sculptures of Mick Jagger's lips and other cultural 
icons.  
</P>
<P>
 Probably my most challenging Christmas creation was the paint-by-numbers of 
"The Last Supper" I did a couple of years ago for my grandmother, who was 88. I 
chose it because when I asked her what she wanted she said, "At my age, all I 
need is Jesus." It was a good thing I waited until her eyesight started failing 
because, frankly, I'm no Da Vinci.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, when Nana opened it, her eyes welled up. She said she couldn't 
believe I would go to so much trouble and added that it was quite good (a 
comment only a loving, nearly blind relative could have made).  
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, gifts to my parents are more practical than they used to be: pajama 
bottoms for my Dad (he hates the tops) and anything French for my mother. Last 
year, one of her favorite gifts from me was a tiny white French dish towel -- 
embroidered with the words, "Le Cordon Bleu" -- that I snapped up from a San 
Francisco cooking boutique. Though this simple white cotton towel might be 
stashed away by some, she absolutely loved it, continually uses it and takes 
pains to ensure its pristine condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Which further reinforces the lesson she taught me as a child, that the 
humblest gifts are often the most treasured.

 Ellen Newth may not look like jolly old St. Nick, but for the American Red 
Cross she brings a priceless gift -- her time. 
</P>
<P>
 "After things settled down and the initial emer gency of the earthquake was 
over, I knew that's when I could really help," said Newth, a North Hollywood 
apartment manager who grew up in Swampcott, Mass.  
</P>
<P>
 "When life calms down, people sort of fade back into the woodwork. It's easy 
to forget," said Newth, 41. "I've always been a high-energy person. I like to 
get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Newth began volunteering in April for the Red Cross Service Center in Van 
Nuys. She routinely works 15 to 20 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a young girl, my mother and I were active in Girl Scouts and our church. 
Those are the places where I learned to roll up my sleeves and help others," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of American Red Cross services are performed by volunteers, Newth 
said. "And like most volunteer organizations, if you've got the time, we've got 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides staffing and training for emergencies, the Red Cross uses drivers, 
organizes fund-raisers, participates in health fairs and provides 
immunizations. Its Youth Services Department recently started an Earthquake 
Safety Puppet Show, which goes to schools, fairs and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the American Red Cross at (818) 376-1700. 
</P>
<P>
 The Student Naturalist Program in Newhall was the brainchild of Gini Shadwick 
in 1990. As the volunteer coordinator for Placerita Canyon State and County 
Park, Shadwick always needed people to answer phones, pass out park 
information, provide animal care and patrol the park's 350 acres. So she began 
the Student Naturalist for children from 8 to 12 to "get kids hooked on 
helping," Shadwick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the earthquake, we've lost a few families who had to move out of the 
area," she said. "But things are slowly picking up again." Her young volunteers 
come from the San Fernando Valley as well as Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides learning about the indigenous habitat and wildlife, students hike, 
work on craft projects and park displays and organize their own fund-raisers, 
bake sales and pet shows.  
</P>
<P>
 "And parents are always welcome to stay," Shadwick said. "I believe that 
children should see lots of parent involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 The group meets the second and fourth Saturday of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the Student Naturalist Program at (805) 259-7721. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Each Need with Dignity (MEND) once helped Maria Franco. Now, like many 
volunteers, she works to give back to the group that helped her out five years 
ago when her family needed food and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nuns started the Pacoima-based agency 25 years ago in an abandoned 
garage. Today, it is one of the largest service organizations for low-income 
families in the northeast Valley, serving Arleta, Lakeview Terrace, Mission 
Hills, Pacoima, San Fernando, Sylmar and North Hills. 
</P>
<P>

needy. The organization also provides toys, furniture, clothes, medical and 
dental care, educational opportunities and employment support. Families also 
can be "adopted." Call (818) 897-2443 or (818) 896-0246.  
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills has offered battered women and their children shelter from 
domestic violence since 1977. Volunteers are trained to meet the special 
problems that often accompany these situations. A 24-hour hot line provides

outreach counseling program and provides temporary housing. After training, a 
commitment of four hours a week is asked. A Christmas party also is planned. 
Call (818) 887-7481.  
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Temporary Aid Center has helped area low-income families and 
individuals for 20 years. Each Christmas the agency needs people to help put

(818) 846-2330.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center has been in operation for 17 years, 
trying to help children from 7 to 16. This Christmas, the center will provide 
about 200 food baskets to low-income and single-family homes. Donations are

Christmas party also is planned. Extensive services are offered for children -- 
karate and piano classes, flag football, basketball, baseball and tutorial and 
job assistance programs. Call (818) 896-8878.  
</P>

medical care, graduate equivalency diploma assistance, court appearance 
supervision, independent living programs and drug rehabilitation. Help also is 
needed with office duties and fund-raising. Call (818) 908-4474.  
</P>
<P>
 Jewish Big Brothers, which has been around for almost 80 years, is designed to 
provide children who don't have a father -- or have little contact with one -- 
a positive and nurturing experience. Children, both boys and girls, range from 
6 to 18. Volunteers must be at least 23 and willing to give four to six hours a 
week for a year. An intense screening and training process is required. Valley 
locations are in Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks, (818) 988-1636 or West Hills (818) 
587-3260.

FARMHOUSE GETS NEW LEASE ON LIFE; VENTURA: IT TOOK 17 YEARS TO RESTORE 
VICTORIANA TO DUDLEY HOUSE, WHICH OPENS TONIGHT FOR SPECIAL PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A restored Victorian farmhouse that Ventura leaders hope will become a tourist 
magnet as a living history museum will open to the public tonight for the first 
time in its 103-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley House is decked in fresh pine boughs, Victorian-themed Christmas 
decorations, twinkling lights and lacy curtains, awaiting its debut at a 
preview party expected to draw about 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have labored 17 years and spent $350,000 to restore the 
two-story home at Loma Vista Road and Ashwood Avenue in Ventura, the holiday 
gala is a long-awaited turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were periods when we wondered if we would ever get it open," said Steve 
Cummings, president of San Buenaventura Heritage Inc., the private, nonprofit 
group overseeing the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can finally envision how everything will look." 
</P>
<P>
 But the hard work is done, the preservationists say. The house has been moved 
a block and turned 90 degrees from its original position facing Telegraph Road 
at the corner of Ashwood Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 A new foundation has been built, and meeting rooms and a functional kitchen 
installed in the basement. Asphalt has been poured for a parking lot, 
electrical wiring snaked through the house and turn-of-the-century light posts 
erected outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that it is nearly finished, Ventura leaders hope the living history museum 
-- which will depict the daily lives of a middle-class farming family from the 
1890s to the 1930s -- will help lure tourists to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get it on the list of tourist sites to see, I think it will probably 
draw a lot of people interested in old architecture and history," said City 
Councilman Jim Monahan. "It is an asset to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the house will not be open for regular tours until late next year, 
the Heritage group will hold a Victorian-themed Christmas boutique there for 
three weekends, starting Saturday. Admission to the boutique, held the 
following two weekends on Friday through Sunday from noon to 5 p.m., is free. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A limited number of tickets to tonight's 6 p.m. preview party, kicking off the 
boutique fund-raiser, are available at the door for $7.50, organizers said. 
Cummings said the historical society needs to raise about $100,000 more to 
finish furnishing and decorating the farmhouse before it opens on a regular 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tediously slow pace of the restoration has been frustrating at 
times, Heritage members and other preservationists say they are thrilled at 
having successfully saved one of Ventura County's dwindling stock of historic 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Queen Anne style home was built in 1891 by Selwyn Shaw, a prominent 
Ventura architect. It belonged to Benjamin Wells Dudley, who arrived in Ventura 
after the Civil War to try farming the 40-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Five generations of Dudleys lived in the home, including Johann Dudley Overby, 
Benjamin Dudley's granddaughter and the only surviving descendant. Overby, 75, 
said she has many happy memories from her days at the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandfather grew lima beans and later planted citrus, she said. He was a 
prominent community member, having served as clerk of the board of supervisors 
and as a justice of the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Overby recalls evenings spent in the parlor by the fire, discussing politics. 
Often, the family held impromptu recitals at the upright piano in the family's 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
 But her favorite childhood activity was to climb high into the attic and 
forage through family possessions, Overby said. And she liked to look out the 
upstairs window for its breathtaking vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "On clear days, you could see all the way to the Channel Islands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1977, she and her mother, Miriam Knox Dudley, were ready to sell, 
Overby said. The city's push eastward was gobbling up lush farmland and 
replacing it with cookie-cutter subdivisions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a happy little farm anymore," said Overby, who now lives in a 
bungalow near downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura acquired the Dudley parcel and slated it for development 
as a historical park. But then Proposition 13 hit, and funding for the project 
died, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 So preservation advocates formed San Buenaventura Heritage, which leased the 
house from the city for $1 a year and began restoring it, Cummings said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the group was perpetually short of money and was committed to 
restoring the house to its original state, the refurbishment took 17 years, 
Cummings said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is very expensive and tedious to restore a house," Cummings said. "It 
could have been built cheaply and more efficiently from scratch, but it 
wouldn't be the old house." 
</P>
<P>
 The work was dragging so slowly that it nearly came to a halt a few years ago, 
said Alberta Word, a member of the Heritage board for 10 years. But the arrival 
last year of several new board members, including architect Steve Harberts and 
antique dealers Dee Fisher and Don Shorts, brought fresh energy to the project, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Christmas boutique, Dudley House will be open for an occasional 
fund-raiser until furnishing and interior decoration are completed, Word said. 
The board hopes to open the house for regular tours beginning late next year, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first floor will represent the house from 1891 to 1915, and the upstairs 
will include clothing, furnishings and decorations from 1915 to the 1930s, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar living history museum in Goleta, called the Stow House, has been 
open for 27 years, said David Bisol, curator of the Santa Barbara Historical 
Museum. It draws about 1,000 tourists a month, Bisol said.  
</P>
<P>
 People are fascinated with living history museums because America is a 
transient nation, Bisol said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old world, you grew up, lived and died in the same community," he 
said. "We're not that way in the United States. So houses such as Dudley House 
are a way for people to find ties to their roots."

OFFICIALS SEEK TO COORDINATE FAMILY AND CHILD SERVICES; GOVERNMENT: COUNTY AND 
CITIES HOPE TO CUT COSTS BY FORMING A COMMISSION TO BETTER IMPLEMENT SOCIAL 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ventura County has a graffiti abatement program. So do Simi Valley, Oxnard and 
other county cities. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not form some type of partnership to reduce costs and put the money 
saved into preventive programs? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they can, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the idea behind the formation of a Ventura County commission for 
children and families. County, city and school officials want to join forces on 
the commission to find ways to better coordinate a wide range of social 
services to ensure that scarce tax dollars are not wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed to form a committee that will 
design the framework for establishing the commission, which would be made up 
entirely of elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Once established, the commission would be able to help coordinate and perhaps 
even integrate services provided by various government agencies, Supervisor 
Susan Lacey said. These services might include things like child care, 
after-school programs, tutoring and job counseling, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission would then determine which programs are most effective and how 
they might be shared or expanded. It would also look at what programs have 
failed or are being duplicated and try to come up with more cost-effective 
solutions, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to look at what works as well as what doesn't work," she said. "We 
want to pick everybody's brain to see if our dollars can't go further. We need 
to make sure that when we spend a dollar, we only spend it once." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the commission was conceived two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, the county formed the Children's Services Coordinating Council 
to better address the needs of children at risk, council Chairman Stephen 
Kaplan said. The council consists of 30 representatives from county and city 
agencies, school districts, neighborhood councils and private, nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Kaplan said, one of the council's primary objectives was to 
establish a commission made up of county, city and school officials who could 
actually set policy on services for children and families. He said the council 
will work closely with the commission once it is formed to provide information 
and develop joint service projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan said he hopes that by forming partnerships among different government 
agencies that the goal will not simply be to save money, but also to enhance 
social and educational programs that aid needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that by merging anti-graffiti services, for example, the county and 
cities could perhaps direct more money to after-school programs or other 
services that could benefit the area's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're able to take some of the money we save and put it into preventive 
services, everybody wins," said Kaplan, who is also director of the county 
Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs. "Right now we're not creating those 
kinds of partnerships (between governments). . . . Things are still fragmented. 
But we're still a county small enough to be able to pull this off." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Weis, Ventura County's superintendent of schools and a member of the 
steering committee that will form the commission on children and families, said 
there are a number of ways governments can work together to reduce operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis noted that the Fillmore Unified School District, where he previously 
worked as an administrator, and the city had shared the cost of purchasing a 
riding lawn mower and other landscaping equipment. He said the same types of 
things could be done on a much broader level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this will bring a closer collaboration of city and school district 
services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Lacey and Weis, the committee responsible for establishing the 
new commission will include Supervisor Maggie Kildee, Ventura Councilman Greg 
Carson, Fillmore Councilwoman Linda Brewster and Santa Paula Councilman Al 
Urias. Three officials from school districts across the county will also be 
asked to join the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is expected to meet early next year, possibly at the end of 
January, to begin discussing its plans for the future commission, Lacey said.

PRODUCE SELLERS FEELING EFFECTS OF MEDFLY SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Produce merchants near the east Camarillo site where Medflies were discovered 
in September say they have suffered sharp drops in sales due to the infestation 
and the malathion spraying that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now, eight weeks after the Sept. 29 discovery of the crop-destroying 
flies at St. John's Seminary, have sales at Camarillo-area fruit and vegetable 
stands begun to recover after plummeting up to 50%, farmers and agricultural 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the popular Camarillo Farmers' Market, where business was off 20%, wary 
customers only began to return in force recently, spokeswoman Mary Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people thought we might not be open, and I think there was some 
concern about the spraying," Little said. "But lately, sales seem to have 
returned to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 The street-side farmers' market operates each Saturday along Ventura Boulevard 
in the city's old downtown. Its success affects not only the merchants, but 
also a hospice for the terminally ill at St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital, 
which usually receives about $20,000 a year in market proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Trainer, farmers' market manager, said that to get the word out that the 
market is still open, an advertising campaign was launched several weeks ago. 
Live music also has been scheduled, and experts have been enlisted to discuss 
such skills as gardening and gourmet cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first month it was very tough," Trainer said. "I would run into 
people around town, and they would say they heard rumors that (the market) was 
closed. I think people thought the produce may have been tainted. It was 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Spalla, a federal agriculture officer, said that 25 fruit and vegetable 
sellers in Ventura County have entered into agreements that limit the way they 
sell, transport and store produce from the 86-square-mile quarantine zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Spalla said the regulations pertain to produce such as oranges and lemons, 
avocados, tomatoes and strawberries, which are all known to attract Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreements, farmers must make sure that their fruit and vegetables 
have been treated with a malathion-and-corn-syrup bait at least six times 
before bringing them to the farmers' market, Spalla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the market, the produce must be placed under netting or plastic 
sheets, and stored fruit must be sealed off in fly-proof containers. Any 
leftover fruit is either given away to local residents or charities or 
destroyed at the end of the day, Spalla said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same restrictions apply to sellers of fruit in roadside stands and retail 
markets in the quarantine zone -- which encompasses all of Camarillo and Somis 
and parts of Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. Those markets, however, are permitted 
to store fruit and vegetables they do not sell. 
</P>
<P>
 James Barker, a partner at Underwood Ranches and the firm's retail manager, 
blamed the Medfly crisis for cutting sales at the ranch's usually bustling 
roadside stand on Los Angeles Avenue by about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gradually recovering now," Barker said. "The spraying really scared 
people off. I think some people thought the stuff was contaminated. So you can 
imagine that we've had to do quite an education campaign to set people 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
 At Queen Ranch in Somis, employees said that the Medfly situation has slowed 
business significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, state officials have sprayed the 16-square-mile Medfly eradication 
zone three times. The next application is set for 10 p.m. Tuesday -- an hour 
later than the normal 9 p.m. takeoff to accommodate holiday shoppers.

UNPRECEDENTED FARM CONTRACT READY FOR VOTE; LABOR: MOORPARK'S MURANAKA FIELD 
HANDS WILL CONSIDER AN ACCORD TO GIVE THEM GREATER SAY IN MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An unprecedented farm labor contract that would give field workers a say in 
management decisions faces a vote from workers tonight at Moorpark's Muranaka 
Farms, said Mario Brito, the regional director for the United Farm Workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The union hopes to use the agreement as a model for future farm labor 
contracts, Brito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, endorsed by both sides on Wednesday after four months of 
negotiations, still requires the approval of Muranaka's 150 rank-and-file field 
hands and packinghouse workers. If approved, the agreement would set up a 
cooperative management team consisting of workers and company officials who 
would meet every six weeks to work on cost-saving labor practices and farm 
production efficiency. The workers will be encouraged to make suggestions 
without the risk of reprisal from company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, modeled after similar pacts between factory workers and car 
makers in Detroit, is not only designed to allow workers a say in company 
policy, but it is also meant to give them a vested interest in the success of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a historic agreement for us," Brito said. "I think it will be 
a model for us. We've had to re-evaluate some things. (The company and the 
union) are always going to be adversaries, but we don't always have to be 
adversarial." 
</P>
<P>
 Company President Harry Muranaka would not comment on the new contract until 
it received a final ratification by the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract would also provide 5% to 8% raises for employees, who have 
worked without a contract since 1992 and have not received a pay hike since 
1990. In this year's negotiations, the union also pushed for health benefits 
and retroactive raises, but company managers said they could not afford such 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka is a medium-sized, family-owned company that farms about 450 acres of 
leeks, radishes, parsley, cilantro and kale in and around Moorpark. The company 
operates another 2,500 acres in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside observers say that if the small farm's new contract holds, it will be 
an innovative step that could help change farm labor arrangements throughout 
the state. They also say it could invigorate the beleaguered union, whose 
membership has dropped dramatically in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The direction the new (United Farm Workers) president is taking is very 
positive," said Don Villarejo, executive director of the Davis-based California 
Institute for Rural Studies. "Growers are going to want an increasingly stable 
and skilled work force, and this will help guarantee that." 
</P>
<P>
 Villarejo said that in 1986 he had a conversation with former UFW President 
Cesar Chavez about "total quality management."  
</P>
<P>
 "I came into his office and he had all these books on Japanese team management 
techniques, and he ended up talking for several hours about more cooperative 
labor-management relations," he said. "It was really quite an eye-opener for 
me. He was saying the union couldn't simply make farmers enemies and the bad 
guys. Instead the union should be looking at how to make this industry work, 
and work in a way that benefits workers. It looks like that's what the new 
president is trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 There are roughly 800,000 farm workers in California, but only about 300,000 
full-time positions, according to Villarejo. The result, he said, is few 
year-round jobs for workers, who end up earning an average of just $5,000 to 
$7,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Workers at Muranaka work year-round and have been paid from $12,000 to $14,000 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really positive step for us," the union's Brito said. "I think the 
company also recognizes that this sort of cooperation is in their best interest 
-- they are guaranteeing loyal workers committed to keeping the company 
profitable."

AUTHORITIES STEP UP EFFORTS FOR YOUTHS TO USE BIKE HELMETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was on a bright Indian summer morning last year that Sgt. Will Howe 
suddenly found himself standing over a child whose final breaths cut through 
him like a chill wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawled on the warm sidewalk at Howe's feet was the form of Rolando Reyes, 14 
-- the same age as the sergeant's own son -- whose head had struck the concrete 
after his bicycle toppled at 10 m.p.h. on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The child had not been wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was on a beautiful, sunshiny day," a still shaken Howe said a year later, 
"and suddenly, it's all over. . . . I couldn't help but think of my own son, 
watching him there." 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to prevent such preventable deaths, Ventura County sheriff's deputies, 
school officials and cycleries in the Thousand Oaks area are stepping up their 
vigilance for children on bicycles who fail to wear a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a state law that became effective Jan. 1, everyone under age 18 
must wear an approved bicycle helmet while riding on streets and other 
thoroughfares. Those caught violating the law over the past 11 months have been 
issued warnings, but no fines. 
</P>
<P>
 That will change Jan. 1, when sheriff's deputies in Thousand Oaks will begin 
issuing citations that provide for fines of $25 -- about the cost of a typical 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many youths heeded the requirement in the early months of the year, 
their adherence began to slacken, Howe said, when word spread that they would 
not be fined. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools were real supportive in getting everybody involved. . . . But 
people soon realized there was no teeth in the law, and so they stopped wearing 
helmets," he added. "That'll change now that it's going to be enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 While no local bicycle-safety statistics have been compiled since the law took 
effect, a recent study on the effects of a motorcycle helmet requirement bears 
note, Sgt. Jeff Matson said. According to a UCLA study released Nov. 16, the 
state law that requires motorcyclists to wear a helmet produced a 37.5% drop in 
motorcycle fatalities in its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen (bicycle accident victims) both ways, with helmets and without 
helmets," Sheriff's Deputy Tim Hagel said, "and it's enough to make you realize 
that the law would save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after the 14-year-old boy's death last year, Tom Bennett was riding 
his bicycle down a steep hill in Thousand Oaks when he hit a piece of wood and 
flew over his handlebars at 40 m.p.h., fracturing his shoulder blade and 
collarbone and grinding across 100 feet of pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his helmet was severely damaged, he suffered no major head injury -- 
just a mild concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for my helmet, I probably wouldn't even be talking to you right 
now," said Bennett, a detective with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolando Reyes was not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Sept. 2, 1993, late morning, when Reyes was riding his bike on the 
sidewalk in the 400 block of Thousand Oaks Boulevard, his friend balancing on 
the handlebars. After hitting a hump, the Thousand Oaks youth lost control of 
his bicycle and fell while his friend jumped off. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had been wearing a helmet, it could have prevented his head injury," 
said Howe, a traffic supervisor whose officers are redoubling efforts to issue 
warnings -- and ultimately $10 coupons for helmet purchases -- to youths 
violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Thanksgiving weekend historically is the busiest shopping day of the 
year," Deputy Hagel noted. "Our biggest blitz right now is . . . to get parents 
to buy a helmet for their children instead of going out and buying (a video 
game)," he said, "especially now that (violators) are going to be fined." 
</P>
<P>
 The $10 vouchers, which were donated to the Sheriff's Department by the Conejo 
Valley Bicycling Club, are mailed to parents of children who violate the helmet 
law. They can be used toward a helmet purchase at one of five participating 
bicycle shops. A moderately priced helmet, typically made of a plastic skin 
stretched over dense foam rubber, can range from $20 to $40, with more 
expensive helmets running up to $139. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools, particularly elementary and middle schools, have been inducing 
children to wear bicycle helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see everybody here wearing them," said Max Beaman, principal at Sequoia 
Intermediate School in Newbury Park. But, he added, "some of these laws take a 
few years to implement to their fullest." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Manzanita Elementary School in Newbury Park, Principal Phil Parish does not 
permit student bicyclists onto campus unless they are wearing helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools in the Thousand Oaks area have done likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that some older youths might view helmets as "nerdy," 
Newbury Park Bicycle Shop co-owner Mike Cicchi said, "I have to say that 
they're coming up with so many options in designs and colors, I can't imagine 
(kids) not liking them." 
</P>
<P>
 Habits die hard, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to remember that you're changing the habits of the whole family," 
Deputy Hagel said. "Historically, the parents haven't had to wear helmets, so 
now they have to adjust to getting their children to do it."

TRANSFORMING TRADITION; THE VALLEY'S VARIED PERSPECTIVES REFINE MEANING OF 
THANKSGIVING; COLLEGIAL DINERS

 Hearth and home, turkey with all the trimmings, family members reunited from 
afar. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the usual images of Thanksgiving, a holiday outdone only by 
Christmas in its sense of tradition and fireside warmth. But tradition does not 
reflect all of today's reality, as definitions of home, family and even food 
are evolving in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the San Fernando Valley, residents gathered in their own unique 
ways to observe a national holiday that has deep roots in American history. 
From a Chatsworth home for boys to houses where turkey is taboo, from a group 
of Filipino exchange students dining at a Mexican restaurant to a new kind of 
family in Van Nuys, celebrations and celebrants brought new perspectives to the 
meaning of Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unlikely setting for a Thanksgiving meal, but they gathered anyway 
at a local Mexican restaurant for baskets of tortilla chips and plates of 
frijoles. There wasn't much turkey, but then, that wasn't the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we do for the students to come together, because a lot don't 
have families to to back to in the area," said Cal State Northridge senior 
Brian Boquecosa, describing the Mexican dinner, a Thanksgiving ritual for 
CSUN's Filipino-American Student Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as most inhabitants of the sprawling Northridge campus flocked home 
for the holiday weekend and student dorms nearly emptied, the tough part of 
Thanksgiving was for those who remained, some separated from their families by 
thousands of miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many seek out friends and group events to fill the void. But some are left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Among CSUN's several hundred foreign students, most of whom do not celebrate 
Thanksgiving in their home countries, many nonetheless regard it as a time for 
togetherness with friends, albeit without the trappings of turkey and dressing, 
said Benin Guleser, president of CSUN's International Student Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not getting together for a big meal. They're getting together because 
everyone else is. When a big group does something, other people want to 
follow," Guleser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of CSUN's Filipino students have family members nearby. But for those who 
don't, Boquecosa's group has held its Mexican dinner, this year on Wednesday, 
for the past four years. They go for Mexican food, he said, because there's no 
local Filipino restaurant large enough to hold them. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Ronnet, a CSUN graduate student who arrived from France only a few 
months ago, did as many others and accepted an offer to celebrate her first 
Thanksgiving at a fellow student's home. "It sounds weird to us, because 
cooking a turkey you can do any day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amir Malekghassemi, a recent CSUN graduate from Iran who has been separated 
from his parents since 1987, spends the holiday with local Iranian friends, who 
always have turkey on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow we've blended it into our culture over here," Malekghassemi said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one CSUN dorm that houses short-term foreign students, the resident 
advisers had hoped to throw a Thanksgiving dinner party to give the students 
their first taste of American tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the students themselves nixed the plan, saying they already had 
engagements. So the resident advisers -- who must stay to work -- decided to 
hold their own turkey potluck anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all going to cook a little bit of food and bring it," said adviser 
Stephanie Deshayes, a senior who came here from France four years ago. JOHN

 Hearth and home, turkey with all the trimmings, family members reunited from

</P>
<P>
 These are the usual images of Thanksgiving, a holiday outdone only by

From a Chatsworth home for boys to houses where turkey is taboo, from a group

meaning of Thanksgiving. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The tables were set with white linen, candles and goblets, flower arrangements 
and wicker cornucopias. Sparkling apple cider flowed freely. Outside the 
windows and through the arches, the perfectly manicured lawns were barely 
visible in the evening twilight. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene could have been one of traditional tranquillity at any number of 
homes this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't any other home. This was the scene Wednesday night at Rancho San 
Antonio, Boys Town of the West, a Chatsworth placement home for juvenile 
delinquents and youths from troubled homes, who gathered on Thanksgiving eve to 
give thanks for their very lives. They entered the dining hall, some in 
starched collars, some in jeans, all of them eager to eat and brimming with 
boyish energy. 
</P>
<P>
 They paused over their tables, suddenly silent, heads bowed for a group prayer 
simple in language and sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks for the air we breathe, thanks for the food we eat, thanks for the 
water we drink," they prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not just words for many of the boys here. Many of these young men 
consider it some divine mixture of fate and faith that they are alive for 
another holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are experiencing life sober for the first time since childhood. Others 
used to deal drugs, burglarize homes, pack weapons. Most know how close they 
came to spending the holidays behind bars or in the grave, rather than with the 
staff members and compatriots of Rancho San Antonio who are now their extended 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "This pretty much feels like I think Thanksgiving is supposed to feel," said 
Jose, 18, of Wednesday's dinner. "Everyone caring for each other, there for 
each other. And all the good food. I guess that's what Thanksgiving is." 
</P>
<P>
 "Society, I think, looks at the perfect picture of Thanksgiving, you know, the 
dog at the fireplace and the whole bit," said John, 16, who is spending his 
second Thanksgiving in a row away from his foster family. "But the weird thing 
is that they are not thankful for what they have of it. They just think it 
should just be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Miguel is one of the lucky ones: He will spend at least part 
of this holiday weekend with his family in La Puente on a special pass from the 
home, which is run by the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time Miguel has seen his parents and siblings in more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be the first thing I'd always think about is going to my friends, 
getting high," Miguel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I am always thinking about being with my family . . . having dinner," he 
said with a smile. "Maybe talking with them. . . . That's something I haven't 
done in a long time." L.D. STRAUB

STUDENTS DIVIDED ON PRAYER ISSUE; EDUCATION: SOME IN RUNDOWN SCHOOLS WONDER IF 
PRIORITIES ARE SKEWED. OTHERS SAY CONTEMPLATION MIGHT HELP THEIR PEERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In city schools where peeling paint, random gun checks and outdated textbooks 
greet students each morning, renewed national proposals to restore school 
prayer symbolize hope for some students and misplaced priorities for others.  
</P>
<P>
 As the newly empowered Republicans wrangle with Democrats over the politically 
charged issue, those who will be most affected by their proposals are engaged 
in their own debates. 
</P>
<P>
 And to hear the students tell it, the answers are no easier to come by in the 
seventh or 12th grade than they are in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way it's kind of good, maybe it will start people's day off better; but 
in a way it's kind of bad because some people don't have a religion and you 
can't force it on people," said 17-year-old Akila Baskin, a senior at North 
Hollywood High School. "Tell the Congress to come see what the real problems 
are, then see if prayer is the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 At Walter Reed Middle School, also in North Hollywood, a group of friends 
pondered the issue and concluded it was rife with thorny questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could make wishes!" said 12-year-old Portia Reddy, thinking aloud about 
what students could do during prayer time. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend, Lana Keshishian, crinkled her brow and offered a retort. "You 
could do that on your own time," she said. Portia nodded grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Garcia, 11, had another concern. "Say your best friend is in a religion 
and you're not, maybe he'd think bad things about you." 
</P>
<P>
 "It could cause a lot of problems," Will concluded.  
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, official Los Angeles Unified School District policy prohibits 
organized prayer at any district activity, including commencement exercises or 
the start of the school day. But in accordance with a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision, the district allows students to have religious clubs and prayer 
groups as extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Other districts have similar policies. In the Las Virgenes Unified School 
District, Supt. Albert Marley said prayer is allowed only when it is "student 
initiated, student-led," at graduation and as an extracurricular activity. A 
similar policy exists in the Pasadena Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles high schools, some students spoke hopefully about a welcome 
opportunity to pray or collect thoughts at the beginning of a hectic day. 
Others were indignant about what they said was an infringement upon the 
separation of church and state mandated by the Constitution. Still others 
wanted to know what practical results school prayer could have. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should talk to us and see what we want," said Akila, the North Hollywood 
senior, who said she is a Christian. "I would tell them I want better 
protection, a clean school, better teachers. Prayer is not my main concern." 
</P>
<P>
 At Taft High School in Woodland Hills, students recalled that twice in their 
school years they have been asked to participate in a moment of silence -- both 
in times of tragedy. In 1992, they silently honored 15-year-old Taft student 
Lamoun Thames who had been stabbed to death across the street from school. At 
another time, they remembered a student who had committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton has said he would consider legislation calling for a 
moment of silence, but not for organized prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 But even during such somber moments, the Taft students said, some classmates 
used the time to goof around and laugh with friends, prompting questions about 
how seriously their classmates would take even a daily silent ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is a big joke to kids and this would be a bigger joke," said 
17-year-old Jessica Elbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Carrillo, 17, said a moment of silence could help hard-pressed 
students. "After a while maybe people would take it seriously," she said. 
"Maybe a moment of silence would do; everyone can pray to their own God and say 
whatever they have to say," Monica added. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Jacoby, 15, tried another argument. "Who would an atheist pray to?" he 
asked. "They also pay tax dollars and it isn't fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ben-David walked away from the group, shaking his head at what he thought 
was a moot point. "Everyone carries a dollar bill -- it says 'In God We Trust,' 
" he said. "Everyone says the Pledge of Allegiance -- God is in that. Maybe 
it's not right, but we already do it anyways." 
</P>
<P>
 Students also talked about how their religious backgrounds influenced their 
opinions. Johnny Lee, a 16-year-old junior at North Hollywood, said he is a 
Christian. But he added that he considers his religion part of his private 
life. "I think that's where it should be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jessica Kim, 14, a member of the New Life Christian Club at Fairfax High 
School, said her religious convictions make voluntary prayer time unnecessary. 
"If some people have a problem with that moment of silence, then you don't need 
it," she said. "People like me will pray any time they need to." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Kamm, a 16-year-old North Hollywood student who is Jewish, said she 
would feel uncomfortable while other students prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the fears of some religious leaders in the national debate, Nicole 
said she is wary of minutes-a-day school prayer at her desk because she thinks 
such an idea is rooted in Christian traditions. "Jewish people don't tend to 
pray in that manner," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Back at Taft, student-body president Andrea Gryczman, 17, took a break from 
cleaning up after a school food fair to say she understood why people would 
want to introduce prayer as an antidote to student woes. But she added that she 
is unconvinced prayer alone would do her school much good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're going to make religion mean something to people who 
aren't interested," Andrea said. "They're hoping it will make a difference, but 
I think it will cause more upheaval."

VALLEY CHARITIES: AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE; VALLEY CHARITIES STILL REELING FROM 
DISASTERS AND RECESSION 
</P>

<P>
 After months of careful belt-tightening, Nancy Reisner finally gave in and 
turned the heat back on in Aunt Fannie's Attic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to," said Reisner, manager of the small thrift store on Reseda 
Boulevard that raises money for the National Asthma Center in Denver. "It was 
too cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Belt-tightening tactics -- leaving the heat off as long as possible, canceling 
plans for outreach or expansion, cutting back on programming -- are evident in 
charities throughout the San Fernando Valley, as they begin their holiday 
season still stinging from the double-edged sword of disaster and recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisner does not expect to see Aunt Fannie's Attic recover its $7,000 loss: 
The Northridge earthquake forced her to close the store for three weeks. After 
all, people are not buying new clothes now. Donations of unwanted clothing have 
dropped dramatically. And four other thrift stores in the neighborhood have 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has altered the financial geography of charitable organizations in 
the last 10 months, becoming a bewildering friend to some programs and a cruel 
foe to others.  
</P>
<P>
 More than $1.5 million in earthquake donations were collected by United Way 
and distributed by the end of August, according to Barbara Bickel, a 
spokeswoman for the charity's North Angeles Region. But other agencies report 
that while the money was available for earthquake relief, non-disaster-related 
programs suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our budget is probably the biggest it's been in a long time," said Barry 
Smedberg, executive director of the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council. But 
while his group's earthquake relief program flourished, its Meals on Wheels 
program had to struggle along with fewer volunteers because of the disaster and 
strained resources. Only now are those programs returning to normal, Smedberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the Family, a family support and resource center in Van Nuys, was 
one of 40 agencies to receive a contract from the Los Angeles County Department 
of Mental Health under its Project Rebound, a federally sponsored program that 
provides counseling services for those traumatized by the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Van Nuys group's $100,000 contract will expire in February, leaving 
Executive Director Susan Kaplan trying to find other ways to continue the 
counseling. An extension of service would mean as much as a 10% increase in the 
organization's $800,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing in crisis counseling about 65 clients every week," said Kaplan, 
who added that families are still feeling the stress from the disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 With the recession and the string of disasters that have hit Southern 
California -- the 1992 riots, the earthquake, the wildfires in October, 1993, 
-- many people do not have the emotional resilience to bounce back any more. 
"We get, on average, five new clients a week," Kaplan said. BAD NEWS FOR 
CHARITIES 
</P>
<P>
 For charities and for everyone else, the earthquake made a shambles of future 
plans and canceled or delayed scheduled events, causing losses of funding. 
Volunteer ranks dropped because people either were too busy putting their lives 
back together, or they moved out of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Girl Scouts had planned to start their annual cookie sale fund-raiser Jan. 29, 
but instead had to wait until March. The young fund-raisers were still out on 
the streets in May, trying to drum up support from an already exhausted pool of 
donors. As a result, the Girl Scouts raised only $539,000 this year, compared 
to $664,000 last year, said Debbi Turner, director of program services for the 
San Fernando Valley Girl Scout Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really felt people did everything they could to support the girls," Turner 
said. But, she said, the loss of funding meant that grant writing -- typically 
used to expand programs -- went instead into earthquake relief efforts and to 
keep programs running. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor damage at the Boys & Girls Club of the San Fernando Valley in Pacoima 
caused membership to drop because parents believed the building was not safe 
for children during repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten months later, with repairs finished, membership has increased dramatically 
compared to last year, but private funding has not, said LeRoy Chase, the 
club's executive director. The organization has had to tap into reserve funds 
that it had set aside for youth programs this coming spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for ONE, the Organization for the Needs of the Elderly in Van Nuys, 
dropped considerably after the quake. The organization, which provides day care 
for seniors, also received minor damage during the quake. But many volunteers 
for the charity were not so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the people that would be volunteering are fixing their own homes 
up," said Marilyn Fried, the organization's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Family Service-operated Valley Storefront in North Hollywood, which 
helps senior citizens and their families, received only one-third to one-half 
the funding of past years, said Director Dorie Gradwohl. Both the earthquake 
and the recession hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, at Thanksgiving, the center is inundated with donations of turkeys 
for needy senior citizens, but not this year. "This year it's just from one 
organization and a few individuals," Gradwohl said. "It's much less." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit, non-sectarian center, which gets its funding from governmental 
sources, foundations, United Way and private donations, has received less this 
year across the board, Gradwohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest drop has been in individual contributions. Although such donations 
account for only about 5% of the center's total revenues, the losses are still 
keenly felt, Gradwohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Jane Frances Food Pantry in North Hollywood had to close down for three 
months in the summer while the quake-buckled floors and broken windows were 
replaced.  
</P>
<P>
 While the pantry was closed, clients were referred to other agencies, although 
some had no transportation. But now the facility is back in business, serving 
150 to 170 families a week. THE ECONOMY WAS BAD, TOO 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions to the annual campaign of the United Way North Angeles Region, 
which ended in July, were down slightly this year -- to just over $60 million 
from $64 million raised in 1992-93. But the reason was the loss of jobs in the 
Valley because of the recession, Bickel said. She added, however, that some 
some employers have left the Valley because of the earthquake. Their departure 
has had an adverse effect on contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not had this kind of financial hardship since the Carter years," said 
Lois Lee, who founded Children of the Night, a shelter for runaway children in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need money," said Lee, adding that she has nowhere in her $1.6 million 
budget she can cut to make up for a $320,000 deficit. "Our contributions are 
down 20% from what they were last year." 
</P>
<P>
 A $135,000 donation from television's Roseanne Barr helped keep the 24-bed 
shelter afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee blames her financial troubles squarely on the recession. Job layoffs and 
the moving of major aerospace companies from the Valley have left many people 
unable to give. A former aerospace worker, for example, wrote Lee recently that 
he was sorry he could not donate $25 a month as he had before. He sent a single 
check for $100 instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession also forced the Salvation Army's San Fernando Valley Corps to 
cut its budget by dropping its annual Thanksgiving dinner for the poor and 
homeless, said Lt. Troi Trimmer, the corps' corporate officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding, however, is that more churches in the Valley have that as a 
service," Trimmer said, explaining why the Salvation Army meal was not deemed 
necessary. The Army's clothing vouchers program was also dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 El Centro de Amistad, which provides counseling, tutoring and referral 
services for the Latino population in Canoga Park, has had to cut down on 
children's field trips because bus service had become too expensive. The group 
dropped plans to move into a new building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very optimistic with the new year approaching and the possibilities of 
grants," said Angel Perez Jr., assistant executive director. "But our overall 
situation is depressing. We want to give these families what they need, but we 
just can't. It's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, the Burbank Temporary Aid Center has survived one of its toughest 
years ever without cutting programs or services, although cuts could still be 
ordered without more help, said Cherie Combs, the executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter was giving out more food than it receives its donations, a 
difference of $19,000 in each of the last four months. Donations by private 
individuals and groups have shrunk, but Combs hopes for a rebound of generosity 
during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are becoming more focused on their own problems and the rising cost of 
living," Combs said. "But we're optimistic that donations will increase, that 
people will remember that there are less fortunate people out there." A SILVER 
LINING  
</P>
<P>
 The response to the earthquake became something of a blessing for many Valley 
charities. Julia Montez, executive director of the Valley District office of 
the American Red Cross in Van Nuys, remembered that "After the quake, donations 
came in steady: bags of money from around the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the organization received letters simply addressed to: "Earthquake 
Relief, Northridge CA." The letter carrier brought it to the Red Cross office, 
Montez said. Inside would be a check already made out to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a surprising side effect to the quake. The long lines at food 
pantries are somewhat shorter than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still plenty of need," said Paul Heeschen, head of the West Valley 
Food Pantry in Woodland Hills. But in October the pantry served 583 families, 
down from 650 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason could be a mini-boom in construction as homes and businesses 
continue to rebuild. That boost may be helping the working poor who normally 
rely on food pantries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be aware that this is temporary," said Doris Bloch, executive director of the 
Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. "As soon as that boomlet stops, the Valley is 
going to be worse than anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Each Need with Dignity, or MEND, a nonprofit group in Pacoima, almost 
went out of business last year when donations dropped to an all-time low, said 
Maria Franco, outreach coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird, you know, but in a way the earthquake actually saved us," Franco 
said. Valley residents opened their hearts and cleaned out their closets and 
pantries after the quake, donating massive amounts of food and clothing to 
MEND, which serves more than 500 families in an average week. 
</P>
<P>
 Since April, donations have slowed down somewhat -- and so did the needs -- 
but MEND still is able to draw upon its earthquake reserves to put together 
clothing and food packages for needy families in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 MEND's biggest need is for children's clothing. With the holidays beginning, 
Franco said, the phone is once again ringing off the hook, with needy families 
trying to plan ahead to have enough food to eat and toys to give to the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a new surge of energy, new volunteers," said Barbara Perkins, past 
president of the San Fernando Valley section, National Council of Negro Women. 
Although her group does not provide services, it is a link between groups like 
MEND and the needy. "People are saying they're giving back because they got 
help after the quake," Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which helps 65 African American families every month as part of a 
partnership with MEND and the Calvary Baptist Church, got 20 more members 
because of the quake. TACTICS TO SURVIVE 
</P>
<P>
 As resources dwindle, charities are finding themselves increasingly in 
competition for help. Donors may decide that the earthquake relief contribution 
was enough for this year and may not make a donation to the agencies they 
ordinarily support. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, at the Children of the Night, recommends something of an all-out attack 
and the use of sources that had not been tried before. She is lining up 
celebrity sponsors, and next week will be going to Washington, D.C., to solicit 
funding from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said it is necessary "to not have too much pride to ask for help," but she 
added a warning to avoid appearing "too desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez at El Centro de Amistad is turning to grant-writing to compensate for a 
loss in corporate donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more agencies seeking corporate donations, so the money has to be 
spread around," Perez said. "It has reached a point where it's very competitive 
between agencies. Whoever writes the best proposal will get the funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Loaves and Fishes in Van Nuys, run by Catholic Charities, has stepped up its 
fund-raising efforts with a new brochure and better use of parish bulletins to 
get the word out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to tell more people about who we are and what we do," said 
Barbara Ausburn, whose group suffered a 10% to 15% drop in funding from 
agencies like United Way even as expenses rose. "We are not doing as much 
marketing as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, ONE has hired a consultant to drum up recruitment and oversee 
fund-raising efforts. It is trying to avoid cutting services. 
</P>
<P>
 And charities may consider even more efficient ways of making it through 
difficult times, said Smedberg of the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council. 
For example, food pantries may look into canning their own food, even getting 
clients to help, or bringing in more farmers' markets to make less costly food 
more available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Smedberg, the Valley Interfaith Council has come through the year, "leaner 
and meaner, perhaps," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan, at Friends of the Family, speaks with a lot of hope, despite the 
tightening of funding she will have to cope with soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an eternal optimist," Kaplan said, adding that a difficult year "makes us 
have much greater resolve that the kinds of services we provide will continue 
to be there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 If hardship builds character, local charities have gained a lot this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is we have all had a common bond and gotten though this together," 
Smedberg said. "People have a better understanding about what charity is all 
about."

VALLEY CHARITIES: AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE; TRAINING THE DISABLED TO WORK, EARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A large man they all called Tiny was working on a production line. His 
oversized fingers could barely maneuver the jagged-edged picture hangers -- 
which are even smaller than his pinky finger -- into the miniature plastic bags 
in which they must go.  
</P>
<P>
 His supervisor tried to persuade him to move to another job -- something 
perhaps more suited to his size and abilities. But Tiny wouldn't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the most important job in the place," he told Matt Lynch, executive 
director of Build Rehabilitation Industries. "If I don't put the picture 
hangers in their packages, just think of all the pretty pictures that will 
never get put up on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny is a client at the San Fernando center, which trains disabled people for 
jobs. He and all of his colleagues are mentally retarded or learning disabled. 
For most, this is the first time they've had the opportunity to earn a 
paycheck, to develop a work ethic, to feel that they too can contribute to 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 But the organization needs help to accomplish its goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we would like computers and office equipment," Lynch said. "It 
would be nice to be able to train some of our more able people in office work. 
</P>
<P>
 "But our dire needs are much more simple than that. We really need chairs. It 
would make such a difference in these people's lives if they just had a 
comfortable chair to sit in while they do their work every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Build has risen above its grim appearance to be a place of hope and pride for 
the nearly 100 people working and learning there. The squat and yellowed 
offices bustle with smiles and goodwill, inspired perhaps in part by the 
Texas-sized bowl brimming over with candy in the executive director's office. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a place where obviously overworked people "make do" in an already 
technology-poor office that lost equipment in the Northridge earthquake. And 
this is also where other people come to take out a new lease on life. Along the 
way, many of them discover they have just now begun to live. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for the first time in their lives, they can head out to the lunch truck 
and buy a meatball sandwich with money they know they have earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny's colleagues, in the rear of the facility's large warehouse, hunched over 
tall tables as they packaged diet food. The packages are banded seven together 
and put in a box. Numbered boxes are drawn on the tabletops in each work 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the building, people perched precariously on stools or sat 
in tattered-looking chairs as they attempted to attach tiny pieces of jade to 
mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Build workers did all of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power's mailers. They inspected more than a million Dancing Raisins after the 
original factory made a mistake on them. They dressed dolls, counted screws and 
cut lengths of rope. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not all charity that Build is looking for this holiday season. The 
organization needs jobs for its workers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Lynch pointed out, employers can receive a Targeted Jobs Tax Credit for 
employing one of Build's clients. Build itself will reimburse a company for 
half the training wages of a client, Lynch also said.

VALLEY CHARITIES: AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE; HOMES GIVE BELEAGUERED CLIENTS TLC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are the clients few others can care for. 
</P>
<P>
 The least disabled of them are blind and mentally retarded. Others are also 
deaf, or suffer emotional problems, or seizures. Many endure a laundry list of 
ailments with which other special care facilities can't cope. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they come to the Therapeutic Living Centers for the Blind, or TLC, as the 
homes are commonly known. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the square peg in the round hole," Executive Director Lynn Robinson 
said. "We don't fit in." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the 50 or so adults who live in the seven TLC group homes around 
the San Fernando Valley, this is about the only place where they do fit in. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a radio and occasionally flinging his arms wildly and uncontrollably, 
twentysomething Chris was headed home for the Thanksgiving holiday. And he 
wasn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to stay here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Southland nonprofit groups, TLC has had a tough couple of years. 
First, the economy took a dive. Then, the earth shook. 
</P>
<P>
 Many charities were forgotten in the harried aftermath of the Northridge 
earthquake -- when potential donors had their own worries -- but TLC was not 
just among the forgotten, it was also among the shaken. All seven of its group 
homes suffered damage in the quake: cracked walls, split floors and toppled 
air-conditioning units, to the tune of $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That's big money to an organization operating on an annual budget of just $1.7 
million, Robinson said. And to make matters worse, the quake damage kept the 
group from holding its annual fund-raiser, which typically brings in as much as 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Government funds, which account for 80% of TLC's total budget, have also been 
slowly diminishing. So far this year, revenues are down 7% to 10%, and the 
group is treading financial water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually what we do in terms of fund-raising is to develop new programs, to go 
forward," Robinson said. "In this case, we need to go back, make repairs . . . 
fix what is broken. Our community is in bad shape and so were we."  
</P>
<P>
 While some charities have found success in recent years with modern and 
massive advertising campaigns, that's a difficult route for TLC, Robinson said, 
as the clients are not made-for-television poster children. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have sunken, clouded eyes and unintelligible voices. Others rock 
violently for hours on end. Still others wear makeshift crash helmets to keep 
from injuring themselves. About 40% have spent time in state mental 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 So the group's holiday mailer is direct, saying in essence, "We really need 
your help." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is optimistic, believing people will respond. They certainly would 
after seeing what happens in these homes, she said, after meeting people like 
Bob. 
</P>
<P>
 Blind and retarded, the tall, middle-aged man spent 20 years sitting on his 
bed in a Northern California group home.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, he goes to the opera, learns to toss salad, sings karaoke. And, 
occasionally, he smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations can be sent to Therapeutic Learning Centers for the Blind, 7955 
Lindley Ave., Reseda, CA 91335.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; EXHIBIT FOCUSES ON THE WORLD OF 
CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only 19 months into this world, Evann Hall gazed around with ever-widening 
eyes that reflected the light and the promise of many Christmases to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least 30 versions of Christmas, each from a different land -- China, 
Brazil, Russia -- whose decorated trees left him giddy with excitement at the 
Christmas Around the World exhibit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library 
near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse," a squirming Evann cried, inaccurately, from the 
arms of his mother as he gazed at a galaxy of lights swirling about a Christmas 
tree that spoke of a land halfway around the world, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that the toddler was off a bit. The ornaments featuring Mickey Mouse 
and other Walt Disney characters, brought to life by 1,100 blazing white 
lights, dangled from the plastic green limbs of a tree behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, 34-year-old Jenny Hall of Newbury Park, gazed at the trees lining 
the library hall -- Ireland and Japan to one side, Iceland and Italy to another 
-- and said, "They're gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, which opened Nov. 19 and continues through Jan. 9, features 30 
Christmas trees that reflect the traditions of the countries that Ronald and 
Nancy Reagan visited during their eight years in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 All mock Douglas firs, the trees differ only in the decorations -- the 
garlands, the ornaments and the other symbols -- that characterize each 
particular country. They were decorated by community organizations, school 
groups and ethnic and fraternal groups. The exhibit was privately funded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a wonderful way to start the holiday season," said Carole Jouroyan, 
52, of Glendale. "It's just breathtaking. Every tree is a work of art." 
</P>
<P>
 "And the prettiest one is the USA tree," said her cousin, Michael Elanjian, 
72, from Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, Jouroyan had strolled down the row of firs in the adjoining 
hall, pausing to soak in the lights and the ornaments of trees from England and 
Germany, Norway and the Philippines, lost in a reverie of Christmas past and 
Christmas future. 
</P>

 Steve Tracy's interest was more practical. Appraising the "sports tree" whose 
limbs were loaded down with tiny baseballs, footballs and basketballs, the 
26-year-old Simi Valley man said, "I'd like to buy this tree for my business." 
He owns MVP Sports Bar and Grill in Simi Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, two young Camarillo friends, 7-year-old Andrew Strickenburg and 
4-year-old Brian Dixon, knelt and held hands in front of the same tree, looking 
up in awe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it," Andrew said in shy understatement. GREG RIPPEE

<P>
 County libraries will take a long Thanksgiving holiday, remaining closed for 
the weekend after turkey day. 
</P>
<P>
 The move saves money and gives library staff a longer vacation, said Alan 
Langville, manager of Ventura County's community libraries. He said the 
libraries have closed Thanksgiving weekend for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo, Fillmore, Moorpark, Ojai and Simi Valley branch libraries will 
be closed Nov. 24-27, as will the Wright library in Ventura and the Prueter 
library in Port Hueneme, officials said. They are usually open on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Paula, Oxnard and Thousand Oaks libraries, all independent of the 
county system, will be open Saturday. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PIRU; FIRE OFFICIALS EXAMINE CAUSE OF 20-ACRE BLAZE

<P>
 The cause of a brush fire in Piru that burned 20 acres is under investigation, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which began about 10 p.m. Wednesday, edged within a quarter-mile of 
a citrus orchard at the Piru Mansion but did not damage or seriously threaten 
any structures, Ventura County Fire Department officials said.The fire was 
contained at 1:11 a.m. Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 firefighters were called to fight the blaze, fueled by winds of 8 to 
10 m.p.h. that helped spread flames across a hillside near Piru Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was the second in the area this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, county firefighters responded to a call from the school about a 
fire in a nearby canyon. That fire consumed less than an acre and was quickly 
extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they did not know if the two fires were related. MARY F.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; POLICE STATION PLAN IS MOVING FORWARD 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley could open a new police station in three years under a plan 
approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's ongoing efforts to build new headquarters accelerated after the 
existing building on Cochran Street suffered damage in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley could be eligible for as much as $3.7 million in federal quake 
relief funds to help cover the estimated $11 million cost of the station. An 
additional $2.9 million could come from the Community Development agency, with 
the balance drawn from the city's general fund and special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, a committee composed of Councilwoman Sandi Webb and 
Councilman-elect Lindsey Paul Miller will study two possible sites for the 
station. And the council agreed to begin looking for an architect to design the 
new facility. SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: RAIL COMPANY FINED OVER SEACLIFF SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Pacific Transportation Co. has been fined $4,000 for a delay in 
reporting a 1991 toxic spill at Seacliff and for failing to have on hand 
written procedures for handling the chemical that leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was also ordered to pay $488,000 in penalties in connection with a 
separate incident in July, 1991, when a derailment leaked 14,000 gallons of 
herbicide into the Sacramento River. 
</P>
<P>
 The fines were issued this week by the California Public Utilities Commission 
after an investigation into both accidents. The company has 30 days to pay the 
state or file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific spokesman Mike Furtney said the company has not yet decided 
whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a decision the lawyers will have to make after they've received the 
documentation from the (Public Utilities Commission)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wreck at Seacliff occurred July 28, 1991, when an axle bearing failed, 
causing a train to jump the tracks and spill steel drums full of aqueous 
hydrazine. The toxic chemical is a component of jet fuel and is used in 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission fined the company $2,000 for an hour and 40 minute delay in 
notifying the state Office of Emergency Services and $2,000 for failing to 
carry guidelines for handling hydrazine in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Furtney questioned the fine for the reporting delay, saying a county fire 
station was notified of the spill almost immediately. "We're only suggesting 
that the fines are curious in the sense that they make no comment about the way 
in which the immediate response was made by literally hundreds of Southern 
Pacific and, of course, public agency people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For cleanup of the Seacliff spill, Southern Pacific has paid Ventura County 
nearly $579,000 for work done by the Fire Department, Sheriff's Department, 
district attorney's office and the environmental health division. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has paid 22 claims to Seacliff residents and rejected 338 
other claims, most from drivers forced to take lengthy detours during the five 
days the Ventura Freeway was shut down for cleanup. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; MAN, 21, ARRESTED AFTER FOOT CHASE

<P>
 A Santa Paula man who led police on a foot chase through a residential area 
was arrested Thursday with the help of a citizen, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the pursuit, the officer chasing John Julien Lopez, 21, accidentally 
fired his own gun, police said.No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was on patrol at 12:20 p.m. when he first spotted Lopez running 
toward Main Street on Cameron Street, with another man running after him, 
police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The man shouted to the officer that Lopez had a handgun, and the officer 
pursued on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit went southbound on Cameron, through an apartment complex and onto 
westbound Main Street, police said. The man who aided police during the pursuit 
assisted in Lopez's arrest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez apparently dropped his gun during the chase, police said. It was 
recovered later. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the incident began as an assault in the 500 block of West Santa 
Barbara Street. MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN ARRESTED ON MOLESTATION CHARGE 
</P>

<P>
 A 27-year-old farm worker has been arrested on suspicion of molesting an 
8-year-old girl whom his wife was baby-sitting at their Oxnard home, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Castro Suarez was taken into custody at his job in Somis on Wednesday 
morning, a year after police first obtained a warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Ken Kent said Suarez agreed to be interviewed by Oxnard police in 
late 1993, then moved from his home to an unknown address. Officers picked him 
up this week after learning that he was working at a Somis farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent said the incident occurred when the 8-year-old girl and her younger 
brother were left at Suarez's home overnight. Because it was a cold night, 
Suarez's wife allowed the children to sleep in the couple's bed. Then in the 
morning, when she left to fix her husband a sandwich, Suarez allegedly molested 
the girl, Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl later told her mother about the incident. The county Public Social 
Services Agency referred the complaint to Oxnard police for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Suarez was being held in County Jail late Thursday in lieu of $50,000. JULIE

VALLEY CHARITIES: AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE; RAPE PREVENTION PROGRAM FIGHTS TO 
SURVIVE TOUGH TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was once a time when Vision Empowerment Inc. -- a nonprofit rape and 
violence prevention agency -- offered free seminars to the public, hosted 
rape-awareness rock concerts and provided free psychological help to the women 
enrolled in its programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the advent of the current economic recession and the devastating Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake, the agency has had to cut some corners to stay 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization owes me a lot of money," said Tevis Verrette, the agency's 
president and founder who has been footing much of the agency's bill with his 
own savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Verrette founded the organization eight years ago after several women friends 
were sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 His workshops teach women to protect themselves from attackers by any means 
possible. The organization's brochures boast that 19 women -- out of the more 
than 3,000 the group has trained -- were attacked after graduating from the 
program and that each of the would-be attackers had to be hospitalized because 
of injuries inflicted by their intended victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Verrette's workshops and lectures teaching rape-prevention techniques are 
given to corporate groups, classes and on a one-to-one-basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to learn to survive on public donations," Verrette said, noting 
that the organization used to collect most of its funds from corporations who 
would ask Vision Empowerment to conduct workshops for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Cal State Northridge was one of the organization's biggest 
clients. But when the earthquake devastated the campus, the university had to 
stop sponsoring workshops there. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Verrette said, donations and volunteers -- once abundant -- are down by 
more than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, most of the agency's money comes from tuitions paid by individuals taking 
the courses, said Verrette. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, Verrette said he was forced to lay off half of his 10-member 
staff and to learn to run the organization more efficiently, an aspect of his 
plight that he called "the blessing of this disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the staff at Vision Empowerment always uses both sides of papers. Women 
who go through the workshops pay for their own graduation parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the true key to survival for nonprofit organizations, Verrette said, is 
for such agencies to ally themselves with other groups with similar goals. 
Vision Empowerment is currently trying to work out a plan with the Los Angeles 
Commission on the Status of Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Verrette's organization already refers clients to the Valley Trauma Center in 
the case of women who recently have been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look to other groups and offer to supplement them," Verrette said.

VALLEY CHARITIES: AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE; SHELTER FOR BATTERED WOMEN HAS YEAR OF 
MIXED BLESSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The past year has brought mixed blessings to Haven Hills Inc., a Canoga 
Park-based nonprofit agency that funds domestic violence prevention programs 
and operates a shelter for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying of Nicole Brown Simpson has ironically been a boon to Haven Hills 
and similar organizations because it has heightened public awareness of the 
domestic violence problem, said Betty Fisher, the shelter's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 But the publicity has also spurred increases in the organization's caseload -- 
especially as the holiday season nears and the incidence of domestic violence 
increases, Fisher said. That has placed an added strain on the organization, 
which has seen a decrease in donations over the past year, along with a greater 
number of victims coming to Haven Hills for help. 
</P>
<P>
 A 911 tape, released shortly after the brutal death of Nicole Brown Simpson in 
June, detailed her cries for help. Simpson's ex-husband, former football great 
O. J. Simpson, has been charged with her murder and prosecutors allege that he 
regularly battered her and eventually killed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by the tragedy, the city of Los Angeles accelerated its plan to 
coordinate the efforts of various agencies to more effectively combat domestic 
violence. After the killing, various ad-hoc city committees were forged into a 
single domestic violence task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council ordered $5 million set aside each year to provide 
housing for battered women, said Tamara Metcalf, the council's legislative 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the O. J. Simpson case has validated the whole issue of domestic 
violence," she said. "The attention has been there, but it has gotten more 
attention because of O. J. Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy has spurred an increase in the number of volunteers at Haven Hills 
and similar organizations, Fisher said. Twenty-two people graduated from a 
recent volunteer training program, compared with an average of eight in past 
years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read about the O. J. Simpson case, I became more aware of what's going 
on," said one of the graduates, Esther Kaufman of Sherman Oaks, a retired 
registered nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said she is concerned that, because of the publicity, the public will 
mistakenly believe that domestic violence programs no longer need donations 
from government and private sources. She noted that Haven Hills has seen a 
significant decrease in donations over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for turkeys," Fisher said. "Last year, we had them; we didn't 
even have to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Any government funds that come in are earmarked for certain items, such as 
repairs, and can't be used to buy food, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the kind of money we can take and go out and buy gifts for kids," 
she said. "Now, I'm not complaining about that, but that's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 There is some doubt, Fisher said, whether the agency can offer as much help as 
it would like to domestic violence victims this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will we be able to help as many people this year as we did last year, making 
sure they have enough food for the holidays?" she said. "This year, it doesn't 
look like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is seeking donations of cash, food, paper towels, disposable 
diapers, cleaning supplies, blankets, pillows and towels, she said. Anyone who 
would like to help should call (818) 887-7481.

INMATES THANKFUL THAT LIFE ISN'T WORSE; CASTAIC: THEY GOT A TRADITIONAL 
THANKSGIVING MEAL, LARGER PORTIONS THAN USUAL, BUT NO SECONDS. AND NO FIGHTS 
WERE ANTICIPATED AT THE FRACTIOUS FACILITY.

<P>
 The cooking wasn't Mom's. And the ambience definitely left something to be 
desired. 
</P>
<P>
 But inmates got a full Thanksgiving meal with all the trimmings Thursday at 
the North County Correctional Facility, the maximum security jail at the Peter 
J. Pitchess Honor Rancho. The helpings were larger than standard jail meals, 
but seconds were offered only to those with special privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Many inmates sat grim-faced and quiet as they ate from plastic trays in their 
58-bed dormitories. Some watched the Buffalo-Detroit football game on 
television screens overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't perfect, but we're thankful for what we've got," one inmate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main course was processed turkey slices, but most of the rest of the 
fixings were made from scratch: gravy, corn bread stuffing, yams, mashed 
potatoes, salad, cranberry sauce, bread and pumpkin pie. Similar meals were 
served to the more than 20,000 inmates in Los Angeles County jails. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Thanksgiving dinner is one of the most difficult meals of the year 
to prepare, said the jail's head cook, Mike McDonald. He said he and his staff 
spent two days preparing the feast for the jail's 3,700 inmates, cooking up 
more than a ton of turkey and 4,800 servings of pumpkin pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cooking was finished by mid-morning Thursday. Food was then loaded 
into large plastic bins and stacked on carts to wheel from kitchen to dorms for 
the noontime meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a good job, considering the limitations we have," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, McDonald admitted, he planned to eat Thanksgiving dinner later 
with his family in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom's still a better cook than I am," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 38-year-old inmate helping to prepare the feast in the kitchen said it was 
like any other meal for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's about average," he said. "It's good for jail food." 
</P>
<P>
 Other inmates had more critical opinions, or just chuckled when asked about 
the food. But Rodriguez Simon, a senior cook who went home at 1:30 p.m. to 
prepare dinner for his own family, said the complainers are too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the turkey, he said, everything he planned to serve his family was 
prepared the same way as the jail food. 
</P>
<P>
 "This food, anybody can eat it," he said. "I don't care who it is. It tastes 
as good as anywhere I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
 The inmates said they were thankful for basic things, a necessity since many 
are facing years behind bars. For about 600 inmates, it was a chance to talk to 
family members and friends in glass-partitioned booths at the jail. On average, 
1,000 inmates receive visitors on weekend days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some inmates said they were simply thankful to still be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful for waking up every day and for being fed," said an inmate 
working in the kitchen. He said he expected no visitors during the day and has 
no hope of being released from jail any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they had to work, deputies at the jail had their own reason to be 
thankful. None of the jail's all too regular inmate fights were expected during 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have the least problems today of any day," said Sheriff's Sgt. Steve 
Smith, who was overseeing a set of dorms. "There's football, extra food and 
visiting. What more could you want?"

FIREFIGHTERS MISS EXIT, SAVE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two car-pooling firefighters who missed a turnoff on their way to work early 
Thursday saved Thanksgiving for one local couple when they extinguished a fire 
that had erupted in their home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Heflin and Michael Elefante were en route to Firehouse No. 73 in Reseda 
from the Leona Valley when they missed their usual exit onto the westbound Simi 
Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys have car-pooled together for six years, so they must have been 
lost in conversation," said Los Angeles City Fire Capt. John Mitchell. "Lucky 
for this couple." 
</P>
<P>
 About 6:20 a.m., the firefighters spotted smoke coming from a residence in the 
18200 block of Nordhoff Street, authorities said. The couple who owned the home 
were awakened by a smoke alarm and had just fled the house to report the fire. 
</P>

 The firefighters used a wooden picnic table to break a window and extinguished 
the blaze with a garden hose. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, apparently started when several combustible chemicals ignited after 
being stored near a gas water heater, caused an estimated $10,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple was not injured. The wife was expected to deliver a baby on 
Thursday. "If that would have happened, they would have been ready for that 
emergency, too," Mitchell said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; TRUE GRIT AND TRUE INSPIRATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A memo to Huong Tran Nguyen's college instructor: Your foolish, racist remark 
has been proved wrong decisively. However, your words have proved to be one 
heck of a motivator. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen arrived in the United States as a student while the Vietnam War was 
raging. She says a college instructor told her she would never be as good a 
teacher as the white aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
 That remark spurred her to prove to the instructor and to prove "to myself 
that there was not a goal I could not reach if I put my mind to the task," 
Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 So over the years Nguyen taught elementary and high school in San Diego, as 
well as teaching reading to older students for the San Diego Job Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to Westminster, home to many of Orange County's Vietnamese 
Americans, and taught in Long Beach, where she established Polytechnic High 
School's language program for students with limited language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Nguyen received deserved recognition, with the Walt Disney Co. 
honoring her and 12 other teachers across the nation for their "teaching 
skills, rapport with students and ability to inspire." Nguyen and her high 
school each received $25,000, and the Long Beach Unified School District 
received $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards were a reminder that we are fortunate to have such teachers to 
inspire us with dedication and determination. As teachers are asked to do more 
important things for our society with fewer resources, society owes them a 
profound debt of gratitude.

TRANSFORMING TRADITION; THE VALLEY'S VARIED PERSPECTIVES REFINE MEANING OF 
THANKSGIVING; MOTHERS AND DAUGHTER

 Hearth and home, turkey with all the trimmings, family members reunited from 
afar. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the usual images of Thanksgiving, a holiday outdone only by 
Christmas in its sense of tradition and fireside warmth. But tradition does not 
reflect all of today's reality, as definitions of home, family and even food 
are evolving in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the San Fernando Valley, residents gathered in their own unique 
ways to observe a national holiday that has deep roots in American history. 
From a Chatsworth home for boys to houses where turkey is taboo, from a group 
of Filipino exchange students dining at a Mexican restaurant to a new kind of 
family in Van Nuys, celebrations and celebrants brought new perspectives to the 
meaning of Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For little Elyse Saragossi, Thanksgiving is definitely a family affair at her 
Van Nuys house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to invite people here," the energetic 5-year-old said between bites of 
cranberry sauce. "Like my two grandpas and two grandmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Elyse also has two mothers. The three generations of 
Saragossis and Moores who gathered to celebrate Thursday formed the picture of 
a typical American family at Thanksgiving, with turkey and stuffing piled high 
on their plates and with grown-ups seated at one table, the kids at another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just like any other family, except Elyse has two moms," said one of 
those moms, Bonnie Moore, who with partner Carol Saragossi adopted Elyse when 
the girl was born. "We were thinking about going away for the holiday, but we 
felt it was important that we stay home and celebrate it with our families." 
</P>
<P>
 On hand Thursday were parents and siblings from both sides, who shared laughs 
and drinks as Saragossi and Moore put the finishing touches on dinner. They 
played with Elyse and her young cousin. And as at many family gatherings, they 
engaged in a touch of good-natured political debate at the table before Moore 
put a cap on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Saragossi and Moore have been together for 12 years, and for all of that time 
have been open with their family, friends and colleagues about their 
relationship. Saragossi is a counselor at San Fernando Middle School, and Moore 
is a social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the pair have worked at creating a sense of extended family 
and getting their parents to better accept their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Elyse, said Moore, turned out to be of great help in that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think giving them a granddaughter kind of made up for the loss they felt by 
having a lesbian daughter," Moore said. "And they really love it that we are 
raising her Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents and Saragossi's mother and father are now good friends, becoming 
"in-laws" who enjoy each other's presence in a way that seemed unlikely a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago it would have probably been a little strained to have both 
families together," said Saragossi. "But now, both families do a lot of things 
together. In fact, my parents weren't going to come, but then Bonnie's parents 
called them and persuaded them to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Moore: "My parents couldn't have asked for a better daughter-in-law."

 The Thanksgiving meal at the Wright home in Canoga Park didn't look 
traditional, and it didn't taste that way, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a succulent golden-brown turkey, a granular nut loaf was Thursday's 
centerpiece. Instead of stuffing cooked in the belly of the bird, the dish was 
prepared with bell peppers, mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes nowhere near any 
meat. And instead of gravy loaded with meat juices, the topping was made with 
tofu, nuts and miso. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to Thanksgiving, vegetarian style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a vegetarian since I was 16," said Adrian Wright, now 32 and the 
mother of two boys. "I'm sure the turkeys are thankful for that." 
</P>
<P>
 The days when vegetarians nibbled on carrots while the rest of the family 
devoured turkey legs on Thanksgiving are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetarian dinners are now so popular that entire precooked meals can be 
bought at most health-food stores. Those who avoid meat can buy sliced 
vegetarian turkey, fresh rosemary-and-thyme whole-wheat bread stuffing, mashed 
potatoes with herbed mushroom gravy, pan-fried lemon garlic green beans, 
orange-cranberry relish and cranberry bread. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of this precooked stuff for the Wright household. After all, some 
traditions -- like home cooking -- have to be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Wright had to prepare her Thanksgiving meal earlier than in previous 
years because her husband, Tui, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, had to 
work the evening shift. Joining them for dinner was Adrian Wright's 
brother-in-law, Alex Wright, who is also a vegetarian, and her friend Jenny En, 
who is not. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wrights have been serving a nut loaf -- like a meatless meatloaf -- in 
lieu of a turkey for several years now, but for En, this was her first time. 
After biting into the loaf, she smiled and said it was good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having turkey later with my family," she said sheepishly. "I'll get my 
fill of vegetables here." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Wright said that most meals from all cultures are predominantly 
vegetarian, with salads, vegetables, rice and beans as basic staples. 
</P>
<P>
 "When most people think of vegetarian food, they think it's boring," he said. 
"But it's all in how it is prepared. I think it tastes very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Four-year-old Biko seemed to agree. He ignored his fork and used his fingers 
to gobble up his food. With his mouth full, he could only nod when asked if he 
was enjoying his meal. 
</P>
<P>
 While the food may have been prepared differently and tasted differently, one 
Thanksgiving tradition remained the same as with omnivores: a dirty kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kitchen is a mess," Adrian Wright said, looking over the dirty pots and 
pans. But she shrugged her shoulders, took off her apron and joined her family 
at the table. JULIO MORAN

AROUND TOWN: A TWISTED CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Claus is coming to town, but you may not recognize him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the one all in white, a glittery tiara perched between his rabbit ears. 
And that's Mrs. C., a Disney-esque evil stepmother with vampire brows and green 
eyeliner. 
</P>
<P>
 We're in the window of Barneys New York in Beverly Hills, where Christmas is 
being created. 
</P>
<P>
 A decal affixed to the window explains that this perverse pastel fantasy is 
"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town," an installation by artist Deborah Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, reaching into a box of dismembered dolls' heads and decapitated toy 
animals, laughs and suggests that she might better have titled her tableau 
"You'd Better Watch Out." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Johanknecht, out from New York where he's Barneys veep for 
display/store design, watches as Brown zaps a tuft of pastel marabou with a 
glue gun and affixes it to a white reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
 He grins. "When you drive by fast, it's going to look like a sort of 
traditional, twinkly Christmas window. And then when you get up close. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Up close, you see that those reindeer are not Prancer and Dancer. That's Queen 
Rudolph in the lead -- with a blond Ivana wig, bee-stung red lips and Tammy 
Faye lashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The curious, strolling by at Wilshire and Camden, stop, look and wonder. "I 
love it!" exclaims one woman. "I'm just trying to figure out the plot."  
</P>
<P>
 Brown smiles. "People are totally freaked out." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that she wants to offend. But she does hope to make people think. 
About things like human vanity and the commercialization of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But, wait -- this is Barneys, a tony store celebrating its first Yule in the 
shrine of conspicuous consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Johanknecht allows, but Christmas doesn't have to be Rockwellian. "We're 
saying, 'Lighten up.' The creativity and magic of Christmas can be a little 
looser." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he loves the window because it's "the kind of thing no 'upscale' 
retailer would ever do." 
</P>
<P>
 Who is Deborah Brown and what's she saying? At 26, the St. Louis-based artist 
has an arts degree from UC San Diego and a masters in fine arts from UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grotesque, hybridized human-animal-vegetable creatures, she explains, 
speak of a culture gone amok, a world in which mortal misfits, seeking to 
reveal their true souls, have traded in their shapes for ones they can believe 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not meant to be nasty, mean," Brown says. "You can laugh at it and 
really understand yourself more." 
</P>
<P>
 A stretch limo glides by outside. "Wait!" jokes Brown, looking out. "Come 
here! I'm going to put you in here." 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby, scrutinizing Queen Rudolph, smiles and says, "Looks like a lot of 
Beverly Hills women, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 When she creates a faux object, "It's very much like plastic surgery that 
doesn't turn out quite right," Brown says. Consider the jet-haired doll with a 
sea gull body. "She didn't think she was going to be a sea gull. She thinks 
she's pretty, though." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids like this because it's a little strange," Johanknecht says. "Adults like 
it because it's really sick. So it's perfect for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's Santa isn't really evil, but he sure is different . Ask Brown about 
his tiara and she replies: "I almost don't want to touch that." Let's just say, 
"He's not exactly Mr. Smith next door." 
</P>
<P>
 And what's with Mrs. Claus? A narcissistic contemporary mother, Brown 
suggests. "She doesn't really care about the kids. She's more interested in who 
he's having an affair with than in putting things in stockings." 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny doll with a Vegas marabou headdress pops out of the chimney of a 
mini-chalet, her arms sticking out the sides. A creature with a doll's body and 
an elephant head spins on a platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown insists that her Christmas window is "not about trying to test you." Of 
course, if you want to speculate about issues of power, media hype, celebrity, 
corruption, isolation, futility. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Around New Year's, Santa Claus will be leaving town, leaving Brown with eight 
chalets, five reindeer and assorted reconfigured beings. 
</P>
<P>
 She may try to place her window in a museum. Or perhaps try to sell her 
fantasy creatures individually -- although, she says, "I don't know who's going 
to want to live with them." A Vegetable Garden for Fun, Food and Therapy 
</P>
<P>
 It all started with some geriatric geraniums and the imaginations of stroke 
rehab patients Don Brown and Cora Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, vegetables from the Brown and Burrell Garden at White Memorial Medical 
Center in East L.A. are harvested and turned into soup and salad by patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Burrell, now outpatients, returned for the recent dedication of the 
garden, which in five months has become a food source for the rehab unit's 
kitchen and an enjoyable part of patients' recreation and speech therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Speech pathologist Christine Alcan-Leal recalls that Brown, 57, was physically 
impaired and depressed when he checked in last April. "He refused any therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in June, Burrell, 60, arrived. They became friends. One day, they 
devised a plan for those wilting geraniums in patio pots. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you could say jalapeno, they'd pried $125 from the recreation therapy 
budget for seeds, potting soil and tools. The administration turned over a 
small plot. 
</P>
<P>
 As seedlings sprouted in the patio pots, patients transplanted them into the 
garden. Marigolds went in the center -- to ward off bugs -- and vegetables 
around the rim, where wheelchair patients can rake and hoe. 
</P>
<P>
 A weaker patient may be able only to tap seedlings out of starter containers 
and hand them to a patient strong enough to bend and dig. Those on walkers tend 
the center area. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehab patients regularly work in the garden. In their kitchen, they dice and 
chop the bounty, all of which is physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardening increases muscle strength and balance and adds fun to their regimen. 
And, says recreation therapist Linda Gudbrandsen, it increases motivation and 
adds a sense of purpose, which is often "the missing element." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the hospital, there's talk of a rehab flower garden. There's this nice 
piece of ground near the emergency room. . . .

 A representative of a fried chicken chain had an audience with the Pope, 
asking if he would change the Lord's Prayer for $5 million. The specific 
change: Replace "daily bread" with "daily chicken." An annoyed Pope asked him 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, the offer was upped to $100 million, but again was denied. 
Several months passed and the rep made his final offer: $1 billion. The Pope 
said he'd discuss it with the cardinals. Prefacing the request, the Pope told 
them he had both good and bad news: 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is we have $1 billion. The bad news is we lose the Wonder Bread 
account."

TECHNOWATCH: PUT YOUR TREE ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW

 It's just about time for the annual Christmas hassle. No, not shopping. How to 
get the tree to stand straight. 
</P>
<P>
 This year there's an answer. Swivel Straight is a new, one-of-a-kind tree 
stand that enables one person to set up and straighten a tree in a minute or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tree lying on its side, slide the trunk into the stand's separate 
trunk receptacle. Then, spin a specially designed ring to secure the three 
clamps around the trunk. Insert the receptacle holding the trunk into the 
device's 24-inch base. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tree is standing inside the base, depress the foot pedal at the 
bottom and a swiveling action straightens the tree. When the pedal is released, 
the tree locks into the stand. The pedal slides into a storage compartment in 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Swivel Straight weighs 13 pounds and is constructed of green heavy-duty 
polymers that don't rust. It holds up to a 12-footer with a trunk diameter of 5 
3/4 inches, and has a six-quart water reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Swivel Straight ($89.95) is sold nationwide at nursery and garden centers, 
hardware and home stores and through seven catalogues. Or you may call the 
manufacturer, Country Line Limited, at (800) 692-2656 for a store near you. Or 
order from one of the catalogues: Plow & Hearth, (800) 627-1712; Safety Zone, 
(800) 999-3030; Frontgate, (800) 626-6488; SuperLife, (800) 865-7575; 
Domestications, (800) 746-2555; Good Catalog, (800) 225-3870, and Langenbach's, 
(800) 362-1991.

 Dry Goods: Two new unusual personal cleansing products, Bath In A Bottle and 
Salon In A Bottle, have been introduced by Los Angeles-based Bottled Hygiene 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 They clean, deodorize and refresh your skin and hair without water -- ideal 
for campers and boaters, and in home-care and hospital environments or for 
bathing and shampooing if an earthquake or other occurrence cuts off your water 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The products are applied directly to the skin and hair and do not need to be 
rinsed off. Salon In A Bottle leaves no residue on the hair, unlike currently 
marketed dry shampoos. Bath In a Bottle is a moisturizer as well as a cleanser. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by a pharmacist, both products contain no detergents, alcohol, 
acids, dyes, salts or animal proteins and have been tested by independent 
dermatologists to assure they are safe for babies, as well as adults. Both 
contain botanical extracts such as chamomile, sage, nettles and rosemary and 
are soap-free and biodegradable. None of the company's products is tested on 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of 12-ounce containers of the products is available ($9, plus $2 
shipping and handling) from Bottled Hygiene Inc., (800) 995-2759.

 Saving Face: If you thought Gillette's Sensor razor was great when it was 
introduced in 1989, check out the new SensorExcel that seems to give an even 
closer shave. 
</P>
<P>
 This new razor, introduced in the United States last month after successfully 
launching in Europe and Canada in 1993, has "microfins" that help the facial 
hairs stand up so they'll be cut more closely and comfortably.  
</P>
<P>
 These are made of "elastomeric" material, a Gillette representative says. That 
translates to a high-tech rubber-like substance. There are new grips on the 
handle made from the same material, so the razor will not slip while you're 
shaving. 
</P>
<P>
 SensorExcel ($3.99) is available nationwide in drugstores, supermarkets and 
mass-merchandise outlets. Refill cartridges are $4.49 for a five-pack; $8.49 
for a 10-pack.

INK: SERVING UP-TO-DATE SLICE OF CHEESECAKE

 They were morale-boosting companions in wartime, those impossibly curved and 
seductive women drawn for Esquire by Alberto Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years after these pinups first appeared, the so-called Varga Girls have 
been reconstituted by Esquire in Timothy White's computer-enhanced photos of 
'90s-era super-models. Amber Smith is sprawled languorously across two pages in 
the November issue; a wispily clad Vendela reaches skyward in December. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not nude shots, as some misinformed advertisers had feared. As 
highly stylized renderings of gorgeous women, they are less provocative than 
Sports Illustrated's annual swimsuit issue and most of the ubiquitous ads for 
Calvin Klein's fabwear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Varga Girls are an old idea made new again, if only for older guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying to connect the magazine to its heritage in an up-to-date 
way," says Edward Kosner, 57, who left New York magazine to become Esquire's 
editor in chief last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all these trademark features at Esquire, such as the Dubious 
Achievement Awards, Women We Love and the Varga Girls. It occurred to me that, 
if we could update the concept with these new creatures called super-models, it 
would be kind of sweet, kind of like up-to-date cheesecake. Female beauty is 
still an enduring value." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction in the magazine industry has ranged from respectful applause from men 
of a certain age, including Playboy Editor in Chief Hugh M. Hefner, to yawning 
dismissal from younger editors trying to tailor their men's books for a new 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of the Varga Girls does raise a larger question of how sex is used 
to sell magazines in the increasingly competitive men's field. What choices are 
editors making -- and why? 
</P>
<P>
 "My big seller in '94 was the February issue with Geena Davis on the cover," 
says Art Cooper, 57, editor in chief of GQ. The actress, who was blond at the 
time and wore a high-waisted Armani suit opened at the hips to reveal her 
navel, helped move 400,000 copies off newsstands -- a 70% sell-through of the 
print run that far exceeded industry norms. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggests, however, that the new and enhanced pinups would not work in GQ 
because the median age of his readers (27.5) is younger than Esquire's (even if 
GQ did run a recent feature on Betty Page, the frequently topless pinup queen 
of the '50s). 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who competes directly with Kosner, offers little reaction to Esquire's 
revival of the Varga Girls except to say, "If it works for them, it's a good 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Hefner, 68, who employed Vargas at Playboy for many years after the artist 
left Esquire (Vargas died in 1982), identifies another elementary advantage to 
the new Varga Girls: "When you create a men's magazine and you leave out the 
one thing that men are most interested in, you have a little problem." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hefner, Playboy's February issue will dust off more archival 
pinups in a feature about George Petty, an illustrator who was popular in the 
'30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hefner goes back to the future in Playboy's December book, which 
presents a nude layout of a 38-year-old Bo Derek, 15 years after the actress 
starred as the perfect 10 in "10."  
</P>
<P>
 Sounding like someone who claims to buy Playboy only for its articles, Hefner 
explains: "Playboy first and foremost is devoted to the romantic connections 
between the sexes, and part of that connection is based on nostalgia." Re-enter 
Derek in Playboy's 40th-anniversary year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Scott Jarrett seems bored by such features. He's the 34-year-old editor 
and publisher of two hip magazines for young men, Ray Gun and Bikini, and a new 
music mag called Huh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm being egocentric, but I would think that Bikini was an influence on 
Esquire's bringing back the Varga Girls," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bikini, a square-shaped and manically designed magazine that Jarrett publishes 
out of offices in Santa Monica, has drawn media attention since its launch a 
year ago, partly in response to its periodic semi-nude profiles of Tatum 
O'Neal, Traci Lords and other celebs who appeal to twentysomething guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Vanity Fair writer Angela Janklow Harrington, now editor in chief of 
Mouth2Mouth, a new youth-oriented magazine, says, "Women's fashion magazines 
for the longest time have been showing photographs of women looking fantastic 
in very little clothing. . . . I think it (the Varga Girl) celebrates women." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Madonna, who has long since transcended the MTV audience so 
that her ever-marketed and ever-evolving sexpot image is turning on the VH-1 
set and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Esquire's double-barreled cover of August, "Mailer on Madonna," which 
displayed the fabulous one in a come-hither bikini pose, sold 204,000 newsstand 
copies to become the magazine's top draw since its 50th-anniversary issue of 
1983. Details, which tries to lean sullenly on the cutting edge, featured a 
trashier Madonna ("Come and Get It") on the cover of its December issue. 
</P>
<P>
 It portrays the blond chameleon at her sleaziest. "The look we came up with is 
based on Madonna's own idea of the way she wants to look," Details creative 
director William Mullen says. 
</P>
<P>
 In his view, why not Madonna? "There's a lot of retro-mania in the air. A lot 
of people would tell you that retro is really modern."

3 SURVIVE 15 HOURS IN FRIGID SEA OFF O.C.; RESCUE: 'AFRAID? WAS I AFRAID? 
THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY,' SKIPPER OF THE SUNKEN DIVE BOAT SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Three San Diego men had a lot to be thankful for on Thanksgiving Day. They 
were rescued after spending more than 15 hours in 58-degree ocean water after 
their boat sank 14 miles southeast of Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great Thanksgiving," said Ken Gerken, 35, as he and the other two men 
recuperated at an Avalon hospital. "When we first sank, we saw Dana Point 
pretty clear. We saw the Orange County lights, and then they all disappeared. . 
. . I just kept praying to God that I wouldn't give up." 
</P>
<P>
 The three men, who had been diving for sea urchins off the Catalina coast, 
were returning to Dana Point Harbor on Wednesday night when two waves washed 
over the bow of their 24-foot dive boat. Skipper Matthew Pressly, 30, said he 
barely had time to make one radio distress call before the boat's bow went up 
and the boat capsized. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressly dove into the boat's cabin and succeeded in grabbing a dry suit for 
himself and the top half of a wet suit for Gerken. The third survivor, Dennis 
Dehrens, 31, wore only jeans, a sweat shirt, a jacket and tennis shoes in the 
chilly ocean water. When the three were admitted at the hospital, Dehrens' body 
temperature was about 92 degrees -- 1 1/2 hours after they were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 The three commercial divers survived by lashing together the bumpers that 
protect the boat's bow, and using them for flotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressly said they were going to take their 24-foot boat out of the water at 
Dana Point and haul it on a trailer to San Diego, where they had planned to 
celebrate the holiday with their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead they spent a harrowing night waving and shouting at U.S. Coast Guard 
helicopters and vessels that came close but never heard or saw them. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first wave rolled over the bow, Pressly said, "we had a little water 
in the back hatches. Then, all of a sudden, I looked down and we had 12 inches 
of standing water. The stern of the boat went upright. I tried to jump in and 
get a wet suit and life jackets but it was like a bad submarine flick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got into the cabin and this tremendous force of water slammed me against 
one side of the cabin. I grabbed what I could. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afraid? Was I afraid? That's putting it mildly," Pressly said. "I thought 
about my kids a lot and I thought about giving up." 
</P>
<P>
 For about an hour, the three men were able to cling to the bow, which bobbed 
near the water's surface. Breathing was made difficult because of the cold and 
because the water around them was covered with gasoline -- apparently from a 
tank aboard the boat that ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bow slipped below the surface, leaving the three men to tread water 
as ocean currents pulled them away from the Orange County coastline and toward 
Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 They then decided to separate. Pressly, who had the full suit, would attempt 
to swim to Catalina, which at the time appeared to be about seven miles 
distant. Gerken, a veteran diver, remained with Dehrens. 
</P>
<P>
 While the struggle to stay afloat sapped their strength, the lines they used 
to tie themselves to their makeshift buoys began chaffing, then cutting into 
their skins. The salt water irritated their cuts, causing them to swell, which 
limited their mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressly, now swimming on his own, had to tell himself not to hyperventilate 
while he fought the cold and the current. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current was pushing me back and I didn't think I could make it," Pressly 
said. "I saw the Coast Guard helicopter and all these boats going by us. I was 
cramping up. To be quite honest with you, I cried. I couldn't hold back. I had 
just about given up." 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster his morale, Pressly said, he thought of his children -- Lucas, 8, 
Samantha, 6, and Jamie, 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have been eating turkey with them (Thursday)," Pressly said. "I was 
the one who was going to prepare our Thanksgiving and they were upset with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, just before noon, a private vessel, The Webfoot, spotted Gerken and 
Dehrens, who were still clinging to the bow bumpers in the choppy waters about 
four miles southeast of Catalina. It turned and plucked them from the water. 
Twenty minutes later, they found and rescued Pressly. The men were so exhausted 
that Dehrens said he couldn't lift his legs to make the three steps into the 
rescue vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to help me in the boat. They grabbed me, poured buckets of coffee in 
me and had me naked and in a sleeping bag before we picked up Matt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William Holvik, the physician who examined and treated the three men, said 
each survivor suffered mild hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard that paramedics were bringing in three men who had been out 15 
hours, I expected them to be in a lot worse condition," Holvik said, adding 
that they were fortunate "that they hadn't been drinking. If they had, they 
probably would have been in a lot worse shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Holvik said the men were fit, although not lean. He said "their good body 
mass" had protected them better than if they had been lean. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were given hot baths and showers, heat packs and plenty of hot coffee. 
Holvik said Dehrens, who survived the ordeal without a wet suit, arrived at the 
hospital with a temperature of less than 93 degrees. It was an hour and a half 
before Dehrens' body temperature rose to 95.6 degrees, Holvik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hypothermia is a medical term for a fall in body temperature to below 95 
degrees. Holvik said there are too many variables, such as body mass and water 
temperatures, to say with certainty how long a person can remain in cold ocean 
water and survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the water was say, 40 degrees, it would make them very ill very fast," 
Holvik said. "Basically, with hypothermia, their whole system shuts down while 
the body tries to keep the core temperature up. Muscle tissues which no longer 
are receiving any oxygen can be damaged, and as a result, the person can 
develop metabolic acidosis, blood sugar can be lowered, electrolytes will 
suffer, and in some cases they can go into fatal heart rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 Prolonged survival in frigid waters is possible. In December, 1987, an 
11-year-old Minnesota boy was pulled from an icy river 45 minutes after he fell 
in. His body temperature was 77 degrees. Physicians considered him clinically 
dead but labored to save him. Two weeks later, he left the hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 All three of the survivors praised their rescuers, as well as the paramedics 
and hospital staff, for taking good care of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe the people here at the hospital," Gerken said. "They all 
have been so nice to us. The doctors even volunteered to go home and get us 
Thanksgiving food. In fact, we're eating turkey dinner right now," he said in a 
telephone interview.

O.C. CELEBRATES A THANKSGIVING OF GENEROSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 300 years after Native Americans and immigrant Pilgrims sat down 
together for the first Thanksgiving, thousands of latter-day immigrants or 
their offspring gathered in an Orange County parking lot for free turkey 
dinners and to hear a call for the renewal of the original Thanksgiving spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to support these kinds of gestures of generosity that cut across the 
suspicion and hatred that seems to be so apparent these days," Msgr. Jaime 
Soto, vicar for the Latino community in the Diocese of Orange, told the crowd 
gathered outside the Casa Garcia Mexican Restaurant, where an army of 
volunteers expected to serve 10,000 dinners before day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for all of us to put that aside for at least one day, 
to be generous with one another and thankful, not only for the gifts we have to 
share, but for having neighbors to share them with." 
</P>
<P>
 Rekindling the spirit of Thanksgiving is especially important this year, he 
said in an interview, in light of the recent passage of Proposition 187, which 
he said seems contrary to the holiday's meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have lost hope in our ability to rebuild a strong California," Soto 
said. "This is a chance to be hopeful. Thanksgiving began as an openness to the 
stranger, the immigrant. It was forged in the spirit of generosity and 
hospitality that has always characterized this day." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar scenes were repeated beneath bright cloudless skies all over Orange 
County, as thousands of hungry celebrants showed up at area shelters, 
restaurants and churches to enjoy bountiful holiday meals prepared in the 
traditional way. 
</P>
<P>
 At the food court of Westminster Mall, hundreds ate courtesy of the nearby 
Shelter for Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach's Hard Rock Cafe opened its doors to the needy beginning about 
11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Costa Mesa, volunteers at the Someone Cares Soup Kitchen served more 
than 1,000 Thanksgiving meals to people who were homeless, short of money, 
elderly or, in some cases, just in need of company. "This makes us feel good, 
and we have a lot of fun doing it," explained Bill Hamilton, owner of Newport 
Beach's Cannery Restaurant, which provided the food. "Plus, it's needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Walder, an immigrant from Belgium who now owns an employee benefits 
company in Irvine and has volunteered to cook Someone Cares' Thanksgiving meals 
for the past five years, said he does it to show his own appreciation for the 
treatment he's received. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to this country years ago with $56 in my pocket and made my fortune," 
Walder said. "I feel very grateful to the community. This is my way of giving 
something back." 
</P>
<P>
 And Robert Tierno, who has spent the past 1 1/2 years unemployed and living in 
a motor home with his wife and four children, said that the free food helped 
make his day. "Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays," Tierno said. "This 
is great. It's hard to cook such a big meal." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the spirit of giving and sharing more evident, though, than at the 
Casa Garcia Mexican Restaurant, where volunteers said they began cooking Monday 
night to feed the throngs of hungry celebrants who at 10 a.m. Thursday began 
forming a line to the serving tent that eventually reached a block in length. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to offer the traditionally prepared Thanksgiving meal, restaurant 
owner Frank Garcia -- who has sponsored the event for seven years -- said he 
used 500 turkeys, 250 gallons of gravy and 8,000 pounds of potatoes, vegetables 
and stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the usual fare -- including pumpkin pie, corn on the cob and 
mashed potatoes -- Garcia added a few ethnic twists: slices of raw pineapple 
and his own special recipe for a turkey stuffing made out of rice, bread and 
Mexican tortilla chips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loves it," the restaurateur declared. "Thank God I got a turkey for 
people who don't have one. If everybody in the world gave a plate to their 
neighbors, there wouldn't be any hunger in the world. You have to give back to 
the community. Today, I'm eating with everybody and it makes me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 His wasn't the only happy face as volunteers circulated among the ethnically 
diverse crowd offering lemonade and punch while a Mexican band played its heart 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at one of the dozens of long folding tables covered with purple linen 
tablecloths, James Gatens, a 43-year-old immigrant from England who said that 
he lives in his car and sometimes works as a salesman, explained why he came. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the ad in the paper. It said they'd have music and food, so I thought 
I'd check it out," he said. "The food is excellent. They asked me if I wanted a 
drumstick, and the turkey looked like it came from Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincente Palacios, a factory worker from Mexico, said he especially 
appreciated the holiday's message of ethnic harmony and tolerance. "I like the 
human warmth," said Palacios, 34. "You can see a lot of people from a lot of 
different places enjoying the same food. I think it's beautiful."

HEARING COULD DECIDE AIRPORT EXPANSION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Every morning, the sound of airplanes departing Burbank Airport jolts Valley 
Village homeowner Lori Dinkin out of bed as well as any alarm clock. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins at 7 a.m. and continues intermittently throughout the day, ending as 
late as 2 a.m. and intruding on her life like a boisterous next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to sleep, and God help you if you're sick in bed," said the 
75-year-old president of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn. "It's bad enough 
when you're well. . . . Your peace has been totally disrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about the potential for even more noise as the airport gains 
popularity, Dinkin has joined three other San Fernando Valley homeowners groups 
and the city of Los Angeles in a lawsuit seeking to halt construction of a new 
airport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport's operating board, known as the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport 
Authority, wants to quadruple the size of the present 163,000-square-foot 
terminal to accommodate the 10 million passengers expected to fly in and out of 
Burbank in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration has pressured airport 
officials to replace the 64-year-old building because it is too close to the 
east-west runway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new terminal will lead to noise pollution that was not acknowledged in 
an environmental impact report completed by airport officials last year, 
neighbors and Los Angeles officials have alleged in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien in January ordered the 
airport authority to redo the environmental impact report, which is required 
under state law for building projects with the potential to significantly 
affect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying the issue again, airport officials reached the same conclusion 
they had the first time: The new terminal will not lead to a significant 
increase in aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials who operate the airport also repeated their earlier finding that the 
number of passengers using the airport will continue to grow with or without a 
new terminal. Thus, any increase in air traffic will occur regardless of 
whether the terminal is quadrupled in size. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents claim the new environmental report is insufficient, and O'Brien 
will hear oral arguments from both sides Monday. If the authority wins, it 
could begin design work on the new terminal immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who wins, the losing side can appeal, which could delay progress on 
the multimillion-dollar project for up to two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This legal stuff is getting ridiculous," said Brian Bowman, president of the 
airport authority, which is made up of nine commissioners representing Burbank, 
Glendale and Pasadena. "What the city of L.A. is doing is primarily trying to 
harass us. That's all they're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third lawsuit filed by Los Angeles city officials -- acting on 
behalf of residents in the southeast San Fernando Valley -- against the airport 
authority since 1977. In each instance, the city has disputed the adequacy of 
the airport's environmental reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first lawsuit, the Los Angeles City Council sought to block the 
authority's purchase of the airport site. The case was settled in 1977. The 
deal allowed the authority to buy the land from Lockheed Air Terminal, while 
airport officials agreed to take "all feasible and necessary" steps to comply 
with state noise standards, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Los Angeles again took Burbank to court, seeking to head off 
plans for a doubling of the airport's size. That expansion was canceled when 
the authority could not arrange for purchase of the needed land. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, lawyers for the city of Los Angeles contend that the airport 
authority failed to comply with the court order, allegedly by producing an 
updated environmental report that misstates federal noise standards and fails 
to provide proper remedies for noise pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 If the authority wins the case, it will be able to proceed with the design of 
the new terminal to accommodate 10 million passengers and 150 flights per day, 
Bowman said. If it loses, the authority would be forced to return to the 
drawing board for a new environmental report, while continuing with the present 
terminal, which handles 90 flights each day and 4.7 million passengers each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the dispute is the proposed 670,000-square-foot terminal, 
boasting nearly twice the current number of aircraft gates.  
</P>
<P>
 Keith Pritsker, a deputy city attorney, contends that a new, larger terminal 
invites more travelers to use Burbank Airport than might otherwise come. 
</P>
<P>
 But airport officials say passenger counts will continue to grow partly 
because of Burbank's convenient location and crowded conditions at Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it responsible public policy to knowingly build a terminal building that 
is vastly under-designed for the number of passengers we know will come through 
the door?" asked airport spokesman Victor Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport's operating revenues for the 1994-95 fiscal year are projected 
to be $56.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about 56,000 flights by commercial airliners were made to and from 
the facility. The vast majority take off to the south and circle east over such 
neighborhoods as North Hollywood, Valley Village, Studio City and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners groups in those areas joined the city's lawsuit in 1993. For years, 
they have asked airport officials to divert more planes to the east -- over 
Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FAA has banned aircraft weighing more than 12,500 pounds from taking 
off to the east because the airport's present terminal lies just 312 feet from 
the runway and must be 750 feet away to comply with federal safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn. has taken a similar position of avoiding commercial 
flights in that direction for a number of safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of physics," said Richard Russell, a former spokesman for the 
group. "If the pilot is using good sense, he will take off over the longer 
(north-south) runway." 
</P>
<P>
 Another point of contention is the complicated method by which airport noise 
is measured under California law, known as the Community Noise Equivalent 
Level. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding Burbank Airport are 15 noise-monitoring stations with microphones 
that record aircraft noise and feed the data into a centralized computer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Imaginary lines are then drawn around the airport indicating the areas where 
the readings reach various average levels in a given year. A 65 CNEL contour, 
for example, encompasses the area in which all average readings are 65 decibels 
or above. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, airports are required to reduce the number of homes, schools 
and hospitals affected by aircraft noise with soundproofing programs, easements 
and acquisitions, among other things -- as long as they are within the 65 CNEL 
contour. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the goal is difficult to achieve, Burbank Airport and most other 
airports in California operate under special permits known as variances, 
according to the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials have spent thousands of dollars to insulate nearby Luther 
Burbank Middle School for sound, a program that Principal Donna Coffey says has 
worked well. Three others -- Glenwood Elementary School, St. Patrick's School 
and Mingay Adult School -- will be next. Similar work is expected to begin soon 
on the 1,764 homes within the 65 CNEL contour. 
</P>
<P>
 After a new terminal is built, airport officials contend, the 65 CNEL contour 
is not likely to grow very much.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't have sympathy for people near the airport," said Richard Simon, 
the airport authority's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bought their homes cheaply," he added. "They realized -- they knew in 
their hearts -- they got a bit of a bargain and they took advantage of the 
opportunity that the proximity to the airport afforded them, and they've 
forgotten that." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents living outside the boundary argue that they are affected just as 
much by aircraft noise but are not recognized under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words, we deserve what we get because we live in the proximity of 
the airport?" Dinkin asked. "If Mr. Simon would like to buy me a house in an 
upscale neighborhood that has the same square footage and all the same 
amenities, I will be happy to move."

CHILDREN OF GOD FOUNDER DIES, SECT SAYS; RELIGION: DAVID BERG WAS 75. HIS 
CONTROVERSIAL GROUP HAD ROOTS IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 The leader of the Children of God, a controversial Christian sect that began 
in a coffeehouse near the Huntington Beach pier and later became involved in 
conflicts with the law around the world, is dead, his followers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Berg was 75, said Rachel Scott, a spokeswoman for the organization 
speaking from Leire, Leicestershire, in central England. The group claims a 
membership of 6,000 adults and 3,000 children in 50 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg had been in hiding since 1971, and Scott said she was informed of his 
death two days ago in a telephone call from Berg's wife, Maria. Scott said she 
did not know what country Berg was in when he died, or when he died. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fell asleep in his sleep, peacefully," Scott told Associated Press, 
quoting Berg's widow. "He was getting weaker and weaker; he died of old age, 
basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Berg will now the lead The Family, as Children of God now calls itself, 
a statement said. She is to continue living in hiding, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been with this organization 23 years, and I don't know where they are," 
Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a traveling preacher, Berg organized the Children of God as a small, 
Christian commune in 1968. Berg, himself the child of evangelists, preached an 
anti-Establishment, apocalyptic creed. As the movement grew, Berg, known to his 
followers as Father David and Moses David, started spreading a bizarre 
collection of prophecies. The comet Kohoutek, he predicted, would doom America. 
He charged that Jews and blacks were conspiring to ruin the world. 
</P>
<P>
 What made Berg and his followers stand out, however, was their fervent 
espousal of a free-love gospel to gather new converts, which eventually 
escalated into allegations of sexual abuse of children in a number of 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has been investigated by authorities in Argentina, France, Spain, 
Australia, Venezuela and Peru on charges of forced menial labor, child abuse 
and using prostitution to attract recruits, but no members have been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the group -- with a new, more wholesome and conservative image 
-- has returned to Orange County, evangelizing at juvenile homes and colleges. 
In 1992, the group even sang for Barbara Bush in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been serious accusations made by the anti-cult movement that 
members of The Family would commit suicide upon learning of their founder's 
death," the statement said. "We have absolutely no intention of doing so. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "As Christians, we can only rejoice that after a long and fruitful life, our 
beloved pastor has been called to his heavenly reward."

A HOLIDAY CRAVING FOR EXERCISE; 4,000 TURN OUT FOR PRE-PIGOUT TURKEY TROT RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA NGUYEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Die-hard runners and recreational walkers joined Santa Claus and his reindeer 
on Thanksgiving Day as a crowd of nearly 4,000 people from all ends of the 
country participated in Dana Point's 18th annual 5-kilometer and 10-kilometer 
Turkey Trot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Dana Point Chamber of Commerce, this is the second-largest 
Turkey Trot in the country, behind one in Dallas, race director Herb Massinger 
said. This year's event drew one of the largest crowds in race history, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a unique event," Massinger said. "Last year people from 15 different 
states came. And every year people from 400 to 500 California cities converge 
here before they have their Thanksgiving dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 A team, or as some participants call it, a "centipede," from the Loeschhorn's 
Running Club followed their annual tradition of gearing up in their Christmas 
outfits. Following a trail of reindeer led by a red-nosed Rudolph, a fit and 
trim Santa dashed off in his red running tights, yelling, "We do this every 
year. It's great fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a pull-up costume that straddled a stuffed-animal turkey, early bird 
Sue Emery, a Dana Point resident, arrived at 5 a.m. to raise spirits and cheer 
on runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this for the past 12 years because I get to see people here 
who rarely leave their homes throughout the year," Emery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the scenic coastal route, roller-bladers whizzed by, babies snoozed as 
their parents pushed them along in strollers, and the young-at-heart senior 
citizens crossed the finish line. Despite the 60-degree morning chill, racers 
of all ages pushed for their best running times. 
</P>
<P>
 First-place finishers from each race took home a $100 check, a plaque and 
other prizes. Those who placed second and third received $75 and $50 checks, 
respectively, and enjoyed other prizes such as a cookbook and cutting board. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Pomeroy, a 65-year-old track enthusiast from Escondido, quickly finished 
the 5-kilometer race. Cooling down with a smile on his face, Pomeroy said he 
felt "a sense of accomplishment" and was ready for a turkey feast. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the race served as a training course. John Garcia, 16, a Cerritos 
High School student, endured the long drive to prepare for the upcoming 
cross-country and track season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no surprise that a victorious Joey Gomez of Fullerton placed first in 
10-kilometer run. A veteran racer who has triumphed in five previous Turkey 
Trots, Gomez said this year's hilly course was good preparation for a future 
Sacramento marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 But others had a different opinion. "The 10K kills," one exhausted racer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend joggers like Laguna Niguel's Jill Murphy, who strolled along the 
course with her 1-year-old son, Reid, came to ease the anticipated evening of 
Thanksgiving feasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way," Murphy said, "I'll feel better about eating a lot later."

THE RUSH TO SHOPPING SEASON; NORDSTROM DECKS THE HALLS WITH HECTIC HOLIDAY 
MAKE-OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 They toiled away all through the night, trying to create the spirit of 
Christmas. They put up trees, hung wreaths and tinseled display cases. But they 
were not Santa's helpers. They were employees at Nordstrom South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tradition at Nordstrom stores all over the country. When the stores 
close at 8 p.m. on the evening before Thanksgiving, everything appears as it 
would on your average shopping day. As soon as the last customer is out the 
door, about 100 full-time and temporary workers hit the floor toting strings of 
brightly colored lights, laying down holiday carpet and trimming the Christmas 
trees for the hordes of shoppers who return for the day-after-Thanksgiving 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea -- a marketing oddity in these times -- is to celebrate one holiday 
at a time and not to overshadow the importance of celebrating Thanksgiving. 
That includes keeping Christmas themes out of its advertising campaigns until 
after Thanksgiving. Most other department stores, and the malls themselves, 
have their Christmas decorating done by the time Thanksgiving rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Nordstrom decorators, preserving the Thanksgiving spirit for shoppers 
means sacrificing their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Few left for home before 3 a.m. Thursday. Nordstrom's in-house designers, who 
work through the night until about 9 o'clock Thanksgiving morning, are kept 
alert with large mugs of steaming coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a bad side to this, it's that you are exhausted on Thanksgiving," 
said display designer Jeffrey Hamill. He explained that most other department 
stores make the change incrementally, decorating one department at a time over 
a period of a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordstrom decorators do it all in one burst, laying out dozens of 
Christmas trees, nearly 1,000 poinsettia plants, 633 strings of lights, 386 
snowflakes, 50 ivy plants, 45 bird cages, 30 aspen trees. They change all the 
window displays. Even the piano on the second floor gets tuned to be in perfect 
shape for the masses of shoppers expected in the weeks to come. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while all the workers expected to sleep through much of Thanksgiving Day, 
few complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "You ask yourself if it is really worth it, and it is," said Denise Combes, a 
store auditor with Nordstrom. "You come into the store and it is normal, and 
when you leave it looks and smells just like Christmas. It's just great." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Combes, a number of the decorators' helpers were Nordstrom employees who 
enjoyed the chance to show their creative sides for a night. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Spillane only got to watch last year's decorating because she was on 
duty as a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like so much fun that this year I wanted to play," said Spillane, 
who spent most of the night creating snowflake patterns on a glass wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is fun to walk in and look around and say, 'I made that,' " Combes said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cori Wiegandt, assistant manager at Nordstrom South Coast Plaza, the 
decoration party is an annual reunion of old friends and colleagues. "Everyone 
that I used to work with when I did stock is here, and that is really fun," she 
said. "If I don't do this, I have withdrawals." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordstrom's tradition of waiting to put up its Christmas decorations until 
after Thanksgiving, while unusual, happens to be a savvy concept. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tony Cherbak, retail analyst with Deloitte & Touche, there is not 
much point in decorating early because few people consider starting their 
Christmas shopping until after Thanksgiving anyway. Less than 20% of all 
Americans will have their holiday shopping done before the Thanksgiving 
weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the transformation of the store is a great customer draw. When 
Nordstrom reopens today at 8 a.m., store officials are expecting customers to 
be lining up to get in, some hoping to be among the first to get a peek at the 
freshly decorated store.

DANA PARSONS: A DAY FOR CHEWING ON IDLE THOUGHTS ON THE MENU OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When better than the day after Thanksgiving for leftover thoughts, reheated 
ideas and half-baked offerings? 
</P>
<P>
 * Given all the big-ticket items floating around, is this really a good time 
for the Anaheim City Council to have so many new faces? 
</P>
<P>
 * Many people instinctively recoiled at Newt Gingrich's thinking-out-loud 
remarks about putting children of welfare mothers in orphanages. Don't worry, 
it'll never happen, but don't we also instinctively know that many infants and 
children would be better off almost anywhere else than with abusive parents? 
</P>
<P>
 * Because of the National Hockey League lockout, we'll never know whether my 
prediction that the Mighty Ducks would be 23-0 at this stage of the season 
would have been correct. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the other hand, I should finally get some credit now that scientists 
concede the universe may be as young as 8 billion years old, instead of as old 
as 20 billion as they previously thought. I've been saying that for years, but 
no one would believe me. Frankly, if 12 billion years is considered an 
acceptable margin of error, excuse me if I'm a little skeptical of future 
announcements from cosmologists. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of these days, I'm going to come up with a Top 10 list of the most 
aggravating things drivers do. Somewhere in there would be people at the head 
of a long line in the left-turn lane and who are daydreaming when the arrow 
comes on. PEOPLE: YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY ATTENTION!!! 
</P>
<P>
 * In-Case-You-Missed-It Department: Dearborn, Mich. (AP) -- A police officer 
who was suspended for three days for writing his sevens European-style, with a 
line through them, is back on the force in good standing. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's too late now, but I wish illegal immigrants in Orange County were 
unionized. I wonder what a three-day strike by them would have done to flesh 
out the debate on their impact on other people's daily lives and pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 * To get on the Anne Rice bandwagon, I guess I'll have to go see "Interview 
With the Vampire." I've had Rice's "Queen of the Damned" for at least two years 
and, despite repeated tries, cannot seem to get past Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Isn't this how revolutions start? Voters overwhelmingly pass ballot 
measures, such as Prop. 187, only to see their implementation delayed or struck 
down by courts. That fuels voter cynicism and anger, but the fault lies with 
supposed leaders such as Gov. Wilson, who knew court challenges awaited and 
even welcomed them. That's fine for him and whatever percentage of voters also 
were aware of it, but does it really help a democracy to devalue what happens 
at the polls? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there anyone in Orange County who actually thinks the Santa Ana Freeway 
construction projects will be finished in our lifetimes? 
</P>
<P>
 * Whatever happened to the Board of Supervisors? 
</P>
<P>
 * Here's one reason I love the news business. The following is a correction 
run by the Associated Press in Spokane, Wash: "In a story Monday about hearings 
into a 1965 federally funded radiation experiment, the Associated Press 
reported erroneously that former prison inmate Harold Bibeau had his testicles 
removed." 
</P>
<P>
 * I'm not going to miss "The Lion King" this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Huffington claimed voter fraud. That may be the most ironic statement 
ever uttered by a California political candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immigration control is a good idea, because of its impact on slowing 
population growth in the United States. But people who make a knee-jerk 
connection between race and fertility should read a book entitled, "How Many 
Americans?" Its authors note that Latino and black women have higher fertility 
rates than Anglos, but attribute it to Anglo women's generally greater 
education. "The relationship between education and fertility is more 
significant than that between race and fertility," they write. "For example, 
Anglo women, regardless of years of school completed, have much higher 
fertility than black women with a college education." 
</P>
<P>
 * The authors also point out that income levels affect fertility rate, with 
higher-income women having fewer children. Latino fertility is high, but the 
authors add: "There is evidence that Hispanic fertility falls in the second 
generation and where some assimilation has occurred. As immigrants and their 
descendants learn English -- a good indicator of acculturation as well as 
increased education -- fertility falls. 
</P>
<P>
 * The search is over! We have found someone who's not in denial and who owns 
up to his shortcomings: Gordon Davey, after being named Britain's most boring 
man, said, "I shall obviously have to try to be more interesting." 
</P>
<P>

THE RUSH TO SHOPPING SEASON; BUSIEST GIFT-BUYING DAY OF YEAR TO CLOG MALLS, 
ROADS TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If you plan to begin your holiday shopping today, take along plenty of 
patience and expect lots of company. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment is down, inflation is in check and, according to government 
studies, Americans have more disposable income to spend on gifts this holiday 
season. What does all of this mean for Orange County residents? 
</P>
<P>
 It means that on the day after Thanksgiving, traditionally touted as the 
year's biggest shopping day, local malls will be brimming with shoppers, while 
the parking lots and the roads leading to them will be choked with cars. 
Transportation officials said they expect twice the normal weekday traffic 
today on streets near the county's major malls. 
</P>
<P>
 After inching along with other cars to get to a shopping center, be prepared 
to queue up in long lines to get into the parking lot. Once you are in, expect 
to spend even more time hunting for a space. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be pretty," said David Sorge, Costa Mesa operations 
engineer. "Our advice is to take the bus or car-pool, but there really is no 
easy way to get around it. At this time of year, parking spaces are at a 
premium at South Coast Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there probably will not be any changes from last year's massive 
holiday traffic jams on San Diego Freeway off-ramps caused by shoppers heading 
to South Coast Plaza. Caltrans had hoped that a South Coast Drive off-ramp on 
the northbound side of the freeway would be open by now to relieve traffic 
congestion on the Bristol Street exit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Caltrans officials said the ramp, which should have been completed in 
July, will not open until January. Meanwhile, Sorge warned of delays on all 
exit ramps leading to South Coast Plaza and on the streets surrounding the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Plaza spokeswoman Suzanne Biallot said the mall will offer three 
valet parking stations for shoppers who do not want to battle for one of the 
10,804 parking spaces at the mall. For those who do not mind walking a few 
blocks, there is also parking available east of Bristol Street and on Bear 
Street by Crystal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic problems will be unavoidable throughout the county, said Caltrans 
spokeswoman Marina Duran-Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't plan any freeway closures due to construction during the holidays," 
Duran-Rojas said. "We're encouraging drivers to ride-share and take alternative 
routes to the malls. We know it's hard to stay away from (freeway) construction 
areas when they're everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the trouble spots that drivers should look out for and avoid if 
possible include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The "Orange Crush," the junction of the Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Main Street off-ramp at the Santa Ana Freeway, if traveling to 
MainPlace/Santa Ana mall. Caltrans suggests using the eastbound Garden Grove 
Freeway and exiting at Main Street instead. Or, if southbound on the Santa Ana 
Freeway, exit at Broadway and cross the bridge to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Toro Road in front of the Laguna Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Edinger Avenue and Beach Boulevard exits leading to the Huntington Beach 
Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 In North County, shoppers are advised to use Imperial Highway or State College 
Boulevard to get to Brea Mall. Caltrans officials said they expect the freeway 
off-ramps leading to the mall to back up and cause delays for drivers wanting 
to exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Mall General Manager Don Ford said he expects shopping will be a frenzy 
today. "The economy is good and we've had a pretty good year already," he said. 
"The mall is fully leased and we have high expectations for all the merchants. 
This means we also expect a lot of cars and shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to accommodate the expected crush of cars, mall officials have made 
some changes in the parking decks, Ford said. On some decks, drivers will be 
able to make only right turns to help them get in and out quicker, he said. 
Valet parking will also be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic flow is not expected to be a problem at the Mall of Orange, said 
General Manager Dan Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many ways to get in and out of here that no one entrance ever 
gets clogged," he said. "The many exits and entrances are one of our biggest 
assets that attract shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Transportation Authority officials said buses will be running on 
a normal weekday scheduled today and are encouraging shoppers to leave their 
cars at home and ride buses to the malls. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA spokesman John Standiford said North County shoppers can take advantage 
of the park-and-ride facility at the Fullerton Transportation Center, near the 
Santa Fe train station, where shoppers can board buses to the Brea and 
Orangefair malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers in Santa Ana can board buses at the transit terminal on Civic Center 
Drive, east of the Federal Building, for South Coast Plaza, Fashion Island and 
Westminster Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you're a glutton for punishment and enjoy sitting in your car, you 
should take advantage of the bus service to your favorite mall," Standiford 
said. Avoiding the Crowd 
</P>
<P>
 With the holiday shopping season officially underway today, so comes the 
inevitable increase of traffic tie-ups. How to avoid jams near three popular 
Orange County malls: 
</P>
<P>
 Mall of Orange Hours: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Avoid: Katella Avenue exit from Costa 
Mesa Freeway Use: Lincoln off-ramp from the Costa Mesa Freeway, and Tustin 
Avenue entrance Parking: Good in rear lots along Canal Street 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Mall Hours: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Avoid: Imperial Highway. Heaviest traffic 
approaches from the south along State College Boulevard and left-turn traffic 
signals make motorists wait to enter mall. Use: Approach from the north along 
State College Boulevard and use Birch Street or Randolph Avenue entrance. 
Lambert Road to State College Boulevard is a good alternative. Parking: Valet 
parking for $3 off Birch Street between Robinsons-May and Nordstrom 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Plaza Hours: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Avoid: Bristol Street entrances Use: 
Fairview Road exits off San Diego Freeway. Go north to South Coast Drive and 
then east. Bear Street is a good alternative. Parking: Use north and south 
parking garages and lots near Bullocks.

POLICE ARREST MAN THEY BELIEVE WAS SHOT BY BOY; CRIME: SUSPECT IN SANTA ANA 
SHOOTING DEATH OF THE BOY'S FATHER HAD GONE TO A HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT. A 
SECOND SUSPECT IS STILL SOUGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 A man who police said was wounded by a 13-year-old boy after shooting to death 
the youngster's father was arrested on suspicion of murder as he sought medical 
treatment at a hospital, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Manuel Barragan, 29, address unknown, underwent surgery at an 
undisclosed Orange County hospital for gunshot wounds to his mouth and eyes 
that he suffered during the shooting about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to 
Lt. David Petko. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had alerted Southern California-area hospitals to be on the lookout for 
anyone seeking emergency treatment for gunshot wounds, Petko said. Police were 
contacted by officials at a Sunland hospital after Barragan walked in for 
treatment nearly 2 1/2 hours after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our understanding that he showed up at that hospital with an injury from 
some type of small-arms fire," Petko said. "He was brought back into Orange 
County by police and is being treated at a hospital in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, a confrontation occurred after two men entered the home 
of Nectali G. Bravo, 43, in the 2000 block of South Artesia Street. During the 
confrontation, Bravo was shot to death. His son, who was not identified, 
grabbed a rifle and shot at the assailants more than 10 times as they fled in a 
car, Petko said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle used by the men was later found abandoned two blocks away with 
bullet holes in the windshield and passenger window and blood splattered 
throughout the interior, Petko said.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they saw one of the two men leave the vehicle at Pacific and 
Edinger avenues and jump into a brown vehicle that sped away, Petko said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a family spokesman said the Bravo family was too upset to comment 
on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, however, praised the 13-year-old for his actions. No charges are being 
sought against him because he was defending his father, Petko said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I understand, the boy put up quite a fight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not name the Orange County hospital where Barragan is being treated 
because they are still seeking his accomplice, Petko said. Barragan has refused 
to tell police his address. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do know that he was undergoing surgery," Petko said. "They said he was 
wounded in the mouth and that his face is a mess. He also has possible eye 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, neighbors in the quiet community where Bravo lived expressed 
surprise that gunmen would attempt to rob someone in their community and in the 
middle of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor, Norman Mitchell, 71, a retired Tustin Unified School District 
audio technician, said he heard what sounded like machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was such a beautiful day and it was 12 o'clock that I didn't bother to 
call 911," Mitchell said. "The guns went off so fast and lasted so long, I 
thought it was someone working with a jack hammer, and if I had called police 
they might have thought that I was crazy or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he looked outside an hour later and saw police cars and was told 
not to go near the Bravo home because a shooting had just occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Rolando Espinoza, 52, said the gunfire was so loud and 
intense that"I thought I was back in 'Nam." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is weird, because if you ask me, (the gunmen) probably figured that 
nobody was home at that hour, that people are usually working and that the kids 
are in school," Espinoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Bravo was a quiet man with a large family. They often would see 
him outside watering his lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always watering his grass," Espinoza said. "On our walks around the 
neighborhood he would always wave at us. He was a nice guy."

COWBOYS BELIEVE IN JASON; PRO FOOTBALL: RESERVE GARRETT KEYS 36-POINT SECOND 
HALF IN 42-31 VICTORY OVER PACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The weary and injured Dallas Cowboys snickered this week when Coach Barry 
Switzer said they would win on Thanksgiving because he believed in Peter Pan, 
Tinker Bell and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, the eyes of 53 grown men were like saucers, their voices filled 
with wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach said he believed in fairy tales," Nate Newton said. "Well, we just 
dropped one on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Footballs fell from the sky. Tiny men scampered across large expanses of 
green. Outlandish wishes were granted. 
</P>
<P>
 And a former Ivy League quarterback led the Cowboys to their biggest second 
half in history during a wild 42-31 victory over the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what this was?" asked Michael Irvin, his smile even brighter than 
his necklaces. "This was beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 More specifically, this was a third-string quarterback named Jason Garrett, 
making his second start in six professional seasons, leading the Cowboys to a 
36-point second half and helping them overcome a 17-3 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 This was running back Emmitt Smith nearly outgaining the Packers by himself, 
totaling 228 yards, including 68 on a screen pass. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Brett Favre and Sterling Sharpe connecting on four touchdown passes 
for the Packers, all for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had told me before the game that we would get 31 points and not turn 
the ball over, I would have to believe that we would win the game," said a 
stunned Favre. "Even against the Dallas Cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
 And this was, of course, Switzer saying that he predicted it from the moment 
he turned on his TV set Thanksgiving morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess what show was on," Switzer said, his voice rising. " 'Rudy'! 'Rudy'! 
'Rudy!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not once in the last two years has a bit player succeeded in football without 
somebody mentioning that movie about the former Notre Dame walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
 But the title fits Garrett as well as anybody. Before Monday, the Princeton 
graduate had spent most of the season on the scout team, and most of his career 
in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Undrafted out of college, a veteran of the World League and Canadian Football 
League, Garrett was known mostly for his shocking red hair and the absence of 
an NFL touchdown pass on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 He was only starting because in a span of a couple of hours last Sunday, 
starter Troy Aikman suffered a knee injury and backup Rodney Peete a thumb 
injury.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked where he was going after passing for 311 yards and two touchdowns 
against the league's fifth-ranked defense, Garrett did not say Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going back to the scout team, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a guy who says he slept through a fire alarm that emptied much of the 
team's hotel at 6:30 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it sounded everywhere but my room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a guy whose first downfield pass Thursday was a perfect completion . . 
. . to Packer cornerback Terrell Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the first half reached its final minute, the Packers were leading, 
17-3, and Garrett had completed five of 16 passes for 54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of Texas Stadium fans hoping to see another Clint Longley, a Cowboy 
Thanksgiving hero of 20 years ago, Garrett was doing a better imitation of Luc 
Longely. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the first of several strange events occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Zampese, the Cowboys' offensive coordinator, left the press box for the 
field, thinking the offense would run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the play calling for the final 30 seconds to Switzer, who thought 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said hell no, let's throw it deep and see if some of our big guys can 
rebound it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the game, Garrett tossed up jump balls like he was an NBA 
referee.  
</P>
<P>
 After 59 yards worth of passes to receivers Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper, 
the Cowboys got a last-second, 37-yard field goal by Chris Boniol to cut their 
deficit to 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys charged out of the locker room after halftime and scored 
touchdowns on their next five possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Williams' 87-yard kickoff return set up the first score. Garrett's 
45-yard pass to wide-open Harper accounted for the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to hear a funny story?" Garrett asked. "This week my wife, who was 
cooking our turkey dinner, said, 'I don't give you football advice much, but 
when you are out there, throw the ball high to Alvin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-three yards of penalties by the frustrated Packers set up the third 
score. Smith's long screen pass led them to the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, they led, 32-24, and needed only Garrett's soaring 35-yard touchdown 
pass to Irvin on their next possession to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense survived its only important test during that time, sacking Favre 
once and forcing two other incompletions when the Packers were attempting to 
drive while still trailing by only eight points late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember when we've played with such incredible intensity for 30 
minutes," said defensive end Jim Jeffcoat. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time they scored this many points in a game was in Super Bowl XXVII 
in Pasadena, when they scored 55 against the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Unreal? 
</P>
<P>
 Long after Switzer had finished waxing about his 10-2 team, long after the 6-6 
Packers had checked their easy final-month schedule in search of some hope, 
somebody phoned one of the movie networks. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, "Rudy" was showing Thursday, 8 a.m. in Dallas. You could look it up.

 The New Jersey Devils, a box-office disappointment despite being one of the 
NHL's top teams, have received an offer to move to Orlando, Fla., the New York

 "Someone called me, I'd say a little over a month ago, and wondered if we were 
interested in moving," McMullen said. "I haven't had any further discussions 
with them, and I don't think anyone else from the Devils has talked to 
Orlando."

 Pete Sampras talking to Pat O'Brien in Inside Sports magazine about his bland 
image: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just not controversial. They (fans) want me to be someone that I'm not -- 
yelling at an umpire, throwing a racket. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want me to do something that's worth writing about. Well, maybe I'm not 
the boring one. Maybe it's the people who are writing who are boring."

 Trivia time: When was the last time that USC beat UCLA and Notre Dame in 
football in the same season? 
</P>
<P>
 Jurassic Park II: Joe Tofflemire, Seattle Seahawk center, tripped on the 
stairs entering his garage recently and chipped a bone in his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 While on all fours -- and cursing -- Tofflemire's son came in and asked, 
"Daddy, are you playing dinosaur?" 
</P>
<P>
 Quack, quack: Joe Namath guaranteed a victory for his underdog New York Jets 
over the Baltimore Colts in the 1969 Super Bowl -- and he delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Oregon Coach Rich Brooks is making a similar prediction, saying the Ducks 
will "stun the college football world" by beating heavily favored Penn State in 
the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Namath backed up his boast on the field; Brooks has to rely on his headset 
from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Court comedian: Eddie Sefko in the Houston Chronicle: "The Rockets already 
have had rookie referee Tom Donaghy twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donaghy is getting a reputation around the league because he's a Jerry 
Seinfeld look-alike, especially when he opens his mouth to make a call, which 
is often." 
</P>
<P>
 Late fame: Robert Parish of the Charlotte Hornets, assessing his career when 
he played for the Boston Celtics: 
</P>
<P>
 "For my first 11 years in Boston I was never considered a great center. We won 
championships. I was an All-Star, but I wasn't any good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, in the last three years, all of a sudden I was a Hall of Famer. Go 
figure." 
</P>
<P>
 Collector's item?The Chicago White Sox mailed out four 1994 World Series 
tickets to each season ticket-holder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to remind them of what might have been," promotions director Rob 
Gallas said. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers caught 16 passes against the Rams 
last Sunday night, the third highest total in a single game in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
 The record? Tom Fears of the Rams caught 18 passes on Dec. 3, 1950, against 
the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1980 Roberto Duran, saying "No mas, no mas," quit 
with 16 seconds to go in the eighth round in New Orleans, allowing Sugar Ray 
Leonard to regain the WBC welterweight title.

 Trivia answer: In 1981, USC beat UCLA, 22-21, at the Coliseum and Notre Dame, 
14-7, at South Bend, Ind.

<P>
 Bud Greenspan has put together another Olympic masterpiece, "Lillehammer '94: 
16 Days of Glory," in which stories from last February's Winter Olympics are 
told as only Greenspan can. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the show's two parts, highlighted by Dan Jansen's quest for an 
Olympic medal in speedskating, will have its premiere on the Disney Channel 
Sunday night at 9. 
</P>
<P>
 And you don't have to be a Disney Channel subscriber to get it. This weekend 
is part of the Disney Channel's free holiday preview in which the channel is 
made available to all cable viewers on systems that offer it. 
</P>
<P>
 The second part of Greenspan's three-hour epic will be shown on the Disney 
Channel on Feb. 12, the first anniversary of the opening of the Lillehammer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Jansen story has been well chronicled but never quite like this. The 
footage gathered by Greenspan's crew, the writing, and the people in the 
segment, such as Jansen's animated wife, his baby daughter and Jansen himself 
make this segment special. 
</P>
<P>
 This story was a tear-jerker for those who saw it as it happened, and it is 
even more emotional the way Greenspan tells it. So have the tissue handy. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts of the story are that Jansen finished fourth and 16th in the 
500-meter and 1,000-meter races at the 1984 Winter Olympics, he fell in both 
races in 1988 following the death of his sister Jane from leukemia, and he 
finished fourth and 26th at Albertville, France, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lillehammer, in the 500, his best event, he slipped and finished eighth. 
After that, he was ready to go home, thinking he didn't have a chance at a 
medal in the 1,000, his weakest event. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the shock of the family, he won the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 On the victory stand, he offered a salute to his late sister and later skated 
a victory lap carrying his daughter Jane, named after his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another outstanding segment in part one of Greenspan's documentary is about 
Oksana Baiul and her narrow victory over Nancy Kerrigan in the women's figure 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tonya Harding-Kerrigan saga barely gets a mention. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan leaves those kind of stories for tabloid shows such as "Hard Copy." 
He accentuates the positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan also tells the stories of cross-country skiers Manuela Di Centa of 
Italy and Lyubov Egorova of Russia and of ski jumpers Espen Bredesen of Norway 
and Jens Weissflog of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a downside to Greenspan's film, it is these segments. Tighter 
editing would have helped. There is simply too much footage of cross-country 
skiing and ski jumping. Ski jumping is a very picturesque event, but after a 
while it gets a little old. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, this is another excellent Greenspan production. The 
storytelling formula that has worked so well for Greenspan over the years once 
again works. 
</P>

 Another alternative to football this weekend is the Skins Game, one of the 
most popular golf events on television. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC will carry this year's Skins Game at Bighorn Golf Club in Palm Desert 
Saturday at 12:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3:30 p.m. Both telecasts will be 
tape-delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's Skins Game produced the largest Saturday rating ever for a golf 
event (6.4), beating the 6.3 Saturday rating for the 1991 Skins Game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 Skins Game was the highest-rated golf telecast of the year (7.0), and 
in six other years, including last year, the Skins Game has outdrawn every 
major tournament except The Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne Stewart, who last year won $100,000 with a 15-foot putt on hole No. 13 
and $120,000 with a 20-footer on No. 16, won the title with a total $280,000. 
He edged Fred Couples, who won $260,000. Paul Azinger and Arnold Palmer were 
shut out. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after last year's Skins Game at Bighorn, Azinger was diagnosed with 
lymphoma in his right shoulder. He underwent chemotherapy and radiation, 
returned to competitive golf in August and is back for this year's Skins Game, 
joining Stewart, Couples and Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Vin Scully, who has worked all but one Skins Game since the event began in 
1983, is back to anchor the telecasts. He missed in 1989, when the Skins Game 
first went from NBC to ABC. Scully was still under contract to NBC then. 
</P>
<P>
 Scully will be joined this weekend by ABC commentators Peter Jacobsen and Mark 
Rolfing. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is produced by Ohlmeyer Communications in association with Trans 
World International. The event was created by Don Ohlmeyer, now the West Coast 
president at NBC, and Barry Frank, TWI senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To promote the Skins Game, Scully, Couples and Watson did a conference call 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Couples: "I don't watch much golf, but the Skins Game is a lot of fun to 
watch. I've always had the feeling if I didn't watch I'd miss something." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Scully: "Skins is something every golfer has played. Even a double-digit 
handicap left-handed hacker like me plays it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Greg Norman's proposed World Tour, which is being backed by Fox, 
both Couples and Watson indicated it could be a good thing if a compromise is 
reached with the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not dead yet: Watson was asked about a letter he wrote to CBS golf producer 
Frank Chirkinian criticizing commentator Gary McCord for his "bikini wax" 
comment and others during last April's Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, also sent to Masters officials, may have played a role in the 
removal of McCord from future Masters telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was a dead issue," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed further, Watson said, "My only regret is that Frank decided to make a 
personal letter public." TV-Radio Notes

BILLS' PLAYOFF HOPES FADE WITH LOSS TO LIONS; PRO FOOTBALL: KRIEG'S THREE 
TOUCHDOWN PASSES KEEP DETROIT'S HOPES ALIVE IN 35-21 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jim Kelly was supposed to breathe new life into the Buffalo Bills. Instead, 
Dave Krieg and the Detroit Lions left the Bills gasping. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg passed for 351 yards and three touchdowns and the Lions' defense 
harassed Kelly with three sacks and two interceptions in a 35-21 victory 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss left the Bills (6-6) at .500 deeper into the season than at any time 
since 1987, the last time they failed to qualify for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hurts a lot," Kelly said. "Right now, I'm blaming myself because I'm 
supposed to be the one that can take this team down the field, and I didn't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a situation the Bills clearly aren't used to. Usually at this point in 
the season, the Bills, who have played in the last four Super Bowls, are 
concerned mainly with wrapping up home-field advantage for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills might still qualify for the AFC playoffs as a wild-card team, but 
their chances of catching the Miami Dolphins and winning the AFC East now seem 
remote. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is not going to lay down, despite what happened today," Bill Coach 
Marv Levy said. "We still have four games to play. Let's play the four games 
and then talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (6-6), who remain alive for a wild-card spot in the NFC playoffs, 
needed only two plays on two of their four touchdown drives. Kelvin Pritchett, 
who had only two sacks all season, recorded all three hits on Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defensively, we took a few more chances in this ballgame," Lion Coach Wayne 
Fontes said. "We sat down and talked about it all week. We couldn't be as 
passive as we have been. We had to put pressure up front, especially on Kelly, 
a quarterback who can get a hot hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our game plan was to really mix it up with the coverages." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly completed 29 of 35 passes for 273 yards, including a 20-yard touchdown 
pass to Russell Copeland and a 27-yard scoring pass to Pete Metzelaars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plays that hurt the Bills most were two fourth-quarter interceptions 
by Detroit safety Willie Clay, one of which he returned 28 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first interception, Krieg completed six consecutive passes for 93 
yards, including a 12-yard touchdown pass to Brett Perriman that put the Lions 
ahead, 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills answered with a 73-yard, eight-play drive with Kelly scrambling in 
from 15 yards with 4:04 remaining to narrow the gap to seven points again. 
</P>
<P>
 On Buffalo's next possession, Clay stepped in front of Thurman Thomas, picked 
off an underthrown pass and ran untouched for the insurance touchdown.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; BLITZ IS THE KEY TO STEELER DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to aggressive blitzing, the Pittsburgh Steelers may be the best 
in the NFL. The Steelers have the league's fourth-best overall defense and 
their plus-7 turnover ratio is No. 3 in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they do is try to pressure you from all areas," said Coach Art Shell, 
whose team plays host to the Steelers on Sunday. "They like to bring people 
from everywhere. The only predictable thing about their defense is their 
unpredictability. They're not afraid to bring anybody at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Greene leads the AFC with 10 sacks, and the Steelers lead the league 
with 40. They have allowed the opposition only 13 touchdowns all season, which 
also is a league low. 
</P>
<P>
 During the exhibition season, Pittsburgh handed the Raiders their only loss 
without showing much of their defensive blitz package. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really didn't blitz much against us in that game," Shell said. "They 
came a few times, but most of those came when we had our young guys in there." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way you can beat their blitzes is to be prepared for them and to be 
ready for the people they like to bring." 
</P>
<P>
 Pro Bowl cornerback Rod Woodson is one player Pittsburgh likes to blitz from 
all over the field. Woodson is second on the team with 57 tackles, second with 
three interceptions, and first with 15 pass defenses, four blocked passes and 
three forced fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' Terry McDaniel continues to have an outstanding season. McDaniel 
leads the AFC with seven interceptions and is on pace to set a single-season 
best with 46 tackles, 18 pass defenses and three fumble recoveries. McDaniel 
also has scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not practicing Thursday were left tackle Gerald Perry because of flu and 
defensive tackle Nolan Harrison because of a hip injury he suffered in practice 
Wednesday. Both players are expected to play against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Lionel Washington (leg) also did not practice and is listed as 
questionable, while center Don Mosebar, who also is listed as questionable, did 
practice. LONNIE WHITE

 The Rams updated the injury status of cornerback Darryl Henley Thursday, 
listing him as questionable rather than out of Sunday's game with the Chargers 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, who injured a hip flexor, ran at practice, but did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson, who is listed as probable because of a thigh 
injury, also did not practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers added defensive tackle Shawn Lee to their injury report with a 
calf injury. Quarterback Stan Humphries, who is listed as questionable because 
of an elbow injury, practiced for the second day in a row, but reported more 
soreness. T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; COLTS' EMTMAN OUT FOR THE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indianapolis Colts defensive lineman Steve Emtman has a herniated disk in his 
neck and will sit out the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Marchibroda said Thursday that Emtman will have surgery in the next week 
to 10 days, but will not return this year.Spokesman Craig Kelley would not 
elaborate on when the injury occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third season-ending injury Emtman has suffered since the Colts made 
him the league's first pick out of Washington in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Emtman started the first nine games of 1992 before he tore ligaments in his 
left knee against Miami on Nov. 8 that year. He returned the next year and 
started five games before tearing ligaments in his right knee against Dallas on 
Oct. 10.

 Vashon Lenard scored 18 points and Jay Walton added 16 as Minnesota held off a 
late rally to upset fifth-ranked Arizona, 72-70, in the first round of the 
Great Alaska shootout in Anchorage, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (1-0) held a 72-65 lead with one minute 50 seconds remaining, but 
Damon Stoudamire hit a free throw and a short jumper, and Joseph Blair dunked 
an offensive rebound to cut it to 72-70 with 40 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats had a chance at the end, forcing the Golden Gophers into a missed 
shot and grabbing the rebound with six seconds left. But Stoudamire's 
three-pointer at the buzzer bounced off the side of the rim. Stoudamire and Ray 
Owes led Arizona (0-1) with 17 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 Villanova 75, Alaska Anchorage 58 -- Villanova had an 18-0 run in the 
first half and a 17-2 run in the second half against the Division II Seawolves 
to advance to the second round against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Eberz scored a career-high 23 points, Jason Lawson added 17 and Kerry 
Kittles 12. Everz, a junior forward, scored 17 of Villanova's 33 second-half 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (1-0), bigger and quicker than Alaska-Anchorage at every 
position, led, 44-37, early in the second half before going on a 17-2 run 
capped by three-pointers by Roscoe Harris and Eberz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just able to have a spurt, and we went with it," said Villanova coach 
Steve Lappas, who credited his defense with limiting the Seawolves' outside 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska Anchorage, ranked No. 7 in Division II, didn't connect on its first 
three-pointer until the final seven minutes and finished two for 12 behind the 
three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought their quickness was going to hurt us," said Seawolf Coach Charlie 
Bruns. "They were running out hard. We're just not used to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Kaiser led Alaska Anchorage with 21 and Dana Pope had 20 points and 
eight rebounds.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; A YEAR LATER, WIN FOR ECHO OF YESTERDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anybody who missed the 1993 On Trust Handicap at Hollywood Park was in luck 
Thursday. Echo Of Yesterday gave a repeat performance at Hollywood Park, 
winning the race restricted to California breds for the second consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, the 5-year-old Pirate's Bounty gelding equaled the stakes 
record he set last year (1:27 for the 7 1/2 furlongs) and remained unbeaten in 
four starts on the Hollywood Park main track. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserved off the pace by Chris McCarron, the 5-2 second choice took on 9-1 
shot Softshoe Sure Shot in the stretch and won by just over a length. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Mr. and Mrs. Marty Wygod and trained by Ron Ellis, Echo Of Yesterday 
beat His Legacy by two lengths last year and now has 10 victories in 16 
lifetime starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most honest horses I've ever ridden," McCarron said. "He's 
got talent and he's got a big heart. Every time he runs, you're going to have 
to beat him because he's going to lay his body down for you. He did today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Softshoe Sure Shot is not an easy horse to get by, but we got by him today." 
</P>
<P>
 Echo Of Yesterday is also a favorite of Ellis, who continues to be one of the 
highest percentage trainers on the local circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty (Wygod) was kidding me last year that I was too sentimental about this 
horse, always wanting to lay him up," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now I told him, he's right, I am a little sentimental about this horse. 
He's just a hard knocker who gives it his best every time. He's just a tiger 
and he fights it out every time."

be able to ride today after being thrown from Ataboy Chad in the ninth race on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unplaced with favored Preferred Road in the fourth and Snow Major in the 
sixth, Valenzuela suffered a deep bruise on his right leg just above the knee 
after being unseated at the start.

 Randy Romero, who retired July 4 and has been working horses at Hollywood Park 
preparing for a comeback, was named to ride Dangerous Scenario for trainer Bob 
Hess in the $250,000 Generous Stakes on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, 36, is staying with Jeff and Linda Lukas in Glendora and his wife, 
Cricket, and son, Randy, are expected to join him here soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to retire," said Romero, who had worked as a bloodstock agent 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I did it is because my knee was bothering me. I had an operation 
on (his right knee) in December and I rushed it coming back. It was my fault 
and when I got ready to ride it started bothering me more and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I could make myself have another operation was to quit, so I did 
that. I got my knee cleaned up with arthroscopic surgery by a doctor from the 
University of Kentucky and I worked out with (the basketball team) there. It 
was really fun and I decided I wanted to go back (to riding). I told my wife, 
'I want to go back and I want to go to California.' She said, 'Go for it,' so 
here I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero has won three Breeders' Cup races and is the regular rider for the 
undefeated Personal Ensign. His agent will be Nick Cosato, who has formerly 
worked with Pat Valenzuela and Corey Black, among others. Horse Racing Notes

 Bertrando, who tired after setting the pace in the Breeders' Cup Classic, will 
ship to New York tonight, arrive there at 9:30 a.m. Saturday, then run in the 
$250,000 NYRA Mile later that day at Aqueduct. "He'll literally get off the 
plane and onto the track," said co-owner and breeder Ed Nahem. The NYRA Mile, 
which will be simulcast between the first and second races at Hollywood Park, 
will be the last start for Bertrando before he returns to stud. . . . There 
will also be a special 4 p.m. post today and there will be 13 live races, six 
of them maiden races. . . . Strodes Creek, who hasn't run since finishing third 
in the Belmont Stakes, worked a mile in 1:38 3/5 Wednesday morning. Also on the 
tab was Romarin, who will take on Slew of Damascus in the Hollywood Mile on 
Sunday. He went five furlongs in 1:02 2/5. . . . A field of 11 fillies and 
mares is probable for Sunday's $400,000 Matriarch at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. 
The probables are Aube Indienne, La Frontera, Las Meninas, Skimble, Zoonaqua, 
Alywow, Exchange, Fondly Remembered, Eternal Reve, Wandesta and Corrazona.

 Notre Dame linebacker Justin Goheen, once considered a candidate for the 
Butkus Award, is out of Saturday's USC game because of a shoulder injury, 
incurred two weekends ago against Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Jeremy Akers (shoulder) and Mark Zataveski (neck) are out of Saturday's 
game.Defensive end Renaldo Wynn (turf toe) and cornerback Tracy Graham (neck) 
are listed as questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said cornerbacks LaRon Moore and Shawn Wooden were 
injured in Monday's practice and their status for USC was also questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irish senior running back Lee Becton, who scored on a 70-yard run on the 
second play of the game in Notre Dame's 31-13 victory over USC last year, ended 
that season with six consecutive 100-yard games.  
</P>
<P>
 But the 113 yards he had against Air Force last week was his first 100-yard 
game of this season. His off-year is attributed both to a stubborn groin injury 
and a constantly changing Notre Dame offensive line. If he gains 73 yards 
against the Trojans, he'll become Notre Dame's No. 10 career rusher. 
</P>
<P>
 Against USC last year at South Bend, he had 178 yards in 20 carries, his 
career high. EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL; TEXAS ENDS SEASON ON HIGH NOTE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas ended a season of injuries, player suspensions and head-scratching 
losses with its best game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 James Brown passed for a school-record five touchdowns, two to Eric Jackson, 
as the Longhorns used big plays to defeat Baylor, 63-35, on Thursday at Waco, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of win that shows we deserve to go to a bowl game," 
linebacker Norman Watkins said. "It shows how strong we are, to go through all 
of the controversies this season and finish the year with our best game." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas (7-4, 4-3 Southwest Conference) will play in the Sun Bowl in El Paso on 
Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor (7-4, 4-3) had Cotton Bowl hopes heading into the game, but is likely 
headed to the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio on Dec. 31. The Longhorn victory also 
means that Texas Tech will be the Southwest Conference representative in the 
Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a redshirt freshman, completed 18 of 25 passes for 289 yards without an 
interception and also ran seven times for 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas' offensive output was its best under third-year Coach John Mackovic, who 
resumed calling the plays after loses to Rice, Texas Tech and Texas A&M had 
fans calling for his job. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia 13, Syracuse 0 -- Reserve tailback Jimmy Gary gained a 
career-high 119 yards and the Mountaineers' defense shut out Syracuse (7-4, 4-3 
Big East) for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
 The resurgent Mountaineers (7-5, 4-3), playing at home, won for the sixth time 
in seven games to remain in contention for the Carquest and Independence bowls.

<P>
 In its second year, Aliso Niguel is considered a dark horse to win the league 
title. Mitchelson anchors the Wolverines and is considered the top player in 
the league and one of the most talented in the Southern Section. She averaged 
14.6 points and 12.9 rebounds as a freshman and is already attracting attention 
from college recruiters. Christensen said she is a physical player, who also is 
a strong rebounder. Joining Mitchelson in the post will be Hyman, who will help 
the Wolverines rebound better. Mika returns as a starter in the much-improved 
backcourt alongside Wallbrink and Ross. Franke was the school's homecoming 
queen last year and has quit playing soccer to concentrate on basketball, which 
she played in England. Christensen thinks a realistic goal for the young team 
would be to finish third in league and get some playoff experience. If 
Mitchelson continues to improve, Aliso Niguel might not have to wait too long 
to win a league championship. SCHEDULE

 Young, athletic and quick is the best way to describe Laguna Hills this 
season. Last season, the Hawks finished fourth, but they could be primed for a 
shot at making the playoffs. Costa Mesa, University, Estancia and maybe Aliso 
Niguel also will challenge for playoff spots. Taylor calls this season a 
crossroads for the program, and if his team can compete against the top three, 
he would consider it a successful season. With leading rebounders Haneef and 
Treinen returning at the post positions, Laguna Hills should dominate the 
boards. Inoue returns to direct the offense, which lacks scoring punch, 
especially from the outside. Taylor is hoping Inoue and Haneef will pick up the 
offensive load with McBride adding some perimeter scoring ability. Taylor is 
optimistic the Hawks will improve over last season. It figures to take a leap 
of confidence to push Laguna Hills into the category of playoff contender, 
however. SCHEDULE

 Like the rest of the teams in the league, Laguna Beach is young and 
inexperienced with only one senior. Only time will tell how good the Artists, 
who finished sixth last season, could be. The Artists have a young crop of 
three juniors and six sophomores that give them hope. Chambers, the lone 
returning starter, Chaffee and Olney each averaged four points. But the trio 
will have to bump that average up if Laguna Beach is to improve on its 0-10 
league finish. Defense, speed and athleticism are the Artists' strong points, 
but they lack a consistent scorer and sorely need some height to match up with 
the rest of the league's centers. Containing players like Mitchelson and Haneef 
will be a difficult task for Boyce and the rest of the Artist interior defense. 
Laguna Beach plays host to a tournament before league play begins and that 
should give Olney a good look at his squad's abilities. Olney hopes to have a 
winning season and reach the playoffs for the first time in his five-year 
tenure. SCHEDULE

 After winning three consecutive league titles, the Mustangs are in for a 
rebuilding year from top to bottom. Whitacre left Villa Park a month ago to 
coach Costa Mesa. At Villa Park he guided the Spartans to consecutive league 
titles and a 21-4 record last season. Both were firsts for the school. He 
inherits a team with three returning starters. Koo is a quality player with 
limitless shooting range and speed. She won't have to handle the point guard 
duties this season, which will leave her free to shoot from the perimeter. 
Brown, an honorable mention selection last year, will direct the offense and be 
the go-to player down the stretch. Lurmann takes over for Heather Robinson, now 
at Miami, and brings good offensive moves to the post. Arellano returns after 
sitting out her sophomore season and is another outside threat. Anderson will 
probably be the fifth starter, but Howse has been the biggest surprise.

 University moves to the Pacific Coast League and gets the nod as preseason 
league favorite, along with Costa Mesa, based on its depth and scoring ability. 
University will play at least 10 players and Bernal says the team could be the 
best in the school's history. The Trojans have a nice balance of experienced 
seniors in Loud and Snavely and an incoming trio of freshmen Bernal thinks are 
among the best in the county. Loud was named to the first-team All-Sea View 
League as a junior, averaging 8.4 points and a little more than 10 rebounds. 
Snavely received honorable mention and averaged 8.6 points. Lawrence is a 
transfer from San Clemente and Day transferred from Villa Park. The Trojans 
will have to depend on speed to make up for the fact that they have no player 
taller than 5 feet 11. A league title and an extra long stay in postseason play 
are legitimate goals. SCHEDULE

champions, edged the competition in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division I race also features El Toro and seniors Courtney Pugmire of 
Esperanza, Nancy Dollar of San Clemente and Santa Ana Valley's Eliaser Estrada

TAKING THE WRAPS OFF A HOT PRODUCT; GIFT-GIVING: THE BASKET BUSINESS GENERATES 
ABOUT $700 MILLION IN ANNUAL SALES. THE KEY IS TO CUSTOMIZE THE PRODUCT TO FIT 
THE CORPORATE CLIENT'S TASTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nellie Carlen is always looking for an edge that will turn a corporate gift 
into something special. And, increasingly, she said, customized gift baskets 
provide that extra something. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a client likes golf, I'll make that the theme for the basket," said 
Carlen, who buys hundreds of corporate gifts each year for ISS Building 
Maintenance Inc., a Santa Ana-based janitorial firm. "I might add golf club 
covers, chocolate golf balls, a mug with a golf design and a nice golf shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of putting gifts into a basket is as old as legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows what Little Red Riding Hood took along when she visited 
Grandma," said Wally August, co-owner of FanciFull, a gift store on Melrose 
Avenue in Los Angeles. "What's different now is how we package the gifts and 
what we put inside. The stereotype used to be booze in a basket or fruit tied 
up in a bow." 
</P>
<P>
 FanciFull, which caters largely to corporate clients in Hollywood, recently 
forwarded a six-foot coffin stuffed with gourmet goodies to the set of 
"Interview With the Vampire." A few years ago it sent violin cases stuffed with 
edibles to a crew working on "Godfather III." 
</P>
<P>
 Magazines aimed at entrepreneurs have targeted gift baskets as "one of the 
hottest businesses to launch in the 1990s," according to Liz Skelton, editor of 
Gift Basket Review, a trade magazine in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard sales data is difficult to gather because the industry includes thousands 
of mom and pop operators. But Gift Basket Review estimates nationwide annual 
sales of about $700 million. Holiday orders accounted for more than half of 
annual sales for a third of respondents to a recent Gift Basket Review survey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine said corporate gift orders are the top sales growth category for 
the basket industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate gift-givers prefer baskets because they're "safe gifts," said Howard 
Gorman, a Tustin-based gourmet confections broker who sells products to basket 
packagers. "You don't have to know someone's shoe size . . . and you usually 
can't go wrong with candy, wines, coffees and confections." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Foster, owner of San Francisco-based Gifts A La Carte, caters almost 
exclusively to corporate clients. Though Foster wants to tempt taste buds with 
unique pastries, wines and candies, she takes care not to stray too far from 
the center and risk alienating gift recipients. "We have to exercise caution," 
Foster said. "We don't include unusual dressings, mustards or oils because 
that's not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 "We always ask our customers what (the recipient) likes and doesn't like," 
said Keri Dugan, owner of The Basket Case Inc., a Newport Beach gift shop. "We 
ask what he or she is like so we can make something special for them. A lot of 
times, we're so much more appropriate than flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Packagers agree that safe doesn't have to mean boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some (baskets) are like those recyclable fruitcakes that make three or four 
stops before getting to their final resting place," joked Warren Daniels, 
executive vice president of Gourmet Gifts International, an Irvine-based 
company that supplies baskets to department and warehouse stores. "They get 
handed from one person to another, and another and another before anyone even 
takes the wrapping off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Packagers turn to creative designs to ensure that gifts stop at their intended 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Gourmet Gifts' Cajun Cooking basket includes Creole seasonings, rice, beans 
and other fixings bundled up in a skillet. A Chinese dinner basket, complete 
with oil, skewers, chopsticks, recipes and fortune cookies, is packaged in a 
two-piece wok. 
</P>
<P>
 Hefty woks, skillets, running shoes, customized canvas bags and wicker picnic 
baskets provide more than just visual appeal and a utilitarian bent. "Gift 
baskets are a big impulse buy for consumers, and they usually equate (weight) 
with better value," said Bill Engel, a Los Angeles-based buyer with the 
Broadway, which has assembled its largest selection of gift baskets for the 
upcoming holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Basket packagers argue that gift baskets are more attractive than flowers, 
their major competitor. "Gift baskets also tend to be more personal," Daniels 
said. "We can offer a themed basket that appeals to just about anyone's tastes. 
And when the goodies are gone, you still have a skillet, a birdhouse or a wok." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gift baskets are getting bigger and bigger each year," said Tim Dean, 
president of Houdini Inc., a Fullerton-based basket packager that specializes 
in wine and gourmet foods. "People keep buying them because they're a nice 
gift. If you know someone likes coffee, you can easily personalize (a basket). 
It's an easy gift."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: SOME THINGS TO BE THANKFUL FOR AT HOLIDAY TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The holidays are a brutally depressing time for entertainment business 
columnists. 
</P>
<P>
 All the movers and shakers temporarily move to places like Vail, Aspen and 
Maui and even their functionaries seem to run out of functions. Certainly 
business is happening somewhere -- on a snowy slope or at some exotic beach 
resort. But for a short and troubling time there's the feeling of dislocation 
that comes from being "here" when everyone else is "there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thanksgiving weekend marks the start of that period, which explains the 
full and complete absence of news in today's column. This space could have been 
filled with a timeless feature on the holiday box office or problems at Sony 
Pictures. But why take the easy way out? Instead, here's a list of the 10 
things to be most thankful for this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 That you're not Michael P. Schulhof: It's hard to imagine any executive in the 
recent annals of show business who's had a worse year. Long-running criticism 
of Sony Pictures, which is under Schulhof's auspices, climaxed last week with 
the news that Sony Corp. had taken a $3.2-billion financial hit on the studio. 
Earlier, Schulhof presided over the messy and expensive resignation of Sony 
Pictures Chairman Peter Guber. And even when he did something that reflected 
some savvy -- such as hiring former CBS executive Jeff Sagansky as his second 
in command -- Schulhof managed to do so in a manner that alienated many of his 
senior executives. 
</P>
<P>
 That Anne Rice was wrong, then right: The hugely popular horror novelist 
stunned Hollywood with her charge that Tom Cruise had been horrifically miscast 
in the leading role of "Interview With the Vampire." Then she shocked Hollywood 
again with an equally strong mea culpa after seeing the finished film. Good 
thing. Hollywood relies on the success of glossy big-budget movies such as 
"Interview" as much as vampires rely on blood. The failure of "Interview" would 
have cut into the holiday box office and cast a pall over the entire industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Quentin Tarantino: Fresh and provocative works like "Pulp Fiction" and his 
earlier "Reservoir Dogs" inspire passionate discourse among filmgoers, which is 
also healthy for the industry. Although Tarantino's taste for violence turns 
some people off, it's his wicked humor that leaves the most lasting impression. 
With "Pulp Fiction" several weeks out of the box, you can still find people 
arguing its merits from office water coolers to college film classes. The 
soundtrack, propelled by trippy surf music, also has more life than most recent 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 That you're not Robert Morgado: Here's one of the industry's great ironies. 
Morgado spent much of his career as Warner Music Group chief trying to gain 
control over Warner Records, the industry gem that was independently managed by 
Mo Ostin. But Morgado's Machiavellian moves ultimately cost him dearly. The 
realignment at Warner set off an executive revolt, which resulted in Doug 
Morris' becoming domestic music czar. Morgado was left with international. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of the major TV networks: Written off as thoroughly as Nixon was 
after Watergate, they rebounded this year as the darlings of the media world, 
assuring plenty of interesting deal activity down the line. CBS and General 
Electric's NBC were subjects of intense takeover discussions, and Capital 
Cities/ABC enjoyed a banner year. The current wisdom is that cable viewership 
is too fragmented and broadcast networks make great assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Carrey: Like Tarantino and other true originals, he enlivens everything he 
touches and makes people want to go to the movies. Carrey was talented enough 
to mine humor out of a dog of a role like "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." Then 
"The Mask" proved the former stand-up comedian and TV performer a bona fide 
star. "Dumb and Dumber" should extend that streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Turner: In a world of image control and earnest executives, he can still 
be counted on to slip gloriously into his "Captain Outrageous" persona now and 
then. Turner's public pursuit of NBC and his broadsides at colleagues who 
rained on his parade (such as his "Up yours, Kay!" when USA Network's Kay 
Koplovitz questioned his strategy) make the media world a more interesting 
place. Turner's acquisitions of New Line Cinema and Castle Rock Entertainment 
also made him a significant Hollywood player. Partners Time Warner and 
TeleCommunications Inc. may never give Turner his full freedom, but they will 
always know where he stands. 
</P>
<P>
 That you're not Martin Davis: Sure, he pocketed more than $50 million from the 
sale of Paramount Communications. But money isn't everything. Davis was trashed 
for his custodianship of Paramount, saw his friendly merger deal with Viacom 
Inc. torn apart and never overcame a public reputation for mean-spiritedness. 
On top of all that, he had to watch his successors receive all the credit for 
"Forrest Gump." The $300-million box office phenomenon got the go-ahead on his 
watch. Davis was last seen starting an investment company called Wellspring 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dream Team: Whether you consider them the Second Coming or a second 
helping of hype, the Jeffrey Katzenberg-Steven Spielberg-David Geffen union 
dramatically changes the Hollywood dynamic by mere virtue of their combined 
power. And now comes the fun part: watching what they do with all that power. 
Word is that the three executives will soon unveil an actual name and a logo 
for their studio. They are also said to be in advanced negotiations to take 
over space in Playa del Rey. In the meantime, look for the first of their deals 
to begin surfacing. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection of Hollywood and Technology: At the entrance to the 
superhighway stands the deal, which has made for some truly awkward and 
entertaining pairings this year. Early stories about Armani-suited Hollywood 
agents courting sandaled Silicon Valley techno-nerds have given way to more 
substantive news -- such as Creative Artists Agency's alliance with three Baby 
Bells, after the Bell Atlantic-TCI merger plan fell through. As the Information 
Age unfolds, the pressure on companies to be well positioned will only 
intensify. That means many more mating dances to come, producing good marriages 
as well as matches made in hell.

SEGA TROTS OUT INFOMERCIAL TO PITCH NEW GAME ADAPTER; MARKETING: THE HALF-HOUR 
COMMERCIAL IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND. IT MAY TEST THE FCC'S RULES ON ADS AIMED 
AT CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sega of America brings zap 'em to the slice 'em and dice 'em realm of 
infomercials today with a half-hour pitch for its new video game adapter. It is 
the first time a toy manufacturer has aimed a lengthy commercial at kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The infomercial is part of Sega's $60-million pre-Christmas marketing blitz 
for the $150 adapter and a collection of new video games for its Genesis 
system. It begins airing on CNBC today and on cable and broadcast stations in 
the nation's 20 largest TV markets over the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Infomercials for toys are rare because federal rules limit the content and 
timing of commercials directed at children. But Sega and its agency, Fraser & 
Associates Advertising of Los Angeles, say the infomercial complies with 
Federal Communications Commission restrictions. They say it targets teen-agers, 
not younger children, and airs at times when youngsters don't typically watch 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Those steps aren't likely to satisfy consumer activists who believe children 
are likely to see the infomercial anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's on is beside the point, unless it's on at midnight," said Peggy 
Charren, founder of Boston-based Action for Children's Television. "We all know 
every 10-year-old would give their left arm to have a Sega set. Of course this 
appeals to children." 
</P>
<P>
 William White Jr., Sega marketing vice president, said the company chose an 
infomercial to plug the 32X adapter because there is confusion about the 
device. The adapter converts the 16-bit Genesis video game player into a more 
powerful 32-bit machine. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sega and its competitors have already announced plans to introduce 64-bit 
machines next fall that will eclipse the souped-up 32X Genesis game players in 
speed and graphic capability. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are asking, 'Should I buy anything, since new stuff is coming out next 
year?' That kind of confusion freezes sales," White said. "We're trying to tell 
people they can enjoy the next level of gaming now without having to wait for 
the next generation of machines." 
</P>
<P>
 Sega and its rivals are trying to create some holiday video game excitement at 
a time when the industry has little new to offer. Rather than upgrade its 
machines, for example, Nintendo of America is touting more sophisticated games 
for its 16-bit units. The company last month mailed 2.2 million owners of its 
Super Nintendo Entertainment System videocassettes featuring the new "Donkey 
Kong Country" game.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a year when improvements are incremental and there is nothing 
revolutionary," said John G. Taylor, an analyst with L. H. Alton & Co. in 
Portland, Ore. "The companies are trying to maintain interest when consumers 
can only look forward to the big improvements in performance next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sega believes its 32X machine eventually will catch on with teen-agers who 
can't afford -- or can't persuade their parents to buy -- the 64-bit machines, 
which are expected to initially cost upward of $250. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found that for the 12- to 17-year-old target market, the glass ceiling 
is $199," said Sega's White. "When you don't get below $200 for a teen-ager, 
you don't have a mass-market product." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sega 32X infomercial unfolds much like a TV soap opera. The cast of 
fictitious "Game Beat" learns that their TV show may be canceled and replaced 
by a hair-styling program. To keep themselves on the air, the intrepid "Game 
Beat" crew does a ground-breaking report on the Sega adapter and several of the 
new games. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a disclaimer noting that it is a paid advertisement appears at 
beginning and end, the infomercial has the pace of a television program. It is 
interrupted by six commercials, three for Sega products and three public 
service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
 The infomercial is set in Venice Beach, because it "typifies hip, cool and 
freedom, especially to people who live outside the West Coast," said Renee 
White Fraser, president of Fraser Associates. The "Game Beaters" -- three men 
and a woman, all in their 20s -- sport tattoos and body jewelry and live 
together in a loft. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The infomercial allows us to create a context that reflects the life of a 
consumer," Fraser said. "What 18-year-old boy wouldn't love to do that -- start 
his own show, write about the games? 
</P>
<P>
 "We can create a level of seduction you can't get in a 30-second commercial," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sega infomercial is atypical in that it doesn't ask viewers to buy 
anything. In that way, it avoids pitfalls experienced by Positive Response TV, 
a Sherman Oaks-based infomercial producer that pitched its own video game 
cartridge for the Nintendo system two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Michael Levy said the company was swamped with calls from children 
who did not have the credit card required to buy the game. Levy said Positive 
Response pulled the infomercial after three weeks and sold excess inventory to 
another company, losing more than $100,000 on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Sega is asking viewers to pick up the telephone, though. The infomercial 
encourages viewers to call an 800 number to vote on whether "Game Beat" should 
remain on the air. The telephone poll allows Sega to learn the identities of 
callers, who will later be surveyed to see if they have purchased a 32X. 
</P>
<P>
 Sega isn't the only company to plug a toy in an infomercial this holiday 
season. Mattel is running an infomercial pitching collector Barbie dolls based 
on characters from "Gone With the Wind" for $225 each. A Mattel spokeswoman 
said the infomercial is aimed at adults and doesn't air when children are 
expected to tune in. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising executive Fraser said Sega is also scheduling its infomercial 
outside the so-called "children's hours," traditionally from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. 
and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, and on Saturday mornings. But Sega is 
clearly targeting a younger audience than Mattel, although there is some 
disagreement on exactly who the Sega audience is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fraser said Sega is trying to reach young men between the ages of 15 and 24. 
Sega executive White, meanwhile, said the target audience is younger, between 
ages 12 and 17. The age of the target audience could be significant if the 
infomercial comes under review. The FCC considers children to be all those age 
12 and under. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's rules prohibit broadcasters from airing commercials for a toy 
during a program about the toy. For example, commercials for Power Rangers toys 
can't air during the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers program. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer activist Charren believes the Sega program violates federal rules. "I 
would expect that once it airs, there will be a challenge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 No broadcaster or cable station has refused to air the infomercial, said 
Fraser, an indication that stations believe it complies with government rules.

OFF THE TICKER: A 'CLASS' STRUGGLE OF THE HOLIDAY SORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you thought your overstuffed mailbox was on the verge of bursting, 
along come predictions of more junk mail this holiday season. In fact, some say 
it may even hit a record. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economy on the rebound, consumers strapped for shopping time and 
third-class mail rates expected to rise in January, 'tis the season for 
direct-mail advertisers to do their thing, according to members of the Direct 
Marketing Assn., based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, unlike last, the Postal Service is promising that it will 
deliver catalogues and bills on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Americans who shop at home, either by mail or by telephone, 
increased 77% between 1983 and 1992, the trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catalogues accounted for $53.4 billion in sales in 1993, and their sales have 
increased an average of nearly 7% a year since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing association predicts that revenue from catalogue sales should 
grow by 6.8% annually, on average, to $69.5 billion by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service delivered 65.8 billion pieces of mail advertising in 1993, 
up from 62.6 billion the year before and 40.7 billion in 1983, trade group 
figures show. A large percentage of that is mailed in the fall and early winter 
for holiday shoppers.

 The evidence is growing that GenCorp Inc. plans to rid itself of Aerojet, its 
respected but ailing division that makes military electronics in Azusa and 
rocket motors in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 GenCorp -- which also makes automotive parts, Penn tennis balls and specialty 
plastics and wall coverings -- said this summer that it was considering whether 
to keep Aerojet, place it in a joint venture or some other alliance, or sell 
the division. 
</P>
<P>
 GenCorp plans to decide by year's end. Executives had no comment on which 
option is preferred, spokeswoman Rosemary Younts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources said GenCorp's investment bankers have distributed 
information packages about Aerojet to prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's any secret that every major aerospace firm is at least 
taking a look at Aerojet," said one senior executive of a major defense 
contractor in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts believe GenCorp wants to sell Aerojet, which has been battered by 
federal spending cuts, even though Aerojet accounts for a third of the 
company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 GenCorp "would just as soon not be a part" of the aerospace business, said 
Harry S. Mortner, an analyst with the investment firm C.J. Lawrence in New 
York. "They obviously don't have the economies of scale. It's a rapidly 
consolidating industry, and they're not apt to be growing that business. So why 
bother in it?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aerojet, which employs 1,350 people in Azusa and 1,650 in Sacramento, has 
built complex motors for some of America's most famous missiles and rockets, 
including the Minuteman, Titan and Polaris. It is also making body panels for 
the next-generation jet fighter, the F-22, and developing derivatives of 
Russian rocket engines for sale in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerojet's electronic sensors have long been critical parts of U.S. 
surveillance satellites that monitor missile and spacecraft launchings around 
the world. It also makes instruments for the government's Earth-monitoring 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cold War over and defense and space programs waning, however, Aerojet 
is taking a beating. Aerojet eliminated 1,250 jobs during the past year, but 
the division's sales and operating profits continued to sink, dragging down 
GenCorp's overall results. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that leads analysts to believe that GenCorp's new president and chief 
executive, John B. Yasinsky, wants to dump Aerojet. 
</P>
<P>
 GenCorp took one step in that direction last spring, when it sold a major part 
of its munitions business -- which accounted for 23% of Aerojet's fiscal 1993 
sales -- to Olin Corp. for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they could sell it all for a decent price tomorrow, they would," said Mark 
B. Johnson, an analyst with the securities firm Roulston Research in Cleveland. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Their No. 1 scenario is to get out of Aerojet and focus the company on 
commercial opportunities," he said. "That's what John Yasinsky definitely wants 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Aerojet's performance turned south in 1992 and has not improved since. In the 
first nine months of GenCorp's fiscal year, which ends Nov. 30, Aerojet's 
operating profit plunged 83% from a year earlier, to $6.8 million, and its 
sales dropped 35% to $405 million (partly reflecting divestiture of the 
munitions unit). 
</P>
<P>
 That meant Aerojet, while accounting for 33% of GenCorp's overall nine-month 
sales of $1.24 billion, kicked in only 10% of GenCorp's $66.8 million in total 
operating earnings for the period. And those earnings tumbled 25% from a year 
earlier because of Aerojet's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 GenCorp stock closed Wednesday at a 52-week low of $10.50 a share in New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading. Five years ago, the stock was trading in the 
low $20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best option for GenCorp and Aerojet would be to find a buyer willing to 
purchase the entire (Aerojet) operation," said analyst Mark L. Parr of McDonald 
& Co. Investments in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tough times represent a dark chapter in the history of Aerojet, which was 
founded in Pasadena by aeronautic scientist Theodore von Karman in 1942. Six 
years later it was bought by General Tire & Rubber Co., GenCorp's predecessor. 
(GenCorp sold General Tire in 1987 to help fend off a hostile takeover 
attempt.) 
</P>
<P>
 Aerojet eventually centered its electronics business in Azusa and its 
propulsion operations in Sacramento, and both units flourished during the Cold 
War. From 1959 through 1979, for instance, it built the second-stage motors 
used on all 3,061 U.S. Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, the contracts have dwindled. Last year alone, Aerojet saw 
Titan rocket deliveries slow, cancellation of the Peacekeeper missile program 
and funding withdrawn by Congress for the advanced solid rocket motor program 
-- a Lockheed-Aerojet effort to develop a new generation of space-shuttle 
booster engines. 
</P>
<P>
 GenCorp could sell Aerojet's electronics group in Azusa without much trouble 
because a buyer could readily merge Aerojet's product lines into its own, 
analysts said. But selling the propulsion business "might be more dicey," 
Mortner said.  
</P>
<P>
 One snag: Because there is already excess manufacturing capacity in the 
rocket-motor industry, a buyer of Aerojet's propulsion unit might want to close 
Aerojet's plants. However, Aerojet's programs got government approval based on 
their being built at Aerojet's plants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who might want Aerojet's propulsion line, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Other prominent rocket-motor builders include Thiokol Corp., producer of the 
Space Shuttle's boosters; Rockwell International's Rocketdyne division in 
Canoga Park, which built the Shuttle's main engines, and Hercules Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Hercules' aerospace group is being acquired by munitions maker Alliant 
Techsystems Inc., and Rockwell, as it moves away from military contracts, is 
spending $1.6 billion to buy Reliance Electric Co. In a Tailspin GenCrop's 
Aerojet division, which makes rocket motors and defense electronics, has 
suffered a sharp drop in sales and earnings in tandem with defense spending 
cuts.

 Mexico's Retail, Wholesale Sales Rise: Retail sales rose 11% in September over 
the same month last year, a government agency said. It was the largest increase 
in two years and the second consecutive monthly gain.Wholesale sales rose 4.4% 
in September, the fifth consecutive monthly rise. The figures are from a survey 
conducted by the government's Instituto Nacional de Estadistica Geografia e 
Informatica. It covered Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey, the country's 
three largest cities. For the first nine months, retail sales rose 0.4% and 
wholesale sales 5.2% over the year-earlier period. The survey also reported 
that the number of people employed in retail commercial establishments in the 
three cities declined 1.8% in September and that the number of people hired in 
wholesale outlets fell 4.4%. Retail workers' real wages rose 1.4% in September.

TOKYO STOCKS TUMBLE ON HEELS OF WALL STREET SLIDE; MARKETS: WITH U.S. TRADERS 
ON HOLIDAY, THE DOLLAR CHALKS UP SOME GAINS OVERSEAS.

<P>
 Stocks tumbled on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to a 10-month low Thursday, but 
British shares edged higher and the dollar rose against foreign currencies on 
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil prices edged higher and gold was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets in the United States were closed in observance of 
Thanksgiving, sidelining many overseas players who ordinarily take cues from 
U.S. activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paris market was among the main gainers in Europe, notching up a sharp 
rise on relief that Wall Street closed with only small losses Wednesday 
following Tuesday's sharp slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people had expected Wall Street to keep going down, so there was a 
bit of short-covering on the Bourse," said one French trader. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, German stocks also endured a dull day with modest gains. The 
main feature was a 21% drop in the price of Metallgesellschaft shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The metals group, which nearly went bankrupt earlier this year, announced 
capital-raising measures on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock traders in Japan said Wednesday's retreat on the New York Stock Exchange 
led to residual selling pressure in Tokyo on Thursday. Japanese financial 
markets had closed Wednesday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nikkei average of 225 selected stocks dropped for the fourth straight 
trading day, falling 261.75 points, or 1.38%, to 18,701.24. On Tuesday, the key 
index had shed 158.73 points, closing below the psychologically important 
19,000-point level for the time since Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders traced Tokyo's decline partly to the losses on Wall Street and markets 
in Europe, Hong Kong and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock prices had fallen on Wall Street Wednesday for the fifth straight day as 
more investors migrated out of stocks and into the Treasury market, attracted 
by the high yields on bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Selling pressure from foreign investors helped knock prices down," said 
Toshiaki Yui, a trader at Nomura Securities, a large Japanese trading house. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to pressure on Tokyo stocks were investors selling Japanese shares to 
buy dollars following an increase in key U.S. interest rates last week by the 
Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Share prices closed slightly higher on the London Stock Exchange after steep 
declines in the previous session. The bellwether Financial Times index of 100 
leading shares was up 9.1 points, or 0.3%, at 3,036.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar trading against the German mark was little affected after the 
Bundesbank's policy-forming council voted to leave rates unchanged at its 
meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower German rates would have made the return on the mark less attractive and 
typically boosted the dollar. However, few investors expected the German 
central bank to cut rates since German M3 money supply continues to grow 
outside the Bundesbank's 4% to 6% target range. The inflation-fighting German 
central bank uses M3 expansion as a leading indicator of price rises. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bundesbank left its discount and Lombard rates unchanged and extended a 
freeze on its 14-day securities repurchase rate for another two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the dollar was quoted at 98.45 Japanese yen, up from 98.25 yen late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers said the dollar benefited from a perception that too many investors 
had sold the U.S. currency in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil prices in London rose slightly. North Sea crude for January delivery edged 
up a penny to $17.15 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 In light trading of U.S. Treasury securities in Japan, the price of the 
benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged and the yield held at 7.94% from the close 
in New York on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the Japanese government's benchmark 10-year bond finished at 
96.69 yen, up 0.32 yen from Tuesday's close. The yield slipped to 4.620% from 
4.735%.

 Namibia Gets 50% Stake in Diamond Industry: De Beers, the world's largest 
diamond producer, gave up its monopoly on diamond mining in the African country 
in exchange for a guaranteed stake in the industry for 25 years. Under an 
agreement signed by President Sam Nujoma and De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie 
Thompson, a new mining concern split 50-50 between the government and De Beers 
will take over all diamond mining. The agreement marks a compromise between the 
domination enjoyed by De Beers in Namibia since 1919.

 T-Shirts Draw Suspensions: More than 1,000 Bell Atlantic Corp. workers were 
suspended for Thanksgiving Day after they wore T-shirts depicting themselves as 
"road kills" on the information superhighway.The suspensions, coupled with pay 
lost when the workers were sent home Wednesday afternoon, comes to about $320 
for senior employees. The shirts show a squashed, furry animal labeled "Bell 
Atlantic Employees." The company is depicted as a truck. The Philadelphia-based 
phone company announced in August that it would eliminate 5,600 jobs -- 7.7% of 
its work force -- to cut costs. Union members claim they will be replaced by 
non-union workers and subcontractors.

GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN ON EASIER TRADE; NAFTA: MEXICO'S REQUIREMENT THAT 
IMPORTED CORN BE DYED IS ONE EXAMPLE OF PROBLEMS U.S. EXPORTERS FACE. MORE 
ROADBLOCKS MAY LIE AHEAD IN WAKE OF PROPOSITION 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Want to sell corn to Mexico? If so, you'll need to dye it green. Or at least 
half of it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's requirement that all corn imports be sprayed with green dye is just 
the most bizarre of a string of problems stifling U.S. and Canadian grain 
exports to Mexico in the first year of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County trade specialist warns that the grain industry's problems may 
be mild compared to what California businesses can expect as Mexican resentment 
grows following the passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which would prohibit public schools and hospitals from serving 
illegal immigrants, has embittered many in Mexico, according to Newport Beach 
trade consultant Lucia de Garcia, president of Elan International. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexicans are too polite to say this to North American business people -- but 
they tell me -- and what they are saying is that this was seen as an 
anti-Mexican thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have just come back from Mexico, and business owners there are talking 
about boycotting California businesses (in protest of Proposition 187)." 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot initiative isn't the only barrier to free-and-easy trade between 
Mexico and the United States, as the grain situation shows. De Garcia said that 
some Mexican businesses have been hurt by NAFTA because it is enabling U.S. 
businesses to compete more directly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to one Mexican who imports caustic soda (used in oil refining), and 
he said that he lost $300,000 last year" because U.S. companies have started 
selling the chemical compound directly to Mexican buyers at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says they are dumping caustic soda in Mexico," de Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such stiff competition is breeding resentment that is being communicated to 
the Mexican politicians who are responsible for implementing NAFTA in that 
country, she said. De Garcia suggests that as Mexico's politicians hear from 
their constituents, U.S. companies could begin seeing more blockades like the 
green dye rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. and Canadian grain industry saw NAFTA creating a huge and hungry 
market for its products. But instead of record numbers of heaping boxcars 
rushing untroubled across the border, trade is being hit, grain industry 
leaders say, by badly designed regulations, bureaucratic delays and the 
inadequacies of Mexico's railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Although trade has risen, it has not been spectacular, and many blame market 
restrictions outside their control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought free trade would bring fewer obstacles, less control. . . . Almost 
a year into NAFTA, we see bilateral trade is easier in some aspects but more 
and more difficult in others," said Victor Hakim, chairman of Continental Grain 
in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heading the list of complaints are some of the import rules imposed by Mexican 
officials as they try to set up a regulatory regime in line with NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican government is prone to just changing the rules overnight and has 
not been very responsive to practical observations from the industry," said a 
U.S. executive from a major grain export company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It changes the regulations and wants them implemented immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 The green dye ruling has the industry up in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 With international corn prices far lower than those guaranteed to Mexican 
farmers, authorities say they need to be able to follow the grain's 
distribution inside Mexico to prevent it being imported and then resold to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to do that, they say, is by making sure all corn shipments show 
at least 50% green dye coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. exporters, Mexican clients and shipping companies say the spraying 
orders are disrupting trade. 
</P>
<P>
 They are pushing for the government to track the corn with paperwork, not 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is turning into a non-tariff barrier to trade," said Sergio Munguia, head 
of the grains division of CANACINTRA, Mexico's chamber of manufacturing 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Munguia said inconsistent application of the regulations has caused heavy 
holdups at ports of entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ships are detained, and, while we resolve it, days pass and we have to pay 
for the delays." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials say the dye ruling is also making rail transport slower and 
more costly because rail cars have to be cleaned of dye residue before they can 
be returned to service. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the time it takes to come here and return to the U.S., I can make two or 
three cargo trips inside the United States," said Eduardo Luckie, the Mexico 
representative of the Santa Fe Railway Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "The authorities are making decisions without really thinking (of) the impact 
they are going to have," Luckie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fear that U.S. railroads, already struggling to handle the huge U.S. 
crops this year, will simply refuse to allow their cars to be filled with corn 
that has been sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's rail network is old and distribution is slow. Analysts say advances 
have been made in cutting bureaucracy and promoting private investment but that 
many years of heavy investment are required to bring the network up to scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a serious problem with rail grain in Mexico," said Rick Calhoun of 
Cargill Inc.'s grain division. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of cars available to go through Mexico has been reduced by several 
railroads and the productivity on returning cars into Mexico has not improved. 
Something needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico for January-July were up 9% from last 
year, whereas total exports rose 19%. While this year's bumper crops and low 
prices in the United States have boosted grain shipments in recent weeks, the 
figures are lower than many in the trade had hoped for.

<P>
 Hoping to clamp down on crime, businesses in Santa Ana have formed a Business 
Community Watch program, apparently the first of its kind in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterned after Neighborhood Watch, in which a network of neighbors help 
protect each other from criminal activities, the Business Community Watch next 
week will post a dozen watch signs that will mark the perimeter of the South 
Garnsey Business Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garnsey area comprises about half a square mile in southeast Santa Ana in 
which 98 light-industrial and manufacturing businesses are located. Business 
Community Watch will report crimes, distribute maps of troublesome areas and 
develop a communication network for the 98 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides security for the businesses, Jose De la Cerra of Polyclad, a 
manufacturer in the Garnsey area, said: "It's a great opportunity for us to 
network with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft Foods, BASF and Air Cleaning Technology are among the other companies 
that helped to establish the Business Community Watch.

 Help for Entrepreneurs: If you're an entrepreneur in Orange County looking for 
ideas to help expand your business, now is the time to give Cal State 
Fullerton's Small Business Institute a call.The institute is looking to sign up 
small businesses for its free counseling program. The program matches an

 Home of the Technopolis: The folks at Accelerate Technology, the Small 
Business Development Center at UC Irvine, have a new nickname for the region: 
Orange County Technopolis. The term, says Accelerate's director Tiffany Haugen, 
underscores Orange County's strength in high-innovation sectors -- electronics, 
measuring devices, drugs and medical instruments.In employment, Haugen says, 
Orange County surpasses the Silicon Valley in all of these except for 
electronics. Orange County Technopolis, of course, is populated by a lot of 
small obscure start-ups, some of which are getting help from Accelerate. Among 
them, as reported in the latest Accelerate newsletter, are Belle-Amie Inc., a 
developer of non-surgical approach to mastectomy prosthetics; Biognosis, whose 
product detects e-coli and other bacteria in meat; CADtest, a designer of 
combined hardware and software solutions for electronics test automation; and 
Funzone, a paper product maker.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; IN THE SHADOW OF DEAN SMITH; NORTH 
CAROLINA'S WOMEN'S TEAM GETS ATTENTION AFTER LAST SHOT IN NCAA FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She looks much taller in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's because on national television, moments before she hit the 
buzzer-beating three-pointer in last season's NCAA women's basketball 
championship game, Charlotte Smith seemed swallowed up by the enormity of it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The shot, which gave North Carolina a 60-59 victory over Louisiana Tech, not 
only announced the presence of a new champion in this basketball-mad region of 
the country, but also captured the attention of many fans, bringing the sport 
into the limelight like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 With all this hovering in the air of the Richmond (Va.) Coliseum, Smith looked 
tiny as she aimed the ball at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 A breath of time remained on the clock and North Carolina trailed by two 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, people held pretzels in mid-bite or stopped in the middle 
of their living rooms or set down their coffee cups and watched their 
televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stands, Smith's father, normally a mild-mannered pastor, stood on his 
chair and cheered then knelt on the floor, telling those around him that the 
Spirit had spoken to him and he knew what was about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, time stood still. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like I was unconscious," Smith said, and her eyes lit up. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after all the interview requests from the media and all the 
congratulatory messages from fans (Michael Jordan reportedly said, "Nice 
shot"), even after being asked how it feels to have changed the face of the 
sport and after meeting the President of the United States, Smith seems to 
treat the experience like a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is a trooper. 
</P>
<P>
 A trooper because when a reporter recently asked to be shown around campus, 
she swung her bag gamely over her shoulder, smiled and said, "Let's go!" 
</P>
<P>
 First stop, Carmichael Auditorium, the cozy, 10,000-seat home of the Tar Heel 
women and about a mile away from the overwhelming, 21,572-seat Dean E. Smith 
Center, where the men's team has played since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Notice the progression," Smith said, pointing to the banners in Carmichael.  
</P>
<P>
 In sequence, they hang: 1992 NCAA tournament (where the Tar Heels lost in the 
first round), 1993 NCAA Final 16, 1994 Atlantic Coast Conference tournament 
champions and 1994 NCAA champions. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left to accomplish?  
</P>
<P>
 "Winning the ACC regular season," Smith said. North Carolina finished 33-2 
overall, 14-2 in ACC and in second place behind Virginia (27-5, 15-1) last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Tonya Sampson, a dominating player who was the team's leading scorer 
the last four seasons before she finished her eligibility, the Tar Heels are 
not expected to repeat as national champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is shooting for it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a senior forward, is a fierce competitor who has led the team in 
rebounds the last three seasons, including a game-record 23 in the NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been competitive since the days when her uncle, David Thompson (yes, 
the David Thompson of N.C. State and NBA fame), used to visit her home in 
Shelby, N.C., for holidays and set all the cousins, brothers and sisters 
against each other in any game he could think of -- who could do the most 
push-ups, the most sit-ups, or run the fastest. And, of course, there was 
always basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get to see him that much, but when we did, it was fun being around 
him," Smith said. "I think he brought out the competitiveness in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Her three brothers also brought out the tomboy in her. Together, they used to 
hunt and build clubhouses in the woods near Shelby. Summers were spent swimming 
in a creek behind her grandmother's house. 
</P>
<P>
 On the salary her father, Ulysses, earned as a pastor at New Life Christian 
Center, just outside Shelby, expensive clothes or toys never entered the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We preferred to be with nature and have adventures . . . just fun stuff," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Shelby High, Smith was the only girl enrolled in the weights class, she 
would take on any boy in the gym in a one-on-one basketball game at lunchtime, 
and she always lined up for the dunk contests. She was selected the most 
valuable player of the girls' basketball team four years and was twice selected 
all-state, even though Shelby never made it to the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell even heard about Smith 
was because Hatchell's brother lives in Shelby and saw Smith play. Hatchell, 
whose team was in the conference cellar at the time, figured she had nothing to 
lose and made the two-hour drive to see Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "She jumped center and she just kept on going, " Hatchell said. "Her team was 
not really that good, but as I watched her rebound and I watched her do other 
things on the court, I thought, man, I would love to get my hands on this kid 
because she has a world of potential." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, it was not that difficult to get her. Few other college 
coaches had even heard of Smith, and none had offered her a scholarship. Smith 
signed a letter of intent for North Carolina during her junior year at Shelby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any regrets in coming here," said Smith, who is reserved and 
polite in the presence of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlotte doesn't talk a lot, she leads by example," Hatchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why, when Hatchell called timeout with the championship game on the 
line, no one questioned her decision to go to Smith for a three-pointer, even 
though Smith had made just eight of 31 three-point attempts all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see (Smith) getting up, I just get excited and my eyes light up," said 
teammate Marion Jones, a point guard from Thousand Oaks who also participated 
in the 1992 U.S. Olympic track and field trials. "When Charlotte gets excited, 
you know you can expect something good out of her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The clock showed 0.7 seconds remaining when Hatchell broke the team huddle 
after a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when things began moving in slow motion for Smith. She set a screen for 
Sampson then ran to a new spot. Turning, she watched, incredulously, as three 
Louisiana Tech players followed Sampson, a likely candidate to attempt a layup 
for the tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Smith was all alone. 
</P>
<P>
 She caught Stephanie Lawrence's in-bounds pass (a "perfect pass" Hatchell 
likes to say), took a step behind the three-point line and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Please let me hit this shot. Please, please let me make this shot . 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it going through the air and it looked pretty good," Smith said. "So I 
just closed my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing she knew, Sampson tackled her and was screaming in celebration. 
The rest of the Tar Heels piled on before Jackson, a reserve forward and 
Smith's roommate, began pulling them off to save her friend from suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith finally was freed, she was covering her face with her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks as if I was trying to protect myself, but I just didn't want anybody 
to see me crying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith wasn't the only one crying. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman wrote Hatchell to say that she had been holding her baby, and when 
Smith's shot went in, she threw up her arms and dropped the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's winning shot provided women's basketball with a much-needed dose of 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaches all over the country have told me how much that shot did for women's 
basketball, just the fact that people stopped and paid attention," Hatchell 
said. "I think what it did more than anything else is it educated a lot of 
people to what a great game it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of the shot is not lost on Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are always talking about how exciting it was and saying that 
it was the best game they had been to all year, including the men's games, so 
now they can see that women's basketball can be just as exciting as men's," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisons between the North Carolina men's and women's basketball teams are 
inevitable, and somewhat vexing to the Tar Heel women, who feel that they 
didn't get their fair share of the media spotlight last season, even after the 
men took an early exit from the NCAA men's tournament in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Carolina student store has sold about $100,000 worth of women's 
basketball memorabilia since March, but that is much less than the estimated $1 
million that was sold after the men won their most recent of three titles in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of people showed up to watch the women play an exhibition game 
recently against a local club team in Carmichael Auditorium. An announcer urged 
fans to buy season tickets, which are being offered for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won a national championship, so we can hold our heads up high and be proud 
of our team and of our accomplishments, just as much as the men's team," Smith 
said, "even though we don't receive as much recognition, we have something to 
be proud of, too." 
</P>
<P>
 And, after all, when you walk into the Raleigh-Durham airport, there is a sign 
listing all eight NCAA championships that have been brought back to the 
triangle, where North Carolina, Duke and North Carolina State all share a small 
geographic area. At the very top of the list is the North Carolina women. For a 
little while, at least, perhaps that is all that matters.

IN SAN DIEGO, WILL THEY; STAND BY THEIR MAN?; RECENT STRUGGLES HAVE CHARGER 
FANS DOUBTING QUARTERBACK STAN HUMPHRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a city gripped by panic. 
</P>
<P>
 That feel-good 6-0 start for the San Diego Chargers is gone, replaced now by 
fear of a great collapse after three losses in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters to the editor in the local newspaper read like fanfare for teams 
residing in Tampa or Cincinnati: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Will somebody please wake up the Chargers? No intensity at all. The whole 
team seems to feel, 'Oh well, we lose, we're still on top.' With that attitude 
they are due for a rude awakening." (William D. Lawton, San Diego) 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Chargers have been losing to teams they should beat -- and there 
aren't many of those left on the schedule. . . . Maybe it's time to ask Dandy 
Don to sing, 'Turn out the lights.' " (James D. Shepherd, National City) 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I've read some rash statements . . . but the one about Stan Humphries 
being an undisputed leader was a lulu. He could not be an undisputed leader of 
a sandlot team." (Wayne Briles, Spring Valley) 
</P>
<P>
 The lunch-hour crowd at the LaFiesta Deli near San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
is losing its appetite: "People are just sick about what has happened to this 
team since they stopped wearing their throwback uniforms," said store owner 
B.B. Hanhan. 
</P>
<P>
 Despair has even infiltrated the Charger front office: "We might not win 
another game, and if we do, I'm not sure 9-7 is going to put us in the 
playoffs," a club official confided. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers finish the season with four of five games at home, but a 
combination of jacked-up expectations and now a quarterback gone sour has 
raised tough questions about Stan Humphries and brought an immediacy to 
Sunday's game with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first part of this season the Lightning Bolts were back in their glory 
uniforms from the past, and Stan was the man, the toast of the town and the 
highest-rated passer in the game. But ever since the second half of a 36-22 
victory over New Orleans on Oct. 16, the man has struck out. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then Humphries has thrown three touchdown passes with seven 
interceptions, while completing 51% of his passes. And as Humphries goes, so go 
the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to tell how Stan will come out of this," said Charger General 
Manager Bobby Beathard. "I'd like to believe he can lift himself above this and 
become a real good quarterback in this league over a long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries may be worried, but he has a grip on reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "People see us go 6-0 and then we're 8-3 and it's like, 'My God, what's going 
on?' " Humphries said. "We're on top of our division, we've lost only one game 
in the division and it's not a reason to get overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Tell that to the second-guessers who are asking for more of Gale Gilbert and 
less of an injured Stan Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always something that people latch onto when you're not winning, and 
unfortunately the quarterback is usually the guy," said Dan Fouts, who was 
inducted into the Hall of Fame after a distinguished career with the Chargers. 
"A lot of people in this league would like to have the problems Stan Humphries 
has. The Chargers are still in control of things and from what I've seen of 
Stan and from what I know about his personality, he'll fight his way through 
this and come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries' personality allowed him to scrap successfully and rise from 
obscurity in Washington to become the savior in San Diego. Traded to the 
Chargers after a season-ending preseason injury to John Friesz, and without 
benefit of a training camp under new coach Bobby Ross, Humphries carried the 
team on his big-play arm to the playoffs for the first time in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago this team went out expecting to compete hard," Humphries said. 
"Now it goes out expecting to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries' leadership qualities, along with Ross' intensity and Beathard's 
skill for assembling talent, have given area fans cause to get excited. 
Although injuries have sabotaged Humphries' play at times, in his three years 
with the Chargers he has compiled a 25-10 starting mark, a .714 winning 
percentage matching Kansas City's Joe Montana, who is tops among active 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has he done lately? 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were doing well I said at the time we were learning something new 
about this team every week," Beathard said. "How was the team going to handle 
it when everyone pointed at them, and that included the quarterback. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested to see how Stan handles this. Does he pull himself back up, or 
is there something that would keep him from pulling himself back up, like 
injuries or what's going on in his mind. It's all new, all new to Stan, because 
he's never been the guy until now." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a feeling within the Charger organization that maybe Humphries has 
lost his confidence and is now pressing to live up to expectations and an early 
season sky-high quarterback rating. But there are mitigating circumstances for 
his midseason slump. This season Humphries has suffered a deep hip bruise, 
injured a knee, sprained an ankle and on Monday he required arthroscopic 
surgery for a dislocated left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 While playing hurt, he has been asked to throw the ball to a corps of shaky 
receivers. A breakdown in pass protection, which has resulted in 10 sacks in 
his last four appearances, and an ineffective running game lately have also 
crippled Humphries' chances for success, but still Stan's supposed to be the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I hope doesn't happen," Beathard said. "I hope he doesn't think 
he has to do it all because then he will be pressing to make the big play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Charger passing game hasn't produced more than 200 net yards since the 
third game of the season. Of Humphries' 10 touchdown passes, six came in the 
first three games. In the past three games, which included one Gilbert start, 
the Charger offense has scored a total of three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when I get in the huddle I think, well, we're struggling a bit on 
offense, and maybe if I make a great throw or make a great play then the whole 
offense will come out of its funk," Humphries said. "I'm going to throw some 
interceptions, make some bad plays, but I'm going to make some big plays. The 
big plays I make lift our offense and our whole team up to another level." 
</P>
<P>
 Big plays were at a premium while the Chargers were desperately searching for 
a replacement for Fouts. After Fouts' retirement following the 1987 season, the 
team won 22 games in the next four seasons under the direction of six different 
starting quarterbacks. Humphries' acquisition, which prompted former Charger 
coach Don Coryell to proclaim, "Good God, in my mind it's a steal," propelled 
the team to an overall mark of 27-16 the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are looking now to see how a guy . . . is going to step up and 
get everybody else to rally around him," Humphries said. "But it hasn't been 
one guy, or two guys that haven't played well recently, it's been all of us. 
And it isn't going to be one guy who brings us out of it. That's why we were so 
successful earlier in the year; we were playing as a team."

BELIEVE THE HYPE; NOTRE DAME'S RON POWLUS HAS LIVED UP TO ADVANCE BILLING 
DURING HIS FRESHMAN SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vision is a hard-to-define trait that separates great quarterbacks from good 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the ability to see an entire field, to see things that haven't happened 
yet . . . but are about to. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Holtz, the Notre Dame coach, believes that his redshirt freshman 
quarterback, Ron Powlus, has it. 
</P>
<P>
 And so does everyone else in the Notre Dame community. 
</P>
<P>
 Called by some the most heralded Notre Dame recruit since Paul Hornung in 
1954, the 6-foot-4, 218-pound Powlus will be in charge of the Irish offense 
when Notre Dame guns for a 12th consecutive victory over USC at the Coliseum on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 At his weekly news conference Tuesday, Holtz talked at length about Powlus' 
vision, about a play Powlus made in Notre Dame's 30-11 loss to Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called a slant pass to Derrick Mayes when we were on their 12-yard line, 
and Ron winds up throwing a high, soft lob," Holtz said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying: 'Oh, no -- what's he doing out there?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what I didn't see -- and he did -- was that the safety had come over to 
Mayes with the backside corner. We didn't complete the pass, but there was no 
danger of a pick and he knew that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes off and I said, 'Son, what in the world are you doing out there? 
We're on the 12, throwing a lob like that -- that's like trying to take three 
points off the board.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks at me and says, 'No, coach -- the safety came up and ran under the 
slant, with the cornerback.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at the films and that's exactly what happened. None of us on the 
sideline saw it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I mean about this kid. He does amazing things. He's a very 
accurate passer, but it's his decision-making process that I respect the most 
in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus arrived two summers ago from Berwick, Pa., with so much hype and high 
expectations that he was almost anointed St. Ronald before he threw his first 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN's Beano Cook, the self-appointed college football expert, has said Powlus 
could start for some NFL teams now. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame didn't do much to lower the steam in Powlus' pressure cooker, 
either. He was issued jersey No. 3, previously worn by Rick Mirer and Joe 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 If you order a Notre Dame football jersey with No. 3 on it from the 
university's memorabilia catalogue, the tab is $650. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus brought all this on himself, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 He passed for 51 touchdowns during his senior year in high school and ran up 
more than 9,000 yards in total offense as a high school player. He was USA 
Today's prep offensive player of the year for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He was America's hottest high school quarterback, everyone agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus was supposed to have his rookie season with last season's 11-1 team 
rather than this season's 6-4 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz was on the verge of naming Powlus his starter last season when two 
280-pound players now in the NFL -- Jim Flanagan and Bryant Young -- squashed 
him in a preseason pileup, and Powlus suffered a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 That Powlus was close to a starter's role a year ago astonished everyone in 
South Bend. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was Powlus, a freshman coolly striding into Notre Dame's preseason 
camp and taking over the offense.  
</P>
<P>
 Holtz, at the time, said privately he never had seen a young quarterback show 
such command of an offense so quickly, or to be able to read defenses as 
adeptly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 1993 training camp scrimmage, Powlus completed 23 of 36 passes 
for 436 yards and five touchdowns, with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Flanagan and Young put him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus tried to come back too early from the injury and broke the collarbone 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Holtz made Powlus wear a yellow do-not-touch-the-quarterback 
vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz, trying to pull back on the hype throttle, had to find something to 
complain about. 
</P>
<P>
 He settled on the fact that Powlus had gained 10 pounds during rehab, and 
nicknamed him "Chunky Chucker." 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus' teammates call him "Happy Feet," a knock on his speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Holtz, in 1993: "We have not had a quarterback who has not been 4.75 
seconds or better in the 40 since I've been here. Right now, Powlus is around 
five seconds flat." 
</P>
<P>
 Mock cheers from teammates went up last August when Powlus allegedly clocked a 
4.8 40. 
</P>
<P>
 His first season is a smash. 
</P>
<P>
 He is already tied with Rick Mirer for the Notre Dame one-season touchdown 
pass record at 18 and he's running a Notre Dame team that has passed for 20 
touchdowns, more than any previous Irish team. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a season when injuries have forced Holtz to start 10 different 
offensive lines, his rookie quarterback has passed the toughness test, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron has had a great season without the benefit of an awful lot of protection, 
and he's taken a physical pounding," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So he's shown us courage in addition to everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "His passing percentage (53%) is not real impressive, but people forget he's 
throwing away five or six passes a game to avoid sacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mayes, his primary receiver: "He came in here with a lot of hype, so we 
felt like he had to really show us something. And he did. It didn't take him 
long at all. On the first day, he walked into the huddle and just took 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus' high school coach, George Curry, said Powlus was a finished product 
leaving high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like a second coach on the field," Curry told the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a sophisticated offense, with 25 to 30 formations a game. Ron knew 
every bit of it, including what every player's assignment was." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his quick mastery of Holtz's offense, Powlus said: "I was already in coach 
Holtz's offense last year before I got hurt. . . . I see what he wants me to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the pressure of playing one of the most visible positions in American 
sports: "There was a lot of hype, but I knew it was coming. I was prepared for 
it. It goes with playing quarterback here.  
</P>
<P>
 "All in all, I'd say I've had a decent year. I've made plenty of rookie 
mistakes, like trying to make some plays that weren't there. But I've done some 
good things, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Of USC Saturday, Powlus says: "We'll have to score a lot of points to beat SC, 
no question about it.  
</P>
<P>
 "SC's defense jumps around a lot, kind of like Michigan State's. I learned 
some things against Michigan State that I'll apply to SC." 
</P>
<P>
 So, why Notre Dame?  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt Notre Dame is a special place, and I felt really comfortable here. I 
liked everything about it, including the fact it's only an 
hour-and-40-minute-drive from home."

A QUARTERBACK CALLS HIS SHOTS; PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER RAIDER STABLER UNDERSTANDS 
HOSTETLER'S DESIRE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE TEAM'S OFFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a moment when careers could be made or lost, when coaches become 
geniuses or fools, when quarterbacks become heroes or goats. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a moment of high tension, heavy pressure and terrifying responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of moment Ken Stabler lived for. 
</P>
<P>
 Here he was, quarterback of the Oakland Raiders, heading to the sideline for a 
conference with his coach, John Madden. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Christmas Eve, 1977. Memorial Stadium in Baltimore was decorated 
brightly to reflect the mood of the holiday, but the fanatical faithful of the 
Colts were in anything but a festive mood. They howled and booed and vented 
their anger at an Oakland team that remained tied with their beloved Colts, 
31-31, in the opening minute of the sixth period of an AFC divisional playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had driven to the Baltimore 10-yard line, the elusive victory 
nearly within their grasp heading into the 76th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 As Madden tried to speak to his quarterback, he realized Stabler was staring 
into the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the fatigue and the cold and the tension finally gotten to the man they 
called Snake? 
</P>
<P>
 As Madden prepared to rattle off Stabler's options, the quarterback turned to 
him, a grin on his face, and said, in that soft Southern drawl of his, "You 
know, we are sure giving these fans their money's worth today." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Stabler trotted back to the huddle and, on the next play, the 
second play of the second overtime, calmly threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to 
Dave Casper to win the game, 37-31. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was a far cry from the tension-filled moments on the sideline in 
Miami last month when Los Angeles Raider Coach Art Shell, a teammate of 
Stabler's, and current quarterback Jeff Hostetler engaged in an ugly shouting 
match over play-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a different era, an era when the play-calling is done by 
committee, when owner Al Davis and offensive coordinator Tom Walsh and Shell 
all have input during the week in forging a game plan. If things are more 
complicated now than they were in Stabler's day, it's a reflection of the 
times. In this age when defensive players constantly shuttle in and out, when 
there are specialists for every situation, when computers spit out reams of 
information on every tendency of every team in every possible circumstance, it 
may be too much to put the entire game plan on the shoulders of the 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabler likes what he has seen from afar of Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to win bad," Stabler said. "He's been there before and I think he 
can get them there again. That team has a lot of talent and a lot of speed, but 
it lacks an intangible thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Stabler can sense it just from watching games on television, including the 
Miami game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art (Shell) doesn't seem to be comfortable with the people around him," 
Stabler said. "You see a ton of frustration and pressure. That whole sideline 
looks like it is ready to explode." 
</P>
<P>
 It sure was different when the Snake was in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabler, now 48 and living back home in Alabama when he's not traveling the 
country making personal appearances, talked about the difference between the 
two eras recently while in town to promote a flag football game, to be held in 
Miami on Super Bowl weekend to benefit The Miami Project To Cure Paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole scenario was real smooth and easy," said Stabler of the '70s, his 
era with the Raiders. "There was a great relationship between Al and the 
players and Madden and the players. It was a happy locker room. Basically John 
let us do whatever we wanted to do on the field. He let me run 85 to 90% of the 
game in that system most of the time. But I had a lot of tools to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 That he did, an offensive line that included Hall of Famers Shell and Gene 
Upshaw, center Dave Dalby, and receivers Fred Biletnikoff, Cliff Branch and 
Casper. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabler didn't have a strong arm, but he was a master at reading the defense, 
finding the open receiver and using the whole field and all the people at his 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical timeout, Stabler would come over and Madden, who always had a 
sideline credential dangling from his belt -- as if he'd get ejected without 
one -- would be nervously running his hands through his hair as he talked to 
his assistants up in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want to do?" he would ask Stabler. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterback would tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, go do it," Madden would reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw me the playbook," Stabler said, "and told me, 'Go win. Do whatever.' 
We were all basically in the damn thing together, but I ran the game. John 
never said a word to me about play-calling. He never yelled at me. John let me 
do whatever the hell I wanted to do and he backed me up." 
</P>
<P>
 And what interaction was there between Stabler and Davis? 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd say, 'Do you know what the hell you're doing this week?' " recalled 
Stabler of the owner. "And I'd say, 'Yeah, I know what we're doing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That he did. Stabler played 15 years in the NFL, including from 1970-79 with 
the Raiders, throwing for 27,938 yards and 192 touchdowns in his career while 
completing 59.8% of his passes. His best year was 1976 when he led the Raiders 
to a 13-1 regular-season mark and a victory in Super Bowl XI. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabler would make much more money playing today but figures he wouldn't get 
as much enjoyment out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't like playing like that," he said of today's intricate chain of 
command. "I'm glad I played when I played. I'm glad I got the opportunity to 
call the plays and run the show the way that I wanted to. Win or lose, it was 
my decision. I made an airplane out of my game plan. I flew by the seat of my 
pants. I didn't study game plans. I didn't study film. I didn't do any of that 
stuff. I just wanted to know if it was zone (defense) or man, and who their 
good players were. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't put a bit in a racehorse's mouth. You've got to let him run if he's 
going to be the best horse he can be. You've got to turn him loose and let the 
SOB go and, if he's got any heart and pride about him, he'll run on Sunday. I 
think the quarterback could probably do as good a job as some of the people 
upstairs if they turned the game back over to the quarterback. It'd be fun to 
watch and see."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL / AROUND THE NATION; 
STANFORD SERVES NOTICE THAT IT WILL BE IN HUNT FOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The tremors reverberating out of Palo Alto last Saturday were only the first 
aftershocks from Stanford's freshman class, called by many the best in a decade 
in women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the season opener, Stanford played Purdue, which reached the Final Four 
last season after beating Stanford on its own court, 82-65, in the West 
Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 New year, new teams, new result. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won, 62-52. 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful women's team of the 1990s -- winner of national 
championships in 1990 and 1992 -- Stanford is back. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it was ever gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tara VanDerveer's team failed to win the Pacific 10 Conference for the 
first time in five years last season, but the Cardinal is still the class of 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Its records the last seven seasons: 27-5, 28-3, 32-1, 26-6, 30-3, 26-6 and 
25-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Denied entry to the Final Four the past two seasons by Purdue last spring and 
Texas Tech in 1993, Stanford's armory is loaded and pointed toward the Target 
Center in Minneapolis, site of the Final Four in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA's West Regional semifinals and final will be played at UCLA March 
23-25. 
</P>
<P>
 There was fair warning last spring, when Stanford announced what it called one 
of the most successful recruiting hauls ever in women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the six players signed by the Cardinal is believed to be Kristin 
Folkl of St. Louis, who can dunk. She'll join the team after the volleyball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The others were Heather Owen, Idaho's prep player of the year; Regan Freuen of 
Spokane, Wash.; Chandra Benton of Lake Oswego, Ore., who probably will be a 
redshirt this season; Naomi Mulitauaopele of Seattle and Olympia Scott of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Cardinal has four starters back from a team that went 15-3 in 
the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning in the middle is 6-foot-5 Anita Kaplan, arguably the nation's best 
post player. Also back: Rachel Hemmer, Jamila Wideman and Kate Paye.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan and Hemmer were all-conference players last season and Wideman and 
reserve Kate Starbird made the all-freshman team.  
</P>
<P>
 Hemmer is still recovering from ankle surgery last spring and has not 
practiced. VanDerveer says she is still in rehab, hasn't practiced and might 
not play this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the well was deep enough that Stanford was ranked fifth in the 
Associated Press preseason poll. Purdue was second. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee is tabbed No. 1 by nearly everyone, but if VanDerveer can blend her 
rich talent into a cohesive unit, it's difficult to imagine anyone stopping the 
Cardinal come tournament time. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the coach agrees. For one thing, the Cardinal is deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "The depth is the big difference this year," VanDerveer said. "Last year we 
worried about foul trouble all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy with the Purdue result with the exception of our rebounding. With 
so many young players, it's hard to convey to them how hard you have to play at 
this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford will aim its sights on at least two other ranked teams before 
beginning Pac-10 play Jan. 5 against Washington. The Cardinal will play host to 
ninth-ranked Texas Tech tonight and visits Tennessee next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford could also meet 13th-ranked Iowa in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic 
on Dec. 18 at Jackson, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Louisiana Tech and Tennessee seem like the class teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Leon Barmore's Lady Techsters came within .7 of a second of a national 
championship last season. North Carolina's Charlotte Smith smashed their hopes 
with a three-point shot in the final second of the national title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is All-American guard Pam Thomas, whose baseline jumper in the final 
seconds appeared to have clinched a national title. 
</P>
<P>
 But four other starters return and Barmore calls his incoming recruits 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Barmore, 338-56 in 13 seasons, calls two of his returnees, Debra Williams and 
Vickie Johnson, "as good as anyone in America." 
</P>
<P>
 His team plays at Long Beach State on Sunday at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee was overpowering last season, beginning with a victory over 
Stanford. The Lady Vols won their first 14 games, stumbled at Rutgers, then won 
another 17 in a row before losing to Louisiana Tech, 71-68, in the Mideast 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pat Summitt, in her 21st season, has four starters back from a 31-2 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the charge is player-of-the-year candidate Nikki McCray, a 5-11 senior 
who averaged 16.3 points and 2.5 steals a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's three returning starters include Final Four MVP Charlotte 
Smith, but gone are center Sylvia Crawley and forward Tonya Sampson. Track star 
Marion Jones is back at the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, 20-9 overall and 12-6 in the Pac-10 last season, got everyone's 
attention with a 79-75 victory over Texas Tech on Tuesday night, ending a 
24-game home winning streak for the Lady Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chris Gobrecht has four starters back, including one of the Pac-10's 
most physical players, Rhonda Smith, who scored 38 points against Texas Tech 
and was MVP of the Preseason NIT. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gobrecht has bolstered her roster with another French player, Laure 
Savasta, who joins countrywoman Katia Foucade. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington was 17th in the AP preseason poll but Husky hopes have soared since 
the victory over Texas Tech. If Stanford stumbles in the Pac-10, it will likely 
be Washington doing the tripping.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL / THE SOUTHLAND; USC, 
UCLA HOPEFUL DESPITE MAJOR LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Cheryl Miller at USC and Kathy Olivier at UCLA, it's a season of 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie and Natalie Williams, the dominant players in Southland women's 
college basketball the last four seasons, are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet both Miller and Olivier say they can't wait to see what post-superstar 
life will be like. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, in her second Trojan season, has major tasks at hand as she readies 
her team to defend its Pacific 10 Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone with Leslie, a four-time All-American, is point guard Nicky McCrimmon, 
perhaps the best in the Pac-10 last season at taking the ball up the court 
through pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, 26-4 overall and 16-2 in the Pac-10 last season, knocked Stanford off its 
Pac-10 perch for the first time in five years. USC came within a game of the 
Final Four, losing in the Mideast Regional final to Louisiana Tech, 75-66. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier, also in her second season, has to replace Williams and Amy Jalewalia, 
who ranks ninth on UCLA's all-time scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA seemed headed for a tournament berth last season until Williams suffered 
a season-ending knee injury in March. Without her, the Bruins lost their last 
three games, finishing 10-8 in the Pac-10 and 15-12 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 In a season in which Stanford looms as the favorite to reclaim its Pac-10 
dominance, USC should finish the race closer to Stanford than to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Thompson, freshman of the year in the Pac-10 last season, is the Trojans' 
best player. She averaged 14.2 points and 10.5 rebounds a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mideast Regional, she had 18 points and 10 rebounds against Virginia 
and 17 and 12 against Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key player for the Trojans will be 6-5 sophomore Michelle Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 There were games last season when Miller sent Campbell in for two- and 
three-minute stretches to spell Leslie when it was sometimes hard to tell 
Leslie was out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a starter, Campbell was seventh in the Pac-10 in blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some expectation at USC that with game experience, she could develop 
quickly into a major contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Anton is a versatile swing player who was a 39% three-point shooter last 
season and is a strong, physical rebounder when asked to play underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 At point guard, Miller must decide between Audrey Gomez, who sat out last 
season after transferring from Notre Dame, and sophomore Erica Jackson. She 
said this week that the position was "up for grabs." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Karleen Shields is a starter after finishing strong last season after 
overcoming early season knee troubles. Shields is the team's fastest player -- 
she is a triple jumper for the track team -- and had 26 steals last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward-center Rashida Jeffery figures to start after apparently recovering 
from two years of nonstop knee problems. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, Olivier has roughly the same high hopes for junior post player Zrinka 
Kristich as Miller does for Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristich has improved steadily in two years, and Olivier recently said she had 
had a great first three weeks of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Z was our most improved player last year and I want her to improve this year 
by the same margin," Olivier said. "She won't have great stats, but she does so 
many good things on the floor the players are now looking to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier has the same hopes for another junior, Kisa Hughes, who will start up 
front and who finished the season averaging in double figures in scoring and 
rebounding. Kristich and Hughes "are a good mix for us," Olivier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kisa did a good job after Natalie went down," Olivier said. "It was tough for 
Kisa to play her game with Natalie in there, but now we expect her to really 
show us something." 
</P>
<P>
 The guard starters figure to be Ricarda Kuypers and Nikki Hilbert. Forward 
Allison Arredondo is UCLA's best three-point shooter -- unless freshman Jamie 
Oenning claims the title. Olivier said Arredondo has improved markedly after 
playing in a summer league. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier said defense will be emphasized far more this season, in an attempt to 
make up for Williams' departed numbers: 23.4 points and 13.1 rebounds. To that 
end, she wants more shots off opponents' turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense will be our best offense," she said. "We want to score a lot off 
our defense. I want more shots by our guards. We're going to surprise some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At San Diego State, fifth-year Coach Beth Burns is building a championship 
program with defense, defense . . . and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth in NCAA team defense last season, the Aztecs were the West Coast's 
surprise team, posting a 26-5 record and winning the Western Athletic 
Conference regular-season and conference tournament championships before losing 
its second game in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading the returnees is leading scorer Falisha Wright, who is backed up by 
her twin sister, Lakeysha.

CAL STATE BAKERSFIELD STARTS ALL OVER; DIVISION II: ONLY THREE PLAYERS RETURN 
FROM NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It shouldn't surprise Pat Douglass that Cal State Bakersfield's men's 
basketball team is the two-time defending champion in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 He was there for both titles. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as the coach, he was pretty much responsible for both. 
</P>
<P>
 He recruited the players, and he coached them. But what he really did was set 
the playing standard that all Division II teams try to match. 
</P>
<P>
 His team was featured in Sports Illustrated last year and has been on national 
television each of the last two years, unheard-of in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems as if it would be hard to forget the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think in those terms. It surprises me when people say 'You've 
won two national championships,' " Douglass said. "I don't look back, that's 
not my style." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but he might appreciate the last couple of years a little more this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Bakersfield win a third consecutive championship? 
</P>
<P>
 Anything is possible, but it doesn't seem likely. 
</P>
<P>
 All five starters from last season are gone, as are two reserves. Douglass 
also had to replace his two assistant coaches, who left to pursue other 
interests. It's hard for a team to mesh quickly when everyone became acquainted 
two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Bakersfield boosters can tell you, it's been done before. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Roadrunners set an NCAA record for most victories (33) in 
an undefeated season with four new starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that was a pretty good adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, there are only three returning players, and none of them had 
significant playing time last season. But as UC Riverside Coach John Masi said: 
"At Bakersfield, they just reload." 
</P>
<P>
 He should know. 
</P>
<P>
 Masi has had arguably the best team outside Bakersfield the last two seasons. 
He has the misfortune of playing in the same conference -- the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. -- and drawing Bakersfield in the NCAA West Regional 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be too far a stretch to say that Bakersfield has an athletic 
department devoted to men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, how many Division II schools have 10 scholarships for basketball? 
Not many. 
</P>
<P>
 The Activities Center, where home games are played, is only five years old, 
seats nearly 4,000 and is as fine as you will find anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly $200,000 of the athletic budget is for basketball, and that's a big 
help in recruiting. Five members of this season's team are from other states 
and none are from Bakersfield. Roheen Oats and Tyrone Davis, the key members of 
Bakersfield's national championship teams, were both from Brooklyn via Columbia 
Community College in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 When the recruits arrive, they find that their previous conceptions of 
Bakersfield were quite a bit off. For one thing, away games are televised 
locally and their coach has his own TV show to talk about -- that's right -- 
Bakersfield basketball. For another, Bakersfield is not a farming town, but 
rather a city surrounded by agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought Bakersfield was a dried-up city, but I thought it was 
great once I came here to visit. It's real nice," said Pauliasi Taulava, a 
sophomore from Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that Bakersfield boosters usually fill up the visitors' stands at 
every game within three hours' driving distance, and most home games are 
near-sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a favorable situation here, no doubt," Douglass said. "Recruiting is 
easier now than before because of the television exposure. We got a lot of 
exposure in that when we played our (national championship) game on TV last 
year, it was at the end of the Division I tournament, and I think there were 
only eight teams left." 
</P>
<P>
 For Division II, that kind of exposure can't be overdone. For example, it is 
directly related to the arrival of guard Damon Smith, who already has the 
athletic department and local media buzzing over his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had seen Bakersfield on TV two years ago, and it was just a game I watched 
because they were 33-0 and it was basketball. So then when they recruited me, I 
kind of knew who they were. Believe me, I watched a lot closer the next year," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he saw was an offense that he could fit into -- a lot of fast breaks, 
three-point shots and give-and-go plays with the post players -- and an 
aggressive defense that could use his quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had been at Solano Community College, was recruited by San Diego 
State, St. Mary's, Gonzaga and Eastern Washington, but said that playing for a 
winner was one of the deciding factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving at Bakersfield in 1987, Douglass has never won fewer than 20 
games. His teams have been to the Division II final three times, reached the 
round of eight five times, won the CCAA regular-season title four times and the 
CCAA tournament five times. 
</P>
<P>
 That has created an expectation of winning and has brought in a lot of fans 
and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it create pressure? Of course. That's why Douglass recruits heavily from 
the junior college ranks. Still, he puts his own spin on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town is used to success in every sport, and that's good," he said. "You 
know that when you take the job. It is more fun and satisfying to coach a kid 
for four years. But for us not to go get players who are a little closer to 
playing at the level we do in our conference would not be good.  
</P>
<P>
 "It just wouldn't go over too well if we didn't make the (NCAA playoffs) for 
two years in row." 
</P>
<P>
 Taulava is one of three holdovers from last season's team and one of only two 
players who didn't come from a junior college. Last year he learned about the 
pressure and the level of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at how athletic everyone is -- I mean every single player on 
the team was good," Taulava said. "Last year it was kind of hard because the 
team before went 33-0 and everyone was back. There was a lot more pressure when 
we lost a few games. But this year there's just not much pressure. We have a 
whole new team so, in a way, we have nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 After two games, they have lost nothing and gained a 2-0 record. But Douglass 
is wary of saying that anything has been gained yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to kid me about (winning a third consecutive national title), but 
I don't think anyone thinks that I'm actually thinking that -- it's 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting from scratch. I have three returners and seven new players. 
Now I think they're a good group and are learning, but it's too early to say a 
lot because I'm still finding out myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I sit here and hem and haw. We can talk about national titles, but 
this is a whole new team. It's not like the Lakers, who won two titles and then 
returned most of their players for the next season. We have a new team." 
</P>
<P>
 But expect a trip to the playoffs anyway.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE; MATADORS' ONLY GOAL 
IS WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Micelli has one goal for the college basketball season, and it has 
nothing to do with how many points or rebounds he gets for Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a winning season," said Micelli, a fifth-year senior. "That's all I 
want, and I'm going to ask Santa, the Easter bunny, everybody. A winning season 
is the only thing that's important." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're going to ask, might as well shoot for the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will open its fifth season of major-college competition on Saturday 
at 2 p.m. against sixth-ranked UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. The Matadors' best 
record in previous NCAA Division I campaigns was an 11-17 finish in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the Matadors, the climb toward respectability never has been as steep 
as it appears this season. Among their first eight games are four teams -- 
UCLA, Alabama Birmingham, Cincinnati and New Mexico -- that made last season's 
NCAA tournament and another that played in the NIT, Xavier of Cincinnati. Home 
games against California and Nevada Las Vegas and trips to Pepperdine, 
Washington State and Fresno State are scheduled later.  
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, this is the most challenging schedule we've ever had," Coach Pete 
Cassidy said. "That part is a plus, if you choose to look at it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy, starting his 24th season as Northridge's coach, had hoped that by now 
his program would have been on solid footing and achieved at least moderate 
success. The Matadors, though, have been rocked by recruiting problems, 
injuries and, most recently, last January's earthquake, which chased players 
from their homes and the team from its gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would like to think that this year has to be better," Cassidy said. "Then 
again, we've said that every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the school's gymnasium, Northridge's basketball program is being 
refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Chevalier, the school's all-time scoring leader and a four-year starter 
at point guard, has completed his eligibility. Taking over the controls is 
Robert Hill, a 6-foot-1 junior who has started only once in two seasons. 
Waiting is Trenton Cross, a 5-11 freshman who last season averaged 17.4 points 
for Reseda High and was considered the San Fernando Valley's top prep player. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli, at 6-8 Northridge's tallest starter, also is the team's only 
returning player who averaged more than five points a game. Micelli averaged 
10.9 points and 3.8 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Stone is the club's top returning rebounder -- and he's a 6-3 guard. 
Stone last season had identical rebounding and scoring averages of 5.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Forwards Mike Dorsey and Ruben Oronoz, a pair of junior college transfers, are 
expected to provide scoring and rebounding balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Gray, a 6-6 transfer from Canada College in Redwood City, Calif., is an 
excellent perimeter shooter and should add scoring punch off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge might be in over its head in the early going, but for the first 
time in their Division I tenure, the Matadors have a conference schedule to 
anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
 The America West Conference, a loosely organized alliance of four otherwise 
orphaned teams, makes its debut this season. Northridge, Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, Cal State Sacramento and Southern Utah are league members. Of the 
group, only Southern Utah, at 16-11, had a winning record last season. CS

BIG WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW; LONG BEACH STATE IS SEEKING A REVERSAL OF 
MISFORTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With only two losing seasons in 31 years, the Long Beach State women's 
basketball program is one of the most successful and tradition-rich in NCAA 
history. That's nice, but here's the problem: Those hard times hit the last two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Coach Glenn McDonald is confident the down days are done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players believe they're going to have a very, very good year," McDonald 
said, "and that helps a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald, a former 49er basketball standout, is in his fourth season as the 
women's coach. His record is 41-44. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Long Beach was 11-17 and tied for seventh in the conference at 
9-9. The biggest problem was turnovers -- about 25 per game. Through two 
preseason games, McDonald noticed a marked improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing now is that we're really being patient with what we're doing," 
McDonald said. "We're going to have more scoring opportunities because we're 
being more selective with our passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior point Akia Hardy (5-6) made strides last season while playing with a 
broken finger. Freshman Sarah Davis (5-6) is expected to be Hardy's backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach had a successful inside game and should again with the return of 
center/forward Melissa Gower. Gower, 6 feet 2, averaged 15.8 points and 9.6 
rebounds as a junior. Gower's game is still developing, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting a lot of leadership from Melissa," he said. "She'll be a better 
offensive player and a better rebounder. She has a great opportunity to be 
player of the year in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Toby Metoyer (6-2) should help Gower with rebounding and 
inside scoring. She didn't play last season after transferring from Duquesne. 
Junior center Ja'net Davis (6-4) will dominate if she becomes more aggressive, 
McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald knew he could count on inside points last season, but the outside 
game was shaky -- at best. Improved conditioning, and experience, should help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had to rely only on the inside game, now I know we can go inside 
out," McDonald said. "We have people who are very confident shooting the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 A big contribution is expected from senior shooting guard Michelle Miller 
(5-8). Miller averaged 4.6 points a season ago. She is an intense player whom 
McDonald wants to shoot more. 
</P>

BIG WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW; TITANS WANT BALANCED SCORING THIS SEASON, 
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Cal State Fullerton's Autumn Hollyfield was the top three-point 
shooter in women's college basketball with 110 in 289 attempts (.381), an 
average of just more than four per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she'll have that many three-pointers this season," Fullerton 
Coach Deborah Ayres said. At least, Ayres hopes she doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres said that was one of the problems with the Titan offense last season. 
Fullerton relied too much on outside shooting, at the expense of passing the 
ball inside for easier scores. The result was a 5-22 record, 4-14 in the Big 
West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Autumn is a tremendous three-point shooter, but getting most of our points 
from the perimeter won't help us win," Ayres said. "We've made some changes in 
the offense to get the ball inside to our post players more often." 
</P>
<P>
 Still Hollyfield should find the opportunity to break the school record for 
three-pointers. She needs only 27 to surpass Joey Ray's record. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Tara Nowling (5 feet 11) and Koko Lahanas (6-0) shared the center 
position last year. Between them, they averaged slightly more than 10 points. 
Ayres wants more scoring from the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to play an up-tempo game, so we'll need them to share playing time 
again this season," Ayres said. "Since we're small and still missing the big 
people inside, we're going to have to speed up our game." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollyfield, a 5-11 senior forward, averaged 17.9 points last season to lead 
the team; junior guard Shayla Bradshaw was a close second at 16.3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans' third leading scorer, forward Shefonda Colbert, is academically 
ineligible. Colbert (6-0) was the team's leading rebounder and had averaged 10 
points over the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres moved Bradshaw from point guard to shooting guard with the hope that she 
can help deliver the ball inside from there and become more of a scoring 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Marissa Frial, a 5-3 senior who averaged 8.6 points last season, has taken 
over at the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frial has been doing a terrific job at the point in practice," Ayres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several players are competing for the other starting spot. Kim Cram (5-10) has 
shifted from guard to forward and LaCheri Grant (5-11) is back after sitting 
out last season. Ayres hopes Michelle Leitner (6-2), coming back from a second 
reconstructive knee surgery, also will help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely a better team right now than we were a year ago," Ayres 
said. "All of our players have had at least one year together, and just knowing 
each other should help." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres says the Titans still are not ready to challenge teams such as UC Santa 
Barbara and New Mexico State in the conference's upper echelon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayres is optimistic about the future. "Having a full staff of assistants this 
year should really help," she said. "We didn't have that last year because of 
the budget problems. It's already had a tremendous impact this year in 
recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
 She rebuilt the staff with Kelley Hall from Mississippi State, Robyn Stewart 
from Idaho and Tom Powers from College of the Siskiyous. Fullerton opens Nov. 
25 at home against Washington State. Cal State Fullerton Facts and Figures

BIG WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW; UC IRVINE HOPES TO REBOUND FROM 5-23 
SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine's women's basketball team didn't make it to the Big West title game 
last March like the men did, but it also reached a tournament pinnacle of 
sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 It won a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters recorded a first-round victory -- their first in the tournament 
since 1985 -- before losing to top-seeded Hawaii, 85-82. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine won three of its final seven games, hardly enough to inspire trash 
talk, but a real hot streak considering the Anteaters were 3-15 in the Big West 
and 5-23 overall. And they averaged 72 points during those seven games, almost 
eight above their regular-season average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything gelled during that time and I'm hoping the players' confidence 
carries over into this season," said Colleen Matsuhara, who has a 12-69 record 
in three seasons at Irvine. "We want to improve on that level of play and build 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine has that modicum of momentum and some experience in its favor when it 
opens the season at 7:30 tonight in the Bren Center against Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Four starters -- who were four of the team's top five in scoring -- are back. 
The Anteaters' fortunes figure to hinge on the play of senior forward Jinelle 
Williams, who led the team in scoring (12.4) and rebounding (9.9) last season, 
and 6-foot-2 junior center Allah-mi Basheer, who averaged 11.8 points, 6.6 
rebounds and led the conference in blocked shots with 49. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jinelle is a perennial choice for all-conference," Matsuhara said, "and 
during preseason workouts, Allah-mi has shown she's capable of performing at an 
all-conference level. We need her to be a force in the lane, both offensively 
and defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Also returning are junior guards Davette Williams (7.9 points and 2.8 assists) 
and Tamera Thomas (5.7 points, 2.0 rebounds), both of whom took over as 
starters midway through last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Cher Scanlon, who started the first 12 games last year but only 
once after, is back in a starting spot and trying trying to regain the form of 
her sophomore year, when she averaged more than two points more than her 4.9 
average last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tamera and Davette have shown the leadership qualities we need in the 
backcourt," Matsuhara said. "And I'm hoping our experience will help us in 
critical game situations." 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of leadership and a little moxie at crunch time could go a long way 
toward turning around the Irvine program. The Anteaters seemed to hang close to 
a number of teams until the closing minutes last season and they lost five 
games by three or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuhara's what-doesn't-kill-us-makes-us-stronger scheduling approach again 
figures to give the Anteaters a nonconference trial by fire. Irvine plays 
Colorado, North Texas, Texas Christian and UCLA on the road before opening the 
Big West season Jan. 4 at Cal State Fullerton. UC Irvine Facts and Figures

SYLMAR LIVES TO FACE CARSON IN SEMIFINALS; FOOTBALL: SPARTANS SURVIVED CITY 
INVESTIGATION OF PLAYER'S ELIGIBILITY AND TIEBREAKER AGAINST OPPORTUNISTIC 
BANNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sylmar High football team and Coach Jeff Engilman had plenty to be 
thankful for Thursday after dodging two potential season-ending bullets in the 
span of about 26 hours this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Spartans (12-0), the City Section's only undefeated team, faced 
expulsion from the playoffs when a reserve linebacker's eligibility came into 
question. Then, about 24 hours after receiving clearance to play, Sylmar found 
itself trailing Banning, 21-0, eight minutes into a 4-A Division quarterfinal 
playoff game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But like so many incidents the Spartans have endured this year, Sylmar 
survived both scares and will face Carson (4-8) in the semifinals next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the guys before the game, 'Hey, maybe you guys are a team of destiny. 
I don't know,' " Engilman said. "But they've got another monster team to play 
so we'll find out." 
</P>
<P>
 After a daylong investigation by City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege on 
Tuesday, Engilman received word about 8 p.m. that night that evidence against 
Joe Gonzalez, a midseason transfer from Saugus who was accused of maintaining 
dual residency for purposes of eligibility, was inconclusive and that the 
Spartans would remain in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, Sylmar had to pull out all the stops with trick plays, a blocked 
extra-point kick, fourth-down conversions and a successful onside kick to beat 
Banning, 28-27, in a California tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar overcame a 21-point deficit and -- despite six turnovers -- tied 
Banning, 27-27, on Durell Price's one-yard run with 3 minutes 18 seconds 
remaining. Shaun Avalos' extra-point attempt sailed wide left and the game 
eventually went into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The California tiebreaker format is used in all playoff games in the state. 
Play begins at the 50 and teams alternate possession for eight plays. The 
winner is the team that has penetrated the opponent's territory after the eight 
plays. The Spartans won by maintaining the line of scrimmage at the Banning 49 
on the final play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar began the game with turnovers on its first two possessions. A fumbled 
punt snap and an interception return allowed Banning to start inside the Sylmar 
20 on the Pilots' second and third possessions. The Pilots converted both and 
led, 21-0, with 3:32 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that diminutive Gerrod Taylor -- the Spartan spark plug -- 
introduced himself to the Pilots. Taylor's 80-yard kickoff return turned a 
comatose Sylmar crowd into a frenzy. Less than six minutes later, Sylmar scored 
again, on Tyrone Morgan's two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Banning extended its lead with 1:08 left in the second quarter when Matt 
Moala intercepted a Greg Marquez pass and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown. 
Price blocked the extra-point attempt and Banning led at halftime, 27-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's offensive problems continued in the third quarter. With Marquez 
struggling, Engilman called on Taylor, a 5-foot-5 junior, to replace Marquez in 
a wishbone offense on third and seven at the Banning 16. Three Taylor runs 
accounted for 15 yards, the last for a two-yard touchdown with 6:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
 With Banning clinging to a 27-21 lead, Avalos' onside kick was recovered by 
Daniel Hernandez at the Banning 47. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-yard gain, Sylmar converted on fourth and nine on Marquez's 
36-yard pass to Eddie Lopez. Four plays later, Price's one-yard run tied the 
score, 27-27.

NCAA WATER POLO CHAMPIONSHIPS; TOP-RANKED STANFORD HOPING FOR A SEQUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not much seems to to be in the way of Stanford and its second consecutive 
national championship in water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe only three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (24-1) will play eighth-seeded Air Force (18-9) today at noon in the 
first round of the NCAA tournament at Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament runs through Sunday, and by that time Stanford figures to be 
celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 It almost looks too easy. Even Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti has a hard time 
finding anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't see any weaknesses," Dettamanti said of his team. "We score 
when we need to, and the defense is coming around at the right time -- we're 
really coming together in all phases of the game."  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's only loss was to California in double overtime early in the season 
at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by senior driver Wolf Wigo, who has 55 points, the Cardinal has outscored 
opponents, 318-180. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigo is the leading candidate to be voted player of the year by the coaches 
and is certain to be a four-time All-American. If teams focus on shutting him 
down, Stanford gets all the help it needs from Jeremy Laster, who scored 49 
points, 32 from beyond the seven-meter two-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 The main threat to Stanford would appear to be second-seeded USC. The Trojans 
lost two All-Americans and five players with significant playing time overall 
and might have figured on a rebuilding year, but sophomores Marko Zagar and 
Hrvoje Cizmic of Croatia changed that when they joined the program this fall. 
Cizmic and Zagar are the Trojans' top two scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 But USC (17-6) has a bit of the bridesmaid syndrome -- they have been 
runner-up three times and never won a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 This year does not figure to be different. Five of USC's six losses have been 
to Stanford. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In the other games today, second-seeded USC will play seventh-seeded Navy 
(25-5) at 1:30 p.m., third-seeded California (19-9) will play sixth-seeded 
Massachusetts (30-6) at 3:30 and fourth-seeded Pepperdine (15-8) will play UCLA 
(16-12) at 5. The tournament will continue Saturday with consolation semifinals 
at 2:30 p.m. and 4, and championship semifinals at 6:30 and 8. . . .Sunday's 
games will start at noon, with the final at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal has won 11 championships in the 25 years of the tournament, and has been 
runner-up five times. Stanford has won six titles and been runner-up three 
times.

MELSBY DOESN'T KNOW THE AGONY OF DEFEAT; HIGH SCHOOLS: RECORD-SETTING LOS 
ALAMITOS RECEIVER TAKES PRIDE IN TEAM'S 38-0-1 MARK SINCE HE BECAME A STARTER.

<P>
 John Barnes will always find something to fret about as Los Alamitos' football 
coach, but having Brad Melsby around for the past three seasons has sure made 
life easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Take last season, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season opener, Barnes worried about how the Griffins would respond 
after winning their second consecutive Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The team had a new quarterback, Mike Good, and different personnel on offense, 
except for Melsby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember riding on the bus to the game and John told me, 'We are going to 
throw every pass to Mels,' " said Barry Sher, Los Alamitos' assistant coach. 
"Brad was the only guy with any experience. He made three or four catches on 
the drive and got Mike Good off to a great start." 
</P>
<P>
 Good was later named Division II player of the year and earned a scholarship 
to Northern Arizona after helping the Griffins win their third consecutive 
Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Brad doesn't help Good get off to a start like that, who knows what kind 
of season we would have had?" Sher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby has played for winning teams since Barnes tabbed him a starter at the 
beginning of the 1992 season. Melsby hasn't missed a game since, and in his 39 
career starts on the varsity, the Griffins haven't lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad and I were looking through the books the other day, looking at the 
records he's broken," Sher said, "But that's the record he likes the most -- 
the team is 38-0-1 since he has been here." 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, a 6-foot-1, 183-pound senior, has quietly amassed some other 
staggering numbers that have put him into the Orange County record books. 
</P>
<P>
 He has compiled 2,811 career yards receiving, surpassing Rick Parma's 
19-year-old record of 2,767. Parma played at Kennedy from 1973 to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby also had three touchdown receptions last week in a Division I 
first-round victory over Bellflower St. John Bosco, giving him 35 for his 
career to break Parma's record of 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby also has 176 receptions. The county record of 177, held by former Los 
Alamitos receiver George Sagen, figures to fall tonight in a Division I 
quarterfinal game against Long Beach Poly at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 The records are nice and Melsby has enjoyed the team's run. Last week, the 
Griffins tied the Southern Section record by extending their unbeaten streak to 
46 games.  
</P>
<P>
 But the records and the streak are the furthest things from Melsby's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to extend a streak, we're trying to win a CIF football 
championship," Melsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 That focus is one of the things that sets Melsby apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, a mellow kid who lived in Minnesota until the fourth grade, doesn't 
like analyzing his success. But his coaches, teammates and opposing coaches are 
less bashful about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a tremendous work ethic," Barnes said. "He sets the example for 
everyone else on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edison Coach Dave White: "I didn't like going against him, but I respect 
him. He's the kind of guy everyone wants. He'd be my first-round draft pick." 
</P>
<P>
 But Melsby, who also plays free safety, deflects the compliments as easily as 
he bats away passes from opposing receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 He wishes he could have the physique of Griffin wide receiver Tony Hartley. 
"He looks like he could play in college right now," Melsby said. 
</P>
<P>
 He longs for the speed of fellow receiver Stan Guyness. But the receivers feed 
off each other's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "When teams key on Brad, someone else is wide open," Feterik said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Melsby finds the end zone, he always credits his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fortunate to play with some great quarterbacks," Melsby said. "I 
mean, Tim Carey, he's at Stanford, Mike Good at Northern Arizona, and now Kevin 
Feterik . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I also learned a lot from watching and playing with (former teammates) Donnie 
(Ruberio) and George (Sagen)." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Melsby's biggest fans is his present quarterback, Feterik, a junior.  
</P>
<P>
 "Brad told me that playing varsity was just like playing a fast JV game," 
Feterik said. "Having guys like him make my job real easy. When we need a first 
down, it's like just throw it to Brad and he'll make the play." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those plays came last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins faced a fourth and goal from the 26 late in the second quarter, 
and Feterik threw an inside screen pass to Melsby. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby caught the ball near the 25, and cut upfield where he weaved his way 
through numerous would-be tacklers to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The score, Melsby's third touchdown reception of the half, gave the Griffins a 
31-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Barnes: "As good as Mels has been all season, he stepped up his 
performance level last week. It's like he was telling everyone that this is 
playoff time and it's time to pick it up a notch." 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby has always had that extra gear and Barnes has used him to the fullest 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, Melsby has 50 tackles (30 unassisted) and five interceptions, 
including one he returned for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby's classroom achievement, a 4.2 grade-point average and a 1,200 score on 
the Scholastic Aptitude Test, has helped attract attention from recruiters at 
Stanford, Arizona State and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Terry Donahue has called Melsby, hoping to persuade the Griffin 
receiver to become a Bruin next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue sees a lot of things about Melsby that Sunset League coaches have 
already discovered this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say Brad's not fast enough, by he always gets open and has 60 to 70 
catches a season," White said. "He's not flashy, but he gets the job done. The 
bottom line is that he's a winner." Melsby at Los Alamitos 
</P>

 Senior receiver Brad Melsby and Los Alamitos have had a near-perfect three 
years together: 07,08,06,07,05,04,04,04 Year Rec. Yards TD W L T 1992 31 506 5

 With a nice blend of size, skill and quickness, the Bulldogs have potential. 
Youth is a concern, however. The juniors played on a 20-2 team as freshman, 
losing only to Mater Dei and Notre Dame that season. Those players are 35-8 
over two years. Davis likes what he has seen in practice. "There's good 
chemistry," he said. "I really like these guys. We should be one of the better 
teams in the area. I've never had a team that practiced so hard." Burroughs

 One thing seems clear--the Indians won't go 2-17 again. They can be a surprise 
team if all the elements blend together. Johnson, at 5-11, rebounds, dunks and 
can go one-on-one with almost anybody. Trejo can make the three-point shot. 
Silveira spent the summer playing pick-up ball in Philadelphia parks. "We're a 
much better team, far more athletic," Sullivan said. "We've got good depth with 
solid starters. I'm excited. But I don't know how quickly they'll develop."

 Minor is the best player in the league and might be the best guard in the 
area. He holds Canyon records for most points in a career (1,138) and in a 
season (619), most three-point shots made in a career (140) and in a season 
(67). But he doesn't have much of a supporting cast. Minor, the only returning 
starter, must lead a young team in transition. "Greg gives you a chance to win 
a lot of games," Hayes said. "The key is how the younger guys come along." Hart

 It looks like a rebuilding year for the Indians, who were the Valley's 
top-ranked team through much of last season before bowing in the first round of 
the playoffs. Gone is All-Valley forward Cody Patterson (15 ppg., 8 rpg.) and 
point guard Eric Spindt (9.5 ppg., 5.4 assists). Hart again will run a 
disciplined, half-court offense and an all-out pressure defense with Posey 
leading the attack. Posey is the only returner who had significant playing

 No seniors, no player taller than 6-3 and only three victories a year ago. 
Could be another long season. But Webb is confident his teachings are taking 
hold and insists the team will show improvement. "It's a tough league to be 
short in," Webb said. "But we'll surprise a few people with our quickness." 
Alemany lost 16 games in a row last season. Pantoja, who started part-time last 
season, averaged six points a game. Chaminade 03,14,08,07 1994 OVERALL LEAGUE

 Young makes his varsity head-coaching debut after a two-year stint as an 
assistant at Cal Lutheran, where he played two seasons. He picked a difficult 
league to enter. "There won't be an easy game on the schedule," he said. 
Experience is limited. Yang is a returning starter who averaged 13 points a 
game. Ellis averaged 4.1 points. Crespi 03,14,08,07 1994 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE

<P>
 Marcaccini, who averaged 17 points a game last season, is among the area's top 
forwards and the Celts have a talented enough supporting cast to contend for 
league supremacy. Yerina, who became coach at midseason last January following 
the death of Coach Paul Muff, scheduled 30 summer-league games. Crespi lost the 
first six but won 11 of the last 13. "A lot of things are looking positive," 
Yerina said. Harvard-Westlake 03,14,08,07 1994 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 24-3 12-2

 The Wolverines, who advanced to the Division III-A semifinals last season, are 
ranked second in the state in Division III by Cal-Hi Sports and are a consensus 
pick to win the league championship. The Collins twins have each grown an inch 
and gotten stronger. Jason is among the area's best big men. Seems almost 
unfair that league opponents will have to deal with them for another three 
seasons. Robbins is another returning starter and Isaacson saw considerable 
action off the bench. Notre Dame 03,14,08,07 1994 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 12-14

 Zapata, who averaged 18.2 points last season, is headed to Nevada Reno, but 
the team's destination is uncertain. The Knights lost a Divsion III-A wild-card 
game against Moorpark last season. There's not much size, and Notre Dame could 
be in deep against teams like Harvard-Westlake. But the players can play 
defense and shoot from the outside, Perez said. St. Francis 03,14,08,07 1994

 St. Francis moves from the Del Rey League to the Mission League this season 
with little experience or size. Papadopulos is the only returning starter. He 
averaged nine points and six assists last season. Lepe averaged four points. 
Long-distance shooting is a strength. Khatchourian, who averaged 14 points to 
lead the junior varsity, is the best of several long-range specialists.

ROADBLOCKS AND STANDS READY TO BECOME ONE OF THE LEAGUE'S DOMINANT PLAYERS.

<P>
 When the going got tough, Tayyiba Haneef kept driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither a painful knee injury nor a 45-minute commute to Laguna Hills High has 
prevented the tallest girls' basketball player in Orange County from excelling 
on the court and in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Haneef stands 6 feet 5 1/2 and has transformed from a gangly youngster who 
closely resembled a newborn filly taking her first steps to a smooth-looking 
sophomore who can high jump over 5 feet 6 and dunk a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's getting bigger and stronger," said John Stonebarger, Laguna Hills 
athletic director. "And she's just starting to get some coordination." 
</P>
<P>
 Haneef's coach thinks she is more than just a tall player; she's an athletic 
one as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would be a good athlete if she were 5-10," Lynn Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A summer of weight training and practice sessions with her father brought this 
new and improved player to the forefront of her peers in the Pacific Coast 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing has come easily for Haneef and her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, a knee injury that cut short her fall sports schedule went 
undiagnosed because a lack of money kept her from undergoing a magnetic 
resonance imaging examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the extent of the injury was never discovered, the pain has since 
subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, her family was forced to reside with in-laws in Compton after 
the rent in Laguna Hills became too high for the family budget. The home is 
very close to Centennial High, but Haneef has been given clearance to remain at 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 It's during periods of crisis that an average person often wilts and fail. But 
Haneef has continued to flourish, maintaining her 4.0 grade-point average while 
participating in basketball, volleyball and track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really trying to do as much as I can for my future," she said. "How far 
I go the rest of the way is going to be up to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Haneef's parents take turns driving the 40 miles to Laguna Hills, and she uses 
the commute to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I have spare time, I'm always studying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scare she had with the knee last year increased her awareness of the value 
of hard work in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something went wrong, I would always have my education to fall back on." 
Haneef said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haneef said she thinks she is through growing after doctors measured a growth 
plate in her leg last year and said she would only grow another inch, which she 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 She has already surpassed her brother Arshad, a senior, who is about 6-2, and 
recently passed her 6-5 father, Mo. Her mother, Pat, is also above average 
height at 5-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being tall because it opens up opportunities," she said. "But 
sometimes people expect me to do a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 And Haneef can expect to get tested even more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 With Aliso Niguel and University joining the league and bringing a handful of 
other talented underclassmen, the Pacific Coast race should become one of the 
most competitive in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 One cross-town rivalry that will grow the next three seasons will be when 
Laguna Hills meets Aliso Niguel, which has 6-2 sophomore center Deanna 
Mitchelson, who averaged more than 14 points and 12 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Haneef hasn't faced Mitchelson yet, but it is something she looks forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel also has another player as big as Mitchelson, and University has 
three talented newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time we're all seniors, we should have one of the best leagues," 
Haneef said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for this season, Haneef wants to erase a bad memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, we were one win away from the playoffs," she said. "This year, 
we have a good chance of making it." 1993-94 / IN REVIEW

 Costa Mesa went unbeaten in league play en route to its third consecutive 
league championship and advanced to the Division IV-AA semifinals, where the 
Mustangs were beaten by Santa Ynez in overtime. Heather Robinson was the star 
for Costa Mesa and is now playing for Miami. Estancia tied for second place 
with Trabuco Hills, which has left for the South Coast League. The Eagles were 
led by two-time all-league point guard Jessica Waltz, who was among the top 
three passers in the county with 7.4 assists per game. The Eagles made the 
playoffs for the third consecutive season. Trabuco Hills improved throughout 
the season and was led by Dyanna Hatch, who shot a county-best 48.6% from 
three-point range. Laguna Hills missed the playoffs, but emerged as one of the 
top young teams in the county, led by 6-5 1/2 center Tayyiba Haneef and point 
guard Tamara Inoue. Century's Nina Alexander was a first-team all-league 
selection last season, averaging 14.7 points and 9.7 rebounds. Her sister, 
Addie Alexander, was honorable mention and averaged seven points. Laguna Beach 
had trouble with taller opponents and did not win a league game.

THEATER REVIEW; DURANG EXPLAINS IT ALL, CUTTINGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mrs. Sorken, a culture vulture masquerading as a theater docent, delivers the 
prologue to Christopher Durang's evening of one-acts -- called "Durang Durang," 
with the playwright's trademark understated annoyance in the face of 
inexplicable pop culture. She's seen a lot of plays and yet doesn't seem to 
love the theater. Or rather she says she sometimes prefers Dramamine to drama, 
two words between which she is determined to find a link.  
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Sorken (Patricia Elliot) hates any play that uses the "f" word and is 
over four hours. This may be playwright Durang's little stab at playwright Tony 
Kushner (much of the evening is made up of insider-y theater jokes). In fact, 
it's hard to tell if Mrs. Sorken is a stand-in for Durang -- some of her cracks 
about the relative intelligence of plants over people sound like the 
playwright's voice -- or if she is an object of condescension to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Durang Durang" is an odd evening of theater about theater that makes you wish 
this uniquely funny and, in fact, extremely influential American playwright 
would share less of his views on other people's work and write something more 
substantially all his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The best piece of the evening is the least arch and the only one with a 
character through whose eyes we are invited to see the world. "Business Lunch 
at the Russian Tea Room" features a playwright named Chris whose stubborn 
iconoclasm seems strangely familiar. Doggedly folding his laundry, Chris would 
like the world to just leave him alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He agrees, however, to meet a Hollywood agent for lunch at the Russian Tea 
Room, where she promptly congratulates him for writing the Craig Lucas play 
"Prelude to a Kiss" (rather like the real-life moment when TV host Charlie Rose 
asked Paul Rudnick what it was like to work on Ron Nyswaner's "Philadelphia." 
Those homosexual writers must all look alike.) 
</P>
<P>
 This one-act delivers the playwright's specialty: a scathingly funny, reactive 
innocent who must deal with the Melissa Stearns of the world, Melissa being a 
Hollywood agent who would like the playwright to write a screenplay based on 
one of a series of terrifically stupid ideas. The one she's pushing: A priest 
and a rabbi fall in love and, "O. Henry style," both get a sex-change operation 
in secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris' horror at this woman who urges him to deliver "quality but 
accessibility" goes unnoticed by her. When she picks up her table-side phone to 
call Philip Roth at home to answer some inane question, she threatens to engulf 
all of American culture. She has the money to do it, too -- a helicopter waits 
above the Tea Room to take Melissa to her Upper West Side meeting with Nora 
Ephron. 
</P>
<P>
 Just where Durang fits in on the rung of culture is something he seems to be 
still figuring out, 15 years after his breakthrough piece, "Sister Mary 
Ignatius Explains It All for You." Much of the evening is devoted to his 
recasting of plays that have managed, in commercial and non-commercial ways, to 
be celebrated by a culture whose values seem to constantly confound him. 
</P>
<P>
 In "For Whom the Southern Belle Tolls," Durang re-imagines "The Glass 
Menagerie" as a place where characters could freely address the way a 
contemporary audience might view the now-familiar peculiarities of the 
Wingfield (or Wingvalley, as Durang calls them) family. Laura becomes Lawrence 
(the very funny Keith Reddin), a pathologically shy collector of glass cocktail 
stirrers ("I call this one blue because . . . it's blue") whose brother Tom 
brings home a female caller, who turns out to be a lesbian with a hearing 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 This joke, like several others in the evening, is repeated a lot and sometimes 
pointlessly throughout the intermittently amusing one-act. The second piece, a 
Sam Shepard parody called "A Stye of the Eye," is similarly repetitive and 
seems to congratulate the audience for having seen and disliked "A Lie of the 
Mind" and for having read perhaps just enough about Shepard to know that he 
often divides two aspects of one man into two different characters and has a 
fondness for symbols (here represented with cymbals, many times). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only time that "Durang Durang" soars is a moment late in the evening, when 
a priest and a rabbi disco dance together in the screenplay from hell of Chris' 
imagination. This is a moment that belongs purely to the playwright's 
theatrical inventiveness and is not weighed down by his debt to or suspicion of 
other playwrights' works.  
</P>
<P>
 Walter Bobbie's overstated direction, in which all the jokes seem to be 
underlined twice, does not help. True to its title, "Durang Durang" shows two 
sides of a playwright whose voice has a permanent place in American drama. 
There's Durang the sharp-tongued, ostensibly confused observer of his time, and 
Durang the very bright Harvard student who needs to move once and for all 
beyond college parody, perhaps beyond being the consummate outsider. He has 
created a play in which for a moment you can hear that voice, but not for long 
enough that anyone could ever do a parody of Chris Durang.

DANCE REVIEW; A MUDDLED, MINIATURE 'SWAN LAKE' VIA MOSCOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC/DANCE CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of his 30th anniversary as head of the Bolshoi Ballet, Yuri 
Grigorovich is a man in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 His company, like most artistic institutions in the former Soviet Union, is 
teetering on the brink of economic disaster and aesthetic stagnation. His once 
unchallenged position of power could collapse at any moment, and, according to 
a growing number of progressive antagonists in Moscow, it may not be a moment 
too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The not-so-great dictator of terpsichorean Russia doesn't want to talk about 
any possible changing of the administrative guard. He is too busy, he says, 
with his latest project -- the care and feeding of a relatively modest ensemble 
that bears a relatively immodest name: the Grigorovich Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 For most impractical purposes, this is a junior Bolshoi organization. It uses 
reasonable facsimiles of old and familiar Bolshoi productions, staged by 
guess-who, as showcases for a small group of dancers who are apparently too 
young to appear with the prestigious alma mater yet too old to be in school. 
The participants reportedly range in age from 19 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the new Grigorovich gang brought its version of "The Nutcracker" to 
Cerritos. Wednesday night on the extended stage of Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 
the vehicle was "Lebedinoe ozero," better known in this part of the world as 
"Swan Lake." 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, was no ordinary "Swan Lake." This, essentially, was 
Grigorovich's controversial 1969 production as performed by a farm club on a 
bus-and-truck tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone in the cast had to fulfill multiple assignments. The basic 
swan corps numbered a pathetic dozen. The crowd scenes have never looked less 
crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 The decors of Simon Virsaladze have seen better days. And, it should be 
recalled, those better days were ponderously garish. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchaikovsky's wonderful score was blasted -- and I do mean blasted -- at the 
non-capacity audience in Pasadena via too-loudspeakers. This not only 
threatened damage to the assembled ear drums but also straitjacketed the 
well-schooled dancers in matters of phrasing, nuance and tempo. Recorded 
ballet, after all, is frozen ballet. It makes spontaneity a matter of wishful 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, there could be little room for assertive 
characterization, even if the neophytes on the stage had been inclined toward 
individuality of expression (in this context an unlikely prospect). 
Unfortunately, Grigorovich's distortion of "Swan Lake," a muddled 
quasi-abstraction that banishes mime and either ignores or contradicts the 
plot, needs all the dramatic help it can get. (It also needs more truth in 
crediting; to pretend that Grigorovich created all the choreography except 
Petipa's black-swan adagio is a preposterous joke.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to tell the players on Wednesday, even with a program. Most 
of the parts are triple cast. A voice on the public-address system rattled off 
the names of the principals on duty just before the curtain rose. The identity 
of the key performers in other assignments, however, remained a mystery -- a 
mystery that insulted the audience while it injured the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The central role in "Swan Lake" is a dual challenge of immense complexity. 
Odette can be played either as an otherworldly bird or as a tragic queen, and 
there are other possibilities as well. Odile, her evil alter-ego, can be a 
flamboyant seductress or a dazed impostor. Tatiana Ledovskikh -- pretty, 
slender and a bit brittle -- settled for being a competent ballerina. No more, 
no less. Her most distinctive feature, apart from a fleeting and pardonable 
mishap in the ball scene, turned out to be the droopiest eyelashes this side of 
a Bette Davis impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
 Konstantin Ivanov as Prince Siegfried partnered her with touching 
consideration, bounded through the air with buoyant ease, and projected bland 
detachment at all times. The error-riddled program did not deem him worthy of a 
biographical sketch. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Mischenko stalked the hero dutifully as a nasty, clean-shaven, 
dark-haired Rothbart (here called Robart , for reasons unfathomable). Andrei 
Evdokimov did what he could with the unmusical, anti-theatrical, 
all-too-athletic tricks of that pesky Jester -- an ancient Soviet anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone worked hard. Too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 This hand-me-down "Swan" was no turkey, seasonal greetings notwithstanding. 
But it didn't hold out the poetic promise of an ugly duckling, either. After 
many a summer dies the. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, never mind. 
</P>

with different casts, at Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 300 East Green St., 
Pasadena, today at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8, Sunday at 2. Tickets

 More Met: New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has rotated viewing of 
its galleries for the past three years because of budget cuts, has reopened all 
galleries to the public on a full-time basis. The reopenings were made possible 
through the Cultural Challenge Initiative, a city-state program that has 
earmarked a total of $10 million for cultural institutions, including $421,000 
for the Met reopenings. Cantor Fitzgerald, a New York financial holding 
company, has provided an additional $421,000 in matching funds. The change 
comes at the start of the holiday season, traditionally the period of greatest 
museum attendance. Most galleries have been closed for half the day -- rotating 
mornings and afternoons -- since 1991, after the Met suffered a $3.5 million 
cut in city support. TELEVISION

 Congresswoman Sugarbaker: It hasn't been promoted as such, but Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason's midseason series for CBS is a sort of sequel to her 
former hit "Designing Women," with Delta Burke returning as ex-beauty queen 
Suzanne Sugarbaker. The premise of "Women of the House" is that Sugarbaker 
takes over her late husband's seat in the U.S. House of Representatives; Teri 
Garr, Valerie Mahaffey and Patricia Heaton co-star as aides. A premiere date

 'Free Willy' News: Film companies Warner Bros. and New Regency Productions 
have announced plans to donate $2 million to a new foundation to help Keiko, 
the captive whale who starred in the movie "Free Willy," which earned the 
studios $100 million. Keiko has been a huge public relations problem for the 
filmmakers ever since it was discovered that instead of swimming to freedom, as 
he does in the film, Keiko lives trapped in a too-small tank in Mexico, losing 
weight and suffering from a herpes-like skin disease. Several other efforts 
have been launched to help Keiko, but the Humane Society of the United States 
on Wednesday called the Warner/New Regency donations "the most hopeful 
opportunity to fulfill countless people's desire to 'Free Willy.' " In 
announcing its gift, Warner, the movie's distributor, made a point of noting 
its past assistance in purifying and cooling the water in Keiko's tank. Warner 
clearly hopes to put the controversy behind it by next summer when outtakes of 
Keiko from the first film will be used in a sequel, "Free Willy II: The Return 
Home."

 The Falcon's Ransom: The Maltese Falcon, one of Hollywood's most famous film 
props, could fetch up to $50,000 when put up for sale next month, Christie's 
auction house said Thursday. The lead statue, center of the classic detective 
film that established Humphrey Bogart as a major star, will be sold in New York 
on Dec. 6. The falcon was left by studio boss Jack Warner to 
actor-director-producer William Conrad as a gesture of appreciation. Conrad 
died earlier this year. A second Maltese Falcon statuette -- made of resin and 
believed to have been held by Bogart in publicity shots for the movie -- was 
scheduled to be auctioned by Christie's in June, 1993, but the auction house 
declined to sell the falcon when it could not be proved that the statuette was 
used in the 1941 movie. POP/ROCK

MOVIE REVIEW; LOW-BUDGET 'FLOUNDERING': LIFE OF AN ACTIVIST VOYEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the all-too-aptly named "Floundering," James Le Gros plays John Boyz, an 
unemployed Venice layabout whose life, with the L.A. riots as backdrop, is 
unraveling. He shambles through life as a kind of activist voyeur. He keeps 
apart from the street life around him but the life keeps messing up his own 
anyway. He walks in on his sometime girlfriend (Lisa Zane) making love to 
another man; he watches home videos of the riot and then gets chummy with some 
crackhead revolutionaries on his apartment stoop. He fantasizes constantly, 
chugs beer, tries to talk his crazed brother (a surprisingly powerful Ethan 
Hawke) into going back into drug rehab. The IRS seizes his savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter McCarthy, the producer-writer-director of this micro-budgeted swatch of 
anomie, is better at dry, deadpan wit than righteous rage. But the wit is in 
short supply. (And sometimes it's leaden, as in the repeated interviews with 
bad-guy L.A. police chief "Merryl Fence" -- guess who?) McCarthy produced Alex 
Cox's "Repo Man" and "Sid and Nancy" and he's trying here for some of the same 
funky, desultory poetry, along with a healthy dollop of Social Consciousness. 
He doesn't quite have the skills for the job.  
</P>
<P>
 When John, in one of his frequent voice-over diary entries, tells us, "I'm a 
rationalist and I'm a romanticist," you may be tempted to offer your own 
assessment. John is a drag. Le Gros is very good at playing draggy characters, 
so at least "Floundering" has a real actor at its center. Without him it would 
be pretty rough going.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BRIDE': UNHURRIED FILM OF THOUGHT, BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "December Bride" doesn't seem terribly ambitious, unless you understand how 
difficult the creation of an authentic, self-contained world can be. Its 
accomplishments can seem likewise modest, unless you've seen enough film to 
realize the rarity of its avoidance of false steps and false emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 A film of beauty and restraint, thoughtful, intelligent and completely 
assured, the Irish "December Bride" is an experience to cherish. The winner of 
a Felix Special Jury Prize at the 1990 European Film Awards, the continent's 
version of the Oscars, the fact that it's late coming to domestic distribution 
is a function not of its qualities but of the perceived feebleness of American 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 For "December Bride," beautiful and luminous though it is, does not have a 
recognizable star or trendy subject matter. And unlike the face-licking, 
over-eager lap dogs of Hollywood, this is a film that takes its time and keeps 
its distance, that has the confidence to tell its passionate story with 
measured dignity and unhurried delicacy. All it has to offer is damn fine 
filmmaking, and where box office is concerned, that is often not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bride's" opening shot, of a woman standing alone on a lonely, wind-swept bit 
of Ireland, signals what is to come. It showcases the beauty of the 
cinematography, the presence of the land as a character in its own right, and 
the centrality of that woman to everything that is about to transpire. 
</P>
<P>
 She is Sarah (Saskia Reeves), forced by poverty to join her mother (Brenda 
Bruce) and work as a live-in servant in the house of Andrew (Geoffrey Golden), 
a small landowner with two grown sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The house is on the shores of Strangford Lough and is part of a fiercely 
Protestant community in turn-of-the-century Northern Ireland. The rhythms of 
farming, the harvesting of kelp and potatoes and the keeping of sheep are the 
stuff of life in this harsh, rain-swept and muddy land, and director of 
photography Bruno de Keyzer's exquisite photography and handsome compositions 
recognizes the beauty amid the drudgery. 
</P>
<P>
 After a terrible accident sours Sarah on the power of the almighty, she finds 
herself attracted to both of Andrew's sons, different though they are. Frank 
(Ciaran Hinds) is younger, moodier and more impulsive, while Hamilton ("The 
Dead's" Donal McCann) is reasonable, responsible but still attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Sarah's solution to this dilemma and the reaction of the community to 
her choice is the central business of "December Bride," what makes this film 
memorable is not so much what Sarah decides as the personality traits that 
shape that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 For that young woman, played with convincing passion by Reeves, is a natural 
radical, a fiercely independent spirit of the type common to literature but not 
often portrayed this effectively on screen.

 "I won't starve for richer folk, there's more to me than that," she proclaims 
at one point, and at another lashes out at the falseness of conventional 
morality, mocking the way "things can be smooth to the eye but botched inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Lines like that show the originating presence of a novel, in this case a 1951 
book by Sam Hanna Bell. As carefully adapted by David Rudkin, "Bride's" script 
convincingly presents characters capable of fashioning eloquence out of the 
fewest possible words. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Thaddeus O'Sullivan, whose clever short film "The Woman Who Loved 
Clark Gable" played briefly over here, has handled his material with a sure 
regard for nuance and gesture that is more than welcome. The result is a 
small-scaled labor of love that audiences can embrace as much as the people who 
made it.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; HENDRIX BIRTHDAY LOVE-IN SKIPS A BEAT AT CLUB LINGERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was fitting that the headliner for the Black Rock Coalition's 6th Annual 
Jimi Hendrix Birthday Love-In at the Club Lingerie Wednesday was Arthur Lee & 
Love. L.A's leading psychedelic black rocker of the late '60s, Lee's star has 
been rising again through a tribute album and cover versions that span the 
spectrum from moodmeisters Mazzy Star to proto-punks the Ramones. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lee's hourlong headlining set before a half-filled house only caught fire 
sporadically, in large part due to his decision to pay homage to his friend 
Hendrix.Fueled by the twin guitars of Michael Randle and Melvin Whittington, 
the early part of the set rocked hard, but it fell apart during a ragged, 
under-rehearsed segment of Hendrix tunes that started promisingly enough with 
"Ezy Rider" blended with Lee's "Tripping and Slipping." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacing was a problem, though -- Lee seemed lost onstage during the gaps 
between each song -- but, once the music started, he came alive with the 
natural charisma that first hooked fans 30 years ago. "Seven and Seven Is" 
remains one of the great power surge rock songs, and some new material (Lee has 
an album on a German label and is actively looking for a deal here) indicated 
he's lost little of his songwriting ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-billed Civil Rite's knack for haunting melodic hooks and vocal blends 
on their opening song was largely swamped under expertly delivered speed/crunch 
metal in the rest of the set. Also appearing was Randy Wilde & Gypse with a 
brief set of Hendrix songs and Jason Luckett. DON SNOWDEN

RESTAURANT NOTES: PEOPLE'S CHOICE OR NOT, ZAGAT HAS THE FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who says L.A. restaurant diners aren't loyal? Just check out the new 1995 
Zagat Restaurant Survey. Trendy food lovers may rush off to check out the 
newest, hottest restaurant, but they remain faithful to their old favorites, 
too. According to the pocket-sized guide, the restaurant-going public has voted 
Patina tops in the city for both food and popularity four years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zagat Survey has become an indispensable tool for serious eaters, food 
professionals and the general public. It's handy for phone numbers, addresses 
and for its thumbnail sketches of the cuisine and ambience. And it's cheap, too 
-- only $9.95. But the top 50 food ratings have always seemed somewhat 
mysterious. Are we to believe Shiro is better than Citrus? Le Chardonnay beats 
Xiomara? Brent's Deli tops Broadway Deli? Give me a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year restaurant diners are invited to fill out a detailed questionnaire 
critiquing their favorite restaurants. Once the results are in, each restaurant 
is then rated on a scale of 0 to 30, based on the computer averaging of the 
scores received from would-be critics. (Patina scored 28 on food compared with 
17 for Tony Roma's rib joint.) Selected comments from participants are also 
larded through the short text. 
</P>
<P>
 According to founder Tim Zagat of New York, who has made a bundle off the 
public's desire to be temporary restaurant critics, 5,500 people took part in 
this year's survey. 
</P>
<P>
 But some wonder how many of those 5,500 were legitimate restaurant-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is fishy," says Piero Selvaggio, who owns Valentino in Santa 
Monica, which is again rated L.A.'s top Italian restaurant (although his 
Sherman Oaks restaurant, Posto, considered to be the Valley's best restaurant, 
never made the list). "I don't believe that the public has much to do with it. 
I think (the publishers) just decide what they want to say." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just nonsense," responds Zagat. "Piero is too smart to say something 
like that; 5,500 people participated in the survey. We have been doing this for 
nine years in Los Angeles. The fact is the book has stayed the test of time. We 
go through hoops to make sure nothing like that happens." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some curiosity about the guide the first or second year," Selvaggio 
adds, "but it's slowly becoming very boring. I'm not a big fan of Zagat." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is Xiomara Ardolina, who owns one of the area's best French bistros. 
Her Pasadena restaurant, Xiomara, has never made the list of 50 top-rated 
restaurants. "I don't know why I'm not on the list. Maybe it's because I don't 
bother to fill out a questionnaire, and I don't hand them out to my loyal 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 But some restaurateurs do. "We have 30 investors, and we give (the 
questionnaire) to them to fill out," says Bistro 45 owner Robert Simon. "We 
don't do any lobbying or send out Zagat forms to large groups of people. But 
they are available here. I talked to (L.A. Zagat editor) Merrill Shindler about 
it and he told me, basically, 'Use them (the forms) at your discretion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I never said that," Shindler says. "I have never left copies at a restaurant. 
It's not something we do. We discourage restaurateurs from filling them out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very scrupulous about it," Simon says. "And I don't ask my customers to 
say anything about Bistro 45. We just tell them, 'It's Zagat time.' Many 
restaurateurs hand them out. " 
</P>
<P>
 "I handed out photocopies when I was manager at Roxxi," says Robert Ramirez, 
who now manages Val's in Toluca Lake. "A lot of customers don't know anything 
about the Zagat. If it's supposed to be the people's choice, how can they vote 
if they don't have a form?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I was that bright," says South Bay restaurateur Michael Franks, whose 
bistros Fino and Depot joined Chez Melange in the top 50 this year. "I swear 
I'm real straightforward. We never gave our customers copies to fill out. I'm 
surprised they (Zagat) even accept Xerox copies." 
</P>
<P>
 They don't. According to Zagat, the questionnaires are printed with colored 
ink in fold-out form to prevent photocopying. All photocopies are tossed out. 
"We have four or five ways to prevent ballot stuffing," Zagat says. "If we 
catch anyone trying to play that game, they won't be in the book." 
</P>
<P>
 Zagat insists no photocopies were included in this year's results. "People can 
say what they want," he says. "The Zagat speaks for itself. It's the 
best-selling guide in Southern California."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MANY NICE TOUCHES AT THE OUT TAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Out Take Cafe on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City displays no bright sign on 
the street; at night you know it by dim-colored letters on a dark awning, and a 
glimpse of customers hunched over food within. The room is a narrow storefront 
minimally modified to accommodate a long, stainless steel kitchen, banquette 
seating and a small bar area with stools and high tables. The walls are butter 
yellow, the furniture dark, battered wood. And the host wears a hot purple 
blazer, matching beret and a weightlifter's belt. Forty customers would pack 
the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is so small and unassuming and plays to a casual neighborhood 
clientele, and because the prices are so low, I expected decent, inexpensive 
food, nothing more. After several visits, I knew better: There comes a moment 
in everyone's first time at Out Take when they stop talking and frown in 
concentration, as if suddenly noticing what's in their mouths. "Wow," they 
invariably say. "This food is really good." 
</P>
<P>
 That moment came for me with the crab cakes, when I found celery root in the 
remoulade, a terrific, classic touch that's long been eclipsed by every modern 
mayonnaise concoction under the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Norman Cheng, I realized, knows what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also likes a risk: His menu is a spirited mix of Russian, Asian and 
French bistro food. Salads and appetizers tend to be more surprising and 
creative than the pastas and entrees.  
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian borscht, a clear plum-red soup with cabbage and chunks of potato, 
beet and carrots, springs to life with a generous splash of vinegar and a 
floating mass of tangy sour cream. I want some right now. In fact, I'll take 
some of that meaty black bean chili, too. Large, well-weighted soup spoons are 
a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetable wonton soup is a clean, clear broth with three beautiful noodle 
dumplings: one each of broccoli, carrot and potato. The filled half-moon pasta 
with fluted edges recurs in various other forms: as fried potato vareniki , 
mushroom dumplings, an assortment of ravioli. 
</P>
<P>
 The vareniki , golden-brown dumplings, are chewy like pot-stickers; you eat 
them with caramelized onions and sour cream. Split an order with at least one 
friend or you'll have no room for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Plump, fresh black mussels in a delicious broth with lemongrass and cream may 
be the most expensive appetizer ($6.95), but there are easily enough for four 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck confit is fall-apart tender but neither crispy nor deeply flavored; the 
endive it sits on rests, in turn, in a pool of duck grease -- tasty grease, 
mind you, but more than any one person should eat in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Most salads on the menu are meal-sized; if you want just a small plate of 
greens to eat before an entree, there's a lovely "one dollar salad" with any 
entree.  
</P>
<P>
 Like the vareniki , spicy turkey ravioli is fried, but then it's sauced with a 
strongly acidic tomatillo salsa: All told, the dish is too intense. Buckwheat 
pasta comes with sea scallops tall as haystacks and big flappy wild mushrooms 
in a pallid broth: This dish is too bland. Fedelini (which looks precisely like 
spaghetti), with tomatoes and an earthy dried ricotta cheese, is not 
remarkable, but satisfying and just right.  
</P>
<P>
 The lamb shank is classic: a big club of meat cooked to dark, sticky, 
caramelized perfection. Sliced roasted pork tenderloin is paired with a subtle, 
effective amount of bleu cheese and pine nuts. But braised chicken with olives 
tastes like yesterday's reheated stew, and is way, way, way too salty, even 
when cut with polenta. Roasted cod on mashed potatoes, another bistro classic, 
is carpeted with capers, another error of excess. After the fact, my vegetarian 
friend is told that the tawny sauce with her grilled salmon and savoy cabbage 
is made with sherry, cream and beef broth. Oops. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon sorbet is served in a hollowed-out lemon, cantaloupe in a cantaloupe, 
pumpkin in a charmingly small pumpkin. Good looks aside, the sorbets are hard 
and granular. Lemon meringue pie is the right choice. Other nice touches: 
individual press-pots for coffee and tea, and tea made from fresh mint. 
</P>
<P>
 * Out Take Cafe, 12159 Ventura Blvd., Studio City . (818) 760-1111. Open 
Monday through Saturday for lunch and dinner. Beer and wine served. Visa, 
Master Card and American Express accepted. Dinner for two, food only $23-$65.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'ENTERTAINMENT III' BURSTS WITH ADDED SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who love to escape to the golden years of the MGM musical, the 
"Deluxe Collector's Edition" of "That's Entertainment III" ($125) is nothing 
less than a piece of paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive package includes a bonanza of footage not seen in the film's 
theatrical release, along with a spectacular "Collector's Souvenir Program," 
eight reproductions of lobby cards, and an opportunity to send away for a 
limited-edition poster with stars' signatures and the original theatrical 
poster. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-disc set features seven sides that include the 119-minute director's 
cut with eight minutes of footage not seen in theaters (four sides are in 
standard play). 
</P>
<P>
 But the real treat is an additional 112-minute supplemental "Collector's 
Treasury" that for many will be the primary incentive to snap up this set. It 
is indeed a treasure trove of material never before seen. Ten outtake musical 
numbers dance out of the MGM archives. While some are not in the pristine shape 
we may have wanted, they are nevertheless fascinating historical footnotes that 
otherwise would have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights: "My Intuition," sung by Judy Garland and John Hodiak and 
dropped from the 1946 "The Harvey Girls"; Frank Sinatra crooning "Boys & Girls 
Like You and Me," deleted from the 1949 "Take Me Out to the Ball Game"; Jane 
Powell singing "Why So Gloomy?," cut from the 1946 "Holiday in Mexico"; Betty 
Comden & Adolph Green-Roger Edens' "An Easier Way," filmed with June Allyson 
and Patricia Marshall and snipped from 1947's "Good News." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's more: Harry Warren and Arthur Freed's "Why Is Love So Crazy?," 
sung by Esther Williams and cut from 1950's "Pagan Love Song," and Judy Garland 
singing "Last Night When We Were Young," trimmed from 1949's "In the Good Old 
Summertime." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Holliday's wonderful rendition of "Is It a Crime?" from "Bells Are 
Ringing," also available on the 1960 film's earlier laser release, has been 
restored to its original stereophonic audio sound for this edition. The final 
outtake: the incomparable Lena Horne singing "You Got Looks," trimmed from the 
1956 "Meet Me in Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 The care with which "That's Entertainment III" was assembled for this laser 
edition is indicative of the meticulous attention to detail that has become the 
hallmark of MGM/UA Home Video special-edition laser releases. The original film 
itself was reassembled on video from the original source materials so that the 
picture would be properly positioned for the home screen. Soundtrack elements 
were remixed for stereo sound from original multichannel pre-recordings, then 
mixed to six-track DTS digital stereo for the laser. 
</P>
<P>
 Detailed chapter search notes on every disc make it possible to find favorite 
numbers and singers easily. In addition, analog tracks offer pre-recordings of 
many songs from original studio sessions. They're all carefully marked, and 
easily found via the clear chapter search notes. Laserbits 
</P>
<P>
 New Movies Just Out: "Getting Even With Dad" (MGM/UA, $35); "Little Buddha" 
(Buena Vista, letterboxed, $40); "The Favor" (Orion, $40); "Clifford" (Orion, 
$40); "The Birds II: Land's End" (MCA/Universal, $35); "Speed" (FoxVideo, $30); 
"Black Beauty" (Warner, $35); "Wyatt Earp" (Warner, $45); "Crooklyn"

</P>
<P>
 Coming Soon: Columbia TriStar will release "Brainscan," with Edward Furlong, 
on Wednesday at $35; Touchstone's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" is due 
Thursday at $30.

THEATER BEAT; 'BAAL': UNLEASHING ANOTHER SIDE OF BRECHT'S INNER BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Bertolt Brecht play is the last place you'd expect to find a riotous gush of 
romanticism. Yet a newly translated adaptation of "Baal" by Shem Bitterman and 
Brian Peeper at 2nd Stage Theatre illuminates the emotional wild side beneath 
the German dramatist's more familiar austere intellectualism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baal," Brecht's first play, celebrates the life of an amoral poet whose 
insatiable appetite for excess, debauchery and flouting the conventions of 
bourgeois society leads inevitably to self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Brecht revised the work periodically during his lifetime, and previously 
translated versions suppressed much of its fervor beneath the author's 
signature detachment and political ideology. For this production, the adapters 
returned to the first two versions, which contain entirely new passages steeped 
in naked psychological autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting episodic portrait of the artist as a young brat is convincingly 
and passionately performed by Jon Matthews. His Baal indulges earthly impulses 
with the abandon of an uncaged animal even as his soul reaches for the sky. In 
multiple roles, the well-cast ensemble reflect the world's stance toward Baal 
-- usually disapproval or indifference. Particularly effective are the 
performances from Mia Furlan, Deborah Offner and Jessica Hecht, who add layers 
to their generic virgin/whore characters. Paul Gutrecht is also notable as the 
wandering musician Baal befriends and then betrays. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's original score supplies haunting, introspective 
tonalities that emphasize the work's brooding atmosphere. The work is tightest 
in the more story-driven first half, and while it later bogs down in lengthy 
monologues detailing the poet's inner state, the unchecked excess is a powerful 
revelation of the author's own turmoil -- a flood of feeling bursting through 
the restraints of intellect. With an emotional life this out of control, it's 
not surprising Brecht would one day try to make his Epic Theater a place of 
cerebral detachment. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Baal," 2nd Stage Theatre, 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, 
Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends Dec. 4. $15. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 
hours, 50 minutes. 'H.I. Vato': Life of a Social Outcast 
</P>
<P>
 "H.I. Vato," Alberto Antonio Araiza's solo performance piece about life as an 
HIV-positive Latino Buddhist, unfolds at Highways with the searing eloquence of 
articulate personal history. 
</P>
<P>
 Araiza is one of the relatively fortunate ones still healthy a decade after 
being diagnosed with the AIDS virus. Yet in this dispassionate plea for 
understanding, rather than sympathy, the systematic social isolation he 
encountered, especially in the early years of the plague, is in its own way as 
harrowing as any physical affliction. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the first time he told someone he was infected, he recalls, "What I 
remember vividly is the sense of him pulling away." Losing many friends to 
their own fears, Araiza learned the hard way the unspoken motto of the 
infected: Tell no one. 
</P>
<P>
 He's past that -- fortunately, because his story is worth telling. An engaging 
raconteur, Araiza straddles Latino and Anglo cultures and comments wryly on 
both from the perch of a social outcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, there's plenty of denial, anger, frustration and sorrow in 
his narrative, yet he finds humor and strength in surprising places. The most 
affecting episodes are related as simple personal anecdotes -- the death of his 
father, or a funny/sad tryst in a leather bar. On occasion, however, the impact 
is undermined by over-posturing. A director's hand would help shape Araiza's 
powerful warning to those who wait until they get some bad news before they 
decide it's time to live. 
</P>
<P>
 * "H.I. Vato," Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica . Tonight, Saturday, 8:30 
p.m.; Sunday, 7:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $10. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 2 
hours. 'Peccadillo' Unfolds at Its Own Pace 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years of marriage, the great symphonic conductor Vito DeAngelis 
(William Dennis Hunt) and his wife, Rachel (Barbara Beckley), know each other 
so well she can recite his next words even as he speaks them. 
</P>
<P>
 The tightly orchestrated intimacy from these two likable performers supplies 
most of the charm to be found in "Peccadillo," an otherwise stubbornly slight 
comedy that even David Rose's handsome staging for the Colony Studio Theatre 
barely redeems. 
</P>
<P>
 Garson Kanin's polite, innocuous comedy depicts the temperamental maestro's 
dalliance with his ghostwriter (Denise Dillard), which triggers Rachel's 
retaliatory affair with her own ghostwriter (Robert Stoeckle). 
</P>
<P>
 Both writers are ornamental devices in a plot determined never to address the 
uncivil consequences of adultery. Lacking the frenetic pacing usually 
associated with bedroom farce, these leisurely exploits of an eccentric Italian 
musical egoist play like "Lend Me a Tenor" on Thorazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Peccadillo," Colony Studio Theatre, 1944 Riverside Drive, Silver Lake. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Dark Dec. 19-Jan. 4. Ends Jan. 8. 
$18-$20. (213) 665-3011. Running time: 2 hours, 10 minutes. PHILIP BRANDES

TV REVIEWS; TIP OF THE HAT TO 'THE HOLLYWOOD WESTERN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Haley Jr.'s "100 Years of the Hollywood Western" manages to survey with 
some insight and admirable comprehensiveness a genre with more than 20,000 
titles, spanning footage taken of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show a century ago 
to a spate of Westerns currently in production. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure-fire entertainment, it's deeper on research -- the clips are terrific -- 
than on thought. The special's hosts are Charles Bronson, James Coburn, James 
Garner, Gene Hackman, Robert Mitchum, Kurt Russell and Jane Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley points out that the "Old West" lasted only a few decades but captured 
the popular imagination enduringly with its endless possibilities for tales of 
high adventure. He and co-writers Aubrey Soloman and Phil Savenick touch many 
bases, and they constantly keep us aware of the movies' peerless capacity to 
turn sometimes sketchy history into potent myth; in doing so, they also manage 
a tip of the hat to the most famous Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
 What they might have made clearer is that the Western became America's 
morality play, and that the difference between John Wayne and Clint Eastwood is 
that, in the 1960s, Sergio Leone and the spaghetti Western injected an 
existential quality to Westerns, blurring the distinction between the good guys 
and the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Once past a nod to pioneer Bronco Billy Anderson, William S. Hart, who brought 
realism to the Western, and Tom Mix, who brought glamour to it, Haley gives the 
silent era short shrift; surely, "Covered Wagon" and "The Iron Horse" rate at 
least mentions. (Serials -- silent and talkie -- aren't dealt with at all.)  
</P>
<P>
 There are apt discussions of the treatment of legendary historical figures, 
and there are entire sequences devoted to cliche expressions, lawmen, 
gunslingers, saloons, singing cowboys, Native Americans, frontier women and the 
eradication of the buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ford and John Wayne were so inextricably linked that Haley is able to 
deal with Ford's career in the context of the Wayne homage. Most other major 
directors of Westerns barely rate a mention, however, even though their films 
are glimpsed. You'll not hear the names of Budd Boetticher, Raoul Walsh, 
Michael Curtiz or Anthony Mann; perversely, Haley credits the direction of 
Mann's 1960 remake of "Cimarron" to his former father-in-law, Vincente 
Minnelli.

THEATER BEAT; 'UKRAINE' TRIES INTIMATE LOCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Dick Vosburgh/Frank Lazarus show "A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the 
Ukraine" played the Wilshire Theatre in 1982, critics noted how skimpy it 
seemed at such a large theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Alley and director Anne Drecktrah try to make it work in their 76-seat 
tent on the grounds of the TV academy.It's now "a night in North Hollywood," so 
to speak. But it's still featherweight and forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half is a creaky musical revue about old Hollywood. Most of the 
performers, dressed as ushers, occasionally leave the main stage and venture up 
to a mini-stage on a platform at the back, which is built so we can see only 
the feet and calves of the dancers -- from this, we can guess which legendary 
stars they're playing. This little device quickly wears thin. 
</P>
<P>
 The only scene worth mentioning -- or doing -- from "A Day in Hollywood" is a 
tap routine in which the cast recites rules from the old Production Code. 
Clever. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, the same cast stages a faux Marx Brothers presentation of 
Chekhov's "The Bear." The impersonations of the Marxes -- Gene Freedman as 
Groucho, David Koff as Chico, Susan Mackin as Harpo, are well done, as is Susan 
Sandel's Marguerite Dumont. But it still seems like a pale reflection of the 
real thing, which is now easily available on video. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine," Actors Alley at the TV academy, 
5220 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 
7:30 p.m. Ends Dec. 18. $18. Tonight's performance is a pay-what-you-can 
benefit for Equity Fights AIDS. (818) 508-4200. Running time: 2 hours, 5 
minutes. DON SHIRLEY

TV REVIEWS; FAUX PAIRINGS HURT 'SINATRA DUETS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Singer Luis Miguel is describing how his "duet" with Ol' Blue Eyes isn't 
actually a first, since, like everyone, he used to sing along with the great 
one's records in the car, shower, etc.: "Actually, I've sung with Frank Sinatra 
-- he just doesn't know about it!"  
</P>
<P>
 The question is, does Sinatra know about it even now? 
</P>
<P>
 There's no concrete evidence that he does in "Sinatra Duets," an hour special 
airing on CBS tonight that's basically an infomercial for the Chairman's two 
much-hyped "Duets" albums, the second of which is newly released. As is 
well-known, Sinatra cut his half of all the duets live in the studio with an 
orchestra, leaving his superstar counterparts, many of whom he has never met, 
to overdub their parts weeks or months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoying the faux-tandemness on record requires a not-insurmountable 
suspension of disbelief. On TV, the attempted illusion of togetherness is just 
awkward as hell -- at times, comic. 
</P>
<P>
 Very much a cipher in his own special, Sinatra appears to have had little 
participation beyond allowing himself to be filmed singing some of these 
numbers in the studio or in concert; onto this footage, guest stars such as 
Anita Baker, Aretha Franklin and Neil Diamond are, yes, superimposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Director George Schlatter does about the best he can given that Sinatra 
couldn't or wouldn't shoot material exclusively for this special, but it gets a 
little creepy when Sinatra's concert footage has been noticeably sped up or 
slowed down in spots to make his lips match the recordings. Or when Patti 
LaBelle, Frank Sinatra Jr., et al. mug and gesture as if there really were 
someone standing next to them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting enough to see the bits of a still-strong Sinatra working in 
the studio that you come to resent the parade of digitally imposed partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything here for more discriminating fans? Absolutely: several swell montages 
of vintage TV and movie clips, which spotlight a succession of younger Franks 
sharing legitimate camera space with (among others) Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly, 
Dinah Shore and -- most pricelessly -- a rare role-reversal duet with Elvis on 
"Love Me Tender" / "Witchcraft." 
</P>

JAZZ NOTES: MUTUAL RESPECT PULLS '50 FINGERS' TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When two pianists play together onstage, it's the jazz world's equivalent of a 
summer day without smog in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Which makes "Fifty Fingers," the second concert in Ambassador Performing Arts' 
"Sounds of Genius" 1994-1995 jazz season, all the more enticing. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, taking place at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena on Dec. 7 at 8 
p.m., finds pianists Kenny Barron, Alan Broadbent, Dick Hyman, Roger Kellaway 
and Gerald Wiggins playing solos and duos. The duos are comprised of Barron and 
Broadbent, Barron and Wiggins, Wiggins and Hyman and Hyman and Kellaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rarity of the format, many pianists seek out these encounters. For 
instance, Kenny Barron has recorded with John Hicks, Hyman made an album with 
Kellaway, and Broadbent recorded with Bill Mays on an album led by altoist Bud 
Shank. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadbent talked about the feelings that come from teaming with another 
keyboardist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to be close musically, to literally be inside the other person," said 
the New Zealand native who now lives in Santa Monica. "It's like getting to 
know the person, and their music, that much better. It's all about 
communication, for me anyway. So if we can attain that kind of communication, 
playing with Kenny, whom I deeply respect, it will be joyful." 
</P>
<P>
 There are pitfalls to such pairings, Broadbent says, as when both artists play 
too many notes, creating the clashes musicians call train wrecks. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if Kenny is soloing, I'll be careful how I accompany, play something 
supportive rather than something that interferes," he says. "Otherwise, it gets 
too confused for me, and I'm always concerned about clarity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty Fingers" is the second of six jazz concerts this season at Ambassador. 
The season opened with Stanley Turrentine on Oct. 6, and also includes the 
Kings of Swing (with Terry Gibbs and Buddy DeFranco) and the Tonight Show 
All-Stars (with Tommy Newsom, Ed Shaughnessy, Conte Candoli and others) on Jan. 
19; pianist Gene Harris' Quartet and All-Star Big Band on Feb. 11; vibist Milt 
Jackson and singer Ernestine Anderson on Feb. 25; and sax giant Sonny Rollins 
on May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for "Fifty Fingers" range from $22.50 to $25.50; three-concert series 
tickets, which include Rollins, Harris and the pianists, are from $52 to $58. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (800) 266-2378; (818) 304-6161. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Barron: Before the Dec. 7 Ambassador concert, Barron will play an 
infrequent date as a sideman performing with saxophonist Mel Martin's quartet 
Dec. 2 and 3 at the Jazz Bakery in Culver City. The program, partially funded 
by the National Endowment for the Arts, will feature the music of Benny Carter 
and others.

 Another Pianist: "I hope Sara wins," pianist Jacky Terrasson said on Tuesday, 
unaware that Paris-based singer Sara Lazarus had won the Thelonious Monk 
International Vocal Competition, held Sunday and Monday in Washington. With 
Lazarus' victory, it's the second consecutive year that Paris-based artists 
have won the Monk competition. Terrasson, a native of Berlin who was raised in 
Paris, won in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And while it's too soon to tell what will happen to Lazarus' career as a 
result of her winning, Terrasson's victory in 1993 set off a bidding war, which 
resulted in him getting what he terms a "great deal" with Blue Note Records. 
The pianist's self-titled debut, which finds him playing with his trio -- 
bassist Ugonna Okegwo and drummer Leon Parker -- will be out in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some previous Monk winners -- most notably Joshua Redman -- Terrasson 
was not an unknown before his victory. He had played with drummer Art Taylor's 
Taylor's Wailers, and the day after his victory, he embarked on an eight-month 
stint with singer Betty Carter, which included a stop at Catalina Bar & Grill 
in Hollywood. Still, he acknowledges the push his career got from the Monk win. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a springboard. It projects you out into the public eye," he says 
from his current home in New York. "But I try not to rely on the victory. It 
doesn't show how great or bad I am." 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist isn't working a lot right now -- he's awaiting the album's 
release, which will be celebrated by a weeklong gig at the Village Vanguard in 
New York, followed by a number of club and festival dates in the U.S., Europe 
and Japan. "I'm going to be busy," he says."

UNCERTAIN VOYAGE; NOTRE DAME KICKER SAILER STRUGGLES WITH HIS CHOICE OF SPORT, 
COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The football field at Notre Dame High is a mosaic of earth tones as the 
Knights' kicking specialists gather to practice their craft before the rest of 
the team arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling across the battered turf, Chris Sailer moves his kicking tee back 
from yellowed grass near the 20-yard line to a patch of sickly green sod at the 
40 and finally into the dark brown mud of midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 At each stop the result is the same: After a quick exchange between snapper 
and holder, Sailer launches the ball more than 60 yards off the tee and between 
slightly skewed goal posts. The solid thump of foot hitting leather is audible 
on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have (Sailer) practice extra points from the 20-yard line now," 
Notre Dame special teams coach Jeff Kraemer says, grinning. "When he was a 
sophomore he'd barely hit balls over the scoreboard, but now (if they are 
kicked from the ten) they go well over it and onto speeding cars on Riverside 
(Avenue). It's actually quite dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing Notre Dame and its senior kicker has been a real hazard for the 
Knights' opponents this season. The team is 10-1 entering tonight's Southern 
Section Division III quarterfinal against Royal at Moorpark College, and 
Sailer's rocket-launcher of a right leg has both benefited his team and 
established him as one of California's top kicking prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer, who acquired his foot skills and leg strength through years of playing 
youth soccer, has received little coaching on his punting form and nearly none 
on his kicking. Nonetheless, in his third year of varsity football the 
17-year-old Burbank native has made all 30 of his extra-point attempts and 16 
of 21 field-goal tries for a total of 78 points. He has tied the state record 
for field goals in a season and his phone number is beginning to show up on the 
auto-dial of college football and soccer recruiters across the country.  
</P>
<P>
 Sailer has not only scored in every game this season, he has consistently 
pinned opponents deep in their own territory by booming kickoffs through the 
end zone and craftily dropping punts near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our defensive success has been because of him," said Notre Dame 
Coach Kevin Rooney, who plucked Sailer out of a freshman physical education 
class and has seen his field-goal percentage and punting average rise each 
season. "I think his effect on other teams is tremendous, because I know our 
offense hates to start on their own 20 with the whole field in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer is effective on the soccer field as well. The son of German parents 
with a deep love for the game, Sailer first played at age 5 and was competing 
nearly year-round when he was 9. Currently a member of the California Stars 
soccer club, he suits up in shorts for the Stars on weekends and in pads with 
the Notre Dame football team during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 He also plays for the Notre Dame soccer team during the winter season, taking 
a break from club competition to dominate the Mission League, in which he was 
last year's most valuable player, from his center-midfield position. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer's lifelong dream has been to play national-level soccer and eventually 
in the World Cup, and the local college programs he would want to be a part of 
are definitely interested in him. On the other hand, his knack for booting a 
pigskin has football recruiters in hot pursuit of his talents. The choice is 
not made any easier by the fact that Sailer carries a 4.0 grade-point average 
and is unsure of what he wants to study in college. He also must take into 
consideration that football programs are wary of offering scholarships to 
kickers early in the recruiting process. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Sailer is at a crossbar in his life. Which university to attend? 
Which sport to play? Which program is best? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known since I was a sophomore that I would have to make a decision 
(between football and soccer) and I was hoping I'd have decided by now," Sailer 
said. "But I probably won't know until the day I make the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Several college football programs are doing their best to make it easier for 
Sailer to plot his course. Notre Dame coaches have told him they are desperate 
for a kicker and will definitely be offering one a scholarship, and, less than 
24 hours after Stanford kicker Eric Abrams missed what would have been a 
game-winning field goal against UCLA, Cardinal coaches called and said Sailer 
would have a good chance to play as a freshman in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is UCLA that has wooed Sailer with particular ardor and might have the 
inside track. The Bruins invited him to their 1994 summer football camp, have 
brought him to cookouts with lavish spreads and attractive recruiting 
hostesses, and installed him and Notre Dame teammates David Dupetit and David 
Sobel on the Rose Bowl sidelines for the Bruins' recent victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is flattering to Sailer but not overwhelming. The phone calls and 
frequent requests for videotape of his performances will no doubt increase once 
the season is over and recruiting picks up, but he is aware recruiting 
coordinators are paid for their ability to sweet-talk prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're gonna do and say what they need to get the best players," said 
Sailer, who booted a season-long 58-yard field goal against St. Francis three 
weeks ago. "I listen, but it's just words. Once they offer me a scholarship, 
then I'll believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 One coach who believes in Sailer is Rooney, whose perpetually worried 
expression might have been more severe had his kicker not made four field goals 
of more than 50 yards this season and appeared stress-free whenever he trots 
onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
 A prime example of Sailer's composure came last weekend in Notre Dame's 
first-round playoff game against Santa Barbara. The Dons' fans heckled him 
during warm-ups before the start of each half, but they were forced to eat 
their words when Sailer kicked three field goals, including one of 52 yards, to 
pace the Knights' 22-17 win. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seems immune to pressure," said Rooney, who has seen opposing coaches 
claim Sailer's cleats are too long and watched teams use consecutive timeouts 
to try to rattle him. "He's able to overcome things that might distract other 
kickers." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those distractions is the field at Notre Dame. Despite efforts by the 
grounds crew, the field's center strip has been uneven at best and a quagmire 
at worst. Hardly ideal footing for a kicking specialist, but Sailer even 
considers it a distinct home-field advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty deceiving out there because even if the ground looks solid on 
top, it may be wet underneath," said Sailer, who consistently loses his footing 
in practice. "I have the advantage, though, because I get a feel for the good 
and bad spots and (opposing kickers) only have five or ten minutes before the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've fallen a couple of times in games, mostly on kickoffs, but not badly 
enough to cause a miss." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Knights advance in the playoffs, look for opponents to bring 
earth-moving equipment and hoses along with their helmets and shoulder pads.

A RUN FOR THE BORDER; FOOTBALL IN CANADA MAY LACK GLAMOUR OF NFL, BUT PRINGLE 
MAKING MOST OF OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the Canadian Football League, not the NFL, and he's playing for a 
no-nickname team in Baltimore that the courts won't let be called "Colts" 
because of a suit filed by the team in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Television coverage? Sure, there's an occasional appearance on ESPN2, where 
you can catch a CFL game now and then along with the calf roping and jet ski 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 But former Kennedy High standout Mike Pringle doesn't care. At 27, he's still 
playing football, and that's the important thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a good college career at Cal State Fullerton a few years before the 
school suspended the program. And Pringle had his shot in the NFL too, but 
things just didn't work out. It's been too long now for Pringle to think much 
about the might-have-beens. 
</P>
<P>
 And frankly, he's starting to like this CFL thing anyway, especially the way 
this season has been going. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be only the CFL, but Pringle is the most successful running back in 
it this year. He finished the regular season with 1,972 yards in 308 carries, a 
league record for single-season rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 And getting that many yards is even more of an accomplishment because of the 
CFL's three-down rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little different, but it's still good football," Pringle said. "The 
only thing is that a lot of running backs in this league get turned off by 
having only the three downs. That makes it more difficult. You have to get most 
of your yardage on first down. There's more chance the quarterbacks will be 
throwing the ball on the other downs. But I've been getting the chance to run 
the ball 20 to 25 times a game, which is out of the ordinary for a running back 
in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle had a good shot at surpassing 2,000 yards. Had he done that, he would 
have been one of only a handful of players on the pro level to scale that 
mountain. Only two NFL runners have done it: Eric Dickerson, when he gained 
2,105 with the Rams in 1984, and O.J. Simpson, who had 2,003 with Buffalo in 
1973. Herschel Walker gained 2,411 in 1985 when he played in the USFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle gained 71 yards in the regular-season finale against Sacramento, 
falling 28 yards short of 2,000. It was especially disappointing because he 
appeared to be home free with 62 yards in the first half. Baltimore, however, 
fell behind and went to an all-out passing game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that I was capable of getting it, and that's the important thing to 
me," he said. "It turned out to be out of my control, and I hardly touched the 
ball in the second half. I'll just leave it at that. I'm not usually that much 
into stats, but I'll admit that bothered me a little." 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't diminish what Pringle did accomplish for a team that has 
advanced to Sunday's Grey Cup championship game. He also caught passes for 442 
yards and set a CFL record for yards from scrimmage (2,414). He missed the 
league record for all-purpose running, including kickoff returns, by 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the best season I've had," Pringle said. 
</P>
<P>
 His final collegiate season in 1989 certainly wasn't shabby. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle will be remembered at Fullerton for his 357-yard rushing effort in 31 
carries against New Mexico State. It tied an NCAA single-game rushing record, 
but it was broken the next weekend. He finished the season with 1,727 yards, an 
average of 157 a game. That ranks as the 23rd-best effort in NCAA history. His 
2,690 all-purpose yards that season is the fourth-best in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might have been the toughest player I ever coached," former Titan Coach 
Gene Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons, the second player chosen in the 
sixth round of the NFL draft. He made the team as a rookie in 1990, and led the 
Falcons in kick returns during the exhibition season, but cracked ribs forced 
him to sit out much of the season. He came off injured reserve for three games 
late in the season, but had little success. He failed to make the roster the 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle played the next two seasons in the World Football League for 
Sacramento, and led the team in rushing in 1992 when it won the league 
championship. The World League shut down, but the CFL expanded into Sacramento 
in 1993. That again gave Pringle new life in football. 
</P>
<P>
 He was traded to Baltimore when the CFL expanded there this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had been using Mike primarily as a blocking back, not a lead runner," 
said Jim Popp, Baltimore director of player personnel. "We knew we were getting 
a good running back, but it was a stroke of luck on our part for it to have 
turned out this well." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle says he enjoys what he calls "the faster pace of CFL football," 
compared to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have 20 seconds between plays instead of 45," Pringle said. "I 
remember the first CFL game I played. I was wondering how I was going to play 
in this league at that pace. I thought I was in good shape, but everything 
happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 After this season, does Pringle think there's a chance an NFL team might be 
interested in him? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had tryouts before, and it just didn't happen for one reason or another 
so I don't worry about it," he said. "It would be nice to have more options, 
but it's not something I think that much about. This season has been fun, and 
I'm just enjoying that."

FARRELL NO RUN-OF-THE-MILL COACH; CROSS-COUNTRY: QUIET LEADER HAS PUT THOUSAND 
OAKS' BOYS', GIRLS' TEAMS AT THE FOREFRONT OF PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who has been to a high school cross-country meet at Mt. San Antonio 
College in Walnut has seen it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first mile -- as the field heads up the initial hill on the 
three-mile course -- most coaches head toward the base of "poop-out" hill, just 
before the two-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The steep incline is regarded as the make-or-break portion of the course, so 
it is there that coaches congregate to urge on their charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks High Coach Jack Farrell rarely ventures to that point, however. 
Fact is, he says little to his runners during a race. 
</P>
<P>
 He usually sits back and observes the proceedings before congratulating his 
proteges after a job well done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt that by the time race day rolls around, the kids should be 
ready to roll," Farrell says. "If you've prepared them properly, they should be 
ready to race. There's very little you can say to them during a race that is 
going to change things." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Farrell's style is unconventional, it's highly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks boys have won six Southern Section major-division titles 
since 1980 -- no other team has won more than two -- and the Lancers swept the 
boys' and girls' Division I titles in last Saturday's section finals. 
</P>
<P>
 That feat made Thousand Oaks the first program to win both major-division 
section titles in the same year. The Lancers are favored to become the first 
program to sweep the Division I titles when the state championships are held at 
Fresno's Woodward Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never worked with an easier group of kids than I'm working with right 
now," Farrell said. "It's a team with a very low whine factor. I've spent 
seasons with kids trying to barter workouts with them, but this team, boys and 
girls, top to bottom, doesn't do anything to try and change the workouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Many factors -- ranging from a strong local youth program, to training in 
ideal weather conditions, to competing in one of the strongest high school 
cross-country counties in the nation -- have been attributed to Thousand Oaks' 
success, but the 49-year-old Farrell has also played a major role. 
</P>
<P>
 His importance was painfully obvious after he stepped down from coaching after 
the 1988 cross-country season to pursue an administrative career. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Dunlap, an assistant under Farrell in 1988 and the top runner on the 1979 
Lancer squad that finished second in the Southern Section 4-A Division 
championships, was left in charge of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Don Goetzinger, then a teacher at Thousand Oaks and a former area youth 
coach, took over the boys' team in 1990 and Dunlap coached the girls. Friction 
between the coaches caused both programs to suffer. Neither the boys' nor 
girls' teams advanced past the league finals in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Team members were demoralized. Some kids cut workouts and others parked their 
cars at points along a training route, where they would hop in and drive back 
to school instead of completing the run. But the thing that made Farrell cringe 
was kids saying, "we (stink)." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to leave a school and move on and hear about the program that 
you coached falling on hard times," he said. "But it's completely different 
watching it happen right in front of your eyes. It's much harder to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Thousand Oaks, Farrell wanted to return to coaching and teaching 
English after two years at the administrative level. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed the excitement of meets during his absence, felt too far removed 
from students and grew tired of being a trouble-shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people love that, management by crisis and problem solving, but I'm not 
one of them," said Farrell, who resides in Thousand Oaks with his wife Kathi 
and two step-daughters. "I like to take tasks from beginning to end and be done 
with it. You can do that in the classroom and you can do that on the athletic 
field. . . . My life is very sequential and I like that, but administration is 
not like that at all. I hated it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' fortunes have improved since Farrell's return. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys placed sixth in the 1991 Southern Section Division I championships 
and have won three consecutive titles. They are the defending state Division I 
champions and are ranked third in The Harrier magazine's national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls placed sixth in last year's state Division I finals and won their 
first section title last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its winning tradition, Thousand Oaks has gained a reputation as a 
high-mileage program whose runners are sometimes overtrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell concedes that stereotype might have had some validity in the past -- 
his boys' teams ran as many as 80 miles a week between 1979-85 -- but he's made 
major alterations to his training regimen since returning to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers no longer run twice a day, their weekly mileage rarely exceeds 50 
and they no longer alternate hard training days with easy ones. Rather, team 
members train at what Farrell calls a "comfortably fast" pace every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, I thought more was better," Farrell said. "My feeling was that 
if some team was running 60 miles a week and beating us, we needed to run 70. . 
. . But I concluded that a lot of that mileage was garbage mileage done to 
boost up the weekly total. We don't have any junk miles anymore. Everything is 
high quality stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Lower mileage is not the only alteration Farrell has made in his coaching 
methodology over the years. His approach to mentally preparing his team for a 
meet has also changed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Farrell, a 1963 graduate of Notre Dame High, took over the cross-country 
program at Thousand Oaks in 1975, he was as rah-rah as most coaches. Pep talks 
were a mainstay of his repertoire. But that changed in 1977 after his varsity 
boys' team performed poorly in a meet against Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the race, Farrell delivered a speech he said would have "made Knute 
Rockne proud." But after his team lost, he was fuming. He was so furious, he 
didn't give a word of advice to the team before the Ventura County 
championships the following week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized then that pep talks might do more good for coaches than for 
runners," Farrell said. "I haven't given a pep talk since." 
</P>
<P>
 Several days preceding a race, Farrell goes over the layout of the course and 
the recommended way to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 The early preparation not only puts Farrell at ease, allowing him to stay calm 
during races, but it has a soothing effect on his runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that we always felt relaxed before races," Dunlap said. "We were never 
nervous. Some of that might have been because we knew we were good, but some of 
that was also because of him. . . . He broke the races down into separate parts 
so that once you were out there, you knew exactly what you were supposed to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith O'Doherty, the top runner on this year's team, says that Farrell's 
approach is particularly helpful in major meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tries to not put too much emphasis on the big races," O'Doherty said. "He 
doesn't hype up the big races. He views every race as important and that keeps 
you from getting nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Fischer, the No. 2 runner on this year's team, did not start running 
until he was a freshman at Thousand Oaks, so high-decibel coaches seem like 
oddities to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different for me to see other coaches out there on the course yelling 
and screaming at their kids," he said. "(Farrell) pretty much lets us go out 
there and do our own thing."

</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes lost most of their height when 6-foot-8 Nick Alexander transferred 
to Westlake earlier this year. Alexander averaged 15.9 points and 10.1 rebounds 
a game as a sophomore. His departure creates a huge hole at center. Calabasas 
must get continued improvement from Coleman, who averaged 10 points and 5.5 
assists a game as a freshman. Marque and Walker are the best from the junior 
varsity. They must fill out the roster and provide depth if Calabasas hopes to 
move out of the league basement. Moorpark 03,14,08,07 1994 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE

</P>
<P>
 Four players who started at least part of the time last season return, plus 
Ahearn, who would have been a starter but missed the entire season because of a 
knee injury. Tate, a transfer from Taft, and Donahue will help with depth in 
the backcourt. "We don't have any stars or go-to guys," Bednar said. "But these 
guys know their roles." Moorpark has been eliminated in the playoffs by La 
Canada in two of the past three years. Nordhoff 03,14,08,07 1994 OVERALL LEAGUE

</P>
<P>
 Hall coached last year at Antelope Valley High and inherits only one returning 
starter, but Rigby hasn't practiced yet because he's a starting running back on 
the football team. Christiansen is the only other returnee with experience. 
Like most league teams, the Rangers will play an up-tempo offense to offset 
size limitations. Santa Clara 03,14,08,07 1994 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 20-9 8-0

</P>
<P>
 Not only do the Saints have both starting guards from a team that reached the 
state semifinals, Cvijanovich has one of his tallest and deepest teams. 
"Usually I'm lucky to get kids who are 6-foot-1 and 6-foot-2," he said. Santa 
Clara has 20 players on the roster, including Dotson, a transfer from 
Louisiana, but the experience of Smith (8.3 ppg., 2.4 steals per game) and 
Ferguson should lead to another league title. Santa Paula 03,14,08,07 1994

<P>
 The Cardinals' fortunes will depend on how far Escamilla takes them. One of 
the league's tri-players of the year, Escamilla averaged 17.8 points and four 
rebounds a game. Santa Paula has enough height to play a half-court game, a 
rarity among league schools.

CLEESE & CO. BUILDING A BETTER 'FISH'; 'DEATH FISH II' HAS THE SAME CAST AS 
'WANDA' BUT THEY SAY IT ISN'T A SEQUEL. GO FIGURE! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "How many sequels can you think of that were better than the originals?" asks 
John Cleese, not entirely rhetorically, calling from London. "It's quite an 
interesting question. The percentage is something like the number of good 
comedy scripts you get sent through the letterbox. There are two. . . . Can you 
think of any?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, some folks would say "Godfather II," we proffer, playing along with 
stump-the-interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right. And the other one is 'Aliens,' some people think. But those are 
the only two that I've ever seriously had put forward. And that seems to me a 
function of the fact that they're intrinsically not very interesting. Either 
most of the creative people are rather less interested, or even if they're the 
same, somehow the first one comes with a lot of baggage that weighs down the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "(So) we're actually quite frightened that people will think this is a sequel, 
because we think that most people would not be interested if they thought it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 What's "this" object of Cleese's stated antithesis to Roman-numeral projects? 
</P>
<P>
 "Death Fish II." 
</P>
<P>
 But not really. That's the working title -- destined to be changed, alas -- 
for Cleese's long-awaited follow-up to the hugely successful 1987 farce "A Fish 
Called Wanda," which marked the last time he graced the screen as script writer 
or leading man. Word has circulated for years that a sequel of sorts was 
cogitating through Cleese's creative pipeline, even if the title character did 
get killed off in the first installment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin and Kevin Kline characters did 
survive "Wanda's" fin . But no matter. The follow-up -- which goes into 
production for Universal this spring -- will reunite the same principal cast of 
four, but as five all-new characters (Kline has two roles in this one). It's 
"an equal, not a sequel," or so goes the catch phrase coined by Kline. 
</P>
<P>
 You could also think of it as the second project from an extremely unprolific 
repertory company. Whatever you call it, reuniting an ensemble cast for a 
non-sequel is just about unheard of in contemporary English-language cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 The new characters will be markedly different in temperament as well as name. 
Says Cleese, "Knowing that I wanted to use the same people, and not wanting to 
do a sequel, I simply reasoned that to make them really as different as 
possible from the characters they'd played in 'Wanda' was the smartest thing I 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore: Instead of being mocked by Kline for his stutter, Palin's character 
will be roundly excoriated for never shutting up. Kline, who played the nastily 
none-too-bright Otto in "Wanda" (and won an Oscar for it), will play two 
sharper characters, a tycoon and his marketing-executive nephew. Curtis 
graduates from a life of crime to the exec fast track, too. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cleese himself, stretching for polarity, will portray a former Hong Kong 
cop "who has got a lot more balls than old Archie had in 'Wanda,' but isn't 
really very romantic in his attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese's co-producer, Michael Shamberg ("Wanda," "Pulp Fiction"), prefers that 
the audience would see the project as the grand resumption of "a great comedy 
team," and acknowledges the likelihood of the public perceiving this as a 
sequel works both for and against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we want it both ways," Shamberg says. "We want all the goodwill that 
we get for reteaming, with none of the pressure of trying to do a better 
version of a film that was already good to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Young, who's directed Cleese in about 50 TV commercials, will take the 
on-set reins over from "Wanda's" Charles Crichton -- who, at 85, "has agreed 
that he's a little too old now to direct a full feature film, though he's 
helping us on the script," Cleese says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new film will be something of a slapdash morality play, whereas "Wanda" 
was better described as an amorality play. The infusion of ethics is 
deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, 'Wanda' I think was a very nice little farce, but it wasn't 
about anything much," Cleese says. "And by the time I realized that it wasn't 
about anything much, I only had time to put a little bit of stuff in that had 
any resonance to it, which was the stuff about the English and Americans -- 
about which I consider myself an expert, since I've married three Americans. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "But on this one, (co-writer) Iain Johnstone and I really started with more of 
an idea -- it's basically something to do with values . That sounds a bit 
tedious for a comedy, doesn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Farcical "Death Fish II" will be, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a comedy first and foremost," says Johnstone, taking the phone from 
Cleese during a break from a script touch-up. "But then, what preoccupies one 
is, how do I live my life -- and it's quite nice to be able to work that out in 
comedic terms. Obviously that's John's great gift: He makes more jokes than 
Ibsen, as it were." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Cleese, coming back on line: "It's a disaster if you preach. We 
discovered this on Monty Python. Graham Chapman and I once or twice got cross 
about things we'd read in the newspapers and we tried to write sketches about 
them. They were never funny. Nevertheless, we all agreed that Monty Python was 
at its best when we were doing material that was 'about something.' For 
example, 'Life of Brian,' which is very much about something, seems to be much 
the best film we made. So it's a very delicate line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese has walked another delicate line with his career. It's nigh impossible 
to think of any other remotely bankable comedy star who's so fin-icky. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly the biggest star to emerge out of the Monty Python troupe, and 
perhaps the most widely respected name in contemporary British comedy, he's 
studiously avoided taking lead roles not of his own making in recent years, and 
hasn't "starred" in any film since "Wanda" seven years back. Not because 
nobody's asking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wanda" was a huge hit that made about $190 million internationally, from a 
$7.5-million budget (after every studio but MGM passed on it, "too British" 
being a common rejection note). 
</P>
<P>
 But he's taken his sweet time crafting a follow-up. He and co-writer Johnstone 
have been working on "Death Fish II" for 2 1/2 years, though rumors of its 
development go back much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 His unapologetically leisurely scripting pace -- and not-impoverished country 
lifestyle -- are financed through his TV commercials and bit parts in films 
like "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" and the upcoming "Jungle Book." Bigger roles 
he turns down as a matter of course, citing the dearth of decent comedy scripts 
from writers not as painstaking as he. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quite proud of my writing record," Cleese says. "If you take 'Fawlty 
Towers,' which I wrote with Connie Booth, I think everyone thinks those are 
good comedy half-hours. But what they don't know is, Connie and I took six 
weeks to write each one. Well, if you take six weeks to write a comedy 
half-hour, you bloody well ought to get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I can afford to, because I can traipse off and do a commercial for four 
days and earn all the extra money that then enables me to take all the time to 
get the script right, when the fee for that is very small. So the acting 
subsidizes the writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's also true to say, for what it's worth, I really have never much 
enjoyed acting on film. I once compared it to spending three months at Heathrow 
Airport waiting for your plane to take off. I find it immensely boring and not 
very satisfying at the end of the day. Whereas if Iain and I sit down and 
produce 2 1/2 sheets of words, at 5 o'clock I feel I've added something to the 
sum total of the knowledge in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But isn't Cleese selfless enough to take stock of the pleasure people derive 
from seeing him on -screen? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think yes. But I've always felt that the people who like my work, I 
suspect, are bright enough to know that it works because the script is good, 
you know? If I started doing bad scripts and believing the people who would 
tell me, 'Oh, don't worry, you'll make it funny,' I would be dead in two years 
-- I mean, professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that happen to Sellers. I worked with Peter Sellers on several movies, 
and I saw again and again how people somehow -- by playing, I suppose, to a 
kind of vanity -- persuaded him to take on projects that were simply not good 
enough. That's why he made so many bad films. And the moment you think that you 
can save bad material because you're such a good actor, I think that's the 
moment your career is dying fast."

WHAT'S FUNNY, FRACTURED AND FOLK?; COMEDY: EARNEST TROUBADOURS, THE L.A.-BASED 
FOREMEN SET TO MUSIC GENTLE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SATIRE.

 The affable quartet of musicians takes the stage at LunaPark sporting Four 
Freshmen smiles and Reservoir Dog suits. With a plunk of upright bass and a 
strum of guitars, they break into sparkling, pristine four-part harmonies that 
call to mind the achingly hopeful voices of such late-'50s folk music notables 
as the Weavers, the Limeliters and the Kingston Trio. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is fractured folk.  
</P>
<P>
 A song that begins by sweetly invoking a day when "the call of the dove can be 
heard 'cross the land" ends looking forward to a world where there are two 
phones in every car and "Kinko's and Starbucks wherever you are." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Hell Froze Over Today," condom dispensers are installed in the Vatican, a 
Congressional Medal of Honor is presented to Dr. Timothy Leary and rich folks 
beg to be heavily taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dulcet tones and forthright manner of earnest pop troubadours, this 
L.A.-based bunch of good-natured folk satirists serves up political humor, 
social critique and a slightly bent vision of current events. With the recent 
release of a live album, "Sing It Loud!" and a running engagement Saturdays at 
LunaPark through Dec. 17, the 10-year-old group brings its message of faith, 
hope and comedy to the people.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing on the line between phony folk and sincere folk," says 
multi-instrumentalist Doug Whitney. "The Foremen is partly a goof on the lesser 
folk groups of the late '50s, but there's also a point of view in our material, 
and we take that seriously."  
</P>
<P>
 That pointed material springs from songwriter Roy Zimmerman, who came up with 
the concept of the Foremen in a record store bargain bin nearly 10 years ago. 
"I picked up an album by the Wayfarers," explains the Bay Area native, 37. "I 
found the album hysterically funny because they looked like five very white 
premed fraternity brothers in matching suits, who had decided to sing about how 
hard it is to be a Negro, and the perils of mining and whaling and all sorts of 
things they knew nothing about. The look stuck with me, and when I began to 
write songs in that style, the political satire came through."  
</P>
<P>
 That formula has led to such crowd-pleasers as "Peace Is Out," a Mamas and the 
Papas-style paean to ill will; "Don't Vote," a rockabilly plea to "put the 
'mock' back in "democracy"; and the timely, rockin' carol "Buy War Toys for 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 The current group of Foremen has been together for two years and includes 
bassist Andy Corwin and percussionist Kenny Rhodes. "We've got a low-tech, 
low-glamour appeal," says Zimmerman, "if 'appeal' is the right word."  
</P>
<P>
 He keeps material fresh for the group by keeping an eye on the headlines and 
building songs around the issues and characters that creep into the public 
consciousness. "Our Oliver North song was written when he wasn't much of a 
factor in his Senate race. We almost had to explain it to audiences. But as the 
race got weirder, the song got stronger. Now, after eight months, we have to 
retire it -- but we can reactivate our Jesse Helms song because he's suddenly 
back to haunt us in a big way."  
</P>
<P>
 The sentiments that come through in the group's music are unabashedly liberal, 
but the members hope that partisans of any political stripe could get a chuckle 
from tunes like the danceable presidential dig "Do the Clinton" ("Slide over to 
the middle . . . lean to the left a little, now lean a lot to the right"). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten laughs from a crowd of Republicans in Newport Beach," Corwin 
says, "and we really do want to entertain those people too."  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be a head-on confrontational group," Rhodes says. "There's 
no way you can get people to laugh when you're yelling at them. Then satire 
degenerates into ridicule."  
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman also wants to avoid bringing the ugliness of the campaign trail onto 
a stage. "I think these last elections were a good example of a lot of people 
running for office by preying on the public's fears and angers," he says. "We 
don't want to use that approach in entertainment any more than we want to see 
it in politics."  
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's a little harder 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman feels the world-at-large is ready for the Foremen, adding that the 
group's philosophy can be boiled down to a few simple dictums. "Things matter. 
It's all right to care about stuff. And it's OK to think. What's good for the 
Foremen right now is that people are talking about politics and social issues 
more than before. Activism, which has had a bad name for the past 15 years, may 
be ready for a popular resurgence."  
</P>
<P>
 In a world where extremist expressions of fear and loathing are increasingly 
passing for political discourse, can the gentle pokes and prods of the 
Foremen's skewed folk make a difference?  
</P>
<P>
 Corwin gives voice to the group's modest goals. "There are what -- 5 billion 
people on the planet? If we can reach out to just, say, 4 1/2 billion of them, 
we'll have put in a good day's work." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Foremen appear Saturdays through Dec. 17 at 8 p.m. at LunaPark, 665 N. 
Robertson, West Hollywood, (310) 652-0611. $15 charge ($12 each for groups of

SOME ILL WINDS SWIRLED OVER DIRECTING OF 'VAMPIRE'; MOVIES: CRITICISM, THEN 
PRAISE, FROM THE BOOK'S AUTHOR WAS JUST PART OF NEIL JORDAN'S CHALLENGE IN 
BRINGING THE STORY TO THE BIG SCREEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wanna see a gothic thriller? Dark intentions and bared fangs? A subject that's 
been around so long it could qualify as the undead? How about "The Making of 
'Interview With the Vampire' "? 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't one -- yet -- but Neil Jordan could star, as an Irish director of 
small, quirky films caught up in a swirl of ill wind and cult fervor, trying to 
make a mainstream movie out of a basically plotless novel. He'd have his most 
critical casting choice second-guessed by the writer, a Morticia Addams 
look-alike -- who then changes her mind. And he'd go on a publicity tour for 
the film while visions of Irish revolutionary Michael Collins (to be played by 
Liam Neeson) are dancing in his head. 
</P>
<P>
 During that tour he would sit in a Manhattan hotel room, with an air of 
tea-time fatigue, and say something ironic like "Perhaps Hollywood is 
changing." Well, at least making "Vampire" wasn't as bad as his 1989 flop 
"We're No Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case," the director said of his oft-derided collaboration with David 
Mamet and Robert De Niro, "I was a director for hire, and it didn't make any 
sense. Somebody else could have done it better than me, 'cause what they wanted 
wasn't what I can give. So I just made a rule for myself, that I've got to have 
a certain amount of freedom. Otherwise I can't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan -- who between "We're No Angels" and "Interview With the Vampire" made 
a not-so-little independent feature called "The Crying Game" -- claims to have 
been given his freedom this time. "It was remarkable really, given the size of 
the budget" -- a reported $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He also got his share of Hollywood-style contretemps via "Vampire" author Anne 
Rice's vehement objections to the casting of Tom Cruise as Lestat -- the 
veteran ghoul who sucks the tortured interviewee, Louis (Brad Pitt), into the 
"life" of coffins and moonlight. Rice experienced such a change of heart after 
actually seeing the movie that she ran ads to say so. Considering book sales 
and everything, this might suggest to the less romantic among us that her 
public tantrum was a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea," Jordan says, convincingly. "She certainly doesn't mind 
inviting the press into her house, though, does she? I mean, I wouldn't do 
that, y'know. But we didn't speak when we were making the movie. In the end, 
when she saw the film, she loved it, that's all I know. I've only spoken to her 
twice in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Rice really loved it, then she's eerier than we already suspected: an 
author who appreciates a director remaking her vision into his own. "Interview 
With the Vampire" is, besides being a film of occasionally startling violence 
and quarts of blood, an exercise in camp. Gone is much of the dark tonality of 
the book, with Cruise cracking the kinds of jokes that would have done "Love at 
First Bite" proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were the laughs wrong?" Jordan asks. "I just thought some things were 
inherently funny. They're eating rats? It's hilarious. Well, then, let's have 
'em eat a poodle. Let's get some chickens. Isn't there something funny in 
Louis' dilemma -- a vampire who won't kill?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but George Hamilton would have been cheaper than Cruise and Brad Pitt, 
and Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea, all those love hunks made up to look as 
if they need naps and transfusions. But alas, this is a big-budget vampire 
tale, one that suggests a litany of allusions (although it was first published 
in 1976, before AIDS had a name), and all of which Jordan dismisses. 
</P>
<P>
 "What fascinated me was the idea that there's no moral responsibility, 
y'know," he said. "Louis becomes a vampire and has to do these unconscionable 
acts to survive. And he says, 'Why is there no punishment? Why isn't God 
punishing me?' And, of course, nobody punishes him and that's what drives him 
nuts. I thought it was an amazing moral question. I thought if you could bring 
that to the forefront then you'd have a story." 
</P>
<P>
 He says that efforts to find metaphors in "Vampire" are an attempt to justify 
the book's darkness; he'd rather depict an amoral universe. "And that's not a 
metaphor," he says, "it's a question." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan is not, like so many other readers of Rice's "Vampire Chronicles," a 
longtime fan. "David (Geffen) asked me to do it, is how it happened," Jordan 
said. "He sent me the book, I read it, I read Anne's script, and I said I'd 
love to do it but I have to do it as an independent movie. I have to have my 
own way with the screenplay 'cause that's what I am, a writer." 
</P>
<P>
 A writer "lost in the world of multimedia," as he puts it. Jordan began his 
career as an author of fiction, then became a scriptwriter and began directing 
when his scripts were ill-used by others. On "Interview," however, he gets no 
writing credit. "The Writers Guild has decided it's her screenplay," he said. 
"Maybe they're right. Her script needed quite a bit of work, and I did quite a 
bit of work on it." 
</P>
<P>
 When Jordan speaks, there's a lilt and a hint of impatience. He seems tired, 
if not of vampires then of talking about them. His next project will be more of 
a "European film," a biography of Michael Collins, the man who made the Irish 
Revolution happen. He's ready to get on to it. "Interview" took a total of 17 
years and several aborted efforts to get to the screen. It's time for the sun 
to come up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why it took 17 years," he says. "Maybe there's something 
inherently unfilmable in the book. In which case it's still there."

CUBAN PIANIST FINALLY FINDS U.S. AUDIENCE; JAZZ: THE LATE EMILIANO SALVADOR WAS 
DENIED A VISA TO PLAY IN THE U.S., BUT AN INDEPENDENT LABEL RELEASE OF HIS LAST 
ALBUM HAS DRAWN CRITICAL PRAISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEILA COBO-HANLON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who know the music of Emiliano Salvador say he played the piano as if he 
had a demon inside, with the same kind of driving energy heard in the music of 
Thelonious Monk. They call him a man of extremes -- too nervous, too intense, 
drank too much. And those who talk about his drinking and his dreams also call 
him one of Cuba's finest jazz pianists. 
</P>
<P>
 For Carlos Puerto Jr., the bass player on his last album, he was simply the 
best. "He was the most original pianist Cuba has had, the man who best blended 
all the roots of Cuban music with American music," said Puerto during a phone 
interview from his home in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador was a master at fusing traditional Cuban dance rhythms -- 
cha-cha-cha, charanga, danzon and mambo -- with traditional jazz elements, in 
what would be his stylistic trademark, a dynamic blend of old and new. 
</P>
<P>
 Why then, was this man, described as "terribly underrated" by his friend 
Paquito D'Rivera, not better known?  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't become more internationally famous because he was in Cuba, and he 
was ostracized (here)," says Arturo Gomez, musical director of WDNA-FM, a jazz 
station in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez first heard Salvador in 1978, when he got hold of his first album, 
"Nueva Vision," distributed by a Mexican label. "It had Arturo Sandoval and 
Paquito D'Rivera, and I just said, 'This record is fantastic!' " Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador's career began auspiciously. Born into a family of musicians (his 
father was a pianist), Salvador won a scholarship to study percussion at the 
Escuela Nacional de Arte in Havana but quickly switched to piano. He eventually 
hooked up with songwriters Pablo Milanes and Silvio Rodriguez, and together 
they initiated the revolutionary song-writing movement known as nueva trova.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, Salvador became Milanes' pianist and arranger. 
</P>
<P>
 But once he branched out and started to record his own music, things began to 
sour, according to his brother Carlos, who now lives in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had many disappointments, his tours wouldn't pan out, his contracts 
wouldn't pan out. . . . The Ministry of Culture always promoted other artists." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Rivera, who dedicated his album "40 Anos de Descargas Sonoras" to Salvador, 
says the pianist was "ignored by the Communist cultural authorities."  
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, Salvador had another big problem: He drank. Reportedly, 
a lot.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was very musical, and very well regarded," says Arturo Sandoval, "but he 
was very introverted, very insecure. He couldn't go out on stage without 
drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador's problems were compounded when a hand injury took him out of the 
performance circuit for several years. When he was well enough to play again, 
he practiced like crazy, got the best engineer in the island and recorded his 
fifth album, "Ayer y Hoy," in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Salvador) was very prepared," says Puerto, the bassist. "Most of the album 
was recorded on first takes. The way you hear it is the way he played it the 
first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador was so pleased with the results, that, says his brother, "he told my 
mother, 'After this record, Mom, I can die. This music will last forever.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One month later, he took a afternoon nap in his home in Puerto Padre, Cuba, 
and died of a heart attack in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 41. 
</P>
<P>
 He left behind five brilliant recordings, of which his last one, "Ayer y Hoy," 
is arguably the best. 
</P>
<P>
 But he would have surely remained largely unknown in the United States, where 
he was twice denied a visa to perform, had he not been heard by Ned Sublette, 
co-owner of QBADISC, an independent U.S. record label specializing in Cuban 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a monster, a monster," says Sublette, who first heard Salvador play 
during a jazz festival in Havana in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Sublette was so impressed with Salvador that he expressed an interest in "Ayer 
y Hoy" even before it was recorded.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard (Salvador) had died, I wasn't even sure he had finished the 
album," said Sublette. But he did something unusual: Instead of waiting for 
"Ayer y Hoy" to be released in Cuba and licensing the existing recording, 
QBADISC leased the rights to the album and released it last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the recording was made with limited resources, (there were only two 
studios to choose from, neither of which has cutting-edge technology), the 
quality is surprisingly good. 
</P>
<P>
 While Salvador had opted for a bigger sound with hefty horns in his past 
albums, in "Ayer y Hoy" he sticks to the essentials, with only bass, drums and 
Cuban percussion supporting the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Always a sucker for old music, he recruited his friend Milanes (who, as an 
established Cuban musician was instrumental in getting studio time) to sing two 
old boleros. Otherwise, the album is pure Salvador, blending Cuban rhythms with 
jazz improvisations reminiscent of McCoy Tyner, Chick Corea and Chucho Valdez.  
</P>
<P>
 Testimony to Salvador's appeal is the critical acclaim given to "Ayer y Hoy" 
and the fact that QBADISC plans to release "Nueva Vision," his first album, as 
a CD. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in an ironic twist of fate, Salvador is finally getting the recognition 
he so wanted in the United States -- the country he desperately wished to play 
in -- two years after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ayer y Hoy" can be purchased in major record stores, or by contacting 
QBADISC, P.O. Box 1256, Old Chelsea Station, N.Y., N.Y., 10011. List price 
$14.98.

NEW GO-GO'S: A TOUR WITHOUT BITTERNESS; POP MUSIC: THE ALL-FEMALE BAND MADE IT 
BIG IN THE EARLY '80S, THEN BROKE UP. THEY HOPE THAT THIS REUNION IS PERMANENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "C ute, bubbly, effervescent."  
</P>
<P>
 In what is for the Go-Go's a three-word mantra of sorts, guitarist Charlotte 
Caffey has summed up an image that has stuck since its early '80s heyday, much 
to the band's chagrin. The first all-female band ever to make it big, the 
Go-Go's were celebrated for their fun-loving charm, for their best-buddies 
camaraderie and for the garagey pop songs that propelled their first album, 
"Beauty and the Beat," to a six-week stay at the top of the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we weren't that way, but there were other sides to us," Caffey 
says now, looking back on the Go-Go's misadventures in the image-making game. 
</P>
<P>
 Her argument is partly supported by the 1981-vintage "Beauty and the Beat," 
which had its moments of winking irony to go with the cute, frothy stuff, and 
it is completely clinched by the darker, troubled tone of the band's third and 
last album, 1984's critically esteemed but commercially disappointing "Talk 
Show."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still trying to sort out in my mind how much we were responsible for it," 
ventures bassist Kathy Valentine, sitting with Caffey and rhythm guitarist Jane 
Wiedlin in a North Hollywood rehearsal studio. "Society was going, 'Here's a 
successful girl band.' It's almost like we couldn't be accepted and embraced. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we were non-threatening," Wiedlin jumps in, finishing the thought. "If 
we had been angry, it wouldn't have worked." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's so great now," Valentine resumes. "Women (rockers) are accepted 
as being sexual, angry, crude -- all the things it was acceptable for guys to 
be all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned by past pitfalls, cognizant of present possibilities, the Go-Go's are 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate cause of the band's return is the recent release of "Return to 
the Valley of the Go-Go's," a double-disc retrospective of hits and rarities. 
</P>
<P>
 As they did in 1990, when they regrouped for the first time to play an 
environmental benefit concert and promote the release of a greatest-hits 
package, the Go-Go's will do a short tour, which includes shows Thursday and 
next Friday at the Wiltern Theatre. Former Bangles guitarist Vicki Peterson 
will fill in for the pregnant Caffey, who will avoid the rigors of the road 
until after her February due date. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Go-Go's aim to keep their reunion going. The members say that 
touring in 1990 enabled them to get over whatever hurt feelings remained from 
the band's bitter initial split. 
</P>
<P>
 When they heard that I.R.S. Records was preparing a more complete 
retrospective release, the Go-Go's, who weren't happy with the 1990 hits 
package, decided to reconvene for the sake of quality control and to add new 
material.  
</P>
<P>
 "This retrospective was going to be put out with or without our involvement, 
and it was a perfect excuse to get together again," singer Belinda Carlisle 
said in a separate phone interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides dipping into personal archives for tapes of early gigs and rehearsals, 
the band recorded three new songs for the retrospective, all of them catchy, 
overtly ironic garage-pop fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It inspires us to want to make another record together," said Carlisle. 
"That's a big possibility down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this just another case of fashionable rock reunion-itis? 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I keep looking at it, there are opportunities that keep coming to 
bring us back together, and this time we're not going to fight it," says 
Caffey, invoking fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we'll know if the Go-Go's have artistic validity or mean 
anything is to do a record," Valentine says. "We made ourselves really happy 
with (the new songs) we've recorded." 
</P>
<P>
 In their first run, the Go-Go's succumbed to the pressures of being young and 
suddenly famous. Infighting set in, and Caffey and Carlisle were hampered by 
substance-abuse problems. Wiedlin was the first to leave, in 1984. Caffey and 
Carlisle gave up drugs, then decided upon sober reflection that they didn't 
want to be Go-Go's anymore. They declared the band finis in the spring of '85, 
to the chagrin of Valentine and drummer Gina Schock. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Go-Go's are in their mid-30s, except for Caffey, a fresh-looking 40.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not putting any pressure on ourselves," Carlisle said. "Getting serious 
and intense about it is going to take the enjoyment out. I want to have fun 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Go-Go's play Thursday and next Friday at the Wiltern Theatre, 3790 
Wilshire Blvd., 8 p.m. Thursday sold out, Friday $25 and $35. (213) 380-5005 .

HOME ENTERAINMENT; FAMILY FILMS EVERYONE CAN ENJOY

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're going to rummage through the video store this weekend to look for 
entertaining family movies that might satisfy all the relatives, here are some 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 CBS-Fox's "State Fair" (1945). Starring Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews, this 
marvelous musical chronicles the adventures of a family at the Iowa state fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's "Sounder" (1972). A powerful, moving drama about the trials of a 
black family in Louisiana during the Depression, with Paul Winfield and Cicely 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA's "Yours, Mine and Ours" (1968). A cute tale about a widow (Lucille 
Ball) with eight children who marries a widower (Henry Fonda) with 10 kids. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA's "Meet Me in St. Louis" (1944). Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien star 
in the story about upheavals in the life of a family in turn-of-the-century St. 
Louis. Many Garland buffs consider this her best musical. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal's "Parenthood" (1989). Steve Martin and Dianne Wiest head a huge 
cast in this sprawling comedy/drama about assorted struggles to raise children. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner's "The Color Purple" (1985). Director Steven Spielberg's sentimental 
drama spans several decades in the life of a Southern black woman (Whoopi 
Goldberg) and focuses on the value and strength of family bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM/UA's "Mrs. Miniver" (1942). A riveting drama about a genteel British 
family nobly coping with World War II. Oscars for best picture and best actress 
(Greer Garson). 
</P>
<P>
 RCA/Columbia's "A Raisin in the Sun" (1961). Starring Sidney Poitier, this is 
a comedy/drama about an upwardly mobile black family considering moving into a 
white neighborhood. Disregard its dated, pre-civil-rights era take on relations 
and concentrate on the spirited interplay among family members. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal's "Dad" (1989). A warm-hearted story about a son (Ted Danson) 
who has to care for his ailing father (Jack Lemmon) when mother (Olympia 
Dukakis) is hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS-Fox's "The Diary of Anne Frank" (1959). This grim drama, seen through the 
eyes of teen-aged Anne (Millie Perkins), is about the Frank family hiding out 
from the Nazis in Amsterdam during World War II. Though the subject is 
depressing, the movie is really uplifting, showing how family relationships 
survive under the most harrowing circumstances. Shelley Winters won a best 
supporting actress Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's "The Godfather" (1972). This violent gangster epic, starring 
Marlon Brando (best actor Oscar) and Al Pacino, may seem like a strange movie 
to recommend for Thanksgiving weekend but, underneath, it's really about the 
strong family ties that motivate the members of the Corleone family. And isn't 
this holiday all about strong family ties? Woodstock on Video 
</P>
<P>
 If you weren't at Woodstock last summer and missed it on cable, the 165-minute 
video "Woodstock '94," which just came out on PolyGram at $25, is an adequate 
summary of what happened. But don't expect any knockout musical performances 
because there aren't any. There's more quality music in any 10 minutes of the 
tape of the original Woodstock concert than you'll find in this entire video. 
What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting Even With Dad" (MGM/UA). Neglected by his dad (Ted Danson), a 
youngster (Macaulay Culkin) gets even by hiding the coins his dad stole in a 
heist. The plan is to blackmail dad into being nice to him and also into 
quitting the burglary business. A predictable, corny family comedy that places 
Culkin in some "Home Alone"-type situations. Not a very good movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Buddha" (Miramax). Buddhist monks are convinced that the 10-year-old 
son of a Seattle couple (Bridget Fonda and Chris Isaak) is the reincarnation of 
their late leader (Keanu Reeves) and encourage the youngster to become 
spiritually enlightened. Director Bernardo Bertolucci intersperses this tale 
with flashbacks showing how the leader became spiritually enlightened. Stunning 
visuals perk up an otherwise slow, serene tale. If you're in the mood for 
something high-energy or are at all cynical, skip this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin Lawrence: You So Crazy" (HBO). A 90-minute film of a concert featuring 
comedian Martin Lawrence, of the TV sitcom "Martin," yakking about 
relationships and everyday life. Brash and vulgar, he's the reigning champ of 
black street humor -- the '90s Eddie Murphy. If you like Lawrence and this kind 
of gutter humor, this is a very funny tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carmen Jones" (FoxVideo). One of the last of the all-black Hollywood musicals 
was a 1954 pop version of the opera "Carmen," pairing Oscar Hammerstein II's 
lyrics with Bizet's music. Harry Belafonte plays a soldier who falls under the 
spell of the seductive vamp Carmen Jones (Dorothy Dandridge). Notable in film 
history because Dandridge, whose vocals are dubbed by Marilyn Horne, was the 
first black women nominated for a best actress Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clifford" (Orion). An obnoxious 10-year-old named Clifford visits his uncle 
(Charles Grodin) who's out to show his fiancee (Mary Steenburgen) he doesn't 
hate kids. Meanwhile, this brat nearly ruins the uncle's life. Much of the 
humor comes from the casting, with adult Martin Short playing the malicious 
youngster in a free-wheeling Jerry Lewis-style wackiness. Very silly family 
comedy that most will find annoying, but it's an OK movie if you're in a mood 
for very stupid slapstick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monkey Trouble" (Columbia TriStar). An unhappy young girl (Thora Birch) 
feeling unappreciated by her parents harbors an escaped monkey who's a skilled 
pickpocket. She has to hide the monkey both from her parents and his crooked 
owner (Harvey Keitel), who wants the animal back. Fairly enjoyable family film, 
featuring a terrific performance by Keitel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops and Robbersons" (Columbia TriStar). The home of the Robbersons is used 
as headquarters for a police stakeout, setting up clashes between bumbling Mr. 
Robberson (Chevy Chase) and a tough cop (Jack Palance). Mostly unfunny and a 
waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Favor" (Orion). A romantic comedy with a far-fetched premise. Seeking a 
vicarious thrill, an unhappily married woman (Harley Jane Kozak) still lusting 
after an old high-school flame (Ken Wahl) asks a single pal (Elizabeth 
McGovern) to flirt with him. But sparks between the old flame and pal send the 
married woman into a jealous tizzy. Mild entertainment with a TV sitcom feel.

'LIFE': BRIDGING GAYS AND THE HEARTLAND; TELEVISION: AS THE NEW YORK-BASED SHOW 
HAS GREATLY INCREASED AFFILIATES, IT HAS SOUGHT TO HEIGHTEN UNDERSTANDING AND 
SHOW THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF GAYS AND LESBIANS IN SOCIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 When "In the Life" first kicked up its heels in 1992, only six public 
television stations in the United States chose to air the trailblazing gay and 
lesbian program. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the New York-based magazine show enters its third season this weekend, 
it can now be seen on nearly 60 PBS stations in cities as diverse as San 
Francisco, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Louisville, Ky. This growth in exposure -- 
particularly in America's heartland -- is no small feat for the first and only 
nationally broadcast television series reflecting gay and lesbian culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of (public television) stations are being run by conservative people, 
so it's quite a step for them to run our show," says John Catania, a producer 
and publicist for "In the Life." "They know they're going to get that heat (for 
broadcasting a gay and lesbian series), but still they've made the decision to 
air us. That really says something about the merit of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the show's more pronounced national profile hasn't made 
fund-raising significantly easier for its producers. Though it has received 
corporate funding, "In the Life" is subsidized largely through contributions 
from viewers and a few small foundations. Indeed, budget considerations were 
partly behind the decision to air four one-hour episodes this season rather 
than the eight half-hour programs that were broadcast last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fund-raising from show to show," offers producer Charles Ignacio. "But 
miraculously, we've been able to get it done by the skin of our teeth. This new 
format gives us more breathing time to concentrate on fund-raising between 
production periods, as well as an opportunity to present some issues more in 
depth." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly a surprise that "In the Life" has been roundly criticized by some 
conservative religious groups and political figures. Before the first episode 
had even aired in 1992, then-Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) 
erroneously chastised PBS on the Senate floor for funding a gay and lesbian 
program. In fact, PBS has never endorsed or helped to finance the show. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the principal goals of "In the Life" is to heighten understanding of 
gays and lesbians by exposing them as a socially, vocationally and ethnically 
diverse group whose members can be found in all aspects of society. Included in 
this season's premiere episode are interviews with two employees from AT&T and 
Time Warner, who discuss their experiences of being openly gay in the 
workplace. There is also a feature on Native American gays and lesbians and a 
segment on Amanda Bearse, an actress on the popular Fox sitcom "Married . . . 
With Children." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to show the contributions of gays and lesbians in society," 
remarks Catania, who is part of the do-it-yourself program's small but 
versatile five-person staff. "We are constantly battling (anti-gay sentiments) 
and all those things out there that tell us we're a drain on society. We're 
breaking down those stereotypes. We are in more places than people think." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Life," which is hosted by Katherine Linton, a professional clown and 
educator who is one of the show's producers, has elicited a variety of 
responses from the gay and lesbian segment of its audience. Some have found the 
program too mainstream and wish it would flash more of the irreverent spirit 
that lesbian comedian Lea DeLaria brought to an early episode. But for other 
viewers -- particularly those in areas like the Midwest and South -- this type 
of gay and lesbian magazine show for the whole family is something of a 
godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recently got a letter from a 16-year-old who sat down and watched the show 
with his parents," says John Scagliotti, the show's founder and executive 
producer. "He said the program allowed his parents to see that there's more to 
being gay or lesbian than sex. We've tried to develop a show that's not 
sensational. We want to be able to bridge the generational differences too." 
</P>
<P>
 * "In the Life" airs Sunday at midnight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

THEATER REVIEW; DATED 'OWL AND PUSSYCAT' IS AT SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Theatre District, a recent addition to the county's storefront troupes, 
goes in for old Broadway plays. Their latest, "The Owl and the Pussycat," is a 
case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bill Manhoff's comedy about a pair of San Francisco apartment dwellers 
opened in 1964, it was considered an incipient sign of changing times. The two 
characters definitely did not fit the uptown mold. 
</P>
<P>
 One, a would-be writer who works in a bookstore, is a pseudo-intellectual 
mope. The other, a would-be model who turns tricks, is an illiterate prostitute 
working out of her living room. Both were regarded, on Broadway at least, as 
daringly downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that the counterculture had yet to be invented, let alone 
mainstreamed. Beatniks still hung around North Beach and the hungry i. The Free 
Speech Movement was just getting started in Berkeley. And Vietnam was no more 
than a rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to maintain that sort of perspective to appreciate why "The Owl and 
the Pussycat" seems so far away and long ago. But even if you do, it doesn't 
help explain why anyone would bother to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhoff's two-hander isn't seen much anymore -- and for good reason. Its 
language has gone stale. (When is the last time you heard someone called a 
"pansy fink?") It strains for wittiness. ("I may be a prostitute, but I'm not 
promiscuous.") And its characters are sadly outdated caricatures. 
</P>
<P>
 To breathe a semblance of life into "The Owl and the Pussycat," you need a 
pair of charismatic actors with appealing idiosyncrasies. Anything less will 
sink like a stone. (Alan Alda and Diana Sands sold the original production. The 
subsequent movie was a dopey vehicle for George Segal and Barbra Streisand.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the Theatre District, Alexandra Hoover (Doris) and John Bowerman (Felix) 
try to project their personalities onto their roles with a dogged combination 
of hard work and goodwill. But inexperience and slight talent eclipse their 
effort. The result, on opening night, was a long, sluggish evening. 
</P>
<P>
 A less-than-luminous first act comes off best because the situation is being 
established: Doris barges in on Felix in the middle of the night, angrily 
looking for a place to stay. She has been evicted from her apartment because he 
has spied on her through his window and has complained to her landlord about 
her professional activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The second act bogs down interminably with six separate scenes -- count 'em, 
six -- each duller and more repetitive than the previous as an emotionally 
needy Doris and a coldly cerebral Felix take up living together. By the time 
the silly third act arrives, with more of the same, the play has seriously 
overstayed its welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The detailed set looks like a painstaking labor of love. All the design 
elements seem right: bookshelves crammed with books, an apt living-room sofa 
and desk, cozy upstairs sleeping loft. The atmospheric kitchen window, painted 
on the wall, is a crowning touch -- especially when lighted to create the 
effect of a moonlit night. The costumes, too, are well-considered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the production's elaborate trappings don't compensate for the emptiness of 
the play or the unseasoned performances. "The Owl and the Pussycat" is no hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Owl and the Pussycat," the Theatre District, 1599 Superior Ave., Costa 
Mesa. Friday-Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m. Ends Dec. 18. $12. (714)

WHERE TO FROM HERE?; RALPH NADER, KING OF THE ACTIVISTS, IS STILL GOING STRONG. 
SO WHAT DOES HE WANT NOW? HE SAYS THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PARTIES ARE 
FOSSILS, AND HE WANTS CONSUMERS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE POLITICAL AGENDA.

<P>
 The November midterm elections might signify a major watershed to most social 
analysts, but not to Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the most vapid issue list in years," he says of the national 
campaigns. "It just shows you the voters are not organized to shape the 
agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 Partisan battles don't interest him since he considers both political parties 
to be fossils. "Just remember they have no membership, they have no grass-roots 
-- it's all electronic combat -- raising money, writing checks and putting 
these absolutely ridiculous 30-second ads on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation, Nader, a towering 6 feet, 4 inches, is soft-spoken, but he's 
as intense as any politician. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrives at a neighborhood bookstore/coffeehouse (a Nader hangout he dubs 
"democracy center") for an interview loaded with supplemental reading -- a 
Harvard Business Review essay on "Economics and the Oval Office," a flyer for 
his "Civics for Democracy Textbook" and other Nader-issued materials, all 
feeding into his overriding goal: to see consumers shaping the political 
agenda.  
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all we own as people, but don't control," he says. "We own the public 
airways, we own $4 trillion of pension funds, trillions of dollars in savings 
deposits and mutual insurance assets, all the public lands in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are enormous wealth, but we don't grow up saying, 'Gee, we own this 
together.' All we think about is owning a car, or a house." 
</P>
<P>
 Sipping cranberry juice and eating an oatmeal cookie (he is a 
semi-vegetarian), he discusses the gaps in the '94 campaign rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only had health care disappeared from the national agenda, he notes, the 
candidates campaigning on the "crime issue" were talking about street crime, 
ignoring the kind of corporate crime Nader wants to hear critiqued: "The 
looting of pension funds, the bank debacle, occupational hazards, consumer 
frauds -- these are all taboo campaign issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think commercialism is more rampant today than any time in our history," he 
says. "It's attacking our other value systems -- our health and our safety." 
</P>
<P>
 At 60, Ralph Nader, the founder of modern consumerism, remains a full-time 
activist. Heading the Center for Study of Responsive Law, a few blocks up 16th 
Street from the White House, he reads, speaks, writes and travels nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had an enormous influence historically," says Steve Brobeck, a consumer 
historian and director of the Consumer Federation of America. "He occupies a 
special place, both as a symbol and, frankly, a celebrity. No one else in the 
consumer movement would be thought of as a guest on 'Saturday Night Live,' but 
he was." 
</P>
<P>
 As the crusader who built his David-and-Goliath career taking on major 
corporations -- automobiles, airlines, insurance -- Nader is accustomed to 
being simultaneously loved and maligned, and often accused of grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't represent consumers -- he just represents consumers who want a 
handout," charged insurance lawyer George Bernstein during a particularly 
bitter debate several years ago over insurance regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nader sometimes finds himself fighting lonely battles. He was the only 
major witness last summer to oppose the nomination of Stephen G. Breyer to the 
Supreme Court, saying Breyer's opinions showed a pro-business, anti-consumer 
bent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nader attributes his passion for activism to his father, a Lebanese immigrant 
who ran a restaurant in Winstead, Conn., and imbued his son with the importance 
of civic responsibility in a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did you learn in school today?" his father would ask. "Did you learn how 
to believe? Did you learn how to think?" Nader was reading the Congressional 
Record by 14, and his list of heroes ranges from Pericles to Thomas Jefferson 
and such muckrakers as Upton Sinclair and journalist Ida Tarbell. 
</P>
<P>
 He selects an anecdote from his youth. As a Princeton undergraduate, Nader 
questioned the spraying of the pesticide DDT on campus. "The groundskeepers 
would spray it on with huge hoses -- we'd even wipe it off our faces it was so 
thick. The next morning there would be dead birds on the sidewalk." 
</P>
<P>
 Nader made the connection, but when he approached the editors of the Princeton 
newspaper with the story, he was brushed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me that we had brilliant biology professors and chemists at 
Princeton and if there was a connection between DDT and the birds' deaths, they 
would know about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the best lessons I had at Princeton." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what he's done for us? He has raised our expectations," says Nader 
protege Harvey Rosenfield, head of California's Proposition 103 Enforcement 
Project. "People trust that man because they know he's not for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Nader began to earn that reputation 30 years ago, when he was catapulted into 
the national spotlight as a young Harvard law graduate whose stinging book 
"Unsafe at Any Speed" challenged the safety of the Chevrolet Corvair and 
American cars in general. 
</P>
<P>
 When General Motors unwisely hired a private detective to try to discredit 
him, the ploy backfired. A Senate subcommittee looked into GM's snooping, and 
the national publicity made Nader a media star. 
</P>

 "It could have been scripted in Hollywood," says John Richard of Nader's 
Center for Study of Responsive Law. "GM overreacted and got caught. Ralph got 
all that exposure on the evening news and made the most of it. He was lucky in 
many ways." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nader's next moves laid the groundwork for the contemporary consumer movement, 
Richard says. 
</P>
<P>
 He attracted waves of young activists to Washington as "Nader's Raiders," 
investigating government foot-dragging (starting with the Federal Trade 
Commission) and business fraud, and instigating reform in everything from water 
pollution to nursing-home abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 New laws were enacted -- the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, 
the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Freedom of Information Act and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 Nader and his associates began forming advocacy groups (more than 50 at last 
count) to oversee enforcement and lobby for more. "I like to think of myself as 
a Johnny Appleseed, getting consumer groups started and letting them grow on 
their own," Nader says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nader-led activity pumped life into a Washington vacuum, says Joan 
Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, Nader's largest watchdog group, formed 
in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no citizen groups in 1965 that lobbied, when he started 
investigating the automobile industry," she says. "There were government 
officials and industry representatives and Ralph." 
</P>
<P>
 Nader's emphasis has gradually switched from exposes to long-range networks of 
public interest research groups (PIRGs) and Citizen Utility Boards (CUBs), 
which are statewide citizen action groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Any conversation with Ralph Nader gravitates back to the theme of citizen 
power. He whips out a little green CUB flyer that is mailed to all Illinois 
utility customers. "In Illinois they helped pass a utility reform package and 
saved ratepayers $3 billion," he says. "Every state needs something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for his basic advice for today's consumer, he doesn't pause. "Read. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can show any family how to save a third of their food budget and improve 
their nutrition," he says. "We can show them how to save hundreds of dollars on 
their insurance bills." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Nader's empire has blossomed into a sophisticated network of consumer 
organizations, he has stuck to the no-frills lifestyle that earned him the 
title of "St. Ralph" in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 He rents a small apartment, owns no car (his frugality is legendary) and has 
never married. "Not having a family was clearly a choice, a sacrifice," he once 
told David Frost in a television interview. "If you want to deal with these 
corporate abuses, you have to give up things." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no Nader successor waiting in the wings. The field is too complex 
today, Brobeck says, and furthermore, "Most people in the country wouldn't want 
to lead their lives the way he does." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralph's work is what he is ," Harvey Rosenfield says. "It's his joy, his 
purpose in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield, a 1976 Nader's Raider, was sent to California to work on lower 
utility rates and, in 1986, on Proposition 103, the initiative to roll back 
insurance premiums. Nader stumped the state successfully for the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield recalls winding up an intensive 10-day campaign swing. "Ralph was 
getting on the plane back to D.C. and he was still giving Proposition 103 cards 
to the flight attendants and crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how they say, 'He can drink anybody under the table?' Well, Ralph 
could work anybody under the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Nader, who has been labeled everything from prophetic to the "national nag" 
over the years, acknowledges his passion for work, but he objects to 
suggestions that his life is monastic. Asked what he does for fun, he replies: 
"What I do is fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do enjoy life," he says. "I just don't enjoy conspicuous consumption. I 
like reading and conversing with friends. When I'm traveling, I like to visit 
things. I like to see a meat-processing plant or a coal mine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Having already tackled the most obvious consumer issues, Nader is taking some 
different paths in the '90s. He campaigned in two 1992 New England presidential 
primaries, encouraging voters to write "None of the Above" on the ballot. Many 
wrote his name instead, and "interestingly, they were divided between 
Republicans and Democrats," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His motive was to generate public discussion of his "Concord Principles," 
which outline tools for his new democracy. "We had no television, it was just 
300 or 400 people in auditorium after auditorium," he says. "They would stay 
until 11 at night for big discussions. This business of the media pandering to 
the lowest common sensibility of the audience is a self-fulfilling prophecy." 
</P>
<P>
 In the unlikely company of such political conservatives as Patrick Buchanan, 
Nader has vigorously opposed both the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), maintaining they 
will undercut environmental and minimum wage standards in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been getting Congressional flak for his unexpected stance -- during one 
heated debate, House Minority Leader Rep. Robert H. Michel (D-Ill.), called 
Ross Perot, Buchanan and Nader the "Groucho, Chico and Harpo Marx" of the trade 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 He was scolded even more publicly last summer in Newsweek magazine. Noting 
that "many of Nader's crusades these days verge on the bizarre," the magazine's 
Rich Thomas wondered aloud if Nader's views are losing their influence. But 
Thomas concluded that, despite losing some battles, Nader remains a "powerful 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA has already passed and GATT -- which faces a Senate vote in December -- 
is expected to be approved, but Nader's opposition is unswerving. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to enumerate his most important accomplishments, Nader first offers a 
checklist of what he calls "transient victories," items such as seat belts, air 
bags, crash-worthy cars, better labeling on food, lower levels of lead in the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 And there have been the victories of what he calls "silent revolutions," in 
America's smoking and eating habits that have occurred despite the pressures of 
the marketplace. "The decline of tobacco and the improvement of nutrition are 
the consumer movement, but people don't see it that way. They see the consumer 
movement as the compulsory recall of cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, he sees health care remaining on the agenda, along with "the 
Big Brother aspects of a credit-card economy with all those electronic data 
bases floating around," and making the new technology accessible to everyone. 
(Although he's still writing on an Underwood typewriter, his office uses 
Internet to mobilize campaigns around the world.) 
</P>
<P>
 And he foresees the emergence of a third party. "Ross Perot broke the myth of 
the two-party system and proved that 19 million voters can wave bye-bye to 
political parties."  
</P>
<P>
 And, no, Nader wouldn't be a candidate. "I have a different role, on the 
outside, to build a democratic infrastructure." People Power 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 30 years, Ralph Nader has planted the seeds of the contemporary 
consumer movement by launching citizen action groups with various interests and 
encouraging their development. Here is a partial list of the public-interest

BEHIND THE WHEEL: HONDA FINALLY COMES TO AN ACCORD WITH A V-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget the Ferrari-Cobra racing wars. Ignore Louis and Schmeling, Rommel and 
Montgomery, Feinstein and Huffington, Pepsi and Coke, Capone and Ness, Ralph 
and Alice. 
</P>
<P>
 These were polite pastings softened by a certain honor among rivals; 
short-term punch-ups with time out for injuries, time off for good behavior, 
and unlimited bathroom breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Accord and Taurus. Now there's a blood-letting made in Purgatory. This 
feud has been splattering gore over national sales charts since 1986, when 
Ford's Taurus entered the American mainstream to challenge the dominance of 
Honda's Accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Taurus, the street fighter. Accord, sheer elegance in miniature. Ford yelping 
and snorting like Hulk Hogan at every advance in sales. Honda maintaining a 
silent dignity. Class easily won those early years, and Accord remained the 
nation's best-selling sweetheart until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ford got sneaky. With Honda dedicated to one-at-a-time retail sales, Ford 
began marketing the spit out of corporate and rental fleet sales to fatten its 
figures. And so Taurus became Top Gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Ford's lead was still solid. More than 360,000 Tauruses were sold 
versus 330,000 Accords for Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 This year -- thanks to a pleasantly redesigned, still charming Accord 
competing against the same old Taurus -- Ford is only a fender in front, its 
lead shrunk to a piddling 2,100 cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new Accord impresses us," reported Consumer Guide's Automobile Book in 
echoing every critique of the 1994 car. "But we believe it needs a V-6 engine 
to compete head-on with its top rivals, the Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its lack of punch, the new Accord just got hotter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's sales were a photo-finish with Honda back in first place, ahead 
by 58 cars, selling 33,287 Accords in October to 33,229 Tauruses for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, at last, Honda adds a V-6 to its Accord line. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for no mercy, no further quarter in this war of the four-doors. Expect 
Accord, this 20-year-old ex-champion, this rare buy where owners consistently 
got more than they paid for, to step back into the fight like George Foreman -- 
with good grace and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although based remotely on the 2.7-liter V-6 that powered the Acura Legend 
when Taurus was damp veal, the new engine develops 170 horsepower, or about 15% 
more power than Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite new pricing that has the Accord V-6 starting at $22,300 -- compared to 
$18,000 for Taurus -- no domestic car can touch Honda for attention to fit and 
finish, to optima of mechanical engineering and a mating of all systems for 
matchless driving smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the positive news. Now the odd news. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite additional cylinders and 25 more horsepower, the V-6 Accord performs 
only fractionally better than its four-cylinder sibling. See that not as a 
smack at the new aluminum engine, but belated praise for the efficiency -- 
thanks to the little miracle of variable valve timing -- that Honda squeezes 
from a four-banger. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the V-6 Accord is only a wink faster from rest to 60 m.p.h. Top speed 
-- a short jail term over 125 m.p.h. -- is virtually the same between Accords. 
The muscular one costs more and is five miles per gallon thirstier. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the most sensitive of seats in the thinnest of pants worn by the most 
passible of owners will detect differing harmonies of the Accords. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why build a V-6? Because -- as Shoeless Joe Jackson was never heard to 
say -- if you build it, they will come. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda owners had been on their knees, hands clasped, begging for a V-6 for 
years. They represented tens of thousands of repeat buyers. The competition -- 
Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable, Toyota Camry, Mazda 626, Volkswagen Passat, Chevy 
Lumina, Nissan Maxima and Chrysler's Vision, Concorde and Intrepid family -- 
was up to its side mirrors in V-6 engines. With Chrysler's Cirrus and Ford's 
Contour entering stage left. It made perfect marketing sense to build a V-6. 
</P>
<P>
 And the subtle blessings of a six-cylinder engine are that it shudders less, 
doesn't work so hard and thus the NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) monster 
is more easily sedated, which translates to smoother power and a more 
comfortable ride. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those who do not measure a car by micrometers and split seconds 
between stoplights, the four-cylinder Accord will remain in production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent the larger, wider engine from bulging all sheet metal fo'ard of the 
windshield, Honda has redesigned the V-6 Accord's front end. It now is two 
inches longer and almost one inch wider, although the wheelbase stays the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from the windshield back is unchanged. The interior shows nothing 
beyond original delights. One note to junior car spotters: The V-6 Accord wears 
15-inch wheels and tires and has a chrome trim around the grille. A "V-6" badge 
on the rear deck is a dead giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The car comes in two trim levels, and the LX starter is nicely equipped with 
two air bags, anti-lock brakes, power antenna, air conditioning, power windows 
and locks, cruise control, remote releases for trunk and fuel flap, and a 
fold-down rear seat. The flagship EX goes all the way and adds leather seats, 
power moon roof, power driver's seat and a six-speaker sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Both models are equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission, 
electronically controlled for undetectable shifts during routine passage. A 
coupe remains a maybe for next year -- but there are no plans to fit the V-6 
with a manual transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein a drag, big time. 
</P>
<P>
 For with a five-speed, the four-cylinder Accord was an agile whippersnapper 
capable of playing in any gear like a silken stocker. With an automatic, even 
the V-6 sags in spots and power takes its time coming when there's any urgency 
to applying mid-range acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a V-6. It is a Honda with all the reliability, handling finesse, 
high resale value, materiel quality, fun factor and smooth operation the marque 
implies. It is an Accord that has seldom stirred a discouraging word, once was 
the nation's best-selling car and seems headed that way again. 
</P>
<P>
 So it will be judged. Accordingly.

ECONOTES; INTRODUCING THE RENEWAL, AN IMPROVED BATTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The household batteries that come along with all those holiday toys are an 
environmental menace. We use an estimated 3 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the eco-choice has been between nickel-cadmium, which can be 
recharged, but eventually adds toxic cadmium to the landfill, and alkaline, 
which lasts longer but can't be recharged. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Rayovac Corp., a leading manufacturer, has come up with a greener 
alternative -- an alkaline battery that can be recharged. It's called the 
Renewal, comes in AA, AAA, C and D capacities, and is available in retail 
stores around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in the battery business a long time and, like other companies, 
we're concerned about the environment," spokeswoman Jolene Woodlee says. "We're 
doing a big campaign for the holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Renewal batteries demand their own recharge pack, an initial 
investment is required, (from $15 to $30, depending on the size) but there is a 
substantial savings in the long run, Woodlee says. Information: (800) 237-7000. 
Greener Holidays 
</P>
<P>
 In a do-it-yourself mood? 
</P>
<P>
 In Redondo Beach, Harmony Works, an "eco-eclectic" retail store (that means 
environmental art, gifts, home decor and clothing) has scheduled two free 
events to make the holidays greener. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Wrappin' With the Earth" hands-on workshop is set for 6:30 to 8 p.m. Dec. 
7. Kathy Dent and Carolyn Locker will demonstrate ways to create 
environmentally safe bows, gift paper and box-top decorations. Children and 
parents can take home their creations. On Dec. 10, from 7 to 8:30 p.m., Chris 
Howell of TreePeople will discuss the role of trees in the ecosystem and offer 
volunteer opportunities in urban and mountain forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony Works opened last spring at 1700 Catalina Ave. in Redondo Beach. 
Something Different 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not a do-it-yourselfer, drop into a Cost Plus store, a West Coast 
retail chain specializing in imported products and an environmental tradition. 
The stores feature recycled wrapping paper, and ribbons and bows colored with 
water soluble dyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of boxes for gifts, the store is suggesting holiday baskets with a bed 
of excelsior, tied with raffia bows. "We always have these on hand, but we've 
really stocked up for the holidays," spokeswoman Julia Whitelaw says. Gift Tips 
</P>
<P>
 Still making a shopping list? The December issue of E Magazine has 50 gift 
ideas in its six-page Holiday Green Marketplace. The items are as small as 
solar slippers, as large as a Swedish Asko washer and as offbeat as the Beaver 
Rivers' worm composting system. . . . And in the big-gift department, Oceanic 
Society Expeditions in San Francisco suggests Whale Watch Gift Certificates for 
full-day and half-day cruises to watch the mighty migration. Also popular for 
gifts are the group's Adopt-A-Dolphin certificates. Information: (800) 
326-7491.

THE GOODS; CHEAP -- NOT CHEESY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taste and money. Inevitable partners? Not at all. With a wish for fabulous 
Christmas gifts and decorations, and a tiny budget, we invited two people with 
a professional eye for beauty to go shopping with us. Nancy Goslee Power is a 
Santa Monica-based garden designer who is creating the landscaping for the Walt 
Disney Concert Hall. Gronk is a Los Angeles painter and conceptual artist whose 
work is being exhibited in a retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art. We went shopping with Power and Gronk at Pic 'N' Save and Woolworth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turn her nose up at bargains? Never. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a game I play," said Nancy Goslee Power, merrily pushing a cart 
through the aisles at Pic 'N' Save on Lincoln Boulevard in Venice. "This is 
what I did when I didn't have any money."  
</P>
<P>
 Her eyes locked on such varied stocking stuffers as a multicolored plastic 
thermos with mercury glass lining, kids' animal-motif plastic dinnerware, and a 
children's gardening set containing plastic wheelbarrow, tools and watering 
can.  
</P>
<P>
 As they say at the head office, trucks arrive at L.A.'s 93 Pic 'N' Save stores 
carrying 30,000 new manufacturers' overruns and such each week. That's music to 
the ears of discount hunters, enlightened consumers and avowed junk junkies.  
</P>
<P>
 Power's seal of approval went to objects with garden themes and to the 
playful. Many were inexpensive copies of items she finds at pricier shops, but 
they easily met her standards. "It's a design issue," as she succinctly put it. 
 
</P>
<P>
 One tip: Don't go for subtle. Grabbing a handful of fabric flowers, made in 
China ($1.99 per bunch), Power opined, "Go for the brightest ones. Pale is too 
good-taste."  
</P>
<P>
 Her favorites included:  
</P>
<P>
 * Great, big padded slippers shaped like strawberries for adults ($6.99) and 
multicolored padded slippers in children's sizes ($3.99), both by Totes. 
"Aren't these divine -- good design," Power remarked of the strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold-painted, papier-mache stars, made in the Philippines. "Five bucks -- I 
can't believe these. Aren't they fantastic? Pile them in a container or a 
gorgeous basket. In New York at Treillage, my friend Bunny Williams' shop on 
East 75th, they sell similar stars in metal for $25."  
</P>
<P>
 * Plastic ostrich eggs in varying sizes and colors (99 to $1.99), made in 
China. "Don't you think that's good design? I think they're yummy." (The 
checkout clerk said they reminded him of something from "Jurassic Park.") 
</P>
<P>
 * A galvanized metal bucket ($3.99). "I've bought galvanized buckets for 
years," Powers said when she stumbled across a good looking one, made in 
Mexico, next to some dust pans and brooms. "You can put plants in them with a 
big bow. Can you imagine one of those filled with ice and champagne bottles?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Iridescent, jewel-toned votive candleholders, made in Taiwan. "I love these. 
Two bucks. I don't think Christmas ornaments and stuff should be expensive, and 
there's a gaudy side in all of us. Neiman Marcus has the same things in brass 
for $25." 
</P>
<P>
 * Calico fabric covered stacking boxes ($4), made in China. "Any kind of 
stacking box is always wonderful. I'd buy these just to put presents in."

THE GOODS; CHEAP -- NOT CHEESY

 Taste and money. Inevitable partners? Not at all. With a wish for fabulous 
Christmas gifts and decorations, and a tiny budget, we invited two people with 
a professional eye for beauty to go shopping with us. Nancy Goslee Power is a 
Santa Monica-based garden designer who is creating the landscaping for the Walt 
Disney Concert Hall. Gronk is a Los Angeles painter and conceptual artist whose 
work is being exhibited in a retrospective at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art. We went shopping with Power and Gronk at Pic 'N' Save and Woolworth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gronk is nothing if not a connoisseur of low-cost Downtown shopping. He 
awakens on sheets from Pic 'N' Save. The Mexican masks near his bed are from 
Olvera Street. His black pants and T-shirt were on sale at Woolworth. Matching 
lawn chairs from Thrifty Drug sit by the low-slung table adorned with a green 
crayon light (Pic 'N' Save again). 
</P>
<P>
 "I spend money where I live," the artist said. And where he works and resides 
is a converted Downtown office building on Spring Street. To follow him down 
nearby Broadway on a hectic Sunday afternoon is to see a man skate through his 
element. 
</P>
<P>
 He glides past the Korean barkers calling out "Todo barato! Pa sale!" He looks 
for the old women who sell chopped fruit on street corners.  
</P>
<P>
 If there's a theme to his shopping, it's to look for quirky, pop culture 
items, then use them in a novel way. Glittery Christmas tree ropes became 
tassels to pull back the drapes in his apartment. "I look for unique things and 
find something about them I can utilize in my daily activities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway is the perfect environment for this kind of guerrilla shopping since 
it's the burial ground for many of the unsold items from upscale stores. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's anything the artist, who does not drive, regrets about Downtown is 
that there's no Kmart. "Usually that's a field trip for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The items he bought:  
</P>
<P>
 * Tassels: $1.99 at Pic 'N' Save, 7th and Broadway. "For me, there's a glitzy 
B-Movie sensibility to them." 
</P>
<P>
 * Lock clock: $10 from stall No. 48 at the Broadway Trade Center. "An objet 
d'art. This is a treasure find. God knows what it symbolizes. This could be 
hanging at the L.A. County Museum." 
</P>
<P>
 * Religious candles: 99 each at Woolworth, 719 S. Broadway. "They give off a 
scent as well as light. They create a mood in your atmosphere. Four of them, 
with a plank on the top, can make a low table." 
</P>
<P>
 * Musical note ornament: $1.99 at Pic 'N' Save. "I know a lot of musicians. 
There's a composer I'm working with, this would work with his sensibilities. 
It's very rare you can find something along these lines." 
</P>
<P>
 * Christmas light bulb earrings: $1.99 at Pic 'N' Save. "A must. I was once a 
Christmas tree when I was growing up. If you want to be a Christmas tree, this 
would be a handy object." 
</P>
<P>
 * Crayon light: $4.99 at Pic 'N' Save. "It's pop art. It's also a great little 
light you can keep on all day and it doesn't distract you. And you can change 
the bulb inside and change the color."

ARTS GROUPS STILL TAKING PLEDGES ON FAITH; FINANCES: DESPITE THE BATTLE OVER A 
DONATION TO THE IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE, ORGANIZATIONS SAY THEY'RE NOT SCARED OF 
CONTRIBUTORS CHANGING THEIR MINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It sounds like an arts group's dream -- turned nightmare. A wealthy benefactor 
announces the gift of a cool million. Then he dies, and his heirs decide there 
are better ways to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what has happened at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. Marjorie 
Barclay, the widow of developer Richard H. Barclay, announced she has no 
intention of giving the theater the remaining $600,000 of a $1-million pledge 
that added the Barclay name to the theater's. Now the theater is suing 
Barclay's estate to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the unusual battle may have sent a collective shudder through the 
county's arts community, nobody sounds worried that Marjorie Barclay's action 
might set off a chain reaction that could threaten millions of dollars in 
pledges that their groups have yet to receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the county's major arts groups, for instance, will add a combined $8.5 
million to their coffers from a single donor. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, arts patron Edra Brophy established a $17-million trust, some of it 
earmarked for the UC Irvine College of Medicine, and some for the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center ($5.1 million), South Coast Repertory ($1.7 million), 
the Orange County Philharmonic Society ($1.2 million) and Pacific Chorale 
($510,000), according to center spokesman Gregory Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Patterson said, the portion of the trust pertaining to these arts groups 
is "revocable" and specifies that the "choice of arts groups could change at 
any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't that warrant a case of the jitters? 
</P>
<P>
 Only a piddling case, if any, Patterson said. That's because the donation 
would be applied toward the center's endowment, which essentially is a 
rainy-day fund meant to bolster long-term financial stability, and never used 
to keep the center up and running on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't accept revocable trust donations for our operating fund," Patterson 
said. That's a typical practice among arts groups. Likewise, the center 
accepted no such gifts for its now-complete $76-million building campaign. The 
center's endowment, currently with $6.4 million543780384amount" of pledges that 
are revocable, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A quid pro quo agreement, in which a donor receives something in exchange for 
a pledge -- from a membership that waives admission to the naming of a theater 
after him or her -- is even more common among arts groups. It's the foundation 
of the Irvine Barclay lawsuit too, theater officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Barclay agreed in 1990 to give $1 million to help complete 
construction of the 750-seat theater on the UC Irvine campus. The Barclays paid 
$200,000 in 1990 and another $200,000 in '91 to the foundation. Payments 
stopped, however, after Richard Barclay's 1992 death. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit states that in exchange for the Barclays' $1-million gift, the 
theater would bear their name. It was filed earlier this month against Marjorie 
Barclay and her late husband's estate by the three groups that jointly financed 
the hall: the UC Irvine Foundation, the city of Irvine and the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very clear from the outset," says Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady 
Jr., "that the Barclay family knew that the donation of $1 million was in 
exchange for having their name placed up on the theater and having their name 
as the identifier of the theater." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when an exchange occurs, a pledge becomes legally binding, says Los 
Angeles attorney William Michael Ramseyer, a consultant to L.A.'s Center for 
Nonprofit Management, which advises arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "A pledge becomes legally binding when, under normal circumstances, the donee 
acts 'in reliance' in some manner," Ramseyer said. "For instance, if you pledge 
money to (public television station) KCET and KCET sends you a coffee mug and 
reads your name on the air, they have acted in reliance, and that makes the 
promise binding. . . . It changes from a simple promise to a contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, a promise or a pledge -- even one in writing -- is just a promise 
until it results in this kind of a contractual agreement, Ramseyer said. "And 
promises are not enforceable in California. There's no such thing as a lawsuit 
for breach of promise. There's only the breach-of-contract lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, if the Irvine Barclay Theatre loses its suit -- Marjorie Barclay's 
attorney insists her name is not on any pledge documents -- Brady said the city 
will have to decide whether to write off as a loss the remaining $600,000 of 
the pledge or take further action against Marjorie Barclay. There's also the 
possibility, he said, that the theater could be renamed if a new donor, willing 
to pitch in for the remainder, is found. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art is the only local arts 
institution in the middle of a building campaign: It is converting a Santa Ana 
bank into Kidseum, a hands-on children's museum, and raising money to fund the 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not, however, received any pledges for the project. Rather, the Bowers 
has received cash gifts for about half the $700,000 it needs to open the 
11,000-square-foot facility on Dec. 18 as planned, said marketing and 
development director Pat House. 
</P>
<P>
 If any major pledges do come in, House said, the donor would probably have to 
agree in writing to receive something in return for the pledge, such as the 
naming of a gallery after him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 Said House: "We would obviously be very concerned about a major gift without a 
quid pro quo." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills bequests are another form of pledge commonly made to arts groups, even 
if wills can be changed until the donor dies and do not become legally binding 
until that time, according to Ramseyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Art Museum didn't worry about any of that, however, before it announced 
in September the bequest of a 140-piece collection of contemporary art from the 
trust of Laguna Beach art aficionado Richard H. Mumper, who died in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumper's gift, which includes works by such leading artists as Richard 
Diebenkorn and Billy Al Bengston, "was a pleasant discovery," said Bolton 
Colburn, curator of collections. "We had no prior knowledge that Mumper had 
named us in the will." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with gifts it was expecting, however, the museum has never had big 
problems and never sued a donor for the goods, Colburn said. Often, it takes 
artworks on extended loan with the understanding that the pieces will 
eventually be outright gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been instances where people have pulled things back -- one or two 
paintings," Colburn said. "But it's such a piddling deal you don't want to make 
a big case out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the museum was promised a "substantial body of work," it would probably 
forgo its iffy "gentleman's agreement" generally drafted for small gifts and 
have an attorney negotiate a binding agreement, Colburn said. "But we have 
never been in that position." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a possibility that up to $400,000 pledged to the Pacific Symphony 
during a recent $5.2-million fund drive might not materialize, said Louis G. 
Spisto, the orchestra's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rest of the money "is very well secured," through irrevocable trusts 
and other arrangements, he said, if that portion doesn't come through as 
expected within about three years, "it wouldn't undo the orchestra, but it 
would hurt our cash position and our plans for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Spisto said, it's not something he loses sleep over. A case in which 
someone reneges on a pledged donation has "never happened here. . . . I think 
it's a very rare situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor Art Museum hasn't faced such a situation either, but "if a 
donor came and said, 'I can't pay my pledge,' I'm not going to sue them," said 
director Michael Botwinick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea whether any court in California would find any of our pledges 
legal or not," he said, "and I have no interest in that; neither does our 
board. It's irrelevant to us. We think your biggest protection is in your 
relationship to your donors." Arts Endowments

FROM SIDEMAN TO PAWN-SHOP STAR; POP MUSIC: GUNS N' ROSES' GILBY CLARKE, AT THE 
COACH HOUSE TONIGHT, STEPS OUT ON HIS OWN FOR A BIT, BUT HE'S NOT GIVING UP 
THAT OTHER GIG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As rhythm guitarist with fabled bad boys Guns N' Roses, Gilby Clarke has 
little to do on stage but stand around strumming inconspicuously, as the more 
notorious, higher-profiled Axl Rose and Slash soak up the fan and media 
attention.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's OK with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke has a team player's mind-set and musical philosophy that would never 
threaten the twin egos; nor would the soft-spoken musician ever command the 
current, groomed-on-shock-value rock world's attention with his 
less-than-outrageous personality in any case. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the recent release of his first solo album, "Pawn Shop Guitars" 
(Virgin Records), Clarke, who performs tonight at the Coach House, proves that 
he's much more than a second banana to his calculatedly offensive band-mates, 
although Rose, Slash and company (currently on hiatus as a group) do guest 
turns on the album. 
</P>
<P>
 The album features nine strong originals plus covers of the Rolling Stones' 
"Dead Flowers" and the Clash's "Jail Guitar Doors" with Clarke's excellent 
guitar work and surprisingly solid vocals conveying real enthusiasm and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 A lively, eclectic and at times nostalgic affair that features lilting pop 
melodies and unusual instrumentation (when was the last time anyone used a 
Mellotron ?) along with the expected electric thunder, "Pawn Shop Guitars" 
comes off like a battle royal between GNR and the Beatles for control of 
Clarke's rock 'n' roll soul -- with Keith Richards acting as referee. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent interview from Buenos Aires, where he was finishing up a South 
American tour, Clarke chuckled at the analogy.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's good; you should use that," he said. "It makes sense because my 
favorite two bands are the Beatles and the Stones. I love playing guitar in 
that rootsy kind of rock thing that the Stones do. The records I grew up with 
were the records from the '70s. In those days, people didn't put out an album 
unless they had 10 great hit songs. That's what I grew up on; that's what I was 
after.  
</P>
<P>
 "Like, if you listen to (David Bowie's) 'Ziggy Stardust,' you go 'That's a 
great record.' From cut one to 'Rock 'n' Roll Suicide,' it's a great record. 
I'm not putting myself in the same category, but that's what I was after. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found my niche; I found what I like in music," he continued. "A lot of 
people hit a trend and go, 'That's what I like,' but I'm still into the same 
stuff I've been into for 20 years, and nothing has made me change my mind yet. 
It's not a matter of copying other bands; it's like, you find the kind of music 
you enjoy and then create your own. But obviously, your influences are going to 
come out. I wanted to make an album that I would enjoy listening to as well as 
making and playing. This is my favorite kind of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke, 32, grew up in Cleveland and moved with his family to Los Angeles at 
age 16. He was inspired to play guitar when, as a teen-ager, he saw a poster of 
Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I even heard his music, that poster made me want to play," he said. 
"It looked so cool, I said 'That's what I want to do, right there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke eventually hooked up with Los Angeles music figure Kim Fowley, who put 
him to work as a studio guitarist. He went on to play with the group Candy, 
which recorded an album for Mercury Records, and to front Kills for Thrills, 
which recorded an album and an EP for MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, his big break came when longtime friend Izzy Stradlin quit his rhythm 
guitar post with Guns N' Roses and set Clarke up with an audition to replace 
him. After Clarke memorized 50 songs in less than a week and fit Stradlin's 
post to perfection, no other guitarists were even considered by the band. 
Clarke handled the high-stress situation with characteristic aplomb, taking 
full advantage of the opportunity while keeping his feet firmly planted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of pressure, but I never accepted it," he explained. "The 
cool thing was that I already knew the guys -- I didn't know them real well; 
the guy I knew best was Izzy -- but they made me feel comfortable. That band is 
so big and out of control that the only thing you can do is walk in and go, 
'OK, I'm just going to be myself.' I know that the people aren't screaming for 
me; they're screaming for Axl and Slash. I try to keep my head about it." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, things perhaps haven't gone as smoothly. Clarke hedges when 
asked whether the real personalities of Slash and Rose are as difficult as 
their public personae. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always just tell people that some of the guys are OK," he said. "In fact, 
some of them are my best friends in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke expressed weariness at the hype that goes along with being a member of 
Guns N' Roses and seems to be refreshed and more at home musically fronting his 
own group. Joined by guitarist Ryan Roxie, bassist Will Effertz and drummer 
Marc Danzeisen -- all of whom appear on States since "Pawn Shop's" July 
release. His passion for the project remains undampened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I do enjoy GNR, there's a lot of bull that goes along with it, 
the media and whatever," he said. "When I'm doing this, it's just back to being 
in a rock 'n' roll band. I don't have to prove anything to anybody. I just play 
songs that I wrote and I enjoy with people that I really care about, and the 
rest doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 So would Clarke, like Stradlin before him, go so far as to leave arguably the 
biggest group in rock today to concentrate on a smaller but more rewarding solo 
career? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd do it in a heartbeat," he replied without hesitation. "I'm very serious 
about it. I've been touring since July, and we're booked through springtime, 
with a chance of being booked through next summer. I've already spoken to 
everybody in GNR and said, 'Look, I'm doing this until it's done, and if you 
need to make a record in between, you make a record without me.' 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, music isn't about money and all that stuff; it's about what I write 
and what I like to do. And I like what I'm doing right now." 
</P>
<P>

CLUB REVIEW; WHISKY ONCE AGAIN A PLACE OF IMPORTANCE FOR BANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than any other venerable Sunset Strip club, the Whisky has moved adeptly 
into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has it shed its " '80s rock" status for a more alternative music mix 
-- that's simply good business in today's climate -- but the famous West 
Hollywood club has also developed an ability to be unpredictable in a 
predictable scene.Unlike the nearby Roxy, which always feels like a showcase 
setting, or the Coconut Teaszer, whose crowd rarely varies, you never know 
quite what you're gonna get when you step inside the dark, 400-capacity Whisky. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nights, the bi-level space is so hot and sweaty that you dread entering. 
Other times the crowd is so complacent that their drinks seem to be about to 
slip out of their hands. In recent months, however, the latter scene has been a 
rare occurrence. As in the past, the Whisky is one of the clubs where you want 
to see bands perform, and once again it means something to perform on that 
historic stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that tears things down as fast as it can build them, all this is 
encouraging. In rock 'n' roll years, the Whisky has been around since the 
beginning of time, and has been the chosen site of nearly every Next Big Thing 
born out of the city's musical imagination. If the Whisky is thriving, so is 
L.A.'s creative spirit. 
</P>

COMEDY NOTES; JENI HOOKS 'EM, NEVER LETS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Richard Jeni, the ever-popular boy from New York City and among the most 
sought-after stand-ups in the country, hooks audiences when he serves up 
observations on the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedian, who's playing the Irvine Improv tonight through Sunday, likes to 
use characters to act out his bits as he drives home a point, fully exploring 
it with rapid-fire punch lines. This way, he doesn't have to keep jump-starting 
the audience. Once they're laughing, he keeps them laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeni lists Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor as influences but admits to parroting 
Steve Martin for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I hit upon a novel concept of trying to be myself. But I've learned a 
lot from a lot of different comics." 
</P>
<P>
 Competing with Jeni will be George Lopez, who finishes his run at the Brea 
Improv tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, whose credits include "The Tonight Show" and recurring spots on the 
now-defunct "Arsenio," is a comic on a mission to raise consciousness in 
mainstream America to the pride and humor of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "People see color first," he once told a Times interviewer. "After a show in 
Houston, a guy came up to me and said, 'I didn't think you'd be funny.' I said, 
'Why, because I'm Latino?' He said yeah. I appreciated his honesty, but it 
shows the stereotypes we're fighting. I don't do ethnic material. I only do 
ethnic material to people who see color. When I was growing up, I never looked 
at color. I looked at people." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lopez leaves, Mack & Jamie take over Sunday in Brea, where they also 
perform Dec.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not a perfect match off stage (Mack Dryden is a conservative Southerner 
who loves a good steak, while Jamie Alcroft is a liberal Northerner and devout 
vegetarian), the pair clicks on stage. Their show, which they've been honing 
since hooking up in Florida in 1978, is part stand-up, part musical, part 
parody. 
</P>
<P>
 When not doing clubs or corporate dates, "The Tonight Show" veterans are a 
popular item on KLOS' "5 O'Clock Funnies." ON THE TOWN: Locally, Jackie Vegas & 
Friends are at Costa Mesa's El Paso Cantina this Saturday at 9:30 p.m. On 
Sunday at 8 p.m., Debby Cali, Scott Greenwood, Joey Simms, Louis Weisenberg and 
Barry Weisenberg will be at the Holiday Inn at 25205 La Paz Road, Laguna Hills. 
It's hosted by Tom Riehl. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Word continues to take the stage at 8 p.m. Mondays at the Cornerstone 
Cafe in Costa Mesa. THE CLOCK IS TICKING: And for the far-thinking among us, 
it's never too soon to start making plans for New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea Improv is going for the throat when it brings in comedian and 
ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and his pals Peanut and Walter from Dec. 27-31. After 
experiencing a Dunham performance, one is never certain who's in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Improv is countering with The LoveMaster, Craig Shoemaker, who has 
just signed a deal with Big Ticket Television for a sitcom next autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 The LoveMaster is Shoemaker's deep-voiced, sex-driven alter ego who channels 
through the comedian to tempt the women in the audience. The Philadelphia 
native also does a wicked Barney Fife imitation, among others. He's there Dec. 
27-31.

THE SCENE / ORANGE COUNTY: PEP AND CIRCUMSTANCE; WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THE 
STEREOTYPES OR RESENT THEM, GIVE A LITTLE YELL. CHEERLEADING USED TO BE 
CONSIDERED JUST FROUFROU AND FROSTING, BUT IT HAS EVOLVED INTO A SPORT 
EMPHASIZING ADVANCED GYMNASTIC AND DANCE SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As youth cultures go, few others have as long, as dedicated and as 
controversial a tradition as cheerleading. 
</P>
<P>
 General perceptions position cheerleaders somewhere between beauty pageant 
queens and models. They're admired as much as they're jeered. Cheerleaders are 
the embodiment of the all-American sweetheart to some, pretty young things in 
short skirts who garnish the sidelines while the tough guys have it out on the 
field. To others, they're the feminist foe. 
</P>
<P>
 The stereotype is that they are forever effervescent (translation: airheaded) 
and elitist (catty) and always dress and act the same (conformist). 
</P>
<P>
 Headlines in recent years haven't helped the image. Consider the Texas mother 
who conspired to attempt murder on a cheerleader because her own teen-age 
daughter didn't make the squad. Costs for uniforms and training camps, which 
can run into hundreds of dollars, compelled one Newport Harbor High senior to 
file suit against the district last month. The case reinforces popular opinion 
that cheer squads are open only to those who can afford to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's a cheerleader to do when she hangs up her pompons? The joke is that 
she either becomes a trophy wife or, if she's forced to, takes a career as an 
aerobics instructor, fly-girl dancer or a pop diva on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're 'froufrou' girls, and all we do is jump around and say, 'Yeah!' We're 
just in a skirt to get popular," says Santa Margarita High senior Jeannie 
Naughton. "No one ever says, 'Oh, those football players are so cliquey.' " To 
describe the 17-year-old's words as sardonic is an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of thinking makes me so mad," adds Jeannie, who, for the record, 
has a 4.1 grade point average. When she gets to college, she says, "if someone 
asked me, 'What were you like in high school?' I wouldn't say I was a 
cheerleader. With that word comes a lot of stereotypes and preconceived notions 
that I wouldn't want someone to connect with me." 
</P>
<P>
 But the role of cheerleading is changing in today's high school life. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,000 young women and men participate in high school cheer squads in 
Orange County alone. Although no exact figures exist, the Universal 
Cheerleaders Assn. in Tennessee and American Sports Data in New York estimate 
an additional 1.6 to 1.8 million do so nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream cheer has evolved into a sport emphasizing advanced gymnastic and 
dance skills with year-round practice sessions that regularly run 15 to 20 
hours a week. Summer vacation is no time to rest, with daily classes in 
gymnastics and cheer, as well as off-campus cheer camps. With a schedule that 
rivals that of the sports they're there to support, cheerleading never goes out 
of season. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic-wear companies have recognized the trend by designing 
high-performance uniforms from futuristic fabrics, and Reebok and Nike have 
developed cheerleading shoes. But while corporate America is cashing in, not 
everyone is rallying around its new incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents and high school sports fans believe cheerleaders should limit 
their role to sideline support. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Hong, 16, a junior at Esperanza High in Anaheim, knows this attitude 
too well. Despite taking first place in three divisions on the national level, 
her team's accomplishments went unrecognized by the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't care," Jessica says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not some little campus club," she adds. "We put in so much work for our 
school. We have injuries as bad as other athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, taped wrists, splints and massive bruises are common; at a recent 
Esperanza event, two members of another school's squad walked around in 
matching leg casts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannie, whose team at Santa Margarita High last year placed first in the 
state championship and fifth in the all-girls varsity division nationally, 
concedes that "it's an ongoing debate. We don't get the kind of respect we 
deserve when we work just as hard as athletes in other sports. We're not just 
pretty accessories." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is a theater to cheerleading that embraces costumes, cosmetics, 
posturing and the overall image that is as integral to the performance as an 
actor's. 
</P>
<P>
 When hundreds of competitors showed up for the the Universal Cheerleaders 
Assn. regional championships at UC Irvine earlier this month, most came with 
clumps of pink or green rollers in their hair, layers of makeup perfectly 
applied to their fresh faces and bags filled with beauty tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bren Center foyer became a mass dressing room, where whole squads set up 
temporary camp to add finishing touches. Some literally changed into uniforms, 
precariously, without revealing anything. A pleated skirt was shimmied into 
over leggings, the leggings then slipped off. A Lycra mock turtle neck was 
pulled through the neck of a huge sweat shirt serving as a kind of body tent 
while the Lycra shirt was carefully squeezed into. 
</P>
<P>
 Young women walked around unabashedly with their hair in rollers. Shortly 
before show time, out came the mousse, the gel, the hair-shine spritzers and 
the professional-size cans of super-strength hair spray. They sat in lines of 
four or five, each combing and arranging the other's hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, eyebrows were lined, lashes brushed and lips colored in. Their 
skin, already thick with foundation, was checked for shine and powdered. It's 
an Avon lady's dream -- no cosmetic goes unused. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannie prefers limited attention on this ritual. It's not all that cheer is 
about, she reminds. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, but looks are a part of cheer. As Eric Brown, a junior at Santa 
Margarita High, puts it: "This is definitely the sport with more good-looking 
girls."  
</P>
<P>
 Eric, 16, dates classmate and cheerleader Kris Vallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jocks are more likely to hang out with cheerleaders than someone not into 
sports," Eric says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And one would be hard pressed to find an overweight cheerleader: Maintaining a 
level of fitness is paramount to executing all those flips, tumbles and hip-hop 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 But "it's not about being really skinny," says Jessica, on the squad since her 
freshman year. Jessica says none of her teammates have had an eating disorder 
-- to her knowledge. "And we're like a family. I think it's because our coach 
talks about anorexia, bulimia and those other problems all the time -- 
constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Weight (that is, the lack of it) is just one among the list of stereotypes 
about cheerleaders, Jessica adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think of the tall, skinny, blue-eyed, blonde airhead -- the girl who 
can't fend for herself and depends on others," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica is Korean, 5-foot-5, muscular from years of gymnastics and an honor 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 She volunteers that the discrimination she's had to face as an Asian American 
who cheers comes from other Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first made cheer, I was told by some other Asians that cheer wasn't 
the Asian thing to do," she says. "They said why didn't I go into (student 
government). There's a lot of Asians in ASB." 
</P>
<P>
 This semester, her younger sister, Roxan, a freshman, is among several Asian 
Americans who made the junior varsity squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's less of that attitude now since I've been on the squad for 
three years," Jessica says. "I figured I can do whatever I want, and I didn't 
have to listen to those people." 
</P>
<P>
 She has had to prove herself on campus with more than just her peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year," she says, "a couple of my teachers think because I'm a 
cheerleader . . . they don't expect me to do as well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos sophomore Jeremy Ploessel has had to contend with another 
assumption: "The typical stereotype of a guy cheerleader is he's gay," says the 
15-year-old Cypress resident. "I just brush it off and figure they're not 
tolerant and they don't know me." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most cheerleaders, male or female, Jeremy got involved at the young age 
of 9 as a mascot for the Los Alamitos High football team. His father was the 
water polo team coach there, and, despite Jeremy's initial interest in that 
sport, he preferred the gymnastic challenges and pep rallying of cheerleading. 
He got on a cheer squad and began competing at the middle school level and slid 
right in when he entered high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men are an increasing presence on high school squads, providing 
impressive support strength to tosses, lifts and pyramids. Ironically, the 
original cheerleaders were only male, according to Kristine Tulp, Universal 
Cheerleaders Assn. regional manager for the West Coast. Half the team at 
Century High in Santa Ana is male, and Mater Dei counts five males on its 
varsity squad of 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a male cheerleader has its benefits, says Jeremy, who would like to 
pursue cheer in college. Those benefits aren't what you might think, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there are so many girls trying to get into the program, it's tougher 
for them than guys," Jeremy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Image is also easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing they ask these days," he says, "is to keep our hair short and 
not pierce anything noticeable." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "I think of myself as part of the squad, not a guy on the team." Of 
course, as the only guy on the team, Jeremy says it's like having 20 sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's the camaraderie of the squad, cheerleaders say, that they most enjoy. 
There's something very tribal to the cheer scene, even among those long out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Postgame pizza parties, training camps and sleep-overs are all a part of pep 
life. So are bake sales and painting spirit posters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many count best friends among their squad, and all say they could depend on 
each other like family. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a teammate falls, everyone comes together afterward to console and 
hug. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some cry a lot under the pressure," says Jessica, "especially if they mess up 
during competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure and responsibility are not easy, says Jessica, even when you 
ignore stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never be negative or doing anything bad because it reflects on the 
squad as a whole," she says. "And you don't want to give your school a bad 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Belonging to another type of school group just wouldn't compare for these 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine not being a cheerleader," Jessica says. "I've been in it so 
long."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; SO, WHAT'S TO LIKE ABOUT SCHOOL?; PLENTY: AS A 
PLACE TO GET AN EDUCATION AND MAKE FRIENDS, THE HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE IS AS 
GOOD AS YOU MAKE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY ZUCCA , Kathy Zucca attends Canyon High School in Anaheim Hills, where 
this article first appeared in the student newspaper, Smoke Signals. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High school isn't always a breeze. There are times when you wonder if you will 
survive. It could be a huge essay you have to write, finals week, a conflict 
with a teacher or a friend or many other things that are getting you down.But 
life is full of stress and conflicts. Things don't always go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, high school is a place where you can learn. An education 
is practically handed to you. Not all students take advantage of this chance, 
but an education is there for the taking. There are many opportunities to 
expand your horizons and gain new skills.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics of high school claim that it is shallow and fake, based on a hierarchy 
of popularity and conformity. That may, at times, be true. However, high school 
is also a place where you can meet friends that might last a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 High school students are often stereotyped as being conformists and caring 
only about popularity. But the truth is that there are so many different people 
on campus with unique talents and qualities that it would be impossible to 
label high school students as conformists. 
</P>
<P>
 And popularity cannot reign supreme because different people value different 
qualities in their friends. Yes, some people are more social than others, but 
that is true everywhere, not just in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, high school is an enriching and rewarding experience. So 
stop complaining! High school has a lot to offer, but only if you give it a 
chance.

building." 
</P>
<P>
 Zac Fen, 17, senior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "People panicking, people going hysterical. When people start to panic we do

go out to the field and hang out, but if I was a teacher, I'd run for my own 
life."

 Tan Tran, 16, junior, Westminster 
</P>

 "There would be no school left because our (building) is way too old." 
</P>

the students mingle around while teachers are trying to take roll." 
</P>
<P>
 David Chogh, 18, senior, Fountain Valley 
</P>

 "People would be trying to hurry out of school. Everyone would be panicking, 
and so no one would be able to get out."

safety is provided for each individual."

something falls on the big kids' heads?"

 Meghan Kuhn, 17, senior, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "People won't run to the field in an orderly fashion. People will get hurt."

 Jennifer Samson, 16, junior, Cornelia Connelly 
</P>
<P>
 "Panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Dap Le, 16, junior, Los Amigos

 "The ground splitting open under my desk." 
</P>
<P>
 Francoise Castro, 17, senior, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're prepared by doing drills and stuff, there probably would be 
a lot of chaos more than anything, since nobody ever takes these drills 
seriously."

 Tanya Lyon, 17, senior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "Keeping your sanity and questioning your existence."

 "Buildings might collapse, and we wouldn't be able to go to school, but of 
course that's nothing major."

<P>
 Scott Scheffler, 15, sophomore, Brea Olinda 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us here have been through so many earthquakes that anything under an 
8.0 is just fine."

 Gary Hoggatt, 16, junior, Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "Panic control."

<P>
 "I think parents calling the school about their children would add to the 
confusion."

 "The biggest problem would be the panic of everyone."

<P>
 "The top (floor). We'll have to jump . . . and panic might be a problem."

<P>
 "The rebuilding process (that) the school and students would have to go 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Bach Vu, 17, senior, Santiago 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we're on a hill, there would be no way to communicate if all the power 
lines were shut down." 
</P>
<P>
 Veena Lucas, 16, junior, Brea Olinda 
</P>
<P>
 "People panicking. Even though they're supposed to go under their desks, 
students would want to get out of the classroom as quickly as possible, 
especially if they are sitting near a glass window." 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Stucker, 16, junior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "Having to come down from upstairs. If the stairs are gone, there would be

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; READY TO ROLL?; DON'T PANIC. BUT, WHEN IT 
COMES TO EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS, NOT ALL SCHOOLS ARE IN STEP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In rock 'n' roll-prone California, schools are required to prepare for 
earthquakes. In many schools, the plan is part of a larger disaster 
preparedness program that also covers fires, bomb scares, intruders on campus 
and a variety of other potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The state requirement to be prepared for earthquakes covers all schools with 
50 or more students or more than one classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the specific things called for in the code is that students and staff 
practice a "drop procedure" (known widely as "duck and cover") defined as 
taking cover under a table or desk, dropping to the knees with the head 
protected by the arms and the back to the windows. The procedure must be 
practiced at least once each quarter in elementary schools and at least once a 
semester in secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The state code leaves many other specifics up to individual districts, though, 
and the level of quake preparedness varies by school. It is dependent on a 
number of things, from how committed districts are to establishing strong plans 
to how attentive teachers and students are to learning and practicing emergency 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the state, some (districts) have very good plans; some don't," 
said Duwayne Brooks, assistant superintendent of school facilities planning 
with the state Department of Education. The level of preparedness reflects how 
much priority has been placed on it at the district level -- a decision Brooks 
said is often unrelated to proximity to known quake fault lines. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, many schools have detailed plans for coping with 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 At Villa Park High School, the school's earthquake plan spells out what should 
be done if the emergency happens during class or during free periods such as 
lunch or when students are changing classes.  
</P>
<P>
 Like many plans, it specifies that students not leave campus unless picked up 
by a parent or another appointed adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven disaster teams of faculty and school administrators at Villa Park have 
been appointed to cover various operations -- command center, sweep and rescue, 
site security and operations, first aid, assembly, parental assistance and 
accounting.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our task," states the Villa Park disaster handbook, "will be to function 
together as a team with group and individual responsibilities. The situation 
will have to be quickly analyzed. Students may need to be moved, accounted for 
and eventually reunited with a family member. Rescue efforts, first aid 
administration and community assistance are highly probable. Records of the 
situation and student movement will be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools, including Villa Park, have been designated as community disaster 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of a major quake, the school would serve as a Red Cross community 
center. It has back-up water supplies, and the cafeteria normally keeps a 
two-week supply of food. 
</P>
<P>
 At Loara High School in Anaheim, the school's disaster plan distributed to 
faculty and staff details everything from the role of a substitute teacher to 
who shuts off the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of an earthquake, "play it safe," the manual states. "For a 
minute or two the earth may pitch and roll like the deck of a ship. The motion 
is frightening but, unless it shakes something down on you, you will not be 
injured. Generally, the initial shock is the most severe and subsequent shocks 
are less intense. Keep calm and ride it out. Survival chances are good when one 
knows how to act." 
</P>
<P>
 Student responsibilities in the event of a disaster, as detailed in the Loara 
handbook, are: 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to your teacher carefully and follow directions; 
</P>
<P>
 Remain calm; 
</P>
<P>
 Know where the evacuation area is for each of your assigned teachers; 
</P>
<P>
 Know evacuation procedures to use before or after school, during passing 
period or at lunch; 
</P>
<P>
 Assist the teacher in caring for injured and help both staff and fellow 
students remain calm and act with judgment; 
</P>
<P>
 Upon evacuation, report to your teacher's evacuation area; 
</P>
<P>
 Stay with the class, assist in accounting for all students, listen for 
directions and follow them. 
</P>

 Crash. Bang. The lights are clanging and the school roof is caving in. The 
floor splits apart, leaving a hole to the center of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 But, being the earthquake-prepared students we are, we know exactly what to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck and cover (under those roomy desks) until we feel we are no longer in any 
danger.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, of course, we will file out the door in a neat, orderly fashion, being 
polite and considerate to all those in front of us along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with an injured limb dangling from her side, Jane waits her turn before 
leaving. With his trusty dog Spot, Dick volunteers to carry the unconscious 
carefully to safety. And we all live happily ever after.  
</P>
<P>
 Right? Wrong! It's time for a reality check. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think, living in California, that we would be totally prepared for the 
Big One. But it doesn't look that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldn't earthquake drills at school happen unexpectedly? After all, that's 
how earthquakes arrive. Instead, school drills are often announced beforehand. 
Sometimes, teachers tell students not only the day, but the exact moment the 
drill will take place. It seems students are only reminded of disaster 
procedure on days that drills are held. And even then it's a joke. Who takes 
these things seriously? What if something disastrous were to happen? Then what? 
</P>
<P>
 During past disaster drills, teachers have told students to duck and cover 
(something they often don't do themselves). Most desks are so small, we're 
lucky if we fit an arm or leg underneath. (And once we get under, what do we 
find? A rainbow of chewing gum above our heads. Now that's gross!) 
</P>
<P>
 If schools must have earthquake drills, it would be better if they were 
unannounced and a little more organized. 
</P>
<P>
 From what I've seen, it looks as if students will probably panic come the day 
of a disaster. Most students won't worry about whether they are reporting to 
the proper area. Chances are, rather than staying at school as they are 
supposed to, they will fear for their lives and move as far away from campus as 
possible! Wouldn't you? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe taking a few steps to make students more aware of the importance of 
safety during a disaster will change earthquake drills from empty exercises 
into meaningful training.

this article first appeared in the student newspaper, Smoke Signals.

<P>
 Did you ever wake up in the morning anticipating that school will be so 
electrifying and exhilarating that you can't wait to hop in your lowered ragtop 
and cruise down to the parking lot and start class? 
</P>
<P>
 How extremely pleasant it is to squeeze into a desk made for a first-grader 
and try to write on the desktop while half the paper is falling over the edge, 
with no arm room, no place to put your legs in front of you. 
</P>
<P>
 You get to sit for a full hour, listening to the bleak and monotonous lecture 
of the teacher, who, as well as half the class, usually doesn't know what is 
going on. Gradually, your buttocks begin to lack sensation. The incentive is 
not to wait until school is over anymore; rather, you hope that the teacher 
will tell you to deliver a call slip or get some coffee -- the movement giving 
your body the gratification of having done something other than sit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the five-minute bell rings, something I wait for not because I loathe the 
didactic part of school, but because I can get up and move (although the five 
minutes eventually truncates to about three minutes from trying to un-plaster 
your body from the too-small desk). 
</P>
<P>
 But that three minutes is all I ask; it satisfies me the way a child given a 
piece of bread for the first time in four days is satisfied. All I have to do 
now is pray that we will do a lab in physics or something other than sit for 
the next hour.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Camrin Christensen, a junior from Laguna Hills High School, is spending the 
school year as an American Field Service student in the Czech Republic, where 
she is living with a family of five. She attends Secondary School of Nursing in 
Kolin, about 45 miles from Prague.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I first learned that I would be going to the Czech Republic as an 
exchange student, I was warned about the lack of fruits and vegetables in the 
everyday diet. I was told to expect meat, sausages, dumplings and potatoes. It 
seems the Czechs are well known for their lack of concern about a balanced 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
 What I have encountered, however, is a different situation. Although I have 
had my fair share of meat and potatoes, I also have plenty of fruits and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many families here own land in the countryside, where they grow their 
own fruits and vegetables. Also, most families do their own canning and 
preserving for the cold winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruits and vegetables have not always been easily available, though. 
</P>
<P>
 My host mother, Frantiska, told me that just seven years ago people had to 
wait in line to purchase fruit, which was both expensive and difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the government has started to import greater amounts of fruits and 
vegetables, making them more abundant and less expensive. CAMRIN CHRISTENSEN

FIRST PERSON: AFTER HIGH SCHOOL REUNION, REALITY CATCHES UP FAST ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gail U., who broke my heart in the eighth grade, looked good as a blonde. 
Brigid C., a homecoming princess, remained a belle of the ball. And Holly M., 
who flirted without mercy way back when, was still a source of frustration. Tom 
Z., a fellow Cub Scout and a classmate from K through 12, was the picture of 
the fit, clean-cut firefighter. Lanny P., with whom I once dissected a fetal 
pig, had a receding hairline but enough confidence to scam on Brigid. And a guy 
named Mike, who sometimes showed up for class stoned, wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 It was worth the $67.50. It was nice to see everybody. And for this member of 
Santa Ana High School's Class of 1974, it was especially sweet to see Sherri 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 We were 16 in the summer before our senior year. We'd get together in her 
family's TV room for each new episode of "Kung Fu." Friendship blossomed into 
love. Ah, yes, Grass-hoppah. For the next five years, it was your basic 
roller-coaster of young romance -- passion, joy, jealousy, heartache. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 13 years had passed since our last encounter. We hugged and she 
introduced me to her husband, Mike -- a different Mike. They live in Westlake 
Village. My Sherri was a girl who insisted she'd never have kids. Mike's 
"Sharon" is the mother of two boys. She's a full-time housewife who drives a 
minivan and volunteers at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike's in software. And Mike, as he puts it with a smile, is "an angry white 
male." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reunion, we all knew, was for memories and catching up, so this 
conversation didn't take place until the morning after. We agreed to meet at 
Felix, a Cuban restaurant on the Orange circle, three grown-ups coming out of a 
time warp. 
</P>
<P>
 When the conversation veered toward the election results, Mike grinned and 
Sherri grimaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Mike is angry. He's articulate, confident and angry about What's 
Happening to America. He didn't vote for Proposition 187 and Wilson and 
Huffington because he's a dyed-in-the-wool conservative. Hardly. He wanted me 
to know that he voted for Mondale against Reagan and even displayed a Dukakis 
sign in '88, back when he and Sherri still lived in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike favored Proposition 187 for all the usual reasons and more. For him, this 
measure wasn't just an approach to illegal immigration. This measure, for Mike, 
was about the common presence of the Spanish language and ballots printed in 
anything other than English. To him, it was a way to say "Enough already!" to 
the trashing of Christopher Columbus and proposed changes in U.S. history 
textbooks and other crimes committed in the name of "political correctness." It 
was a vote against group identities and a vote in favor of the value of 
individualism and personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The more Mike talked, the more it became obvious that Proposition 187 was like 
a runaway 18-wheeler carrying a cargo of volatile grievances, all touching on 
the competing ideals of America. Many angry white males, no doubt, saw 
Proposition 187 as a vote against affirmative action and the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of what Mike said reminded me of a George Will column about the threat of 
"multiculturalism." There have been, as Will noted, many excesses and 
absurdities, and there is much that is worthy of criticism. But has America 
ever been monocultural, like, say, Japan? Is that a worthy ideal? It seemed a 
fitting topic at a Cuban restaurant tucked in a downtown that still resembles 
Smalltown, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 What unites us, Mike argued, is our American heritage. Our heritage, I 
suggested, has been one of constant social change. Mike, like many Americans 
throughout the ages, sees immigration as a threat to American culture. American 
culture, I suggested, has always expanded and evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike objects to the efforts to revise U.S. history textbooks, suggesting that 
bows to "political correctness" and "multiculturalism" corrode American values. 
It seems to me that a revision of history books could do more to honoring 
America's most noble struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked about two American heroes. As kids, we learned all about Paul Revere 
and "the 18th of April in '75" -- largely because Longfellow was a hell of a 
publicist. But why was it that Mike and I didn't hear about the abolitionist 
Harriet Tubman until our college years or later? Tubman's story is the more 
profound -- yet she never got as much ink. 
</P>
<P>
 A knee-jerk angry white male might say Tubman is getting attention these days 
because a black woman is "politically correct." Mike is more thoughtful than 
that. Maybe I'm wrong, but he seemed willing to consider the notion that maybe 
kids might benefit by learning a little something about Tubman and less about 
Revere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We were spoiling Sherri's breakfast. She seemed relieved when Mike offered me 
a personal revelation. Mike smiled and said that really he doesn't know his own 
ethnic heritage, because he was adopted. His dark features suggest many 
possibilities. Sherri laughed recalling how somebody said her husband looked 
"Mayan." 
</P>
<P>
 But we soon returned to politics, to Sherri's dismay. The angry Mayan male, if 
that's what he is, was clinging to the hope that Huffington would pull it out. 
Mike fantasized that his absentee ballot would be the last one counted, and his 
vote would defeat Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that he respects Huffington. And it's not that Mike adores assault 
rifles and, therefore, hates Feinstein. No, Mike voted for Huffington for one 
reason above all others: to punish Feinstein for her stand against 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was right. She predicted that 187 might cost her the election, and 
it almost did. Men like Mike, and women too, were willing to overlook 
Huffington's hypocrisy, carpetbagging and other dubious credentials to "send a 
message." But what great American values would have been honored by the 
election of Mike Huffington? 
</P>
<P>
 Only reluctantly would Mike's Sharon join this discussion. "Who did you vote 
for?" I asked. I was wondering whether the girl I knew -- a girl so moved by 
the immigrant hero of "Kung Fu" -- had become a woman who would follow her 
husband's angry lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. For Senator, my Sherri didn't vote for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple days later, we talked on the phone and agreed to get together for 
lunch, some time after Thanksgiving. Just the two of us, to talk about 
everything else.

IN D.C., WATCH WHO CALLS YOU 'FRIEND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this city, you call your rivals friends to be polite. Dignified. Diplomatic 
in a city that runs on diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon started here long ago, when truly decorous speech permeated the 
House and the Senate.(It still does in the British Parliament, where jabs at 
hated opponents routinely begin, "As my Right Honorable Friend has so wisely 
pointed out . . .") 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it was functional, to maintain decorum. But then it bled over into 
the messy rest of the political world -- into how folks do business," says Earl 
Bender, a Democratic political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn very fast in Washington to calibrate each person's use of the term 
Good Friend . A lobbyist might meet you once and have a passing knowledge of 
you in the newspapers, and this language of inflation allows the lobbyist to 
refer to you as a Good Friend, which isn't the same thing as the good friend 
you drink a beer with after work in your undershirt." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the best way to embarrass enemies is to link them through 
friendship to someone unpopular, someone like -- well, these days, the 
President himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in Washington, where the word has been twisted beyond recognition, can 
being a close friend of the biggest guy in town be a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is," says Bender, "being a close friend of the President of the 
United States, the leader of the free world, the most powerful man on Earth, 
is, was, and will always be a good thing." MARY ANN HOGAN

DANCE REVIEW; A MUDDLED, MINIATURE 'SWAN LAKE' VIA MOSCOW

 On the eve of his 30th anniversary as head of the Bolshoi Ballet, Yuri 
Grigorovich is a man in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 His company, like most artistic institutions in the former Soviet Union, is 
teetering on the brink of economic disaster and aesthetic stagnation. His once 
unchallenged position of power could collapse at any moment, and, according to 
a growing number of progressive antagonists in Moscow, it may not be a moment 
too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The not-so-great dictator of terpsichorean Russia doesn't want to talk about 
any possible changing of the administrative guard. He is too busy, he says, 
with his latest project -- the care and feeding of a relatively modest ensemble 
that bears a relatively immodest name: the Grigorovich Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 For most impractical purposes, this is a junior Bolshoi organization. It uses 
reasonable facsimiles of old and familiar Bolshoi productions, staged by 
guess-who, as showcases for a small group of dancers who are apparently too 
young to appear with the prestigious alma mater yet too old to be in school. 
The participants reportedly range in age from 19 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the new Grigorovich gang brought its version of "The Nutcracker" to 
Cerritos. Wednesday night on the extended stage of Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 
the vehicle was "Lebedinoe ozero," better known in this part of the world as 
"Swan Lake." 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, was no ordinary "Swan Lake." This, essentially, was 
Grigorovich's controversial 1969 production as performed by a farm club on a 
bus-and-truck tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone in the cast had to fulfill multiple assignments. The basic 
swan corps numbered a pathetic dozen. The crowd scenes have never looked less 
crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 The decors of Simon Virsaladze have seen better days. And, it should be 
recalled, those better days were ponderously garish. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchaikovsky's wonderful score was blasted -- and I do mean blasted -- at the 
non-capacity audience in Pasadena via too-loudspeakers. This not only 
threatened damage to the assembled ear drums but also straitjacketed the 
well-schooled dancers in matters of phrasing, nuance and tempo. Recorded 
ballet, after all, is frozen ballet. It makes spontaneity a matter of wishful 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, there could be little room for assertive 
characterization, even if the neophytes on the stage had been inclined toward 
individuality of expression (in this context an unlikely prospect). 
Unfortunately, Grigorovich's distortion of "Swan Lake," a muddled 
quasi-abstraction that banishes mime and either ignores or contradicts the 
plot, needs all the dramatic help it can get. (It also needs more truth in 
crediting; to pretend that Grigorovich created all the choreography except 
Petipa's black-swan adagio is a preposterous joke.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to tell the players on Wednesday, even with a program. Most 
of the parts are triple cast. A voice on the public-address system rattled off 
the names of the principals on duty just before the curtain rose. The identity 
of the key performers in other assignments, however, remained a mystery -- a 
mystery that insulted the audience while it injured the artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The central role in "Swan Lake" is a dual challenge of immense complexity. 
Odette can be played either as an otherworldly bird or as a tragic queen, and 
there are other possibilities as well. Odile, her evil alter-ego, can be a 
flamboyant seductress or a dazed impostor. Tatiana Ledovskikh -- pretty, 
slender and a bit brittle -- settled for being a competent ballerina. No more, 
no less. Her most distinctive feature, apart from a fleeting and pardonable 
mishap in the ball scene, turned out to be the droopiest eyelashes this side of 
a Bette Davis impersonator. 
</P>
<P>
 Konstantin Ivanov as Prince Siegfried partnered her with touching 
consideration, bounded through the air with buoyant ease, and projected bland 
detachment at all times. The error-riddled program did not deem him worthy of a 
biographical sketch. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Mischenko stalked the hero dutifully as a nasty, clean-shaven, 
dark-haired Rothbart (here called Robart , for reasons unfathomable). Andrei 
Evdokimov did what he could with the unmusical, anti-theatrical, 
all-too-athletic tricks of that pesky Jester -- an ancient Soviet anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone worked hard. Too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 This hand-me-down "Swan" was no turkey, seasonal greetings notwithstanding. 
But it didn't hold out the poetic promise of an ugly duckling, either. After 
many a summer dies the. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, never mind. 
</P>
<P>
