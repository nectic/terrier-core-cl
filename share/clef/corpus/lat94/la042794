POP MUSIC REVIEW ; EAGLES REGAIN PEACEFUL, EASY FEELING 
</P>

 Fourteen years between shows? 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, it's no problem for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quintet's first concert performance since a savage 1980 breakup, the 
Eagles demonstrated Monday night in Burbank the conviction and craft that 
originally made it one of the all-time great American rock groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Angeles-based band had to get over its nervousness before it 
showed those characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, even the Eagles, often described in the '70s as icy performers, showed 
evidence of the jitters in the opening minutes of its two-hour set before 800 
fans and guests on a sound stage at Warner Bros. Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show that was taped for an MTV special scheduled to air in late summer, 
the band members -- Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Don Felder, Timothy B. Schmit and 
Joe Walsh -- hardly acknowledged the audience as they walked from the shadows 
to the stools that would be their home for the opening acoustic set. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed casually in T-shirt and jeans, Frey began things, predictably, with 
"Peaceful Easy Feeling," one of the first in a series of hits that made the 
Eagles the biggest-selling band in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 But his vocal and the band's playing and backing harmonies hardly reflected 
the comforting, relaxed aura of the lyrics. Instead, the band seemed cautious 
through the early numbers -- more concerned with avoiding mistakes than opening 
up emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 The anxiousness wasn't broken until seven numbers into the set when Henley, 
wearing a flannel shirt and jeans, flubbed the words to one of four new songs 
-- the ballad "Learn to Be Still." 
</P>
<P>
 For longtime Eagles watchers, it was a key moment. One of the factors that 
contributed to the breakup of the band in 1980 was the tension growing out of 
the high standards and perfectionism demanded, in large part, by Henley and 
Frey, the band's primary songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than get more uptight, Henley simply laughed as he acknowledged his 
error and started again -- and the nervousness evaporated for everyone on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 When the group followed with Felder's classy new guitar introduction to "Hotel 
California," the music felt more effortless and free. 
</P>
<P>
 After the acoustic set, the band was joined by an orchestra and up to five 
backing musicians for seven songs. Schmit contributed the lead vocal on "I 
Can't Tell You Why," and Walsh sang "Pretty Maids All in a Row." 
</P>
<P>
 For the closing segment, the Eagles turned up the volume and rocked, moving 
from "One of These Nights" through "Life in the Fast Lane" and "Heartache 
Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The encore consisted of the biting new "Get Over It," which Henley describes 
as the band's new "anti-politically correct" song, and "Desperado," the Eagles' 
signature song from the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, the singing sounded as inviting and tailored as if the band had 
never taken the winter off -- much less 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question surrounding the regrouping of the Eagles wasn't whether the 
harmonies would still be there -- just as, given the continued popularity of 
Eagles songs, there was no worry about selling tickets for their upcoming tour, 
even at a top price in Southern California of $115. 
</P>
<P>
 The question for the tour, which begins May 27 at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre 
and ends Oct. 8 at the Rose Bowl, was whether the songs would still be 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, the Eagles chronicled the contradictions and tensions of a 
generation caught between the idealism of the '60s and the encroaching greed of 
the '80s -- and those issues remain part of the national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's best songs, from "Hotel California" to "The Last Resort," deal with 
everything from innocence to cynicism, personal ethics to governmental 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The continued relevance of these songs -- along with the introduction of new 
material and the inclusion of some of Henley's solo material -- is important 
because the Eagles are speaking about this tour as being a "resumption," not 
just a one-time reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Band morale is high," Frey said backstage after the taping. "Everybody is 
upbeat. We are having a good time. I couldn't be happier." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, seated next to him, said he also would like to see the Eagles continue 
as a recording and touring unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have grown up some," he said. "Doing the solo thing was nice, but there is 
something about being in a band that is magic."

MOVIE REVIEW ; MARTIN LAWRENCE'S FAMILY VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No need to worry about thoughtless critics giving away all the best jokes in 
"You So Crazy," the new Martin Lawrence performance film. If they work for 
mainstream publications, they won't be able to. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lawrence is almost always in-your-face raunchy and scatological, an 
enthusiastic dispenser of profanity whose explicit detailing of all kinds of 
sexual situations led to "Crazy" getting an NC-17 rating and undergoing a 
change in distribution. The same tendencies got Lawrence uninvited from "The 
Tonight Show" after his use on "Saturday Night Live" of what Daily Variety 
described as "coarse material" elicited hundreds of complaining phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lawrence, the star of Fox network's "Martin" and the former host of HBO's 
"Def Comedy Jam," is more than someone who talks dirty. As this film of a 
Brooklyn Academy of Music concert shows, he is an alive comic presence, an 
adept social commentator, and, most surprising, a promoter of values that can 
only be called mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a leather outfit with a large peace sign on the front and something 
unprintable on the back, Lawrence can't stand still. He prowls back and forth 
like a fighter, an impish performer who knows how clever and sassy he is and 
relishes the knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Richard Pryor, not surprisingly one of his models, Lawrence really 
doesn't deliver jokes. He tells stories, dispenses advice, describes outrageous 
situations. A vivid mimic, Lawrence just doesn't talk the talk, he grandly 
pantomimes every last sexual detail he can think of. 
</P>
<P>
 Again like Pryor in his early days, sex and race are Lawrence's two main 
subjects. He cheerfully skewers white people for being "too chipper; they know 
it's their country." His more outrageous routines deal with masturbation, oral 
sex, what goes on in prisons and what mealtime was like for Jeffrey Dahmer. All 
are offshoots of the kind of no-holds-barred frankness that always 
characterizes street humor, displaying an absence of shame that places them 
several steps past what anyone is used to hearing on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the delight he takes in being unvarnished and verbally beyond the 
pale, the thrust of Lawrence's performance supports quite solid values. He 
encourages fathers to take care of their children, men and women to love each 
other and communicate better, and everyone to use condoms and stay away from 
crack. Though he may not talk like a conventional role model, beliefs like this 
make him sound like a candidate for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Very fluidly directed by Thomas Schlamme, who used eight cameras and director 
of photography Arthur Albert to make sure everything went smoothly, this is a 
model performance film from a visual point of view. Startling and funny, 
today's version of comedy that goes beyond the socially acceptable, "You So 
Crazy's" lack of boundaries will unnerve people who think they're beyond all of 
that. Which is no doubt part of the point. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: NC-17, for language. Times guidelines: very frank and graphic 
sexual language and mimicry.

 Sanders to Leave Channel 2: Hosea Sanders, one of the few local black male 
television news anchors, is leaving KCBS Channel 2. Sanders, who has been a 
weekend anchor since 1986, said he will become a weekday morning anchor at ABC 
affiliate WLS-TV in Chicago after his current contract expires in July. He will 
also be doing occasional news reports for ABC News. He is leaving in the wake 
of charges by employees and community leaders that KCBS has discriminated 
against minorities and women in the newsroom. Los Angeles Urban League 
President John Mack said of Sanders' departure: "This is a great opportunity 
for him. But it is also an indictment of KCBS and other network-owned stations 
in this city that they have failed to hire a black male anchor on a regular 
basis. It makes the point that racism is alive and well in too many newsrooms. 
The 'good old white boys' running the newsrooms just aren't willing to be fair 
and just in this regard." Sanders said management had not talked to him about 
renewing his contract. As far as his relationship with management, he said, 
"Generally, people who are satisfied with their jobs don't entertain other 
offers." Station management declined to comment.

 * Remembrances of Nixon: Following today's coverage of former President 
Richard Nixon's funeral, NBC News will rebroadcast part of John Chancellor's 
1971 "A Day in the Life of the Presidency" report on the Nixon White House. The 
footage appears on "Now With Tom Brokaw & Katie Couric" at 9 p.m. On Friday, 
PBS' "Talking With David Frost" will be devoted to segments culled from 28 
hours of interviews Frost conducted with Nixon in 1977. Also on Friday, KCET 
will repeat the PBS "American Experience" program "Nixon" from 9 p.m. to 
midnight. And on Tuesday at 9 p.m., cable's A&E will premiere "Nixon on Nixon," 
a new "Biography" program produced within the last year, in which the former 
President gives a personal account of the many trials and tribulations of his 
political career and private life. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talkers Silenced: In deference to the national day of mourning to observe 
Nixon's funeral, nascent cable talk show channel America's Talking has canceled 
Los Angeles auditions scheduled for today for an unknown talent to host a 
one-year talk show. However, the auditions will take place as planned on 
Thursday and Friday, at the Century City Shopping Center & Marketplace. 
Audition hours will be extended both days from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. THE ARTS

 Happy Birthday: Popular lexicographer-musicologist-conductor-composer Nicolas 
Slonimsky celebrates his 100th birthday today with a musical celebration for 
invited guests at the downtown Museum of Contemporary Art. That follows on the 
heels of Sunday's fete at Irvine's Severin Wunderman Museum. A longtime Los 
Angeles resident, the Russian-born Slonimsky will also be saluted this weekend 
on KUSC-FM's "Sundays at Four" series.

 Taper Shows Recognized: As the Broadway awards season gets under way, two 
former Mark Taper Forum epics, "The Kentucky Cycle" and "Angels in America," 
are among the nominees for outstanding Broadway play from New York's Outer 
Critics Circle. The other nominees are "Broken Glass" and "The Rise and Fall of 
Little Voice." Nominated for the Broadway musical award are "Beauty and the 
Beast" and "The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public," along with last season's 
"Blood Brothers" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman." . . . In other awards news, 
Anthony Hopkins has been tapped to host this year's Tony Awards, June 12 in New 
York. QUICK TAKES 
</P>
<P>
 Looks like David Letterman can throw a good party even away from home. The 
guests he's lined up so far for his May 9-13 visit to Los Angeles are Michael 
Keaton, Bette Midler, Elvis Costello, Ray Charles, Magic Johnson, Billy 
Crystal, David Copperfield and, in what CBS says is its first public appearance 
together since 1974, the music group Traffic. . . . Speaking of Letterman, he 
will join ABC News' Diane Sawyer, Discovery Communications founder John 
Hendricks, and CBS President Howard Stringer in receiving the first Foundation 
Awards from the International Radio and Television Society on May 10. The new 
awards recognize "individuals who have built a foundation for great success in 
their careers and enriched our industry as a whole." . . . Talk-show host Joe 
Crummey has joined the on-air staff at KMPC-AM (710), which is changing to an 
all-talk format May 9. Crummey had hosted talk programs at KFI-AM for about 5 
years. He will now be heard on KMPC from noon to 3 p.m. . . . Walt Disney 
Pictures will stretch the rubber children's toy "Stretch Armstrong" into a 
live-action film character, for a movie to be released next year. Also to be 
featured: Stretch's similarly elastic dog Fetch. . . . "I Love You," the 
favorite song of purple preschoolers star Barney, has spawned a lawsuit by 
Washington state music publisher Jean Warren, who claims she owns the rights to 
the song. Barney's creators say they paid an Indiana woman, Lee Bernstein, for 
the rights in 1992. But Warren says she bought the rights from Bernstein in 
1983, so the Barney folks paid the wrong person. SHAUNA SNOW

JAZZ REVIEW; THE FREDDIE HUBBARD FIVE MINUS FOUR AT UNION STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Murphy's Law was in effect on Sunday afternoon at that unlikeliest of venues, 
a concert hall at Union Station. A performance by a group listed as the Freddie 
Hubbard Quintet found four of the advertised musicians missing, most notably 
Hubbard himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The trumpeter, who was briefly hospitalized recently but confirmed his 
appearance as late as Sunday morning, was taken "violently ill" around show 
time, according to his manager. His saxophonist, Bob Sheppard, also was a 
no-show and was not replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Tony Dumas and drummer Carl Burnett were replaced by subs, John B. 
Williams and Charles McVacerson Jr. This left pianist John Beasley as the only 
billed artist to participate. The audience, which had paid $20 to hear 
Hubbard's group, was offered a program by what had become the John Beasley 
Trio. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Beasley is a soloist of singular skill and Williams, best known 
for his regular work on "The Arsenio Hall Show," has long been respected for 
his upright bass work. Long familiar with such Hubbard compositions as "Up 
Jumped Spring" and "Sky Dive," the trio mixed them with such standards as 
"You're My Everything" and Bud Powell's "Celia." LEONARD FEATHER

TV REVIEW; 'BEIRUT TO BOSNIA' WARNS OF HATRED OF WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 British correspondent Robert Fisk's territory is a world of laptops and 
notebooks, suicide truck bombs and sniper attacks. His 18 years of dispatches 
for the Times of London and the Independent make him a genuine survivor among 
Beirut-based reporters.  
</P>
<P>
 Words, Fisk suggests, aren't enough to convey the pain, frustration and terror 
of the people who live with war in the region. Maybe sound and images can do a 
better job: thus, "Beirut to Bosnia," his three-part film report for Channel 
Four in England and picked up for U.S. broadcast by the Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters must react to events, and the developing event that has captured 
Fisk's attention is the growth of Islamic fundamentalism and its militant 
armies of faithful. He sees his reports as warnings to the West of a collecting 
rage against the West, and especially the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's segment begins with haunting images of a shattered Beirut and the 
Iranian and Syrian-supported Islamic sect Hezbollah, which has grown since the 
1982 Israeli invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisk struggles to decode the martyrdom ethic of the terrorizing believer, who 
views his death as marking the entry into Allah's kingdom -- a death made even 
greater if it comes while destroying Allah's "enemies," namely Israelis and 
their allies.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's death as an escape from the slums and poverty that director Michael 
Dutfield's camera vividly captures, especially in the desperately poor 
neighborhoods of Gaza where Fisk travels in the second segment. The Israeli 
military's demolition of apartment buildings where a sniper was hunted down 
smacks of the worst of Vietnam to an American viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Fisk isn't out to condemn the Jewish people. In a moving segment, he 
likens two refugee tragedies -- an elderly Israeli in an old Palestinian home 
is himself a Holocaust survivor. Fisk even travels to the old man's hometown of 
Trzebina, Poland, where no Jews now live. 
</P>
<P>
 The final segment travels even further: from Egypt, where a militant Islamic 
terror campaign has driven tourists out of the country, to Bosnia, and the 
Muslim victims of Christian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Beirut to Bosnia" airs at 10 tonight through Friday; repeats at 1 a.m. and 
on consecutive Saturdays beginning April 30.

PUT THE BUCKS ALONG THE BORDER; DEVELOPING A SENSIBLE IMMIGRATION STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a politically charged climate, money at the federal and state levels is 
talking loudly in the complicated formulation of immigration strategies along 
the U.S. border with Mexico. While the fiscal crunch is certainly not producing 
any more dollars, ironically it is helping shape some sensible policies and 
positions in Washington and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service now acknowledges that the 
money just isn't there for the ambitious $30-million upgrade of the Border 
Patrol's San Clemente checkpoint on Interstate 5, and that available resources 
for now are best concentrated along the border. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), 
long an advocate of a bigger facility and one of those in Congress urging 
colleagues to ante up for immigration costs, is convinced this represents a 
fundamental strategic decision by the Clinton Administration. He has wisely 
folded his cards and called on Congress and the INS to close that checkpoint, 
and another one in Temecula, and to concentrate all resources and agents to the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the money was there, we have argued that it makes no sense to try to 
control illegal immigration 62 miles inside the country. There, Border Patrol 
efforts to stem the tide on a busy interstate are hopelessly late in the 
process, largely ineffective and even dangerous. Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego) 
campaigned for office against the checkpoints in 1992, and later asked Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner good questions about the 
checkpoints' cost-effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the INS denies that it has lost confidence in checkpoints, but 
says pointedly that it is evaluating them in the current fiscal climate and in 
view of an Administration preference for border regulation. It is not difficult 
to read between the lines, however. What the INS really must do is determine 
how to reallocate personnel to the border in a cost-effective way, one that 
makes best use of the latest technology and that preserves constructive 
relations with Mexico in the era of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of cost-effectiveness, Gov. Pete Wilson has followed Florida and New 
York in efforts to recover from the federal government the cost of imprisoning 
illegal immigrants in state prisons. He's right; California taxpayers should 
not have to bear the burden of this federal responsibility. The lawsuit can 
only strengthen the case made by these beleaguered states that the federal 
government must meet what are in fact federal obligations.

PRESIDENT NIXON'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * How sad it is to lose a former President. Although I always backed President 
Richard Nixon's opponents, America has lost a senior foreign-policy expert. 
Some of the public policy statements he made during the last decade sounded 
rather reasonable compared with the previous 12 years of conservative 
Reagan-Bush policies. Back in the early 1970s I was upset with him for not 
including me on his "enemies list." But time heals old wounds.

 * A TV reporter said in reference to President Nixon: "We are all victims of 
our successes and our strengths are determined by our weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 President Nixon has always been my hero since I was a Nixonette on the 
Berkeley campus in the '60s. Since that time, and to this moment, President 
Nixon has been my inspiration for overcoming life's battles during periods of 
adversity and personal crisis.

 * Richard Nixon's keen mind was clearly demonstrated during a foreign-policy 
speech he delivered to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 1986. Just 
prior to being introduced to the approximately 1,000 people on hand, he asked 
that the podium be removed. His aide at the time, John Taylor, now executive 
director of the Nixon Library & Birthplace, had given me a copy of the text. I 
noted that it was 21 pages, double-spaced -- a probing examination of America's 
role in the post-nuclear age. The former President spoke extemporaneously, not 
using a single note. 
</P>
<P>
 Towards the end of the talk, Nixon ticked off 12 points outlining a new policy 
toward the then-Soviet Union. Looking at my text from my place at the end of 
the dais, I noted that he skipped point 10. Just prior to concluding, he paused 
and then deftly inserted the missing paragraph. He had included virtually every 
word in the text of that approximately 40-minute speech!

 The writer is past president of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. * What 
has caused the media and President Clinton to half-staff the flag for Richard 
Nixon? Are we to mourn a fallen President, a statesman? True, he has died and 
we don't say bad things about the dead. But should we distort history? 
</P>
<P>
 He was forced to resign the presidency or be impeached. He broke many laws. He 
betrayed the trust of the American people and the oath of office. He ruined the 
lives of thousands of citizens with his red-baiting and secret enemies list. He 
supported fascist dictatorships in Southern Europe and throughout the Third 
World. He was elected by promising to end the Vietnam War and instead escalated 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, the law-and-order President, thought like a criminal, authorizing 
robberies, break-ins and phone taps. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when a sacred trust to the American people is trampled by a President, 
when laws are broken which would have sent a poorer, less important person to 
jail, then history should record it that way.

 * Shortly after Nixon resigned I was in London shopping at a discount store.

things. He had bad character."

 * Shortly before he was questioned about his choice in underwear last week, an 
MTV audience of twentysomethings asked President Clinton what was the most 
important thing his mother had taught him. He replied, "Never give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he could have learned that same lesson from Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what you thought of him or his politics, you could never call Nixon 
a quitter. Time after time, when pundits had written him off, Nixon was the 
proverbial phoenix that kept rising from the political ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could have imagined that a Republican President, who was forced to resign 
from office nearly 20 years ago, would be briefing a Democratic President after 
returning from a recent trip to Russia where he met with top opposition 
leaders? In some countries, a Nixon figure would have been exiled or shoved off 
to permanent obscurity. Instead, Nixon fought back and began a long political 
comeback that would ultimately reward him with an elder-statesman mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's well-chronicled career had a long history of fighting back and turning 
insurmountable tides. After losing the 1960 presidential election and then the 
California gubernatorial election, Nixon weakened only once publicly by 
proclaiming, "You won't have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore." But even then, 
after a short stint in private life, he did the impossible -- he came back to 
win the presidency just a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these thoughts occurred to me back in 1983 when Nixon came out of 
seclusion to begin his public rehabilitation with a speech on foreign policy at 
Chapman College in Orange. Even then, speaking without notes and a podium, he 
kept an audience spellbound with a thoughtful analysis of world affairs. He 
received a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 After being so publicly disgraced, Nixon could have hid and collected his 
presidential pension. But he seemingly had a genetic mandate to keep firing 
back and he did, by writing books, giving speeches and playing adviser to world 
leaders. He never gave up. Maybe that could be one of Richard Nixon's greatest 
legacies.

</P>
<P>
 * If Watergate began the period of national skepticism, the glowing 
reminiscences about Richard Nixon by some who knew him do nothing to change 
that Zeitgeist . 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that Nixon broke the law not only by obstructing justice in the 
Watergate investigation. His apologists seem to forget the burglary of the 
office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist. They've apparently forgotten the 
enemies list and the wiretapping. Those are violations of the Fourth Amendment. 
Perhaps they've forgotten, too, his abuse of power by illegal use of the IRS to 
harass his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducting foreign policy is one thing: You make your own rules. Domestic 
governance has quite different, more difficult ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we shall have the spectacle of all of those past presidents and the 
present one eulogizing Nixon. Either they are world-class hypocrites or they 
have forgotten that if this is not a nation of laws, not men, then it is not 
worth living here.

affairs. What about domestic affairs? 
</P>
<P>
 As a black female who has worked extensively in the federal environs of 
equal-employment opportunity, beginning with the program's inception in 1969, I 
feel that it is time to give credit where credit is due. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was the first President to put teeth in equal opportunity in employment 
in the federal government through his Executive Order 11478 (Aug. 8, 1969). 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't stop there! More important, he was the President who signed into 
law the amendment (PL 92-261, March 24, 1972) to the 1964 Civil Rights Law, 
which directed equal opportunity in employment for not only federal employees 
but for state and local government employees, too. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs will forge an acquired skill forever in the manner that our 
government treats its citizens in equality of opportunity. I salute you, Mr. 
President, and thank you!

how much they hated him when he was President? Has everyone forgotten about the 
countless deaths he caused in Southeast Asia, or the fact that he resigned in

</P>

 A national day of mourning for Nixon? You've got be kidding me!

 * When Hitler began conquering Europe, no one in the media accused any 
opponent of those events of "anti-Nazi hysteria." Yet in 1946, when Stalin 
gobbled up East Europe and Richard Nixon ran for Congress opposing this, he was 
accused of "anti-communist hysteria." Communism lasted much longer than Nazism 
and has been responsible for far more butchery and suffering in many more 
countries. To this day, the media repeat the cliche of "anti-communist 
hysteria," as though anyone who is against communism is some kind of a 
dangerous radical. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of world communism, I should think, would have validated those who 
were always against it rather than those who appeased it. It took TV about 40 
years before it would show footage of Stalin's troops invading East Poland in 
1939, instead of just Hitler invading from the other side. I proudly join in 
honoring Nixon for his "anti-communist hysteria." We "hysterics" were right.

 * Historians and media pundits will argue the pros and cons of Nixon's actions 
as President for years hence. No one, however, will dare question the 
down-to-earth brilliance of his forethought to draw up a "living will." He 
spared us the media sensationalization of the medical heroics to save a 
half-paralyzed, unable-to-speak human. I hope many people will consider the 
same legal course to preserve their dignity, as did he.

HEALTH WATCH; PURGING POPCORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Popcorn was supposed to be the guilt-free snack. Now a study released by the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest tells us that much of the popcorn 
sold in movie theaters is popped in coconut oil, making a healthy snack a whole 
lot less healthy.Coconut oil is a big no-no because it's high in saturated 
fats, which are a key cause of heart disease. Ideally, popcorn should be cooked 
in something less artery-clogging; air-popping would cut the fat content 
dramatically.  
</P>
<P>
 And forget about butter-flavored topping. Everybody knows that the congealed 
yellow stuff pumped on top of popcorn at the theater can't be good for you. 
There . We've said the responsible thing. 
</P>
<P>
 With that out of the way, can we have a little perspective here? Of course we 
should all strive to eat and live healthier. But heck, we also think there's no 
need to double over in guilt if once a week or twice a month you like, as we 
do, to dive into a bag of warm popcorn (dare we say it? sometimes with butter 
flavor), washed down by a soda (yes, soda, not unfiltered juice) and top it off 
with a few pieces (OK, a whole box) of sugar-laden candy.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we should just take a packet of vitamins to the movies and pop them 
during the key climatic scenes. No rustling of popcorn bags or candy wrappers, 
just a quick gulp of B12, with bottled water, of course. Oops! No, that won't 
work either: Another recent study suggested that vitamin supplements are pretty 
much useless to a person who eats a balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next? Vitamin-flavored popcorn? Wouldn't help, but couldn't hurt.

BECOMING THE MASTER OF DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A meeting on Monday in Washington of federal officials involved in the 
Northridge quake relief produced two very useful ideas. One is that the widely 
praised federal effort will need to be even better next time. And the other is 
that the cost of disaster insurance is too onerous to be left to individuals or 
even to individual states but must be organized in the form of mandatory 
federal disaster insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The multi-agency meeting and self-evaluation, attended by such disaster doyens 
as James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Henry 
G. Cisneros, the housing secretary and Federico Pena, the transportation 
secretary, did not bog down in an orgy of self-satisfaction. Indeed, despite 
its successes, the relief program, officials agreed, was plagued by too much 
confusion and too many errors. "This was a great experience," said one 
official. "But the Big One scares the bejesus out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 That helpful lack of smugness was reflected in the officials' keen sense that 
a national disaster-relief insurance fund is urgently needed. The time has come 
for Congress to take a hard look at making disaster insurance, be it flood, 
hurricane, earthquake or whatever, mandatory for the nation's property owners. 
Government simply doesn't have the resources to compensate all 
disaster-produced property losses. And only if the risks are spread widely can 
the premium for basic, meat-and-potatoes coverage be kept so low that it can be 
required of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monday meeting was a useful reminder that the effort to create such a 
national insurance fund needs to be mounted now. The memory of the Jan. 17 
quake is fresh enough that the idea should still engage the attention of the 
entire California delegation. The vicious tornado in Texas on Monday should 
arouse that state's representatives to action. Each month seems to bring some 
fresh rebuke from Mother Nature. The only way not to leave ordinary Americans 
in the financial lurch is to create some sort of natural-disaster protection 
act that would assist states in adopting stiffer building codes, give private 
insurance companies some incentives to make quakes and other perils more 
insurable and require basic natural-disaster insurance coverage.

THE NEXT FEMINIST REVOLUTION; TODAY'S ADOLESCENT GIRLS FACE ALL THE FREEDOMS 
THEIR MOTHERS WON, PLUS ALL THE EXPECTATIONS THEIR MOTHERS IGNORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE ADLER MARKS, Marlene Adler Marks is a columnist for the Jewish 
Journal of Greater Los Angeles. Her book, Jewish Girls, will be published next 
year by E.P. Dutton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With her weekly allowance, my 12-year-old daughter buys teen magazines. "Your 
prom! Your dress! Your thighs! All your problems solved!" the spring headlines 
shriek. "Look, Mom, this issue is perfect for me," Samantha says, though the 
prom is years away. Poring over the glossies, she stares up into her mirror. 
"My mouth is too small," she'll frown. Or, "Does my head dip in in the back?" 
</P>
<P>
 Has it all come back to this? Superficially, the lives of 12-year-old girls 
today appear to revolve, much as mine did a generation ago, around lipstick and 
nail polish, paper-thin 16-year-old movie stars (in my case Jimmy Darren, in 
hers "Seaquest" star Jonathan Brandis) and the thrills coming from hearing 
female singers wax on about love (for my era's "Going to the Chapel" my 
daughter substitutes rap group Salt-N-Pepa singing "OK, what's my weakness? 
Men. OK, then chill it, chill it" on MTV.) 
</P>
<P>
 But if it looks like only more of the same (with time out for softball and 
track), growing up today is a much riskier proposition. There are other signs 
-- in the obsession with weight loss, the idealization of the fashion-model 
subculture, the high rate of teen pregnancy and incidence of suicide -- that we 
are a long way from "The Brady Bunch."  
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, girls' lives now reflect the unfinished business of their 
parents, a generation born to believe that life had no limits but now learning 
that it does. We've bequeathed to them a cultural revolution, but largely let 
it go at that. Perhaps this is why parents feel guilty as evidence piles up as 
to how badly our young girls are doing. While others are free to debate whether 
feminism has gone too far in its obsession with sexual harassment and date 
rape, most mothers and fathers I know suspect that the problem with the 
movement is that it has not gone far enough in helping to pass on strong values 
to children in a world bereft of them. Moreover, adolescence, a time when ego 
and selfhood are notoriously weak, may in fact be more treacherous for our 
daughters born into post-feminist families where "leadership," "competence" and 
"assertiveness" are arbiters of female success. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-grade English teacher at my daughter's school, known as "a womanist" 
for pushing her girls into early political consciousness, speaks eloquently of 
our daughters' urgency. "It's worse now than when we were young," she told me. 
"In the '60s, we girls at least had hope. We sensed our mothers' frustrations 
and vowed to live the lives they wanted but never knew. But this generation of 
teens, the world says they have so many choices, but it still wants them just 
to be cute. Some of them give up even without trying." 
</P>
<P>
 She's speaking from what I've come to think of as Carol Gilligan territory. 
The Harvard psychologist's 1992 study of young girls, "Meeting at the 
Crossroads: Women's Psychology and Girls' Development," documented their 
painful slide from the heights of "Sure I can" into the valley of "I don't 
know." When Samantha was younger, I, like many women who benefited from the 
feminist revolution, felt confident that our daughters would fit into their 
world's new freedoms with confidence, needing little tailoring for their own 
needs. But now I'm witnessing firsthand my daughter's battle against the 
"psychological foot-binding" that Gilligan suggests few girls can avoid. Like 
many parents, I cry out: What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 But new ideas are at hand. Already, a movement is starting to guide parents 
through their daughters' trying years. Each day brings more books and studies 
examining "how American schools shortchange girls," and offering prescriptive 
advice on how "the mother-daughter revolution" might rectify the situation. 
(Fathers' contributions are still undervalued.) There are new classes on 
"parenting for professionals," providing guidelines so that children in 
two-career and single-parent families don't get shortchanged. And, crucially, 
there is Thursday, the second annual "Take Our Daughters to Work Day," 
sponsored by the Ms. Foundation for Women to help daughters see their mothers' 
and fathers' daily contributions to society.  
</P>
<P>
 This increased focus on our children's real lives, as opposed to our 
expectations and projections for them, is the unfinished business of the 
feminist movement. It couldn't come at a better time.

I KNEW KURT COBAIN'S SICKNESS; ONCE, I WAS KURT COBAIN; SUICIDE: MONEY AND

OF THE WELL.

<P>
 I understand what it is like to be an angry, depressed addict who needs so 
badly to be liked that he gets on stage and sweats and bleeds and hopes that 
people will somehow connect. 
</P>
<P>
 But as addicts whose only real happiness is being high -- whether it's on dope 
or music, writing, acting or painting -- success becomes our worst enemy. When 
self-hatred runs so deep, it is never alleviated by fame or wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the void that was there at the beginning grows even larger when 
applause only rings hollow to the ear, and fortune is as meaningless to an 
empty soul as is one coin dropped into a bottomless well. 
</P>
<P>
 So inevitably, the addict must destroy what he is convinced he doesn't deserve 
-- and he must do so before it is taken away from him. Self-destruction appears 
to the last measure of control the addict has over his own life -- and this is 
the most vicious lie of all. 
</P>
<P>
 I was one of the lucky ones. I managed to destroy my music, but none of my 
suicide attempts worked. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Keith Moon, Jim Morrison, 
John Belushi -- and now Kurt Cobain -- were, in the end, all addicts who 
couldn't get sober and whose luck ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not about being smarter, more talented, weak or strong. It's a disease 
that can't be cured, only arrested. Like a diabetic needs insulin, addicts need 
mental, physical and spiritual healing. The 12-step programs work, and there 
are hundreds of thousands of recovering addicts who are luckier than Kurt 
Cobain because they found that out in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, I celebrated nine years of sobriety. April 17 was the four-year 
anniversary of my liver transplant. The nightmare has ended for me. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry that Kurt Cobain could not live to see his nightmare end. In the 
brief time I knew him, I found him to be a kind and loving man. It was so hard 
to look into those eyes -- sad, hopeless. They were a mirror of my past and a 
window into his terrible pain. 
</P>
<P>
 I can only hope that the millions of his fans who loved him and his music will 
see that he was, finally, an addict who suffered too much to see what we all 
saw: someone worth loving, with a life worth living. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that his baby daughter -- and my grandson -- will know that truth all 
the days of their lives.

PERSPECTIVES ON RICHARD NIXON; A RECONCILIATION IN THE POLITICAL FAMILY; THE 
DEMOCRAT BURIED IN THE NIXON LANDSLIDE OF '72 PAYS HIS RESPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE McGOVERN, George McGovern, a former U.S. senator from South Dakota, 
was the Democrats' 1972 candidate for the presidency. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the public figures in America whom I have known over the past 40 years, 
none exceeded Richard Nixon in the capacity to come back from political defeat 
and personal setback. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Nixon's most painful and shattering experience must surely have been the 
Watergate tragedy that forced him to resign the presidency he had won against 
my candidacy in his landslide victory of 1972. I can think of few other 
politicians with the personal toughness and tenacity to have survived and 
triumphed over so dark a chapter. If one of the tests of greatness is the 
capacity to convert overwhelming loss into a more compassionate disposition and 
an enlarged vision, then Richard Nixon passed that test in the years since 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
 I lived for a time with a combination of disappointment, sadness and 
resentment toward Nixon and his associates in the wake of my defeat in 1972. 
But with the passage of time, those feelings faded and I made my peace with my 
old rival. 
</P>
<P>
 I telephoned him after Mrs. Nixon suffered a stroke shortly after his 
resignation from the White House. In the course of that conversation, I told 
him that his opening to China might be his greatest achievement. He agreed with 
that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 We exchanged letters and calls from time to time after that and he sent me 
inscribed copies of his books. 
</P>
<P>
 In early January, 1984, I went to see him in New York at his daughter Tricia's 
apartment for the purpose of suggesting that he and I issue a joint statement 
urging President Reagan to meet with his Soviet counterpart. There had been no 
summit conference involving Washington and Moscow during the first three years 
of the Reagan Administration. Nixon strongly agreed with me on the urgency of 
such a meeting, but after careful consideration he decided that a public 
statement of this kind might be resented at the White House. Only an hour 
before my arrival, he had received a call from the President congratulating him 
on his 71st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1991, by coincidence I was on a flight from Washington to New 
York with him, and we talked about the presidential possibilities for 1992. I 
mentioned that some of my friends were urging me to make another presidential 
bid, 20 years after my 1972 campaign, and asked for his advice. He replied: 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were you, I would ask myself two questions: One, do I have something 
important to say that is not likely to be advanced by other potential 
candidates? And, two, would anyone pay any attention to me? If you can answer 
'yes' to both of those questions, why not give it another try? You won't know 
whether or not you can win if you don't try." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the best advice I ever received about a possible presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 During all my years in public life, Richard Nixon has been one of the few 
enduring and significant national leaders. His career has been so intertwined 
with my own that I feel, despite our political differences, as though an old 
member of my political family has gone. I will miss him.

PERSPECTIVES ON RICHARD NIXON; IRONIES CROWD THE STATESMAN'S BIER; HE EMBODIED 
THE BEST AND WORST OF AMERICA'S ERA OF TRANSITION; WE WHO ELECTED HIM SHARE HIS 
HONOR AND HIS SHAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER MORRIS, Roger Morris' Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American 
Politician, won the National Book Award silver medal and other distinctions. 
His book about the Clinton presidency, Promises of Change, is due out later 
this year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this death of our most famous -- our most infamous -- recent President, 
almost everything about him is draped in irony. 
</P>
<P>
 We inter Richard Nixon as the familiar fixture of a political era and an 
enduring, haunting mystery of American leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 He was our ceaseless politician for more than half a century, what Lyndon 
Johnson called "a chronic campaigner," while a painfully shy human being for 
whom politics was compulsion and torment. To successive generations he seemed 
bold, commanding, ruthless, though his private passages were often spent in 
anxiety, doubt, vacillation. 
</P>
<P>
 We insisted on him as a rootless, generic figure, never a part of the 
landscape as Jefferson belonged to Tidewater, Johnson the Texas Hill Country, 
Clinton Arkansas. Yet Nixon was our most native President, quintessential son 
of small-town, middle-class America as it flourished in such caricature in the 
Southern California of the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke, as few other politicians had, for and to that nation in its 
transient moment of post-war ascendancy. He embodied its hope and intelligence, 
fear and ignorance, its persistence in any case. In the end, it recognized and 
denied him, rewarded and punished him, for the reassuring, disturbing 
reflection he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Discreet and somewhat hypocritical eulogies dwell on the cliche of Nixon 
statesmanship abroad, when his more historic impact was at home. It was he who 
revolutionized American politics and the electoral map by building the 
Republican Party in the South on the twin pillars of coded racism and corporate 
domination. It was he more tellingly than any other who led the red-baiting 
demagoguery that silenced generations of authentic political discourse in the 
country and intellectually emasculated the Democrats to this day. It was he who 
established the manipulative theater of the contemporary presidency, who 
brought to Washington, as no other chief executive before him, the fatal curse 
of big money. 
</P>
<P>
 While celebrating his diplomatic triumphs -- the opening to China, detente 
with the Soviets -- we politely pass over the rest. There was the senseless 
four years of prolonged slaughter in Vietnam, a plunging of Cambodia into war 
and genocide, human-rights tragedies from Biafra to Burundi to Bangladesh, CIA 
overthrow of elected regimes in favor of torturing generals, a lethal neglect 
of international trade and economics, all that and more. But, then, ritual 
memories of statesmanship are never made of spindly children or a sea of 
skulls.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, ironies crowd the burial like uninvited guests. 
</P>
<P>
 We remember him as a wooden, almost bloodless man. Yet he was the most human 
of public figures, given to drinking too much in the stress of the presidency, 
to sophomoric antics with his few close male friends, to both crude vulgarity 
and courtly evasiveness with those who worked for him. He lived a twisting 
56-year love affair with the woman he cloyingly courted, married and 
emotionally abandoned, then eventually found again in an irreplaceable bond at 
the close of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 He was toppled by Watergate, by his own ineffable abuses and the pursuit by 
partisan enemies, though also by hidden machinations in his own regime that 
even cynical Richard Nixon was loath to see. Our most anti-Establishment 
politician, he coveted and appropriated the old network and privilege, becoming 
before it was over an Establishment himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Not least, this politician who preferred such secrecy, who tried to conceal so 
much while hoarding a record of his every word, ended by leaving behind more of 
himself than any President in American history. Richard Nixon, our favorite 
enigma, will be pored over by historians amid thousands of hours of Oval Office 
tapes, millions of memoranda words -- a posterity of revelation and judgment 
all his planning could not have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the legacies of the Nixon era seem too raw for candor. He was too 
much our vessel. If he was capable, so were we. If he lacked character, so did 
our choice of him. If his inheritance is bitter, so is ours.  
</P>
<P>
 He returns to Yorba Linda, where myth and pain began. One thinks of the Quaker 
poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, in his verse lamenting Daniel Webster's fall 
from grace: 
</P>
<P>
 Revile him not, the Tempter hath  
</P>
<P>
 a snare for all;  
</P>
<P>
 And pitying tears, not scorn and wrath,  
</P>
<P>
 Befit his fall . . .  
</P>
<P>
 All else is gone; from those great eyes  
</P>
<P>
 The soul has fled;  
</P>
<P>
 When faith is lost, when honor dies,  
</P>
<P>
 The man is dead!  
</P>
<P>
 Then, pay the reverence of old days  
</P>
<P>
 To his dead fame;  
</P>
<P>
 Walk backward, with averted gaze,  
</P>
<P>
 And hide the shame!

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BILLY DEAN: CAPABLE BUT EMOTIONALLY FLAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where there's smoke, there's fire, they say. They seem to be finding ways 
around that at the Crazy Horse Steak House, though. There were scarcely any 
cigarette smokers lighting up for Billy Dean's early show Monday (and hurray 
for that) but you never would have known it from the stage fog being pumped 
into the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean's music ran a good sight more true than the canned atmosphere. But like 
many of his video-ready generation of country singers, his music doesn't 
approach the hard-earned character of its forebears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a greatest-hits album out already and I don't even have any gray 
hair," he remarked early in the show, and it is a mite curious. The guy only 
has three albums out, and already his label has deemed him worthy of a 
retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, the brown-haired, black-garbed 31-year-old Floridian is a capable 
performer who knows how to engage an audience without resorting to forced 
enthusiasm. His voice is pleasant, if not exceptionally emotional, and one 
didn't need the James Taylor covers in his set to draw comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-song set featured all but one of the tunes from Dean's hits collection, 
including "Only the Wind," "I Wanna Take Care of You," "I'm Not Built That 
Way," "Once in a While" (from the "Eight Seconds" soundtrack) and the sweet, 
sad ballad "Somewhere in My Broken Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean and his five-piece band were able to wrap a mood around that number and 
the 1993 hit "Tryin' to Hide a Fire in the Dark" (the latter particularly 
benefited from guitarist Don Mahar's David Lindley-like statements on a 
double-neck guitar/six-string bass rig). At such times, Dean sang with feeling, 
and if you didn't get a strong sense of personality from it, at least you could 
tell there was a person there. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't always the case. Take Dean's version of the 1977 Dave Mason hit 
"We Just Disagree." A tender, sad, blameless look at the way love can slip away 
despite a couple's best intentions, the song has been one of the saving graces 
of Crusty Dave's endless career. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean prefaced his version with a cute, predictable story about a girl who had 
dumped him back when the Mason version was a hit. He told her, " 'That's OK, 
but one of these days, darling, I'm going to be on that big stage, singing my 
big hits, making the big money and honey, you're going to be big time sorry. . 
. .' She hated this song. She was so glad when it went off the charts, and 
guess who brought it back?!" 
</P>
<P>
 The story sorta makes one think ol' Billy Dean hasn't actually paid much heed 
to the song's lyrics, and when he sang them Monday he only supported that 
impression, tossing the tune off with a minimum of emotional contact.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his band, which played with style and form throughout most of the 
set, went overboard with thick K mart Studio Orchestra synthesizer tones and 
extraneous guitar and bass solos. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the songs in the set weren't especially deserving of emotional input, 
having been built, in the modern Nashville way, around a predictable lyrical 
hook. The new "Money Don't Talk, It Swears" was one such tune, borrowing a 
single line from Bob Dylan's 1965 "It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" and 
beating it into the ground. Dean's forthcoming single, "Men'll Be Boys," wasn't 
exactly overflowing with fresh insight either, with its refrain: 
</P>
<P>
 The only difference between men and boys  
</P>
<P>
 Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys.  
</P>
<P>
 Dean closed the show accompanying himself on acoustic guitar during three 
numbers, his hit "If There Hadn't Been You" and surprisingly effective covers 
of relatively minor James Taylor and Jimmy Buffett tunes, "Shower the People" 
and "It's My Job."

THEATER REVIEWS; CAST 'MEASURES' UP, CONCEPT DOESN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Lewis, who co-founded the Actors Studio with Elia Kazan, says a 
director's concept of a classic drama must emerge from the text and illuminate 
it. Too many directors, he says, paste a concept on a play with no thought as 
to how appropriate it may be. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the problem with director Dudley Knight's "Measure for Measure," in 
repertory at UC Irvine with an impressive production of "Hamlet" (see 
accompanying review). 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Knight's is much of a concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, to begin with, is a cumbersome mix of comedy and drama concerning 
misuse of power, governmental fallibility, human frailty and the virtues of 
honesty and integrity. It is rarely performed, but with its mistaken identities 
and rapacious bawdiness, it can be entertaining in the right hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight, for the most part, has neglected the very script he is gilding. Those 
in the cast who succeed do so on their own hook as performers; the production 
itself is unshaped and unfocused. 
</P>
<P>
 John W. Gloria gives a fine, reserved performance as Lord Angelo, underscored 
with a subtle and very effective sense of bumbling evil. Hope Chernov's convent 
novice Isabella, who abandons her vocation to save her wrongfully doomed 
brother Claudio, is well-defined, nicely balanced between gentle innocence and 
righteous fire. Anne James Dreiling makes a riot of the bawd, Mistress 
Overdone, and ably keeps herself in check at the first hint of being overdone. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Humphreys is a stalwart and romantic Claudio, David Nevell is amusing and 
impressively constrained as Pompey and Jason Ades gets laughs with a properly 
bumbled Elbow. But Alexander Zubatov as the Duke, who vacations incognito to 
see how his rule is affecting the people, falls afoul of the friar the Duke 
pretends to be, with corny, cliched friar shtick and an accent that wanders 
from Ireland to Scotland to somewhere east of Java. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's concept includes projected photos as Pompey lists Mistress Overdone's 
ex-customers now in jail: Master Rash is Billy the Kid, Master Caper is Michael 
Jackson, etc. As Pompey is himself dragged off to prison, Knight has him 
jumping into the audience with a bucket, announcing: "At this time of year we 
like to take up a collection for . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 And some of the supporting cast -- including Colby French, whose performance 
as the executioner amounts to a bad Boris Karloff impression -- should follow 
Ralph Richardson's advice to young actors: "Look in the mirror and ask yourself 
if it's human." 
</P>
<P>
 The same technical people who make such a joy of "Hamlet" served this 
production but here nothing makes a match. Knight's staging is cumbersome on 
the unit set; the lighting, with huge shadows on the side walls, is 
distracting, and the period tops worn by the men over their modern pants look 
like Bea Arthur's caftans. 
</P>

O.C. THEATRE REVIEW; UCI 'HAMLET': INVENTIVE AND INTUITIVE; CHARLES HUSTON FITS 
THE ROLE PERFECTLY, AND STEPHEN M. BURDMAN'S SUPERIOR DIRECTION BRINGS FRESH 
INSIGHTS TO THE CLASSIC WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine has brought together the right director and the right actor for 
"Hamlet," the most difficult of the Bard's tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The production is director Stephen M. Burdman's thesis project for his 
master's degree, and a piece of work of which he justly can be proud. His 
staging is imaginative and highly focused. Flights of invention are visually 
stunning on Julie Allardice's simple but totally effective setting of 
platforms, stairs and a cleverly used broad apron. And Jason Kai Cooper's 
painterly lighting is like another dramatic character in Burdman's impeccable 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial restraints have dictated designer Felicia Pam Libbin's contemporary 
clothes, usually overlaid with period tops; their sturdy Nordic look is 
achieved by just the right juxtaposition of both. Every technical effect 
bolsters Burdman's concept. 
</P>
<P>
 He has approached the Danish tragedy as a socio-political lesson for all 
times, and it is probably his fresh insights and his brash courage, along with 
his sure sense of dramatic form, that make it work so well. In a recent 
interview, Burdman said he sees Hamlet as a 19- or 20-year-old, and he is 
blessed with a young, intuitive actor, Charles Huston, who could not be more 
right for the role, nor more able to delve into its intricacies, its bright 
lights and dark shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston's Prince of Denmark has a vision of what the throne of his country 
should be, and it doesn't include a murderous uncle and faithless mother. The 
actor also gives Hamlet a vitalizing sense of humor and a down-to-earth 
understanding of the frailty of fate.  
</P>
<P>
 He looks and feels as right in period jerkin over black jeans as he does later 
with suspenders slapping against his hips. The sea changes of his multihued 
characterization are accomplished with ease, and he makes magic of those 
stunning moments when the ghost of Hamlet's father speaks not to him, but 
through him, as he spins like a maelstrom in his sea of troubles.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a formidable performance, meshing imperceptibly with Burdman's insights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If David Francis' Claudius is not as rich as it could be, he has a solidity 
that works well. In any case, Anne James Dreiling's Queen Gertrude has enough 
depth and detail for them both, with delicacy and constraint, and often a sense 
of humor that shows where this Hamlet got his. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Denning's feisty Laertes, Harmony Goodman's statuesque but easily broken 
Ophelia, David Nevell's absent-minded-professor of a Polonius and Tom 
Humphreys' steady, stalwart Horatio all are well-hued threads in Burdman's vast 
tapestry. In a very effective conceit, Burdman brings all of those deceased 
back to the shadows at the rear of the stage to gaze unemotionally at the 
fallout from their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a delightfully eccentric Gravedigger (John W. Gloria) and a very 
funny Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Stephen Simon, Colby French) who are pure 
Tom Stoppard until they have to get serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamlet" is a role every serious young actor must play, and every serious 
director must attempt to fathom, if they want to grow. Burdman wisely has 
chosen a fairly complex and complete script (though the entire "Hamlet" is 
almost two hours longer) which gives both him and Huston the breadth and depth 
in which they can shine. And they do. 
</P>

TV RATINGS; BARNEY'S A BUST IN HIS PRIME-TIME DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the highest-rated TV movie Fox has ever broadcast, but everything's 
relative. "Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders" 
didn't even win its time period and wound up ranking 42nd among last week's 89 
prime-time network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was hardly the biggest loser to be found Tuesday in the figures from 
the A.C. Nielsen Co. In his prime-time debut, Barney was a bust. The purple 
dinosaur, an icon among preschoolers, attracted only 9% of the available 
audience with his special on NBC Sunday night and finished 87th overall. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' adult icon "60 Minutes," the primary competition at that hour, was No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC didn't fare much better with its two-part historical drama "World War II: 
When Lions Roared." The first installment on Tuesday ranked 52nd, with an 
audience of about 8.6 million homes, but only about 7 million of them returned 
for the conclusion Wednesday, which placed 69th overall. Southland Ratings

 Here are A. C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area

 Celebrity pavement: Intrepid host John Cunningham recently had a surprise 
guest star on "Driveways of the Rich and Famous," his periodic series on public 
access television. While Cunningham often wangles riveting interviews with the 
gardeners, maids and chauffeurs of the stars, he actually ran into none other 
than Madonna while filming.

 Depending on the city for a lift: After reading these "emergency phone 
procedures" inside an elevator at City Hall, Bob Hill of Burbank wonders how 
many mayoral administrations you might have to endure before being rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Pick up telephone receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 2. During normal working hours 6:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., dial 55617, or after 
hours, weekends and holidays, dial 53367. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Stay on the line until someone answers. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Tell person you are stuck in elevator No. 4, City Hall South. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Person will contact elevator mechanic, who will assist you. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Hang up telephone receiver.

 Mooning the authorities: Fine Line Features certainly didn't shy away from the 
fact that its release, "Bitter Moon," was directed by Roman Polanski, the 
well-known fugitive. Polanski, you may recall, fled to Europe after pleading 
guilty in 1977 to a charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor during a 
party at actor Jack Nicholson's house. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Bitter Moon" opened, Fine Line initially headlined its movie ads with 
this classy bon mot:  
</P>
<P>
 POLANSKI IS IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD!

 We'll pause until you stop laughing.

 It's true -- a courthouse with a slip-and-fall hazard: You'll have to take our 
word for it that we were absent for two weeks because we were on jury duty. We 
were never selected for a panel, though the experience didn't lack for 
excitement. Twice, the escalators in the Long Beach courthouse slammed to a 
halt while we were riding them. miscelLAny:

 Amtrak's Coast Starlight (L.A. to Seattle) run was recently designated a 
"nonsmoking train," though passengers are permitted to light up "on station 
platforms" at a few stops, including San Luis Obispo, Sacramento and Klamath 
Falls, Ore. (all of which will probably sue). Smokers are warned to "be 
prepared to re-board immediately when the notice of departure is given." 
Especially if the engineer doesn't like smokers.

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; NO GLITTER IN THIS 
COUPLE'S DETECTIVE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Forget all that hooey on late night television about the glamorous lives of 
husband-and-wife private eye teams. Martie and John C. Jensen Sr. are the real 
thing, and these gray-haired gumshoes don't carry guns, spin the wheels of 
flashy sports cars, or employ engaging, case-cracking house servants. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the real world, where the Jensens live in a trailer park, drive pickup 
trucks -- one with 143,000 miles on it -- and listen to country and Western 
music. They carry pictures of their grandchildren in their wallets. They go by 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't shot anybody this week," John Jensen said, joking over coffee 
recently at the Van Nuys courthouse. "We haven't broken into anybody's house 
and gone through their garbage. We have had guns pointed at us within the past 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Husband-and-wife private investigators, while fodder for Hollywood, actually 
are a rarity. The Jensens say that as far as they know, they are the only 
licensed husband-and-wife team currently working in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Martie, 57, and John, 53, fell for each other while investigating a fatal 
crash involving an 18-wheeler on the Grapevine for an insurance company. They 
married in 1979 and started their own firm, Jensen & Jensen Professional 
Investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Her photographic memory complements his by-the-numbers style perfectly, they 
say. The Jensens present a united and non-threatening front with their clear 
blue eyes and kindly faces that invite people to spill secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the Jensens specialize in death penalty cases, working under 
contract for the offices of the Alternate Defense Counsel, the court-appointed 
lawyers who handle cases when the public defender's office has a conflict of 
interest because it already represents a co-defendant or witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many of the lawyers she works for, Martie Jensen approves of the death 
penalty. She just thinks the authorities should prove their case first. 
</P>
<P>
 She's made it difficult for them at times. 
</P>
<P>
 A death penalty case is complicated, she says. It arrives in cartons, rather 
than in the binders known as "murder books." The Jensens retrace the police 
detectives' steps, re-interviewing witnesses, looking for holes in their 
stories. They ask the questions that weren't asked by police, and follow up 
leads their clients give them, playing the role of debunker. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen & Jensen has handled about 70 capital cases, and none of their clients 
have been executed. "Right now, we haven't even got anybody on Death Row," John 
Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is impressive considering the stacked deck capital murder cases often 
present.  
</P>
<P>
 But in several capital cases Jensen & Jensen has handled, the client has 
actually walked. Their work has contributed to five acquittals and three 
dismissals. The client list includes some notorious defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Harvey Rader, an Englishman and Reseda car dealer who'd been accused 
in 1988, after a six-year investigation, of killing four members of a 
Northridge family, whose bodies were never found. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's free now. I talked to him the other day," Martie Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Dr. Richard Boggs, a Glendale neurosurgeon convicted of 
conspiring with two friends to murder a stranger and collect a $1.5-million 
insurance policy after claiming the dead man was one of the friends, a partner 
in Just Sweats, an Ohio clothing company. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the Jensens worked on the defense of Father David Dean Piroli, 
the Simi Valley priest accused of stealing more than $50,000 from parish 
collection plates. He contended another priest did it, and the jury acquitted 
him on one count and was hung in favor of acquittal on another. Ventura County 
prosecutors decided earlier this month not to retry him. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Martie Jensen is defending Mary Ellen Samuels, 45, facing the death 
penalty on charges of two counts of murder for financial gain. She is accused 
of hiring a hit man to kill her husband, collecting $500,000 worth of 
insurance, then hiring others to kill the original hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like her," is all Martie Jensen will say about Samuels.

FACE UP TO HAITI'S RULING THUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News reports have confirmed that at least 23 people, and possibly more, were 
killed last weekend in a Haitian military attack on Gonaives, a center of 
political support for exiled civilian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The 
bloody incident occurred during a military sweep aimed at rousting partisans of 
Aristide from the seaside city, about 100 miles from Haiti's capital, 
Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the number of dead is surely appalling to the average American, it 
will come as no surprise to human-rights specialists who have closely monitored 
the situation in Haiti since September, 1991, when Aristide was ousted in a 
military coup. Several human-rights groups reported last week that about 3,000 
Haitians have been killed in political violence since then, 150 of them since 
the start of this year alone. There has also been a surge in disappearances of 
political activists and in the number of rapes blamed on Haitian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The long Haitian crisis became a political embarrassment for President Clinton 
when he was forced to take back his campaign criticism of former President 
Bush, who had ordered the U.S. Coast Guard to return Haitian refugees 
intercepted at sea to their homeland. Once in the White House, Clinton opted to 
maintain that very policy lest he encourage a flood of Haitian refugees to this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 His embarrassment grew worse last year when the Haitian junta reneged on an 
agreement brokered by the United Nations that would have allowed Aristide to 
return home last October. That was followed by a humiliating retreat when a 
small but noisy Haitian mob kept a boatload of unarmed U.S. military trainers 
from landing to help enforce the U.N. agreement. Now comes the Gonaives 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 This political and diplomatic embarrassment has become a human tragedy. It is 
time for the U.S. government to take off the kid gloves with which it has been 
dealing with Haiti's military thugs and impose the toughest economic sanctions 
possible on the Haitian regime, including a total blockade on oil. That must 
include pressure on the neighboring Dominican Republic, from which black-market 
oil is still being smuggled into Haiti. To claim that tougher sanctions will 
hurt only Haiti's poor is disingenuous. They are already suffering far more 
than U.S. sanctions can hurt them.

DODGERS RUN WILD, STILL WIN; BASEBALL: DESPITE STRANGE PLAYS, THEY RALLY TO 
DEFEAT PHILLIES, 4-3. WORRELL GETS THE SAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They kept their manager squirming on the bench, and even made three outs at 
the plate in one inning, something Tom Lasorda said he had "not hardly" seen 
before.  
</P>
<P>
 But in a wild seventh inning, the Dodgers still managed to score the decisive 
runs in a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Tuesday night at Dodger 
Stadium before 28,194. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are all doing their job and when they make mistakes, they make up 
for them with desire and effort," Lasorda said. "I like their attitude and the 
way they help each other and battle back." 
</P>
<P>
 Down 2-0, the Dodgers tied the score in the sixth when Eric Karros singled in 
Tim Wallach and scored on a single by Jeff Treadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the seventh, an inning in which all three Dodger outs were made at 
the plate. The Dodgers scored twice to move ahead, 4-2, but the wildest moment 
came at the end, when the Phillies made a 9-2-3-5-2 play to abruptly stop a 
rally and send scorers into puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't too happy, " Lasorda said. "Poor Henry (Rodriguez), to see a guy 
slip, I thought he hurt himself." 
</P>
<P>
 With the bases loaded and one out, Jose Offerman scored on a single by 
Rodriguez. Eric Karros then grounded back to reliever Heathcliff Slocumb to 
force Mike Piazza at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it got tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi hit a line drive to right field, which scored Tim Wallach. But 
Rodriguez, also trying to score, fell rounding third base. Right fielder Wes 
Chamberlain threw to catcher Darren Daulton, and Rodriguez, scrambling to his 
feet, went back to third. But Karros and Mondesi were running full bore, and 
when they saw Rodriguez stumble, they went into retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing I could do but stop," said Karros, who was two for four. "I 
saw (third base coach Joey) Amalfitano waving Henry in, so I just put my head 
down and kept running. But we were up 4-2, so it wasn't like we didn't score 
any runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Daulton threw to John Kruk to try to get Mondesi, or somebody, and Kruk threw 
to third baseman Dave Hollins, who realized by then that Rodriguez was headed 
for home, so Hollins made the throw to the plate for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have lost, it would have been tough," said Wallach, who scored 
two runs.  
</P>
<P>
 For the Dodgers, whose last seven losses have been by two runs or less, a 
two-run lead in the eighth inning doesn't provide a very secure feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Phillies came back to score a run in the eighth, Lasorda put the 
ball in Todd Worrell's hands. Worrell retired the side in order to earn his 
second save. Gary Wayne (1-2), who relieved starter Kevin Gross to start the 
seventh inning, earned the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Phillies had opportunities to score and we did too, but when they had the 
bases loaded in the sixth inning and Kevin got out of it, that was the key," 
Wallach said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who has made four starts and still doesn't have a decision, held the 
Phillies to two runs, but it could have been much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In a wild sixth inning, Gross loaded the bases when he walked Darren Daulton, 
took off Milt Thompson's helmet with a pitch high and inside and saw Treadway 
boot Kevin Stocker's routine grounder. But Gross pitched out of that jam, 
coming back to strike out Ricky Jordan, who was pinch-hitting for Greene, and 
popping up Lenny Dykstra. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made it exciting," Gross said. "I threw too many pitches, but we battled 
and I kept it close and we won. I would love to have as many wins as I can, but 
we win as a team and that is the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Philly starter Tommy Greene, the Dodgers stranded six baserunners in 
the first five innings and in four of those innings, they had runners in 
scoring position. Each team stranded 10 baserunners.  
</P>
<P>
 Greene made his first start since April 7 and held the Dodgers to three hits 
through five innings. Greene, who had been sidelined with shoulder tendinitis, 
gave up four walks, two in the third inning, but the Dodgers didn't take 
advantage.  
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we would get them eventually," Karros said.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; EASTWOOD'S GOAL LIFTS MAPLE LEAFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Eastwood, playing because of an injury to Doug Gilmour, made the most of 
an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastwood scored the game's only goal with 13 seconds left in a third-period 
power play, giving the Toronto Maple Leafs a 1-0 victory over the Chicago 
Blackhawks at Toronto and a 3-2 lead in their Western Conference quarterfinal 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous relief," Eastwood said of his first playoff goal, scored at 
10:07 of the third period. "I was just happy to be in the right place at the 
right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto's opportunity came when Gary Suter was penalized for hooking at 8:20. 
Dave Andreychuk passed out of the corner to Eastwood, who put it over Ed 
Belfour's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wendel (Clark) made a great play behind the net to get the puck over to Dave 
and I just got a piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 2, Calgary 1 -- Geoff Courtnall's goal 7:15 into overtime at Calgary 
kept the Canucks alive in the playoffs, cutting their deficit to 3-2 in a 
Western Conference quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary could have closed out the series by winning on its home ice, but 
instead Vancouver won the right to play host to Game 6 on Thursday night at 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The game turned on a defensive mistake. Calgary's Kevin Dahl was unable to 
control a bouncing puck near center ice and Courtnall took over. He broke in 
alone and scored on a 35-foot slap shot. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 6, Detroit 4 -- Sergei Makarov scored twice and Igor Larionov had 
three assists at San Jose to help the eighth-seeded Sharks take a 3-2 lead in 
the Western Conference quarterfinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 Makarov scored the Sharks' first goal on a power play 2:47 into the game. 
After another first-period goal by Todd Elik, Detroit rallied to tie the score 
on goals by Paul Coffey and Ray Sheppard. 
</P>
<P>
 Makarov scored his second goal with only 75 seconds to play in the second 
period, putting the Sharks ahead to stay. San Jose was outshot, 35-21, but 
Arturs Irbe stopped 31 shots.

MORNING BRIEFING: YOUR VITAL SIGNS COULD DEPEND ON REMEMBERING THIS STATISTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Kiszla of the Denver Post proposes that the NFL abolish the draft and 
cites some benefits:  
</P>
<P>
 "Draftniks could enter therapy and learn the difference between a vital 
statistic and meaningless trivia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birth date of your spouse is vital. The 40-yard dash time of a cornerback 
from Texas A & M Kingsville is not." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "(Mel) Kiper could be returned to his proper place. He again would be a 
sports geek talking back to the TV rather than a sports geek talking on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the first Angel pitcher to win 20 games? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dirt man: Dennis Rodman of the San Antonio Spurs does the dirty work in the 
NBA, digging out rebounds. He is also literally into dirt, as the owner of an 
excavation company in Frisco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't know dirt, but he asks the right questions," said Rod Bilhauer, 
who runs the 75-employee company for Rodman. "Sometimes, I think he would 
rather do dirt than basketball." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Duck talk: Cincinnati's Kevin Mitchell recently sat out a game against the 
Montreal Expos' Kirk Rueter, prompting a question on whether he was trying to 
duck left-handed pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mitchell: "I don't duck left-handers. I don't duck right-handers. I don't 
even duck gunshots." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Air Anderson: Greg (Cadillac) Anderson of the Detroit Pistons missed five of 
six free throws in a recent game against Milwaukee, prompting teammate Sean 
Elliott to tell him:  
</P>
<P>
 "If you were still in college, they would have nabbed you for point shaving." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer spirit: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe has a love affair with 
Fenway Park, ancient home of the Red Sox:  
</P>
<P>
 "Go ahead, America, laugh at us. Sit in your climate-controlled Skydomes with 
Hard Rock Cafes in right field. We'll walk up the sticky, smelly ramps that our 
fathers and our grandfathers climbed all those years." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ho-hum: Bernie Lincicome of the Chicago Tribune, commenting on major league 
baseball players wearing patches commemorating the 125th anniversary of the 
professional game: "This is also the 125th anniversary of the periodic table of 
the elements, but I do not see chemists wearing patches on their smocks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just kidding: Now the NBA says the Calvin Murphy-Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf free-throw 
flap was nothing more than a joke. This after saying it was concerned Murphy 
interfered before Abdul-Rauf shot two free throws that could have broken 
Murphy's single-season percentage record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was laughing about it," said Rod Thorn, NBA vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Abdul-Rauf, who missed the second of two free throws and failed to break 
Murphy's record. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For the record: Bill Munson was the last quarterback drafted by the Rams in 
the first round, in 1964, not Terry Baker as reported.

 Trivia answer: Dean Chance, with a 20-9 record in 1964.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ROCKIES CAN'T SOLVE TEWKSBURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury cooled off the National League's highest-scoring team, striking 
out a career-high 10 and becoming the first five-game winner in the majors as 
the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Colorado Rockies, 2-1, Tuesday night at 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (5-0) gave up five hits, including a home run by Andres Galarraga in 
the fourth inning, and walked none in his second consecutive complete game. He 
has won nine of 11 starts dating to last Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 He also made an acrobatic play to end the eighth, knocking down Howard 
Johnson's line drive, rolling to get the ball and then tossing it to first 
while on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies entered the night averaging 6.3 runs per game. Galarraga's home 
run was their league-leading 30th and ninth in four games, but no other Rocky 
got past second base. In one nine-batter stretch ending in the seventh, 
Tewksbury had four strikeouts and five infield outs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he's pitching, you can put the radar gun up and just unplug the 
batteries," Colorado Manager Don Baylor said. "Speed is going to mean nothing. 
You start looking for the breaking ball and he comes in with a fastball and it 
looks like he's throwing 95 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga leads the league with 28 runs batted in, one short of the major 
league record for April held by four players -- Dave Winfield in 1988, Dale 
Murphy in 1985, Ron Cey in 1977 and Joe Carter of the Toronto Blue Jays this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 6, New York 3 -- Ricky Gutierrez's two-run double erased a 3-2 
deficit in the sixth inning and lifted the Padres at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Met Wally Whitehurst (2-3) matched a career high with nine strikeouts 
and walked three. Mark Davis faced two batters and Scott Sanders pitched 1 2/3 
innings for his first career save. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 7, San Francisco 3 -- Shortstop Royce Clayton's two-run throwing 
error and Cliff Floyd's sacrifice fly in the fifth inning helped the Expos 
rally at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Swift (3-2) had a 3-1 lead entering the fifth after retiring 12 
consecutive batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrin Fletcher walked, and Sean Berry and Wil Cordero singled to load the 
bases. Expo pitcher Jeff Fassero (2-1) hit a bouncer to Clayton, whose throw to 
catcher Kirt Manwaring sailed to the backstop as two runs scored. Floyd's 
sacrifice fly gave Montreal a 4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 8, Chicago 2 -- Tim Pugh pitched a five-hitter and Thomas Howard 
and Tony Fernandez each drove in three runs for the Reds at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds improved their record to 13-5 with their seventh victory in eight 
games. The Cubs have lost nine of 11 to fall to 5-13, worst in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 7, Houston 4 -- Doubles by Brian Hunter and Carlos Garcia capped a 
four-run rally in the eighth inning that lifted the Pirates at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff King led off the eighth with a single against Todd Jones (0-2) and took 
third on Orlando Merced's single. After a walk to Don Slaught loaded the bases, 
King scored on Al Martin's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 After Merced was thrown out at home on a grounder, Mitch Williams relieved. 
Slaught then scored on Scott Servais' second passed ball of the inning before 
pinch-hitter Hunter and Garcia hit run-scoring doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 9, Florida 6 -- Rookie Mike Kelly collected his first major league 
RBIs with a two-out, three-run double to break an eighth-inning tie at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who entered the game in the seventh as a pinch-runner, pulled a 3-2 
pitch from Yorkis Perez down the third base line with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookies Javier Lopez and Ryan Klesko homered for the Braves, who overcame a 
5-1 deficit.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS SAYS HE STILL HAS HEADACHES

<P>
 Delino DeShields, who suffered a concussion Saturday night when he collided 
with Raul Mondesi against the Montreal Expos, is improved but still suffering 
from intense headaches and might not travel with the team on Thursday when they 
leave for New York. Plane flights can aggravate head conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My head is killing me," DeShields said Tuesday from his home. "It's like a 
migraine and it makes me a little nauseated. I saw the doctor today, and I will 
see him again tomorrow. But if the headache keeps up, I won't get to go." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields said he still doesn't remember anything about the collision, which 
knocked him unconscious for a few minutes. He was examined Tuesday by 
neurologist Ronald Andiman and team physician Michael Mellman, who see him 
again today.

 Darryl Strawberry, who entered a drug treatment center April 7, is doing well, 
according to his attorney, Bob Shapiro.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is doing very, very well in his rehabilitation," Shapiro said. "He is 
currently in the process of going through family therapy in order to educate 
those close to him about his problems, and for the continued course of 
outpatient treatment when he is released." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said he does not know when 
Strawberry will be released. Treatment programs normally run 21 or 28 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have called Darryl, but the calls do not go through, that is the nature of 
the program he is undergoing," Claire said. "I would like to hear how he's 
doing and we have talked to baseball's players' relations committee to try to 
find out, and we should be hearing something shortly.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's closing in on three weeks, but I don't know how long it will be until 
somebody tells me." 
</P>

 It was not Roger McDowell who had the life-size cutout of Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda made, as was reported the other day. This time, the prank was 
orchestrated by Brett Butler, who initiated the project during the team's first 
home stand. Lasorda, who at times is late for the national anthem, was 
surprised Friday night to take his position in line and find a cardboard cutout 
of himself in line with the other players. The cost of the prank? $500. MARYANN

PADRES ARRESTED FOR PROPOSITIONS; BASEBALL: SCOTT SANDERS AND DEREK BELL 
CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR OF PATRONIZING A PROSTITUTE IN NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two San Diego Padre players were arrested Tuesday for allegedly propositioning 
undercover policewomen on a Manhattan street corner often frequented by 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Scott Sanders and outfielder Derek Bell were arrested around 2 a.m. 
EDT on a misdemeanor charge of patronizing a prostitute.The arrests came 18 
hours before they were due at Shea Stadium to play the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders and Bell, who was wearing the World Series championship ring he won 
with the Toronto Blue Jays, appeared "shocked and bewildered," Capt. Michael 
O'Neill of the Public Morals Unit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they were baseball players and I told them they were under 
arrest," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men pleaded innocent Tuesday evening to soliciting a prostitute. They 
turned down a deal in which they would have had to plead guilty to a reduced 
charge of disorderly conduct, do one day of community service, spend a day in a 
health seminar and pay $45 in fees and fines. 
</P>
<P>
 They were released on their own recognizance and are due back in court June 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were expected in uniform at Tuesday night's game, said Padre 
spokesman Jim Ferguson. Sanders had been listed as the probable starting 
pitcher, but the team had decided before the arrest to start Wally Whitehurst 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ballclub is investigating the situation to see what all is involved," 
Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Padre Manager Jim Riggleman said he learned about the arrests when he was 
called in the middle of the night by O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough way to learn a lesson," Riggleman said. "Sanders was going to 
pitch in the ball game. If nothing else he should have used better judgment."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; EDMONDS IS GIVEN SCARE OF HIS LIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Outfielder Jim Edmonds was never so scared in his life, lying motionless in 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He was running to first base in the second inning when an errant throw by 
Yankee shortstop Mike Gallego hit him in the neck, just below the left ear. He 
never lost consciousness, but he couldn't move. He could not feel his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my legs going numb," Edmonds said. "That's when I knew I was in 
trouble. I was hoping I could walk away, but it was like all of the life had 
gone out of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they took me away in the ambulance, that was the worst ride of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds left the field on a stretcher, his neck in a brace, and was taken to 
Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Doctors there told him the injury was a deep 
bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember too much after I got hit," Edmonds said. "But I'm OK. I'm a 
little groggy right now, but I'll be ready to go (Wednesday)."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Bob Melvin turned down the Angels' offer to be their triple-A catcher 
at Vancouver and instead signed with the Yankees. The Angels, who will be 
without catcher Greg Myers, who had arthroscopic knee surgery and will be 
sidelined until June, want a veteran catcher in reserve at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 They now will explore the possibility of signing Greg Olson, 33, or Geno 
Petralli, 34. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Ken Patterson, who has a partially torn ligament in his left elbow, 
will be put on the disabled list today and John Farrell probably will replace 
him in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell, still with Vancouver, said he was told by club officials to prepare 
himself for a call-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also are expected to recall starting pitcher Joe Magrane after 
Saturday, when he is scheduled to work again. Magrane, on a rehabilitation 
assignment, yielded nine hits and two runs in seven innings Monday in 
Vancouver's 5-3 victory over Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Angels believed it would be virtually impossible for designated 
hitter Chili Davis to duplicate last year's season, he is doing even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is batting .377 with 19 runs and 17 RBIs. He already has reached base 45 
times; he reached base only 57 times during all of April and May last season.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TORONTO'S CARTER TIES MARK WITH 29TH RBI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Carter tied a major league record with his 29th run batted in during 
April, helping Todd Stottlemyre and the Toronto Blue Jays to an 8-6 victory 
over the Kansas City Royals on Tuesday night at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter is the fourth player to drive in 29 runs in April, joining Ron Cey 
(1977), Dale Murphy (1985) and Dave Winfield (1988). Carter is on a 13-game 
hitting streak and has eight homers this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if he drives in another run this month, Carter might not own the 
record. Andres Galarraga of the Colorado Rockies has 28 RBIs this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Devon White went four for four with a triple, was hit by a pitch and scored 
three times. He leads the league with 25 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stottlemyre (3-0), who began the season in the bullpen because of an injury to 
Duane Ward, won in his first start of the season. He gave up four runs on seven 
hits in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had an RBI double in the Blue Jays' four-run first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Milwaukee 0 -- Alex Fernandez pitched his second shutout of the 
season at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez (2-3), who had lost his previous two starts, gave up six singles. He 
struck out two and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 11, Minnesota 3 -- Rookie Manny Ramirez hit a three-run homer and 
Albert Belle doubled twice at Cleveland as the Indians ended a four-game home 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Maldonado also homered for the Indians. Kenny Lofton tripled, doubled, 
drove in two runs and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Clark (2-0) gave up three runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings and Jose 
Mesa pitched 2 1/3 innings for his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 10, Oakland 4 -- Brady Anderson had two home runs and two doubles at 
Baltimore to help the Orioles send the Athletics to their eighth consecutive 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who never before had four extra-base hits in a game, tied a club 
record by scoring four runs. Rafael Palmeiro and Chris Hoiles also homered in 
the Orioles' seventh victory in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Rhodes (1-3) pitched a three-hitter for the Orioles' first complete 
game of the season. He walked four, struck out eight and retired the final 16 
batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 6, Detroit 1 -- High winds blew winning pitcher Rick Helling (2-0) off 
the mound, forced fans to be moved from the upper deck and caused a 45-minute 
delay at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind gusts estimated at 45-50 m.p.h. uprooted several trees in the parking lot 
and blew down a street light. A popup by Jose Canseco fell near the feet of 
Tiger first baseman Cecil Fielder for a single, and the field was left 
littered. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a tornado hit the north Texas town of Gainesville. On 
Monday, a tornado touched down in Lancaster, south of Dallas, killing four. 
</P>
<P>
 Play was stopped in the bottom of the sixth when the winds caused dirt and 
debris to blow up in the faces of the players and spectators. Light rain also 
was falling when crew chief Rich Garcia halted the game with the Rangers ahead, 
3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 4, Boston 3 -- Pitcher Greg Harris threw past home plate on Torey 
Lovullo's grounder with the bases loaded in the 10th inning at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners loaded the bases with one out as Rich Amaral led off with a 
double for his third hit and Ken Griffey Jr. was intentionally walked. After 
Jay Buhner sacrificed, Reggie Jefferson was intentionally walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo grounded back to the mound, but Harris (1-2) threw the ball past 
catcher Dave Valle.

FISHING REPORT: BIGGER BLUEGILL GETTING ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I really think the bluegill bite is a front-page story," said Jim Brown, a 
spokesman for San Diego City lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case it's a short Page 6 story, but for panfish fishermen it's quite a 
story nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida-strain bluegill -- larger than the northern-strain fish prevalent 
at most other lakes -- are on a suicide mission at three of the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers in the last week: Otay Lake, 4,075 bluegill -- in only three days 
of fishing -- San Vicente, 3,260 bluegills and Sutherland, 4,981.

 "But the real thing that causes people to get breathless is these bluegill, 
like the Florida bass, are getting so big," Brown said. "A lot of them are 
two-pounders."

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: CLOUDY FUTURE DESPITE NCAA GYMNASTIC 
TITLES 
</P>

 With mixed emotions, two UCLA gymnasts received their awards for winning 
individual events at the NCAA meet Sunday at Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McCain won the vault with a score of 9.675 and placed second on the 
parallel bars with a score of 9.40. Jim Foody won the high bar with a score of 
9.45. 
</P>
<P>
 The titles don't take away the pain of knowing the program probably will be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA announced last August it was dropping men's swimming and men's and 
women's gymnastics after the 1993-94 academic year, but reinstated women's 
gymnastics two weeks later when threatened with a gender-equity lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the men's swimming and men's gymnastics teams were awarded a 
temporary restraining order on April 18, barring the school from cutting the 
programs. But the order also required lawyers representing the parties to 
return to Superior Court in Los Angeles on May 16 for further argument. 
</P>
<P>
 If the men's gymnastics program is eliminated, McCain and Foody will be the 
last of a long list of NCAA champions from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 McCain and Foody, sophomore roommates, are undecided about what they will do 
if the program is dropped. Both would like to continue training at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want to leave, but if the school. . . takes away our gym and 
we have no coach and no place to work out, I'll have to leave," Foody said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear what status the men's gymnastics team would have next year if it 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be offers for Foody and McCain, who also won the high bar title last 
year, should they decide to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, NCAA men's gymnastics is in danger of being eliminated altogether 
because of dwindling participation, so it is uncertain that they would be any 
better off at another school. 
</P>
<P>
 A fine fix for a couple of NCAA champions.

 Long after most fans had left the Ojai Valley tennis tournament Sunday, USC 
and UCLA played well into the evening for the Pacific 10 Conference men's 
doubles championship. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Wayne Black and Jonathon Leach defeated Robert Janecek and Sebastien 
LeBlanc, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5, giving the Trojans the doubles title and a share of the 
Thacher Cup, emblematic of the Pac-10 title, with Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the key was, even though they were behind all the time, just staying 
in the match," said USC Coach Dick Leach.  
</P>
<P>
 USC battled back from two match points and a 5-3 deficit in the third set to 
win the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, who played despite being ill during the early rounds, also won the 
Pac-10 men's singles title. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The sixth-ranked UCLA softball team will play host to top-ranked Arizona in a 
Pac-10 doubleheader Saturday at 1 p.m. at Easton Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (32-8, 13-3 in the Pac-10) are led by DeeDee Weiman, a senior who 
led the nation averaging 12.22 strikeouts through April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiman is 16-4 with an earned-run average of 1.09 in 135 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensively, UCLA is led by Jennifer Brundage, a junior who is hitting a 
Pac-10 leading .465. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (48-2, 16-0 in Pac-10 play) is led by Laura Espinoza, a junior from 
Wilmington Banning High. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza has broken numerous NCAA Division I records this season. She has hit 
25 home runs, breaking the record of 19 set by Marcelina Smith of Florida A&M 
last year, and has 84 runs batted in, breaking the previous record of 70 set by 
Danielle Yearick of Manhattan College. 
</P>
<P>
 In her three-year career, Espinoza has 43 homers, breaking the NCAA record of 
34 set by Liz Mizera of Texas A & M from 1985-88, and has 176 RBIs, breaking 
the record of 150 set by Gina LoPiccolo of Fresno State from 1988-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona defeated UCLA, 11-2, and, 7-1, at Tucson on April 2. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Danielle Scott, a three-sport athlete at Cal State Long Beach, is the 49ers' 
top competitor in every sport she plays. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- She was named the Big West player of the year for the second consecutive 
year and also was named the NCAA's most valuable player after leading the 
volleyball team to the NCAA title. She won the Honda Award for volleyball on 
April 8, making her a finalist for the prestigious Honda-Broderick Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Six days after the volleyball season ended, Scott joined the basketball 
team. She led the Big West in rebounding, averaging 10.4 rebounds a game, and 
was the first Big West athlete to receive first-team all-conference honors in 
two sports in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four days after the basketball season ended, Scott joined the track team. 
In her debut April 2, a four-way meet at UC Irvine, she won the long jump with 
a leap of 17 feet 3 3/4 inches, making her the school's top long jumper this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott placed second in three events at the Irvine Invitational on Saturday. 
Her long jump of 18-9 3/4 ranks second in the Big West this season behind Tracy 
Dulmage of Utah State (19-5). Scott ranks ninth on Long Beach's all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 She also placed second in the high jump at 5-2, and second in the triple jump 
at 35-11 1/4. It was her first competition in the triple jump and her mark 
ranks fourth in the conference this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott has completed her eligibility in volleyball but has a season left in 
basketball and track. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach will compete in the California-Nevada Collegiate championships on 
Saturday and Sunday at UCLA's Drake Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Bassett, former UCLA men's tennis coach, will have his allegiances 
divided Sunday when UCLA plays host to Pepperdine at 1:30 p.m. In 27 years as 
Bruin coach, Bassett led UCLA to seven NCAA team championships before retiring 
after last season. He is working as a volunteer assistant for Pepperdine Coach 
Allen Fox.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; THE WICKED NORTH IS AMONG TOP HORSES GRACING MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The morning after The Wicked North won the Oaklawn Handicap at Arkansas, Cot 
Campbell, the owner of Wallenda, the eighth-place finisher, was scouting horses 
for sale at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wicked North's not nominated for the Pimlico Special," somebody said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best news I've heard all day," Campbell said. "Because that's 
where Wallenda's headed." 
</P>
<P>
 It is good news, too, for Hollywood Park officials that The Wicked North is 
back in California, where his trainer, David Bernstein, is looking at the 
$300,000 Californian and the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup as probable starts for 
the 5-year-old this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Top horses help make the meet, and Hollywood Park is counting on these 
standouts during the 68-day season that opens today: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Wicked North. The disqualified winner of the Santa Anita Handicap is 
the best older horse on dirt in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bien Bien. Winner of three of four grass starts at the Santa Anita meet, 
including Sunday's San Juan Capistrano Handicap, the 5-year-old chestnut might 
run on turf and dirt at Hollywood. The $500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap is 
next, and the Gold Cup on July 2 is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paseana. The two-time Eclipse Award winner has won stakes at Hollywood in 
each of the last three years, and with $2.8 million in winnings is edging up to 
Dance Smartly, the retired female record-holder with $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flawlessly. A champion grass mare for two consecutive years, the 6-year-old 
daughter of Affirmed has used the summer meet as a warmup for fall, when she 
has won Hollywood's Matriarch three consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arcangues. Is the Breeders' Cup Classic winner, at 133-1, a one-race fluke 
or a horse to be reckoned with? The answer, under Arcangue's new trainer, 
Richard Mandella, begins unfolding Sunday in the $150,000 John Henry Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 A horse that won't be at Hollywood, at least temporarily, is Mamselle Babette. 
John Forsythe's 4-year-old filly, winner of four stakes at Santa Anita, was 
highweighted at 122 pounds for Friday night's $100,000 A Gleam Handicap, but 
will skip that to run in the Sixty Sails at Sportsman's Park in Chicago a week 
from Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, who rode Mamselle Babette in her last victory, is expected to 
reach the 6,000-victory mark early in the season. Of the 10 other jockeys who 
reached 6,000, only two -- Bill Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay -- did it before 
their 40th birthdays. McCarron won't be 40 until next March. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron is scheduled to ride Golden Klair, the 117-pound co-highweight, in 
the A Gleam, which is the first of 35 stakes on the schedule. Cargo will also 
carry 117 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet ends on July 25. The track will be open Wednesday through Sunday, 
with Monday cards scheduled for May 30, July 4 and July 25. The 13 Friday cards 
will be run at night, with first post at 7. First post for most daytime cards 
is 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of quinellas, Hollywood Park will offer the EZQ, a new $2 minimum bet. 
There willbe three payoffs, for the horses that finish first and second, first 
and third or secondand third, in either order. The EZQ will be available for 
all races. 
</P>
<P>
 R.D. Hubbard, the chairman of Hollywood Park, had hoped to open the track's 
card club by now, but there has been a delay in getting state approval for the 
group that will lease the club. 
</P>
<P>
 An application from a group that includes former football figures Don 
Klosterman and Eddie LeBaron is under consideration by the state attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard has been in the forefront among those track executives who want to 
combine racingwith other gambling, a philosophy that has more recently been 
embraced by Dick Duchossois of Arlington International in suburban Chicago and 
Charles Cella of Oaklawn Park in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchossois is trying to get a riverboat gambling license for Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tracks must do this in order to survive," Duchossois said during a visit to 
California last week. "I once said that many tracks will go out of business by 
the year 2000 if they don't get into other gambling businesses that have 
surrounded them. I've now changed that estimate to the year 1995." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Blues Traveller heads a field of seven in today's $44,000 allowance race on 
the turf course at Hollywood Park. Blues Traveller will be ridden by Eddie 
Delahoussaye and is assigned 118 pounds for the 1 3/16-mile race. Blues 
Traveller, a 4-year-old Irish-bred son of Bluebird, has won two of his 11 
lifetime starts and earned $195,373. 
</P>
<P>
 Others entered are Special Comic, who will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux and is 
assigned 118 pounds; Wise Words, Alex Solis, 118; Prospector's Ghost, Laffit 
Pincay, 115; Golden Post, Chris McCarron, 115; Phoenician, Gary Stevens, 115, 
and L'Honorable, David Flores, 115. 
</P>
<P>
 The $100,000-added Senorita Breeders' Cup Handicap will be run Saturday.

LOS ALAMITOS; AT 53, JOCKEY LAMBERT ISN'T ABOUT TO QUIT COMPETING ANY TIME SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After jockey Jerry Lambert suffered a serious back injury, few thought he 
would race again. But Friday night at Los Alamitos, Lambert returned to the 
races after three years. 
</P>
<P>
 A thoroughbred rider who guided Native Diver to stakes victory after stakes 
victory, Lambert came back aboard an Arabian trained by L. Yancey Carter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert failed to hit the board with his first attempt, but returned Saturday 
night and rode a winner and a second-place finisher, both trained by Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert began riding in 1958, and few things have kept him away -- not the 
Army, injuries or his 53rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd only been galloping horses two weeks when I rode my first race," Lambert 
said. "It was in Shelby, Mont., and the dust was so thick I couldn't even see 
the turns." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert rode in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon and Washington 
before trying Southern California in 1962. Almost immediately, he found both 
success and complications. M.E. (Buster) Millerick gave him the mount on Native 
Diver, who went on to earn more than $1 million and retired with 34 stakes 
victories. But almost before Lambert got started, his draft board called. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day I ever rode Native Diver I got a draft notice in the jockeys' 
room," Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
 So for two years, he soldiered during the week and rode on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, Lambert was still riding, taking mounts at Golden Gate, 
Bay Meadows and the Northern California fair circuit. The bit broke during a 
race at Pleasanton in 1987 and Lambert went "out the tailgate," as he put it. 
He suffered broken ribs, a broken cheek bone and a broken ankle. Eight weeks 
later, he was back in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 At Golden Gate in 1990, Lambert's mount ducked the whip and threw Lambert to 
the inside rail. The back injury, a compressed disk, required a year's therapy 
and appeared to have ended his riding career.  
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Larry Sterling hired Lambert as an assistant manager of his West Coast 
Training Center. But the desire to ride remained, and Lambert started 
exercising horses. Sterling moved to Oklahoma and Lambert moved his tack to 
Emerald Meadows Ranch in Riverside, where he met Arabian trainers Yancey and 
Ruthie Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware of his reputation, but had never seen him ride," Yancey Carter 
said. "He's a great talent and once he started riding, it became apparent." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert asked Carter if he could ride races and Carter believed it was worth a 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 30 years of riding thoroughbreds and only a few months aboard 
the Arabians, Lambert says he still is getting used to the new breed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not as fast and the conformation and the fractions are different," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lambert plans to continue with Arabians unless Carter decides to train 
thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are trainers and there are horsemen," Lambert said. "And he's a 
horseman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jockeys Carlos Bautista, Eddie Butler and Brian Long each fell -- Long twice 
-- in races during the weekend. Bautista suffered a strained shoulder, but the 
others escaped serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista, who rode 39 winners and finished eighth in the 1993 jockey 
standings, was aboard La Donna Blanca in Friday's fourth race. He was thrown 
after crossing the finish line in a dead heat for second. He was taken to Los 
Alamitos Medical Center and X-rays revealed the shoulder injury and a bruised 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista took off the rest of his mounts for the weekend, but hopes to ride 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Long first fell in Thursday's sixth race. He was leading with Y-O Gold Tack 
coming out of the turn when the gelding bolted to the outside. Mike Burgess, 
riding Ringdangdoo and running second, barely avoided Long, who came back to 
ride the next race. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's sixth race, Long again had the lead when he fell. Riding Lovely 
Fashion in a 4 1/2-furlong thoroughbred race, Long lost his balance on the 
backstretch and bobbled along a couple of strides before being thrown into 
traffic. Another horse clipped him in the back of the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one got me. I'm done here," he said, walking off the track and favoring 
his right leg. "I ride thoroughbreds at Santa Anita, and that's it for this 
track. They can keep this." 
</P>
<P>
 Long rode three races on Santa Anita's final card Monday and finished that 
meeting with three victories, five seconds and four thirds in 78 mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler fell in Saturday's third race and rode again in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Thursday night, Los Alamitos will increase the purses on 
thoroughbred races. Purses between $4,000 and $7,500 will increase $1,000. 
Purses of less than $4,000 will add $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it to encourage more thoroughbreds to race here at Los Alamitos," 
racing secretary Ron Church said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Barbara Jagoda would like to start her record-setting Arabian, Magna 
Terra Smoky, in the Equest International California Open on May 13, but she's 
not counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-eyed gelding defeated four others in winning the Sierra Knights 
Handicap on Friday, becoming the first Arabian to win 33 races. 
</P>
<P>
 "He only runs in stakes races now and there's one a month (for Arabians)," she 
said. "But we're having trouble filling our races, so I don't know if that one 
will go."

IRGUN HAS A SORE HOOF, TO SKIP KENTUCKY DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irgun, a Southland colt who won the Gotham Stakes and Wood Memorial in New 
York, was scratched from the Kentucky Derby on Tuesday because of an abscess in 
his right front hoof. 
</P>
<P>
 Irgun was considered one of the few front-runners who would challenge Holy 
Bull for the lead at Churchill Downs on May 7.Holy Bull became the Derby 
favorite after scoring front-running victories in the Florida Derby and Blue 
Grass Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young, who trains Irgun for Brandon and Marianne Chase, had been soaking 
the colt's foot since his arrival at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been taking its time to heal," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 A $28,000 yearling purchase, Irgun was unraced as a 2-year-old. He was shipped 
to Aqueduct after a victory and a second behind Strodes Creek in two starts at 
Santa Anita this winter. He won the Gotham by six lengths and was 1 1/2 lengths 
better than Go For Gin in the Wood on April 16. BILL CHRISTINE

CRESPI ON WRONG SIDE OF THE NET; VOLLEYBALL: CELTS LOSE TO LOYOLA AND HAVE A 
LOSING RECORD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS WITH SLATTUM AS COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crespi High boys' volleyball Coach Kevin Slattum grinned wryly and swallowed 
an unpleasant pill with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since Slattum started the Celts' volleyball program eight 
years ago, one of his teams has a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's hard for me to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But say it he had to after a 15-5, 15-5, 10-15, 15-8 loss to Loyola in a 
Mission League match on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi (6-7, 5-6 in league play), will miss the playoffs this season for the 
first time ever, and its loss to the powerful Cubs (14-1, 9-1) was symbolic of 
the way the Celts have played this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played well in spurts and in other spurts we looked like a freshman team," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ineptitude reigned for Crespi as Loyola coasted to victory in the first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 7-5, in the opener, the Celts surrendered eight consecutive points 
to lose the game, then made mistake after mistake in game two to lose 
convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Balls were being spiked off their faces, Loyola players were laughing and 
goofing around between games and all signs pointed to a demeaning three-game 
sweep by the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crespi regrouped in Game 3. The team started hustling, minimized its 
mistakes and standout hitter Nick DiPasquale began displaying his powerful 
spike. Suddenly the Celts went on an 8-2 run to take an 8-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to DiPasquale's five kills and a slew of Loyola errors, Crespi seized a 
little piece of pride and won the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality soon set in and Loyola breezed in game four. 
</P>
<P>
 DiPasquale led Crespi with 18 kills and seven digs, and Joe Bellavia added 14 
kills.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; ERRORS HELP SADDLEBACK UPSET FIRST-PLACE OCC IN 
SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saddleback scored two unearned runs in the first inning and went on to upset 
first-place Orange Coast, 2-1, in an Orange Empire Conference softball game 
Tuesday at OCC. 
</P>

DOW FALLS 6 AHEAD OF 1-DAY CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed slightly lower Tuesday as investors 
took profits from the previous day's surge and prepared for the market being 
closed today in memory of former President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow meandered at modestly lower levels throughout the uneventful session. 
It closed at 3,699.54, off 6.24. The popular market indicator advanced 57.10 
points Monday to end above 3,700 for the first time in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Most broad market measures heavily weighted with New York Stock Exchange 
issues also lost ground. The NYSE composite slipped 0.06 to 250.41; Standard & 
Poor's 500-stock index shed 0.84 to 451.87. The Nasdaq composite index of 
mostly small issues rose 3.41 to 734.21. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones about 7 to 5 on Big Board volume 
of 288.12 million shares, down from 263.55 million the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 The lackluster day for stocks came despite a decent showing for bonds amid 
mixed economic news. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of a boost in consumer confidence eroded some of the optimism sparked 
by a Labor Department report on employment costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's 30-year bond yield fell to 7.10% from 7.15% on Monday. The 
bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 19/32 point, or $5.94 
per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong rally has pushed down long-term bond yields about a third of a 
percentage point since April 18, when the Federal Reserve Board raised 
short-term interest rates for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The positive reaction of fixed-income investors contrasted with the market's 
sharp negative response to previous Fed rate hikes in February and March. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, investors seemed unwilling to take positions before a 
potentially market-moving economic report due Thursday. U.S. financial markets 
are closed today in honor of Nixon, who died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board, a New York research group, said its index of consumer 
confidence jumped 5 points in April to 91.7 and was up 24 points from last 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of strong economic activity usually upset bond traders, who worry that 
rapid growth will breed inflation, which devalues fixed interest-bearing 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Good inflation news, however, muted the impact of the confidence report. The 
Labor Department said its employment cost index, considered one of the best 
gauges of wage inflation pressures, rose 3.2% in the year ended March 31. That 
was the smallest increase on record. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco stocks were ignited by the news that Britain's BAT Industries has 
agreed to pay $1 billion in cash for American Tobacco, a division of American 
Brands, which jumped 2 7/8 to 34 5/8 in active NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other heavily traded tobacco stocks were RJR Nabisco, which gained 3/8 to 6 
7/8 in Big Board-leading volume, and Philip Morris, which moved up 2 to 54 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Healthy quarterly results helped Disney gain 1 1/8 to 43 1/2. An 
unexpectedly poor report drove the insurer UNUM's stock down 4 1/4 to 50 1/4. 
AST Research rose 3/4 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing rose 1 to 48 3/4. Prudential Securities 
upgraded the stock's rating to "buy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks came under pressure. Chevron fell 1 3/4 to 90 7/8 after it 
reported a 23% plunge in earnings. Texaco slipped 1 1/4 to 64 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * RHI Entertainment surged 9 1/8 to 35 5/8 on the American Stock Exchange in 
response to news that Hallmark Cards will acquire all outstanding RHI shares 
for $36 each. 
</P>
<P>
 * One big loser was the Mexican issue Gupta, which tumbled 9 3/4 to 13 1/2 and 
headed the Nasdaq list of active stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets turned in a mixed performance. In Europe, the Frankfurt DAX 
30-share average index ended at 2,243.20, up 1.86% or 40.98 points; London's 
Financial Times 100-share average ended 19.2 points higher at 3,125.3. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average closed down 80.21 points at 19,628.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index came on strong in late trading to close 93.05 points 
higher at 2,284.13, on expectations of a drop in Mexican interest rates and 
news of a multibillion-dollar currency swap agreement among the United States, 
Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 Light, sweet crude oil fell 33 cents to $16.91 a barrel on the New York Merc. 
Gold rose on the New York Comex to $373.90 an ounce, up 50 cents; silver 
fetched $5.173, up 4.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar was mostly lower against major foreign currencies. 
Traders had expected the greenback to gain from the latest batch of U.S. 
economic news.

S. AFRICANS CAST HISTORIC VOTES; ELECTION: HOSPITALIZED, RETIREES AND DISABLED 
FLOCK TO POLLS IN HIGH SPIRITS ON FIRST DAY. PROBLEMS WITH BALLOTING ARE 
WIDESPREAD -- BUT NO MAJOR VIOLENCE IS REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Democracy dawned with a flourish across South Africa on Tuesday as hospital 
patients, pensioners, the disabled and other "special voters" flocked to this 
country's first all-race polls in unexpectedly high numbers and remarkably good 
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening day of the historic three-day election for the post-apartheid 
government was marred by widespread confusion and hundreds of complaints of 
logistic problems and technical glitches at urban and rural polling stations. 
These included missing ballots, late starts and long lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no major poll violence, and despite more than a dozen bomb 
threats there were none of the explosions that have killed 21 people and kept 
South Africa on edge since the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, sick and elderly black voters who have waited all their lives to cast 
a ballot began lining up before dawn in cities, towns and townships across the 
nation. Some were hauled in blankets and wheelbarrows. Many waited up to eight 
hours under the baking sun in columns that extended for more than half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more voters showed up than were anticipated, officials said, although no 
official count was available. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the 22.7 million eligible voters -- including up to 18 
million first-time black voters -- will cast ballots at 9,000 heavily guarded 
polling stations today and Thursday. It remains to be seen if the glitches that 
dogged Tuesday's balloting will become nightmarish obstacles and lead to 
violence under a virtual flood of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the country's largest black township, patients at the sprawling 
Baragwanath Hospital, one of the biggest hospitals in Africa, hobbled in to 
vote on crutches, rolled up in wheelchairs and marched up in tattered bathrobes 
and threadbare pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought this day would come," said a beaming Mary Lele, 72, clutching 
her grandson's arm as she walked slowly, but with pride, to cast her first 
ballot. "I'm very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Mashaba, 73, carried her 2-year-old granddaughter in a red sling on her 
back. "I want her to see freedom," she said with a toothless smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettie Mogatwe, 42, rode in a wheelchair, her broken left leg in a new cast. 
Despite the pain, she grinned with delight when she left the polling booth. "I 
think it's the end of apartheid," she said. "We'll not be oppressed anymore. . 
. . We'll all be equal." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the first day's 2,219 fixed and mobile polling stations were 
equal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Zulu strongholds of KwaZulu and Natal, a plan to deliver special 
stickers to attach to the ballots for supporters of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party apparently went awry. Scores of 
polling booths did not receive the stickers, or got them late in the day, 
leaving thousands of disappointed and angry voters in one of the country's most 
volatile areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, who only last week dropped his militant boycott of the elections, 
called for an extension of the three-day voting period to alleviate the 
problem. "I'm extremely, extremely worried," Buthelezi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 He also complained hourly to the head of the Independent Electoral Commission, 
Judge Johann Kriegler. At an evening news conference, Kriegler said the voting 
could not be extended but acknowledged the commission had been overwhelmed on 
its first day of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell, the picture is far from perfect, but much, much further from 
disastrous," he said. But Kriegler, who has labored from the campaign's start 
to gloss over allegations of inefficiency and disorganization in the election 
preparations, called the day a "godsend." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a trial run today and picked up a large number of bugs and hitches and 
glitches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 IEC Commissioner Ben van der Ross said the worst problems were in three areas. 
"Very serious shortages" of election materials were reported in Transkei, he 
said. Communications had broken down in northern Transvaal. And several tribal 
chiefs had tried to "take the law into their own hands and commandeer the 
polling stations" in Natal, he said. Allegations of fraud were reported in 
several areas, but none was substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from other areas around the country were also worrisome. Voting was 
delayed for up to eight hours because of missing ballots or equipment in the 
mining town of Kimberly, while voting at Durban General Hospital did not begin 
until midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling was also delayed up to seven hours in townships in the East Rand and 
along the coast in Port Elizabeth and Port Shepstone. Only ballots for the 
National Assembly arrived in parts of Newcastle, although voters must mark 
another ballot for provincial legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials reported tension at two prisons after voting was delayed until the 
afternoon. And the boat carrying election officials and ballot papers to Robben 
Island, the infamous prison that once was home to Nelson Mandela, broke down in 
Cape Town harbor. The 700 prisoners voted later. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africans in 80 countries around the world were also able to vote. 
Mandela's niece Nomoza Patin was the first to cast a ballot, by virtue of her 
location in Wellington, New Zealand, which is closest to the international 
dateline. "It means a restoration of dignity . . . for every South African 
person," she told news services of her vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In Johannesburg, African National Congress spokesman Pallo Jordan told a news 
conference that the first day of voting had been rockier than expected. "We 
aren't that shocked by it, although we are dismayed by it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, enthusiasm and a sense of forgiving seemed the order of the day for a 
people finally able to choose their own leaders and rule their own land. Even 
the Johannesburg Stock Market was generous, surging to a record high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an incredible feeling, like falling in love," gushed Anglican 
Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his 
outspoken campaign against apartheid. He will vote today. 
</P>
<P>
 So will Mandela, the 75-year-old anti-apartheid crusader who seems about to 
trade his job as president of the ANC for president of the new South Africa. 
"What I feel is beyond words," he told a news conference. "Today marks the dawn 
of our freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Frederik W. de Klerk, who will trade his job as Africa's last white head of 
state for one as deputy executive vice president under Mandela, said he had no 
regrets about freeing Mandela from prison in 1990 and starting the long 
transition from apartheid to democracy. "I wanted this election to take place . 
. . that is what I have been working for," he said as he escorted his 
89-year-old mother, Corrie, to vote in Pretoria. "Today the new South Africa is 
being born." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, there was a flag to prove it.

DANA PARSONS: JUST DOWN THE ROAD IN YORBA LINDA, A DRIVEN NEWCOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As first the rain and then the hail pounded the streets of Yorba Linda on this 
historically significant Tuesday afternoon, a relative political newcomer is 
sitting in his threadbare campaign headquarters and reflecting on his old hero, 
whose casket was whisked into town just a couple hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony is amazing," congressional candidate Todd Thakar says. Amazing in 
that Thakar's introduction to politics came 22 years ago as a 14-year-old high 
school freshman in Wabash, Ind., who volunteered to work at the local 
Republican headquarters in support of the Nixon-Agnew reelection effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time I was ever really involved in anything, and it was the 
Nixon campaign. Then at our school, we had a big thing, a Nixon-McGovern thing. 
I was head of the Nixon group. I can even remember what I wore -- red, white 
and blue bell bottoms. We did a rally with both sides, and I headed up the 
Nixon rally. We had Styrofoam hats and Nixon-Agnew bumper stickers around the 
front of them. I even remember the cheer; it was like '1-2-3-4, 3-2-1-4, Who 
for, what for, who you gonna vote for, Nixon-Agnew, Nixon-Agnew, '72.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The brush with politics lit a fuse in Thakar. He decided he wanted to be a 
politician. "Some people want to be a fireman or this or that, but this is what 
I always wanted to do," he says. "How I knew when I was 14 that this was what I 
wanted to do, I don't know, but this was it. It's a public service thing. I 
want to be a representative. It's not the politics. I'm not enchanted with the 
politics at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason he and I are discussing life's ironies is that the campaign office 
Thakar has established is now only a few hundred yards from the Nixon Library & 
Birthplace, which today will become the site of the former President's burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Thakar opened the campaign office in the Old Towne section of Yorba Linda 
several weeks ago. A Republican, he's in an uphill campaign -- not to mention a 
crowded field -- to unseat incumbent U.S. Rep. Jay Kim in the 41st 
Congressional District. The Republican primary is crucial in that the winner is 
virtually certain of being elected in November in this heavily GOP district. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Thakar how Nixon's death affected him. "It's been real interesting, 
going door-to-door campaigning and having so many people mentioning that this 
was his (Nixon's) home. I learned he died while I was out campaigning Friday 
night, and so it was a little bittersweet. But it's OK because the outpouring 
and the respect that is coming is good. Few people had the vision and 
leadership and impact that he did." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask if Nixon disappointed him. "I remember the summer of '73, and we were 
painting our house and just watching the Watergate hearings," he says. "I don't 
ever believe that Nixon was involved in the break-in or aware of it (before it 
happened), but I couldn't help but think if he had taken a strong stand right 
after it happened and accepted the responsibility as the leader of the party 
and vowed to get to the bottom of it, that things would have been very 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one young Nixon staffer who testified during the Watergate hearing 
told young people to stay away from politics. I ask Thakar if that admonition 
affected him. "I certainly didn't buy into it then, but I had even more 
firsthand experience later. I worked on Capitol Hill for 3 1/2 years for Pete 
Wilson (during Wilson's U.S. Senate tenure). I think my idealism brought me 
there, but in the time I was there I was thinking, 'Is this what I want to do 
with my life?' I really struggled with that, and I went back and forth, because 
when you get back there and you see it work firsthand -- or see it operate -- I 
saw a lot of things I didn't like. There's a lot of politics and it took a good 
couple of years to resolve if this was something I really wanted to do, because 
of the bad things you see." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked if Nixon's inglorious presidential demise left an impression. "It goes 
back to what I said before, if he had taken the responsible initially. . . . " 
He pauses, then says, "I think ethics is something you can't compromise. People 
don't expect their leaders to be perfect, but they do expect them to be honest 
and fair." 
</P>
<P>
 I try to picture a young Richard Nixon winning his first run for Congress at 
33. Now, the Old Man, as his admirers sometimes called him, is dead at 81. The 
Old Man is out and a crop of new young congressional wanna-bes, like the 
36-year-old Thakar, are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am," says Thakar, "I've been doing this for 20 years (preparing for a 
career in politics), my first campaign was the Nixon campaign, and that was the 
energy and exhilaration of a kid and a President you believed in, and all that 
was good about America. Now here I am 20 years later, and my headquarters ends 
up being down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Settling on the office location near the library happened almost by chance, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now that we're here, the irony is real heavy."

FEUDING COUNCIL EXPECTS TOUGH JOB FINDING MANAGER; VENTURA: AN EXECUTIVE SEARCH 
FIRM MAY BE ENLISTED TO HELP LOCATE CANDIDATES TO REPLACE JOHN BAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura City Council members, still reeling from their city manager's Monday 
night announcement of his imminent resignation, said Tuesday that they hope an 
executive search firm can locate a replacement that the often-bickering council 
can agree on.  
</P>
<P>
 All that is certain about hiring John Baker's successor, council members said, 
is that they will discuss hiring such a search firm at next Monday's City 
Council meeting, and that they will consider candidates both inside and outside 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from that consensus, council members expressed widely diverging visions 
of what they want from the next city manager. Some also worried aloud that 
their contributions to the selection process might be thwarted by their equally 
strong-willed colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see somebody that has been a very strong manager in 
government, but also someone who knows the private sector and who has even 
worked in the private sector," said Councilman Jack Tingstrom, a staunch 
business advocate.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Carson, on the other hand, said he'd really like to hire 
someone who has worked at a city that's a tourist destination, to help Ventura 
strengthen its draw to out-of-towners.  
</P>
<P>
 At which idea, Councilman Jim Monahan scoffed. "No, see, that's inexperience 
talking," he said. "We don't want to get a travel agent for a city manager."  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle said he believed the whole selection process was best 
placed entirely in the hands of executive search experts. Professional 
headhunters could winnow down a list of candidates to one finalist and present 
it to the council for a yes or no vote, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should run the process -- especially not this council," he 
said. "It's such a disaster, so ego-driven."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the council has argued for months over selection of an economic 
development coordinator, a consultant who would be charged with overseeing the 
city's economic revitalization. Not only do council members not agree on the 
role this person would have at City Hall, they have spent hours of council time 
debating who gets how much input, and when, in selecting from among the various 
candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 Picking a new city manager will be easier, some council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will actually be much cleaner because we have a job description 
for the city manager," Councilman Steve Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, council members say, the city manager is the most powerful 
employee at City Hall. And Baker, who has been Ventura's city manager since 
1981, is also the highest paid city worker, making $108,120 in salary and 
$23,957 in benefits last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council itself directly hires only two employees -- the city manager and 
the city attorney. Every other city department head, including the police 
chief, the fire chief, and the head of public works, is hired by the city 
manager and answers to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, the city manager is the main link between the part-time council 
members and the full-time city staff. "Without that cooperation between the 
council and the city manager, you don't have anything," Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the search for such high-ranking officials can span the length of the 
state as well as the country. When Ventura hired Baker, the city lured him away 
from Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one high-ranking city official, Community Services Director Everett 
Millais, said despite the attractiveness of the job, he doubts that he will 
apply. He said he lacks the breadth of experience to take on such a 
wide-ranging job. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent someone would offer it to me, I wouldn't turn it down," he 
said. "But I don't see myself as being on a par with the type of candidates 
they are going to get." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Baker spent Tuesday working at his current job, and preparing for 
the next one. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be going into business, he said, with Gerald Newfarmer, the former 
city manager for Cincinnati who now does consulting work for major cities 
around the country. Baker and Newfarmer, both of whom plan to remain in their 
separate cities, met when they worked in Oakland together. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are still designing a logo, but they have come up with a slogan. 
"We're calling it, 'Helping People Work Together,' " Baker said.

JUDGE BARS UNDERWATER EXPLOSIONS FOR TESTING; CHANNEL ISLANDS: FEDERAL COURT 
INJUNCTION TEMPORARILY BLOCKS NAVY DETONATIONS OVER FEARS OF HARM TO MARINE 
LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the detonation of 
underwater explosives to test ship-hull strength west of the Channel Islands 
after ruling that the blasts would irreparably harm marine life in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Dist. Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles granted a preliminary 
injunction to stop testing until the case is decided as a whole at civil trial 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge concluded in a written decision that "plaintiffs have shown a 
near-certain likelihood of prevailing in their claims" that the Navy and the 
National Marine Fisheries Service violated federal law in approving the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge has decided to uphold environmental laws in the face of the Navy's 
wish to conduct these tests in the worst possible ecological area in the 
continental United States," said Richard Kendall, lead attorney for five 
environmental groups that sued to block the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy will appeal the decision, according to a statement released late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy is gravely concerned that today's ruling will send U.S. Navy ships 
to sea without testing (that) will maximize their ability to survive combat," 
the statement read. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing was scheduled to start this week about 20 miles off Navy-owned San 
Nicolas Island and about 85 miles southwest of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons 
Station, where the tests were to be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Wilson agreed with environmental attorneys, who argued that the Navy had 
filed no valid environmental report, had failed to examine alternate test sites 
and had not adequately protected marine mammals and other sea life. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials have acknowledged that the testing could result in the deaths 
of a small number of marine mammals, but have insisted that the tests are 
environmentally safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say aerial surveys conducted in the test area during the last 
several months show there are relatively few marine mammals there. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmental groups allege that 22 species of marine mammals -- including 
seals and sea lions -- would be killed, injured or harassed by the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called ship-shock tests would involve the detonation of underwater 
explosives as large as 10,000 pounds each to determine the strength of the 
Navy's new Aegis-class destroyers, their electronics equipment and overall crew 
survivability under simulated battle conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit named the National Marine Fisheries Service for granting the Navy a 
permit for the tests, which could involve as many as 270 detonations over a 
five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the dispute is whether the tests should be conducted farther 
offshore in deeper waters, where the concentration of marine life is not so 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups want the Navy to move the tests -- the first in the 
nation since 1991 -- from waters above an ocean cliff and as shallow as 1,800 
feet to depths of up to 18,000 feet, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to go offshore into the 2,000- to 3,000-fathom range," Kendall 
said, "away from the feeding areas of seals and sea lions and away from the 
body of nutrients concentrated on the Patton Escarpment." 
</P>
<P>
 Maris Sidensteker, a marine biologist for plaintiff Save The Whales, declared 
Tuesday's ruling "a victory for marine mammals." Other plaintiffs were the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, which coordinated the legal challenge, the 
Humane Society of the United States, American Oceans Campaign and Santa 
Monica-based Heal the Bay.

COUNTY URGED TO RECONSIDER PLANS FOR HOSPITAL WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A procession of doctors urged Ventura County leaders Tuesday to rethink their 
plans for a new hospital wing and end the feud between neighboring hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we justify building a $30-million building that will provide service 
that can be provided elsewhere?" said Moustapha Abou-Samra, a neurologist who 
works at both Ventura County Medical Center and Community Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In a five-hour hearing before the County Board of Supervisors, Abou-Samra and 
other physicians said the county should consider collaborative efforts between 
the two underused hospitals, rather than building new space for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a step would also relieve the suspicion that the county hospital is 
intent on capturing private patients, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am tired of the ongoing feud between the two institutions," added Jack 
Broms, a physician who has served on both staffs. "This feud is a waste of 
money and a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials say they are not responsible for any conflict between the 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe we are in a hospital war," said Supervisor Maggie Kildee 
after Tuesday's hearing. "We have not attacked other hospitals. We have not 
gone after other hospitals and said 'You're doing it wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors called the hearing to address questions raised in the 
simmering feud, which has manifested itself in newspaper advertisements and 
letter-writing campaigns. The members of the county's Public Facilities Corp., 
which must approve bonds for the projects, also attended the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors reiterated their support for the project after the hearing, but 
promised to do further analysis and examine how other communities have dealt 
with health care for poor residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the financial concerns, many doctors expressed concern about 
health-care reforms that could influence the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sam Edwards, the county hospital's medical director, defended the 
project despite criticism from his fellow physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 He described a changing health-care system that has taken the decisions about 
patient care away from the doctors and given them to financial managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms will also cut the number of doctors needed: from 224 doctors for 
every 100,000 to 120 doctors per 100,000. "What are all the doctors going to 
do, learn to paint houses?" Edwards asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Edwards said he saw a continuing need for institutions like the county 
hospital, aimed at providing health to the poorest residents. "It's very clear 
we're going to have a demand for safety-net medicine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Community Memorial doctors and supporters charge that the county will have 
to go beyond the indigent resident and solicit private-care patients to survive 
the cutbacks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's system of clinics, staff physicians and a new health-care plan 
for employees is a "medical nuclear weapon" in the war to win patients, argued 
Siegfried O. Storz, a cardiologist affiliated with Community Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Storz also accused the county hospital of creating a two-tier care system, 
giving county workers who choose the county hospital preference over poor 
residents with nowhere else to go. He displayed a hospital memo describing a 
special paging system used only when the patient is a county employee or family 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will let the doctor know it is an employee or family member and that 
they need to respond right away," the December, 1993, memo read. 
</P>
<P>
 County hospital Administrator Pierre Durand said he was not familiar with the 
memo and would look into it. Durand came prepared with his own salvo against 
Community Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited statistics showing that the community hospital's nonprofit status 
amounted to a $20-million tax break. But the hospital provided only one-half of 
1% of health care for the county's poor in 1992, the latest state health-care 
figures available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Benton, a spokesman for Community Memorial's board of trustees, said 
the figures were misleading. "The county is tax-exempt also, but it is also 
tax-supported," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton argued that any county that cannot afford to keep its libraries and 
government offices open full-time cannot afford a project, which with a parking 
lot and interest payments, will cost $56 million over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters pointed out that 70% of the costs would come from the state, but 
that didn't satisfy foes of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if state funds were available to spend on the project, it's still 
taxpayers' money and we should have a say on how it's spent," said Judy 
McGregor, a Ventura resident.

PROSECUTORS DEFY D.A. ORDER; SUPERIOR COURT: SOME DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS 
REFUSE TO SIGN AFFIDAVITS SWEARING THEY BELIEVE LAWRENCE STORCH IS BIASED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare act of defiance, some Ventura County deputy prosecutors are refusing 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's order to sign forms preventing the 
longest-serving Superior Court judge from hearing criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The forms -- affidavits -- require deputy district attorneys to swear that 
they believe Judge Lawrence Storch is biased. 
</P>
<P>
 Some prosecutors said they do not believe the judge is unfair and do not want 
to attach their names to the protest against Storch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not," Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said when asked 
if he would sign one of the affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in front of him for 15 years and he's always been fair to me," said 
Kossoris, whom Bradbury has described as the "top gun" among his deputies. "And 
I won't sign an affidavit under penalty of perjury that he is prejudiced when 
he's always been fair to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Because some deputies have declined to sign the affidavits, their supervisors 
have been forced to sign in their place in order to have Storch disqualified 
from cases. Under the law, each side in a case gets one opportunity to 
disqualify a judge by simply alleging bias, without having to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear Tuesday how many times deputy prosecutors have refused to 
sign the affidavits. Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell, the felony 
division chief who has such information, could not be reached. Officials in the 
district attorney's office refused to give the figure or to talk about their 
dissatisfaction with Storch. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors did bar Storch, a 20-year jurist, from two cases on Tuesday -- 
involving suspects accused of child molestation and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The molestation case is being handled by Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig. 
But the affidavit was signed by her supervisor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela 
Henke-Dobroth. Koenig declined to comment and Henke-Dobroth could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The refusal by some prosecutors to toe the line is unusual in the district 
attorney's office, where deputies usually are loath to criticize office 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman applauded the front-line 
prosecutors who refused to sign the disqualification papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that they're acting in the highest tradition of good lawyering," 
Clayman said. "They're expressing their conscience on what they think is 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some deputy prosecutors say they plan to abide by the directive to keep 
Storch off criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch has declined to comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors began using affidavits to ban Storch from hearing any new criminal 
cases after the judge granted a defense attorney's request to alter the verdict 
in a murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch voided a first-degree murder conviction for Todd Love of Newbury Park 
and convicted Love of second-degree murder, saying the evidence did not support 
the more serious charge. His decision shaved 10 years off Love's prison term, 
outraging some prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley, who prosecuted Love, said he believes 
Storch made a wrong decision in that case and is glad Bradbury has decided to 
bar the judge from hearing any new felony cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support Mike Bradbury's position and would abide by it," Frawley said. "I 
am confident that everyone will abide by it." 
</P>
<P>
 Several deputy prosecutors, who who declined to be identified, said they had 
not decided whether they will sign affidavits charging Storch with bias if they 
get a case assigned to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's stupid and so do most of the prosecutors in this office," said a 
longtime deputy prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Another said it appears that some of the office's most senior attorneys feel 
comfortable leaving their names off the affidavits against Storch, while some 
prosecutors with less tenure are following Bradbury's directive. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Frawley, some of those who plan to sign the affidavits said they believe 
Storch is too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to refuse that order," Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons accused the public defender's office of being hypocritical for 
faulting prosecutors on the issue. He said public defenders tend to file more 
disqualification affidavits against judges in Ventura County than prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman acknowledged that his attorneys do not hesitate to use affidavits to 
remove a judge from a case. But he said he has never directed his attorneys to 
systematically disqualify a judge, as the district attorney's office has done 
in the Storch matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't tell anybody to affidavit anyone," Clayman said.

LOCAL MILITARY BASES TO OBSERVE DAY OF MOURNING; NIXON: NAVAL FACILITIES IN 
POINT MUGU AND PORT HUENEME WILL HAVE MINIMAL OPERATIONS. POSTAL DELIVERIES 
WILL BE SUSPENDED. 
</P>

<P>
 Thousands of defense workers and Navy aviators will be idled today at the 
Naval Air Weapons Station at Point Mugu to mourn the death of former President 
Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 With flags already lowered to half-staff for 30 days to mark Nixon's passing, 
Point Mugu and the Naval Construction Battalion Center nearby in Port Hueneme 
will observe the day of mourning with minimal operations and skeleton staffs, 
base officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of President Clinton's declaration of a day of mourning, "We're 
observing the holiday routine," said Marge Hays, spokeswoman for the Point Mugu 
weapons testing base. 
</P>
<P>
 "All nonessential offices will be closed," she said. "The airfield will be 
open and some air operations that cannot be canceled will go on, but by and 
large, the great majority of people who work here will have the day off or 
their operations reduced." 
</P>
<P>
 While most banks and all city, county and state offices will remain open, 
postal service will be suspended and post offices closed in Nixon's honor. The 
offices and facilities of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District also 
will be closed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since Nixon's death at age 81 Friday after a stroke, some 
schoolteachers have been giving lessons about the nation's 37th President, 
showing their classes televised reports on his funeral and lecturing on his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 At Camarillo High School, the honors American history class was already deep 
into studies of the Nixon presidency the day he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher, Jim Graves, said: "Their assignment happened to be dealing with 
Richard Nixon and the enigma he presents. We have discussed that to quite an 
extent, the conservative as well as the liberal perspective on Richard Milhous 
Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 The class has rounded out its study of the Nixon presidency with discussions 
of detente and "the great breaking-down of Chinese and Soviet barriers to the 
United States," Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley View Junior High School in Simi Valley on Tuesday, students were 
allowed to watch telecasts of the motorcade that bore Nixon's casket from El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station to the presidential library in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will probably turn the television on at some point each period (Wednesday) 
so they get a taste of what a body lying in state is like, and what it means to 
have people filing past," said Sally Hibbitts, social studies teacher. "Since 
in our community I'm anticipating something similar in the future for former 
President Reagan, I think it's important our students know what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, have requested to be buried on the grounds 
of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday afternoon, as the funeral procession moved toward Yorba Linda, 
visitors to the Reagan library in Simi Valley added their names to the more 
than 2,600 already signed in a condolence book to be given to the Nixon family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought President Nixon got a bum rap from the media," said Chuck 
Maass of Canoga Park, signing the book beneath a photo of Nixon. "What he did 
was certainly no worse than what the present officeholder has done." 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne Maitre of Placentia agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think eventually you will see he didn't do anything worse than anyone 
else," said Maitre, who said she voted for him. "What the family needs to know 
is that people cared." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald and Mary Brennan of West Hills said they drove to the Reagan library 
Tuesday especially to sign the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our President, and he represented us, and we just feel bad at his 
passing," Donald Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a Nixon detractor signed the book, saying his own father's terminal 
illness made him sympathetic to the Nixon family's grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know President Nixon has done some crooked things," said Bob Lamb of 
Urbana, Ill. "I have been holding a very bitter, bad taste in my mouth about 
what (Nixon) had done, but I feel now that things should be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Reagan library will be closed today, the lobby will remain open at 
the Simi Valley facility so that visitors can sign the condolence book, said 
library spokeswoman Stefanie Salata.

BANK PULLS OUT OF 2-YEAR SLIDE; ECONOMY: A. LEVY OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC AFTER 
REPORTING $1.36-MILLION QUARTERLY GAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura-based Bank of A. Levy on Tuesday reported a profit of $1.36 
million for the first quarter of 1994, the first gain the bank has made in 
seven consecutive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our first profit in two years," said Marshall C. Milligan, the bank's 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the recession's aftermath) is not over yet, but we're confident that 
we're making good progress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter of 1993, the bank reported a net loss of $800,000. As 
recently as the last quarter of 1993, the Bank of A. Levy had a net loss of 
$981,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schniepp, director of the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecasting Project, 
said the news was one of many signs throughout Ventura County that the economy 
is improving, although slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the business climate is at least beginning to solidify its 
losses," Schniepp said. He said that across California, banks were showing 
signs of recovery in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1994, it should be even better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan said the bank's strongest area of earnings was in the recovery of 
$695,000 worth of real estate and commercial-business loans that had gone 
unpaid.  
</P>
<P>
 The bank also made a pretax gain of $360,000 on the sale of its former 
Vineyard Avenue office in Oxnard. In addition, the sale of foreclosed real 
estate deals contributed to profits, Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quarter, the bank wrote off $674,000 in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The future looks optimistic for the bank, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have additional problem loans," he said. "We're in the later stages 
of cleaning up problems that developed in 1991 and 1992, and we're making 
progress through that cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Jan. 17 earthquake adversely affected banks in the San Fernando 
Valley, it had little effect on the Bank of A. Levy, Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the quake, 16 of the 17 county branches were open. Although the 
bank established an emergency loan program for earthquake victims, those loans 
had a negligible impact on the bank's earnings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan predicted it would be another 12 to 18 months before the bank could 
completely resolve the damage done to its portfolio by the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bank of A. Levy is the county's largest locally owned bank. Its closest 
competitor, Ventura County National Bank, recently reported losses of $114,000 
for the first quarter 1994. But compared with VCNB's losses in the first 
quarter of 1993 of $1.58 million, officials there were optimistic about the 
smaller losses.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PILOTS URGE END TO NEW SAFETY RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Ventura County pilots Tuesday asked county supervisors to repeal a 
newly imposed rule to clear wooden benches, computers and other equipment from 
airport hangars that airport officials say increases fire and safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 The order was issued just weeks before newly hired Airports Administrator 
Rodney Murphy takes over the county's Department of Airports. Supervisors 
Tuesday approved Murphy's hiring at an annual salary of $68,562. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozen pilots who appeared before the board also asked to be exempted from 
a new rule that requires their hangars to be inspected before they are issued 
key cards to activate electronic gates at airports in Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Airports issued the cleanup order April 20, citing fire and 
safety concerns. The order, which also bans the building of airplanes in the 
hangars, calls for compliance by May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "The severity of the requirements (is) ridiculous," charged Nathan Rambo, a 
retired engineer and administrator who maintains a hangar at Camarillo Airport. 
"It is designed to be implemented days before the new administrator takes 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots, many of them members of the Experimental Aviation Assn., which 
builds its own aircraft, said timing of the order is also troublesome because 
it comes just three weeks before the association's fly-in. The annual event is 
attended by 8,000 pilots from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's at least delay that date until after the air show," said pilot Bill 
Melly, a hangar owner at Camarillo Airport since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Chairwoman Vicky Howard agreed that the order is inappropriate and 
should be rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very disturbed about it," she said. "We're working very hard to bring 
business and government together, and I thought that (memo) was not in the 
spirit that the Board of Supervisors would like to have with businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, a member of the county's Airport Authority, said 
there have been some instances in which airport hangars were improperly used 
for storage for items other than aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make sure we have two safe airports," he said. "But I do think 
there is a degree of harassment for airport users (in the order). I would like 
to see an end to this." 
</P>
<P>
 The memo was not issued in time for either the Board of Supervisors or the 
Airport Authority to place an item on their agendas for official action. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said it is unlikely that either the board or the Airport Authority 
could meet on the topic in time to rescind the order before it takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Airports Operations Manager Nona Makinson, who issued the order, could not be 
reached for comment. JOANNA M. MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; FORUM TO HELP THOSE BUYING FIRST HOME 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is sponsoring a free forum Saturday to help potential first-time home 
buyers. The session will be held from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. in the Community 
Meeting Center's Constitution Room, 11300 Stanford Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum is open to the public on a space-available basis, said Jennifer 
Mack, housing program coordinator with the city's Community Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a big demand for this type of information," Mack said. "We've 
already received 650 inquiries from people thinking about buying their first 
homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack said the forum will have experts who will discuss such things as 
governmental programs for financially helping first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time the city has sponsored a forum such as this, but we're 
thinking of making it an annual event," Mack said.BILL BILLITER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; FBI INVESTIGATING DEFENSE CONTRACTOR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI said Tuesday that it is investigating a Camarillo defense contractor 
suspected of misappropriating government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Auer, supervisor in charge of the FBI's regional office, said agents 
served a search warrant Feb. 2 at Research Management Consultants Inc. for 
company documents.No charges have been filed and the investigation is 
continuing, he said. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Janean Daniels, attorney for Research Management Consultants, said the FBI has 
also subpoenaed several employees, but they have not yet testified before a 
federal grand jury in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said the warrant asked for some of the company's financial records and 
agents seized boxes of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we deny all allegations," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was founded in 1988 and is owned by Raydean Acevedo. The company 
has contracts with the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, Daniels said, as 
well as other government contracts to do environmental and engineering 
consulting. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; HEARING TO STUDY RENAMING SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing is scheduled Thursday over a proposal to rename a Santa Paula 
elementary school after a longtime city leader and current school board 
trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees of the Santa Paula Elementary School District will hear 
testimony on whether to rename Glen City School after Trustee Joe Bravo, but 
the item is scheduled as an information-only matter, and no decision will be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Every elementary school in Santa Paula except Glen City is named after a 
prominent local citizen, all of whom are white. The city is 60% Latino, and the 
name issue, which some community members claim is racial, has divided many in 
the city of 25,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, former Trustee Bob Borrego proposed renaming the campus after 
Bravo, the former mayor of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 But others suggested the district would do better to honor Dorothy Pinkerton, 
who served as the Glen City School principal for more than 20 years until her 
retirement in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkerton has said she would welcome the honor, but would rather see the 
school's name remain Glen City, a reference to what the city was called before 
it was named Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday in the district office at 144 
Davis St. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 Ventura County is applying for a federal grant to help preserve historic 
portions of Piru that were damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the $50,000 Community Development Block Grant would fund planning 
and engineering studies to preserve sections of the tiny community's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Several buildings in the business district were "yellow-tagged" after the 
earthquake, indicating that they were dangerous to enter. All are listed in the 
State of California Historical Resources Inventory, which makes them eligible 
for historical preservation funds, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also damaged was a state landmark adobe on the Camulos Ranch. JOANNA M. MILLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: '3 STRIKES' MAY HELP CLIENT, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A three-time convicted robber now facing 10 felony counts of child molestation 
might get a lighter sentence if convicted under the state's new "three strikes 
and you're out" legislation than under previous laws, the defendant's attorney 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn also acknowledged that his client -- 
40-year-old Henry Diaz -- is considering pleading guilty to some of the charges 
to get the more lenient sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn's comments came after Diaz's preliminary hearing was continued to give 
the defense more time to consider the defendant's options. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was charged with 10 counts of felony child molestation after police who 
raided his Sitka Avenue home said they found him in bed with a 13-year-old girl 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn said Diaz could face 41 years if convicted under the law before the 
"three strikes" legislation was enacted March 7. He could serve as few as 25 
years under the new law, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new law, if applied in a certain way to this case, could conceivably lead 
to a lesser sentence than if you applied the old law," the defense attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig, who is prosecuting Diaz, refuted Quinn's 
interpretation of Diaz's sentencing option if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about 41 years under the old law, that would be the maximum," 
she said. "But he would be eligible for parole much earlier than that." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, state prisoners might serve half their sentence with time off 
for good behavior. That would mean Diaz would be eligible for parole in about 
20 years under the old law. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn said there are many uncertainties with the three-strikes law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is an absolute morass of conflicting provisions and ambiguous 
language," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz's preliminary hearing was continued until May 12 by Superior Court Judge 
Charles W. Campbell Jr. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY GETS GRANT FOR FLOOD CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County received a $1.5-million federal grant to continue work on a 
flood control channel needed for the planned Cal State University west of 
Camarillo, county officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds from the U. S. Soil Conservation Service will enable the county to 
complete all but the final 1,300 feet of the 1.5-mile-long channel, said Arthur 
Goulet, director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will contribute about $95,000 toward the new section of the 
project, which extends a concrete ditch that drains the mountains above the 
campus another 2,700 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soil Conservation Service has already contributed $1.5 million to the 
project, which is expected to cost about $5 million when it is completed, 
probably next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very close to the end of this project," Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clara Drain project was conceived and designed in the 1970s, when 
concrete channels as opposed to more natural waterways were thought to be the 
best method of flood control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we would conceive it the same way today," he said. But to 
redesign the project would have set the timetable back by years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drain or some other form of flood control is needed to keep the property 
at Central and Santa Clara avenues from being inundated during heavy winter 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulet said the county has also received a federal grant for design and 
engineering work to widen and improve Santa Clara and Central avenues. But he 
said funds for road construction are probably three years away due to federal 
funding cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State is purchasing one parcel and in condemnation proceedings for the 
remaining portion of 260 acres of lemon orchards chosen for the university.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; APPLICANTS SOUGHT FOR HABITAT HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Low-income families eager to own a home -- and willing to devote 500 hours to 
help build it -- are invited to apply for Habitat for Humanity's first major 
project in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization plans to build a three-bedroom, one-bathroom house 
on Beall Street in Thousand Oaks this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The family selected to own the home must chip in with "sweat equity" labor, be 
able to come up with escrow closing costs and be able to pay off a 20-year 
mortgage to cover the price of construction material, estimated at about 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Other qualifications: The family must have an annual income of $13,000 to 
$30,000, have members who have lived or worked in Thousand Oaks for at least a 
year and be unable to buy a home through standard bank loans. In addition, they 
must be willing to put up with publicity about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity has scheduled three informational meetings for families 
interested in applying. The sessions will take place in the Thousand Oaks High 
School cafeteria, 2323 N. Moorpark Road, at 7:30 p.m. May 4 and 5, and 1 p.m. 
May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity members are confident that they'll find a family to meet 
the group's tough standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thousand Oaks is not downtown Los Angeles, but there are a lot of people 
whose families grew up here and who now can't afford to live here," said 
Jennifer Zobelain, who heads the project committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Beall Street residents who live near the Habitat for Humanity building site 
will participate in screening applicants. Groundbreaking will take place after 
the family is selected, which probably will occur in July, Zobelain said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; HOUSING PROJECT UP FOR RECONSIDERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $20-million housing development rejected last week by the Moorpark City 
Council is scheduled for reconsideration tonight at a special council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery, who voted against the project, said he has 
changed his mind and wants the council to reconsider the bid by Kaufman and 
Broad to build 87 houses in the Campus Hills development in eastern 
Moorpark.The 494-house development has been unfinished since 1992 when the 
original developer, Griffin Homes, went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of homeowners has criticized Montgomery for his change of heart, 
saying he was "flip-flopping" to please the developers. They say the project 
would undermine the value of their homes by allowing smaller houses than those 
planned for the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, who is running for county supervisor, said the attacks on his 
decision to reconsider the plan are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the bad guy here," Montgomery said. "It's frustrating that the 
specter of campaign politics may have entered into this . . . all I'm trying to 
do is represent all the people of Moorpark." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the development said that no other offer to complete the project 
is likely soon, and that as part of the agreement, Kaufman and Broad would 
build a recreation center with the 87 houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said that the most vehement criticism against him has come from 
members of a homeowners group whose president, Ted Martens, works for Barbara 
Williamson, one of his opponents in the county supervisor race. 
</P>
<P>
 Martens denied his criticism was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that I thought he did a wonderful job trying to work out a 
compromise (last week)," Martens said. "But I am upset with the way it's been 
handled since then." 
</P>
<P>
 The special City Council meeting will begin at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall, 799 
Moorpark Ave. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; JURORS FIND MAN GUILTY IN DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury convicted a Newbury Park resident of a drug charge Tuesday but 
deadlocked on charges that the 26-year-old man tried to run over a sheriff's 
deputy with a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Hedlund was charged with one count of transportation and sale of 
cocaine and two counts of assault on a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedlund slammed his pickup truck in reverse and sped toward Deputy Patrick 
MacCauley on June 30 after realizing that a man he had just sold cocaine to was 
a police informant, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 MacCauley testified that he managed to dive out of the way to avoid serious 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath declared a mistrial Tuesday on the 
two assault charges after jurors, who had deliberated for more than a week, 
told him that they were deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyo Ortiz, one of the jurors, said outside court that he voted not guilty on 
the two assault charges because the prosecution did not prove that MacCauley 
was behind the pickup truck when Hedlund put it in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have gone two more weeks and probably would not come up with a 
conclusion," Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert D. Meyers said his office will decide later whether 
to retry Hedlund on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath did not set a sentencing date on Hedlund's conviction on one count of 
transportation and sale of cocaine. DWAYNE BRAY

BOY SAYS HE DOESN'T RECALL FATAL STABBING; TRIAL: PHILLIP HERNANDEZ, 13, 
TESTIFIES HE BLACKED OUT AFTER VICTIM PUNCHED HIM AT SIMI VALLEY SCHOOL FEB. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eighth-grader Phillip Hernandez testified Tuesday that he doesn't remember 
fatally stabbing a 14-year-old classmate in February at a Simi Valley junior 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 13, on trial for second-degree murder in Ventura County Juvenile 
Court, said he blacked out after victim Chad Hubbard punched him on the side of 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I opened my eyes, I saw blood on Chad's shirt," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison pointed out to 
Hernandez that he did not mention anything about blacking out during his 
interviews with detectives just after the stabbing and told police that he had 
been aiming for Hubbard's stomach, not his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he did not remember his interviews with investigators after the 
stabbing. In his testimony, Hernandez said he obtained the folding knife 
shortly before the fight when a friend showed it to him. He said he was going 
to hand the knife right back to his friend, but got distracted. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was the first time since his arrest that the defendant talked publicly 
about the fatal encounter Feb. 1 at Valley View Junior High School. His 
relatives and Hubbard's family listened to his testimony as he described the 
events leading up to the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he and Hubbard passed each other in a school hallway shortly 
before the fight and exchanged insults. Hernandez said he flashed a gang sign 
at Hubbard, who made a sign with his fingers resembling a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the two ran into each other and Hubbard started the fight, Hernandez 
said. Before the stabbing occurred, Hubbard threatened to bring a gun to school 
and shoot him, Hernandez testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are calling Hernandez a malicious killer, but Deputy Public 
Defender Donna Forry is portraying Hubbard as a bully who had been drinking 
when he provoked the fight and threw the first punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he told Hubbard to leave him alone, but Hubbard hit him in the 
right shoulder, then on the chest and the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he hit my head, it went like a blackout," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he did not remember pulling out his friend's folding knife or 
stabbing Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez became confused during the cross-examination by Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison also showed Hernandez pictures that were taken of him shortly after 
the fight in which there were no apparent bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did not have a blackout, did you?" Ellison asked. Hernandez, who appeared 
bewildered, answered simply, "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is expected to continue testifying today before the defense rests.

APARTMENTS IN INDUSTRIAL AREA OKD BY PLANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying commercial truck noise and traffic should not bother future residents, 
Thousand Oaks planning commissioners have agreed to allow a 246-unit apartment 
complex to be built in an industrial section of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission debated the matter for five hours Monday night before 
granting Shapell Industries permission to build the apartment complex directly 
across from the old Northrop Corp. plant on Rancho Conejo Boulevard. The vote 
was 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Shapell proposed to build the apartments inside the gated community 
of Rancho Conejo Village. But the developer changed the location after 
homeowners complained about sharing their gated community with renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Linda Parks cast the lone vote against the complex, saying she 
was concerned that noise from trucks using the nearby United Parcel Service 
compound on Rancho Conejo Boulevard would disturb residents. She pushed hard to 
postpone a decision so that staff could conduct a three-week study of noise 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 But other commissioners rejected the idea of a study as a needless expense, 
saying that Shapell had already produced satisfactory evidence that the level 
of noise would be minimal. The UPS facility is the only operating business in 
the neighborhood, and it ceases to create noise after 6 p.m., they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go measure the noise because there isn't any noise out there," 
Commissioner Forrest Frields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks urged the commission to also consider the prospect of increasing noise 
levels as more industrial users move into the area. "There is no doubt in my 
mind that at 4 o'clock in the morning these people are going to be waking up to 
the sound of 18-wheelers downshifting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other commission members said they believed the issue had been resolved by 
Shapell's willingness to install sound barriers in the complex, including 
double-glazed windows, insulation and double-thick walls, and solid-core doors 
in the apartments that front Rancho Conejo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said Shapell's promise of surrounding the complex with oak 
tree plantings and masonry walls should diminish any future noise problems. 
"This area really is more of a transitional zone than an industrial zone," 
Commissioner Mervyn Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Planner Robert Rickards said it appears development on the 14-acre parcel 
will go forward, although he cautioned that opponents have 20 days to appeal 
the decision to the City Council.

FESTIVAL AIMS TO APPEAL TO A SPECTRUM OF TASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kids can't stomach the roller coaster? Maybe they'd rather enter a coloring 
contest. Air too chilly for the Ferris wheel? Try an indoor story hour. Rodeo 
too rough and rowdy? How about an exhibit of children's photographs? 
</P>
<P>
 When the 30th annual Conejo Valley Days festival opens tonight, organizers 
hope to provide something for every taste. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong-stomached can down cotton candy and hot dogs and then swirl through 
the twilight on dozens of gut-testing rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Those less enamored of dizzying twists can browse through the two big-top 
tents, picking through children's clothes, golf clubs and other paraphernalia 
from local stores. 
</P>
<P>
 And those eager to indulge in nostalgia about Thousand Oaks' bygone small-town 
days can swap memories at the Badgeroo Contest. Longtime residents will show 
off their Conejo Valley Days buttons from years past and trace the history of 
the event from the first low-key community circus to the current, five-day 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 While a few leftover showers may sprinkle the fairgrounds this morning, by the 
5 p.m. ribbon-cutting ceremony "things should be all cleared out," National 
Weather Service forecaster Dave Gomberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures should hover just above 50 degrees tonight, and the weather 
should steadily improve through the weekend, Gomberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days volunteers are hoping that the cheery forecast will draw 
big crowds on opening night. But in case the weather isn't enough, they've come 
up with a gimmick: a Family Night pass that allows youngsters to romp through 
all the Kiddy Land rides for just $5. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for tonight's festivities, volunteers, vendors and carnival 
operators spent a hectic Tuesday afternoon setting up their booths and rides on 
the damp field. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of hustle and bustle out there," Jennifer Cummings, the event 
coordinator, said from her command post inside the Conejo Valley Chamber of 
Commerce. "Everything's on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival's first event, the annual Badgeroo Contest, is scheduled for 7 
p.m. on the outdoor stage. Contestants will try to outshine one another with 
creative displays of buttons from Conejo Valley Days past. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent winner pinned them to a miniature covered wagon, event coordinator 
Jim Nelson recalled, but most stick the buttons to hats, vests and dungarees. 
"It's a madhouse," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more crazy than the contestants: the price tags on some of the old Conejo 
Valley Day badges. The rarest button, a tin star that folded over a vest 
pocket, commemorates the 1966 fair and goes for $400. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost mine on the Ferris Wheel" three decades ago, Nelson said ruefully. "I 
didn't know then how valuable they would be." 
</P>
<P>
 While Badgeroo Contest focuses on tradition, this year's Conejo Valley Days 
will also feature several new events, most notably the Conservation Corner in 
the children's tent. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate Earth Day, which officially was April 22, the city and a local 
environmental group have arranged for mascots like Sierra the Bear and Tammy 
the Recycling Eagle to teach children about conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trash Monster, a gruesome creature created from unrecycled junk, will also 
make a guest appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids will go to the rides and then they'll go through the children's 
tent," predicted Grahame Watts, the city's recycling coordinator.

FEMA SUSPENDS FUNDS FOR EMERGENCY BASIN; NEWBURY PARK: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANTS 
AN ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT ON PROJECT'S EFFECT ON A WETLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government has frozen funds for an emergency debris basin in 
Newbury Park and will not release the money until experts draft a formal 
environmental report analyzing the project's effect on a nearby wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, Ventura County started work on this thing in an area where there 
may be some endangered species," FEMA officer Daryl Wait said Tuesday. "We 
cannot fund this until they get environmental clearance." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's decision to suspend funds for the project came after a state 
environmental specialist voiced fears that the debris basin, as designed, could 
damage a wetland along Reino Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But the action surprised engineers at the Ventura County Flood Control 
District, who have already completed one-third of the basin and are counting on 
federal funds to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've just shocked me with that news," division engineer Ed Gunen said upon 
learning of FEMA's move. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency had been scheduled to reimburse the 
flood control district for $658,840, or 75% of the project's total cost, Wait 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that money will be frozen until the federal Soil Conservation Service can 
complete a report that satisfies national guidelines for assessing 
environmental impact. The public will have a chance to comment on the analysis, 
further delaying payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so ecstatic," said Michelle Koetke, a Newbury Park resident who has been 
calling for an environmental study. "This is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent rains had already forced the flood control district to suspend work on 
the ditch until Monday. Given FEMA's decision, engineer Gunen said he did not 
know whether excavation would resume next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the chief project engineer and the director of the flood control district 
were on vacation and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Building a debris catch-basin along Reino Road became a priority after last 
fall's wildfires, which ripped through Newbury Park hillsides and stripped away 
vegetation that normally anchors the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that heavy rains could sweep soil and fallen branches down the 
hills, clogging a nearby flood control channel, engineers decided to build the 
30-foot-deep debris basin between Lynn Road and Kimber Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after dirt-moving equipment rolled into the neighborhood and began 
scraping out the ditch, residents mobilized against the project. They posted a 
sign asking people to call the flood control district, and pestered local and 
federal officials to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 Of paramount concern was the county's plan to flush all water from the debris 
basin into a concrete-lined channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argued that ground water should be allowed to pool in the ditch, where 
it would naturally replenish the adjacent wetland. By pumping the water out, 
they said, county engineers could be draining the sensitive habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly isn't fair to wildlife to decrease the amount of habitat 
available to them on that land by pumping the water into the sewer," said 
environmental specialist Ken Wilson of the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to those concerns, Gunen on Tuesday said the county's engineers had 
agreed to stop draining the water within three weeks. For the time being, 
however, he said pumping was necessary so crews could finish excavating the 
ditch and sprinkle gravel along the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunen predicted that the county might have to pump intermittently this winter 
to keep the debris basin at maximum capacity. Too much water could keep the 
ditch from catching all the dead wood and silt that slip down from fire-scarred 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take two to three years for the vegetation to come back," Gunen said. 
"We will evaluate (growth on) the watershed area and we may feel comfortable 
leaving some water in the basin. We'll play it by ear." 
</P>
<P>
 In another concession to environmentalists, Gunen said the flood control 
district had agreed to drill three "monitoring wells" to analyze water flow. By 
measuring water levels in the wells and the basin, he said, hydrologists could 
determine whether the wetland was suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 But after-the-fact monitoring did not dim the clamor for a full environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the idea of finding out what impact something will have before you go 
and cause that impact," Planning Commissioner Linda Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's decision to withhold funds pending an analysis cheered some critics of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We at least wanted this looked into," said resident Jocelyn DeVault, who 
suggested that water pooling in the ditch be converted into a neighborhood duck 
pond. "This is good to hear. I'm excited."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; EDMONDS IS GIVEN SCARE OF HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel outfielder Jim Edmonds was never so scared in his life, lying motionless 
on the ground Tuesday while a hush fell over Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He was running to first base in the second inning when an errant throw by 
Yankee shortstop Mike Gallego hit him flush in the neck, just below the left 
ear. He never lost consciousness, but that's what made it so frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't move. He could not even feel his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my legs going numb," Edmonds said. "That's when I knew I was in 
trouble. I was hoping I could walk away, but it was like all of the life had 
gone out of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they took me away in the ambulance, that was the worst ride of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, carried off the field on a stretcher with his neck in a brace, was 
rushed to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Two sets of X-rays of were taken and 
doctors told Edmonds he was extremely fortunate. It was only a deep bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 He can walk again. He can play again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember too much after I got hit," Edmonds said. "But I'm OK. I'm a 
little groggy right now, but I'll be ready to go (Wednesday). I don't want to 
sit out any longer than I have to." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers: "That was terrifying, to say the least. He 
gave us all a pretty good scare." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Bob Melvin turned down the Angels' contract offer to be their triple-A 
Vancouver catcher, according to agent Doug Baldwin. The Angels, who will be 
without catcher Greg Myers until June after undergoing arthroscopic knee 
surgery Tuesday, want a veteran catcher in reserve at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 They now will explore the possibility of acquiring either Greg Olson, 33, or 
Geno Petralli, 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin, meanwhile, might soon be joining the Yankees. Catcher Matt Nokes, who 
hit a grand slam Monday night against the Angels, was diagnosed Tuesday with a 
broken hamate bone in his left hand. He will be out six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Ken Patterson, who was diagnosed with a partially torn ligament in 
his left elbow, will be placed on the disabled list today. John Farrell, 
according to Rodgers, probably will replace Patterson in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also are expected to recall starter Joe Magrane after his scheduled 
start April 30 for Vancouver. Magrane, who's on a rehabilitative assignment, 
gave up nine hits and two runs in seven innings Monday in Vancouver's 5-3 
victory over Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to make his debut for the Angels in their four-game series May 
5-8 against Oakland. BOB NIGHTENGALE

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: NOW GARMAN MIGHT SOFTEN TOUGH 
SOFTBALL SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton softball Coach Judi Garman is going to think twice from 
now on about her philosophy of playing an extremely tough schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new selection rules for the NCAA playoffs, a team's power rating, 
which weighs heavily the strength of its schedule, won't be the factor that it 
has been, according to Garman. She said at-large teams for the postseason 
tournament will be chosen almost solely based on won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
 "A team must have an overall winning record to be invited, as well," she said. 
"The heavier emphasis on the won-loss record definitely will be a negative for 
teams in the West, where most of the teams play strong schedules." 
</P>
<P>
 Garman pointed out that Fullerton (24-25, 13-9 in Big West) has played 
numerous games this season against teams in the top 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely won't be playing in the Arizona tournament next year," Garman 
said. "We went there because we knew it would be tough competition against the 
defending national champions, but we wound up with four losses there, with two 
of them against Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
 Will this also change the scheduling philosophy for the the Titans' midseason 
PONY-Louisville Slugger tournament that traditionally has included many of the 
nation's top teams? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to do anything negative relating to that tournament because it has so 
much prestige, but I do know some coaches haven't played in it in the past 
because of the strength of the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA softball playoff field, however, will be expanded from 20 to 32 teams 
this year. Four teams will compete at each of the eight regional sites. The 
four seeded teams will be sent to different regionals. Half the teams will be 
from automatic berths; the other 16 will be at-large selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us have been critical of teams in the past that have not played 
strong schedules, but it looks as though we may have to change our thinking on 
that," Garman said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Former Fullerton soccer star Mike Ammann is getting a two-week tryout with a 
team in a hotbed of soccer, Charlton of South London, in the English Division 
One league. 
</P>
<P>
 Ammann took part in a training session with the U.S. national B team in 
Bermuda recently, then left for England last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlton really needs a goalkeeper, so they seem very interested in Mike," 
said his brother Bob, an assistant coach for Al Mistri at Fullerton and a 
player for the Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be eligible to play in the European leagues as an American, you have to 
have someone in your immediate family who was born in Europe or have played in 
75% of your national team's games. Mike doesn't qualify on either score at the 
moment, but his girlfriend is Italian, and they would get married right away, 
rather than later, if the opportunity exists for him to play there." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Bob have Swiss citizenship, but Switzerland doesn't belong to the 
European soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would go there in a second if I were eligible, but I would have work permit 
problems," Bob Ammann said. "The English are trying to conserve their own 
players. That's why they're so limiting about the number of Americans who can 
play there." 
</P>
<P>
 He says there is a big difference between soccer in the United States and 
England. "There's a lot more excitement and involvement by the fans there than 
there is with American soccer at this point," he said. "Soccer is the sport of 
the masses in England."

 Fullerton distance running star Heather Killeen, making a comeback from hip 
and knee injuries that sidelined her during the cross-country season, made a 
good showing in the 3,000 meters at the UC Irvine Invitational last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished third in the event with a time of 10:06.50, but it was the top 
time in the race for a college runner. The two runners finishing ahead of her 
-- including former Edison star Shelley Taylor, the winner in 9:56.56 -- were 
unattached. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looked a lot sharper than in previous weeks," Coach John Elders said. 
"She had no pain, so it appeared to be a really positive step for her. Since 
she didn't have any problems with either her knee or her hip." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans are entered in a meet at UCLA Saturday and Sunday and Killeen will 
run the 5,000 meters for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be her biggest race so far this season," Elders said. "She ran 10:30 
the first time she ran the 3,000 this season, so she improved her time quite a 
bit. We hope to have the same kind of improvement in the 5,000 meters." 
</P>
<P>
 Killeen says she still is focusing on being in top form for the Big West 
Conference meet May 13-14 at Las Cruces, N.M. "I still have good days and bad 
days when I'm training, but the bad days are getting to be a lot farther 
apart," Killeen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Bid of Excitement auction which benefits the Titan athletic program is 
scheduled Saturday at the University Center. "It runs most of the day with the 
tent sale starting at noon and the other session starting at 6 p.m.," said 
Larry Zucker, executive director of the Titan Athletic Fund. "We raised $87,000 
last year and we hope to raise $100,000 this time." Former UCLA coach John 
Wooden is scheduled to be the keynote speaker . . . The Fullerton baseball team 
is ranked No. 1 in the nation by Baseball America and Collegiate Baseball this 
week after last weekend's two victories over Pacific. Fullerton is 34-8, 11-3 
in the Big West. Fullerton remains in first place in the conference followed by 
Nevada at 9-3. The Titans lead the conference in pitching with a 2.54 
earned-run average. Long Beach State is second with a 3.16 ERA. . . . Pitcher 
Brandi Isgar of San Dimas High School has signed with the Titans to play 
softball. She has a 61-12 high school record with 14 no-hitters and 21 
one-hitters. . . . Two softball doubleheaders involving the Titans have been 
canceled. A doubleheader scheduled Monday against Loyola Marymount was rained 
out and will not be rescheduled. Today's doubleheader against Fresno State has 
been canceled by mutual agreement of the coaches. Fullerton plays next at 1 
p.m. Saturday in a doubleheader against New Mexico State. . . . Kathy Van Wyk, 
an assistant softball coach at Fullerton for nine seasons, Tuesday announced 
her resignation, effective at the end of the current season, to pursue a head 
coaching job. "I'll be looking for another coaching job in the area," she said.

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; KARIYA LEADS CANADA PAST LOWLY AUSTRIA, 
6-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Kariya, the Mighty Ducks' unsigned draft pick, scored three goals in the 
World Hockey Championships on Tuesday as Canada beat Austria, 6-1, at Bolzano, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada is 2-0 in the World Championships; it hasn't won the title since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya -- whose agent, Don Baizley, will meet with Duck General Manager Jack 
Ferreira in Italy next week for more contract talks -- scored on a first-period 
breakaway Tuesday and added two goals in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira and Baizley said it is unlikely they will reach an agreement when 
they meet in Italy. The sides remain millions apart on a multiyear deal but are 
hoping to agree on terms this summer -- probably sometime after the late June 
entry draft -- so Kariya can begin his NHL career this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games Tuesday, Russia defeated Britain, 12-3, and the Czechs defeated 
France, 5-2. * 
</P>
<P>
 A three-year contract agreement with Russian right wing Valeri Karpov, 22, the 
Ducks' 1993 third-round pick, might be done when Ferreira sees agent Jay 
Grossman in Italy. However, the signing will be delayed, partly because Karpov 
isn't at the World Championships.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Radek Bonk, the 18-year-old star with Las Vegas in the International Hockey 
League, led the draft rankings of the NHL Central Scouting Bureau that were 
released Tuesday. Behind him were two junior players -- center Jeff O'Neill of 
Guelph and defenseman Ed Jovanovski of Windsor, both in the Ontario Hockey 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, with the No. 2 pick, are focusing on Bonk and Jovanovski. However, 
the team is being approached about trading the pick. The player selected No. 2 
probably will seek a contract approaching $2 million a year, an amount the 
Ducks are unwilling to give Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finances won't (be the determining factor for) us to trade the pick," 
Ferreira said. "If we decided to trade the pick -- and I've had discussions 
with a couple of teams -- it would be because what's being offered is better 
than what we would be able to pick. . . . I don't think there's a clear-cut guy 
who's No. 1. They're outstanding players, but I don't know if they're great 
players."

TOP-RANKED EL TORO SPIKES DANA HILLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in weeks injury-riddled Dana Hills had its starting lineup 
intact, but the Dolphins were still no match for top-ranked El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers defeated Dana Hills, ranked sixth in Orange County, 15-2, 15-10, 
11-15, 15-4, in a South Coast League boys' volleyball match Tuesday at El Toro 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Mariano had 22 kills and two blocks and setter Todd Steinert had 47 
assists to lead El Toro (11-1, 7-0 in league). Doug Thompson added 10 kills and 
Chris Jacobson added nine kills and two blocks for the Chargers, who only 
stumbled in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hefty and Matt Clem each had two blocks, and the Dolphins (8-4, 4-3) 
tallied eight in the game to post a 15-11 victory. Jeremy Darner, who had a 
team-high 17 kills, and Neil Hewko, who had 12, also had four kills each in 
Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Darner missed four matches because of a blood clot in his arm and wasn't 
medically cleared to play until Tuesday, Dana Hills Coach Oz Simmons said. 
Setter Wes Tsai also returned for the first time after missing a week with the 
flu and Hewko returned after being out with a sprained thumb. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

PREP TENNIS; THIS MATCH NEVER HAD A CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apparently the Garden Grove-Los Alamitos nonleague boys' tennis match just 
wasn't supposed to happen. The first meeting on March 7 was suspended because 
of rain after one round and Tuesday's rescheduled match at Garden Grove never 
got started. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Coach Kevin Starnes and Los Alamitos Coach Mike McCutcheon 
couldn't agree whether to continue the March 7 match or start it over, so they 
decided not to officially play it. With ominous clouds and lightning nearby, 
the teams did play some practice sets, but nothing will be reported to the 
Southern Section office. 
</P>
<P>
 Starnes, whose team trailed the earlier match, 4-2, after one round, wanted to 
start over because two of his players were not with the varsity in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to continue a match when the same players are not playing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starnes also didn't want to jeopardize his No. 4 ranking in Southern Section 
Division II against Los Alamitos, an unranked Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCutcheon had hoped to continue the match in progress at the beginning of 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our league (the Empire) goes by the USTA rules, and they say to continue it 
at the same point," McCutcheon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing a possible conflict arising, Starnes called Bill Clark, the Southern 
Section administrator for tennis, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clark said it was a gray area and that they had no rule for it, so he told us 
to decide it," Starnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 And both coaches decided simply not to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I was the home team, I could have decided to default the match to us, 
but I didn't want to do that," Starnes said. "So we played it for fun, and 
there's no hard feelings either way. I guess you could call this the match that 
wasn't meant to be." DAVE McKIBBEN

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: TOP-RANKED SYLMAR WAS BOTTOMS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sylmar High (17-3, 8-0 in the East Valley League) is the hottest baseball team 
in the region. The top-ranked team in the area has won 17 of 18 games, 
including the last 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar is ranked seventh in the state, according to Cal-Hi Sports, and 20th in 
the country in a recent USA Today poll. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Spartans, a team that lost their first two games to Saugus and 
Alemany, get to the top? 
</P>
<P>
 Eight starters are batting better than .300, and the team is batting .344. The 
team's earned-run average is 2.76. Sylmar has outscored Valley Pac-8 Conference 
opponents, 56-11. And nonleague teams haven't fared much better, 90-68. 
</P>
<P>
 So this has got to be the greatest team in Coach Gary Donatella's seven-year 
history at the school, right? Well, Donatella wouldn't exactly put it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the most surprising team I've ever had," he said. "I thought 
we'd be successful, but not this successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about the top 20 teams in the country, I don't know (what to 
think)," Donatella said. "I thought my 1991 team could play with anybody. But 
this team? There's something about this team. I don't know what it is. 
Resiliency, I guess." EAST VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Poly Pop 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers who relax against the bottom of the Poly lineup might find themselves 
in a jam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Montenegro and Gowdy Martinez, the Parrots' No. 8 and 9 batters, have 
combined for 12 hits, nine runs and five RBIs in the Parrots' last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Montenegro, who had only three hits in his first 19 at-bats, has gone seven 
for 13 in the last four games and brought his average up to .313. Martinez is 
batting .348 and is one of eight players better than .300. FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Smitten by Hart 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Worley's tone was not bitter, but his frustration was evident. His Saugus 
baseball team, the consensus choice to win the league championship, lost to 
rival Hart for the second time this season. The Centurions were embarrassed, 
10-3, as the Indians (14-4) improved to 6-0 in league play and moved two games 
in front in the standings. Saugus (12-5-1, 4-2) allowed 13 hits and committed 
four errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been used to winning all the big games," Worley said. "But I don't 
understand this group. I think they want to beat Hart too much. They press too 
much. And Hart always seems to get a key call, a break here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley decided to start pitcher John Maggiora against Burroughs instead of 
Hart at the outset of the week. Maggiora recorded a no-hitter against 
Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggiora struck out three, walked none and hit one batter. Maggiora, a sidearm 
right-hander, isn't a dominating pitcher but he carries a 0.82 earned-run 
average and has walked only six batters in 34 innings. Saugus is 15-4 in games 
Maggiora started over the past three seasons. MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Who's Hot 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake shortstop Dave Bartlestone started the season as a reserve, but he 
hit so well that Coach Rich Herrera moved Scott Morris into the outfield to put 
Bartlestone into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Bartlestone reward the coach's confidence? How about 10 hits in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just gave him a chance to swing a bat and he proved that he could," 
Herrera said, "and he's been in (the lineup) ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 Bartlestone, who first started two weeks ago during the Camarillo tournament, 
is hitting .440 in his first 25 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Word around the league is: Don't run on Royal right fielder Phil Derryman, who 
might have the strongest arm of any outfielder in the league. Last week, 
Newbury Park held a runner at third on what would have been a routine sacrifice 
fly with most other outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
 Derryman has drawn interest from pro scouts based solely on his arm and size 
-- he is a skinny 6-foot-3 1/2, meaning he could fill out to major-league 
dimensions with the right diet and weight training. Around the Leagues. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Sylmar right-hander Carlos Velazco (7-1), who has pitched five complete 
games and has three saves, has 69 strikeouts in 54 1/3 innings and a 1.03 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sylmar's staff pitched 14 scoreless innings last week against Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poly, which made 72 errors in 23 games last season, has cleaned up its act. 
The Parrots, who have won 10 games in a row and 14 of 15, have made 31 errors 
in 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rio Mesa and Dos Pueblos, who began the week tied for first place in the 
Channel League, will meet on the final day of the season, May 13, at Dos 
Pueblos.

DIGEST: NORTH HOLLYWOOD DIDN'T TAKE WORST FROM BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three top players from the North Hollywood High baseball team were dismissed 
for disciplinary reasons and did not play in two games against Monroe last 
week, Husky Coach Rick Pally said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies (6-10, 0-8 in Valley Pac-8 Conference play) played without their 
top two pitchers and No. 1 batter, who were asked by the coaching staff to turn 
in their uniforms April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior left-hander Mike Delano (1-2, 2.59 earned-run average) and senior 
right-hander Patrick Fields (2-2, 2.33 ERA), along with slugger senior Robert 
Talamantes (.429), were suspended from the team after coaches "unanimously" 
decided that the trio's unsportsmanlike behavior was disruptive to the team in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we looked at it, we're 0-8 and it couldn't get any worse," Pally 
said. "We had to send a message that no person is bigger than this program." 
</P>
<P>
 Delano, who has 39 strikeouts in 24 1/3 innings, met with the coaching staff 
on Monday and Tuesday, acknowledged his disruptive behavior, asked that he be 
allowed to clean up his act and return to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure where I stand," Delano said Tuesday. "We had some problems and 
most of them were my fault. We all got removed for the same reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Delano is the only player to express an interest in returning. His fate will 
be determined by the end of the week, Pally said. PAIGE A. LEECH

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; HAUNTED BY TWIN CRISES OF LOVE AND FAITH; MESHUGAH BY 
ISAAC BASHEVIS SINGER TRANSLATED BY THE AUTHOR AND NILI WACHTEL; FARRAR STRAUS 
GIROUX $22, 240 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I believed that God is a novelist who writes about what He pleases," muses 
Isaac Bashevis Singer in "Meshugah," "and the whole world has to read Him, 
trying to find out what He means." 
</P>
<P>
 "Meshugah" is the third of Singer's novels to be published since his death in 
1991, but the fact that the author is dead is somehow fitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The characters in Singer's books and stories are forever happening upon men 
and women who appear to return from the grave, and the beloved Singer can do no 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has anyone ever written a novel about a person like me," writes Singer in 
"Meshugah," as if letting us in on a joke, "about loves and entanglements like 
mine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Set in New York, Paris and Tel Aviv in the early '50s, "Meshugah" focuses on 
the adventures of a Yiddish writer called Aaron Greidinger, a literary alter 
ego who is made to stand in for Singer in acting out the crisis of love and 
faith that sends him into the arms of various worshipful but damaged women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had lived through two world wars, my entire family had perished, women with 
whom I had been close had been reduced to clumps of ashes," Aaron says. "The 
people I wrote about were all dead. I had become a fossil of a long-extinct 
epoch. When my publisher introduced me at a literary party, the younger guests 
asked, 'You are still alive?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Aaron Greidinger discovers that a certain dark passion burns hot in the 
hearts and souls of the Holocaust survivors with which he finds himself, a 
circle of intimacy and betrayal that includes his admiring readers, his ardent 
lovers, his benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the tortured who remain tortured, but they still seek redemption in 
each other's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent theme of "Meshugah" -- the title is the Yiddish word for crazy -- 
is a love triangle, but new and surprising angles come into view on every page, 
and every lover's embrace is literally haunted by history. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron is drawn to Miriam Zalkind, a beautiful young woman who managed to 
survive the very worst excesses of the Holocaust by the most dubious possible 
means. But Miriam also serves as a surrogate wife, daughter and lover to Max 
Aberdam, a charming old swindler who suckers orphans and widows into entrusting 
him with their reparation money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live on pills and faith," declares Max, "not in God but in my own crazy 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Miriam is not the only woman who beckons Aaron Greidinger, and as he careens 
from bed to bed, he learns ever more horrifying details about Miriam's wartime 
experiences. But he cannot bring himself to renounce her love even as he is 
physically sickened by what he discovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not until the very last pages of "Meshugah" do we finally find out how Aaron 
responds to Miriam's desperate overtures to marry her and give her a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that remained for us to do was to snatch a few moments of pleasure before 
we collided one with the other and, like the bubbles we were, burst," Aaron 
remarks of Miriam and himself. "Both Miriam and I could neither be together nor 
stay apart. We did not deny God nor could we serve Him." 
</P>
<P>
 At moments, "Meshugah" is a work of philosophical speculation dressed up as 
bedroom farce and black comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Miriam has a husband, too, and he shows up at an awkward 
moment with a gun in his hand. When Aaron seeks refuge in the bathroom of her 
apartment, his impulse is to search for a razor -- and shave himself so he will 
look presentable to his would-be murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 And Aaron manages to engage the maniacal husband in theological discourse at 
the moment of greatest peril. 
</P>
<P>
 "God is evil?" Miriam's husband demands of Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least to animals and men," replies Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you live with this sort of faith?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't, really." 
</P>
<P>
 "Meshugah," like much of Singer's work, was first published in serialized form 
in the Yiddish press, and the author worked with Nili Wachtel on the English 
translation in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Meshugah" does not quite achieve the sublime heights of Singer's 
greatest books -- "The Slave," for example, or "Satan in Goray" -- it's still 
vintage stuff, and somehow less stylized and more self-revelatory than much of 
Singer's fiction. Even if the ultimate meaning of God's novel is obscure, 
Singer is willing to make it clear what he means. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, where were the dead?" says Aaron Greidinger as he strolls through the 
empty streets of a Jewish neighborhood on the eve of the Jewish New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where were their loves, their pains, their hopes, their illusions? Were they 
all gone forever? Or was there an archive somewhere in the universe where they 
were all recorded and remembered?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, indeed, there is such an archive, we realize as we read "Meshugah," and 
it almost seems that Isaac Bashevis Singer is still at work there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meshugah," then, is one more addition to the archive, a worthy new chapter in 
the divine novel of which Singer continues to be the chief scrivener.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; RECYCLED JUGS TO MAKE DEBUT AS TRASH 
BINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 If you recycle a can or toss a candy wrapper at this week's Conejo Valley Days 
festival, sneak a peek at Thousand Oaks' latest pet: light blue trash bins made 
entirely from recycled milk jugs. 
</P>
<P>
 More durable than concrete, the so-called "plastic lumber" has been fashioned 
into 40 dual-compartment bins for use throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the bins, which will be used to collect both ordinary trash and 
recyclables, will make their debut at the Conejo Valley Days carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 After the festival, the bins will be distributed throughout the city. City 
employees will be in the Conejo Valley Days children's tent all weekend to ask 
residents where the bins should be placed. 
</P>
<P>
 The resilient plastic lumber will also be used in the Civic Arts Plaza, 
replacing the low concrete slabs that traditionally serve as barriers in front 
of each parking spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The plastic costs slightly more than concrete -- about $48 per parking stop, 
whereas concrete would run $40 to $44, said Civic Arts Plaza Project Manager Ed 
Johnduff. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plastic "is a much better product in the long run," Recycling 
Coordinator Grahame Watts said. "We have not seen any deterioration with the 
plastic lumber." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike concrete, the plastic lumber does not chip or crumble. And graffiti 
washes easily off the parking stops, Watts said. STEPHANIE SIMON

OXNARD COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER TIGHTENING SMOKING ORDINANCE; HEALTH: OFFICIALS 
AGREE TO REVIEW PORTIONS OF THE LAW, CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE ONE OF THE MOST 
LENIENT IN THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day when Ventura's strict new smoking law went into effect, elected 
officials in Oxnard reluctantly decided to take a closer look at banning 
smoking in restaurants and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also will consider exempting small businesses from its ordinance 
when the city staff returns later this year with options for tightening the 
city's existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision to review portions of the law came after two hours of 
discussion from health officials about the dangers of secondhand smoke and 
debate among council members regarding government interference in the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Michael A. Plisky and Bedford Pinkard clearly opposed 
tampering at all with the law, which is considered by many to be one of the 
most lenient smoking ordinances in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Manuel M. Lopez and Councilman Thomas E. Holden both said that 
recent evidence linking secondhand smoke to heart and lung disease and other 
ailments warranted another look. Councilman Andres Herrera was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question in my mind that smoking is unhealthy," said Holden, a 
former smoker. "The problem with cigarette smoke is it affects people other 
than myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The current law allows smoking in restaurants -- unlike ordinances adopted 
within the past eight months by Ventura County and the cities of Thousand Oaks, 
Ventura, Moorpark, Camarillo and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard ordinance, written six years ago, also lets employers decide 
whether to allow smoking in their offices or workplaces. None of the other 
recently tightened ordinances allow smoking in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pinkard and Plisky both said that businesses are already overly encumbered 
by government regulation, be it local, state or federal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to parents -- not government -- to take care of the children," Plisky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he would rather see the resources that would be spent on stricter 
smoking regulations used instead to curb "dope fiends" and "welfare freaks who 
have babies just to get (public) money." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkard said: "It's not my fear that I'm going to die from secondhand smoke. 
It's my fear that I'll die from some drunken driver." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council voted to restudy only certain portions of the law, a 
dozen or more speakers urged the council to adopt regulations at least as 
strict as the other five cities and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a public health problem," said James Orlowski, an allergist who is 
co-chairman of the Smoking Action Coalition of Oxnard. "When you're smoking 
around other people, it basically isn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seeing patients who are getting sick because of the smoke of others," 
Orlowski said. "It's hard to understand how this is still going on in this day 
and age." 
</P>
<P>
 Nan Waltman, an educator for Ventura County Public Health, said it is the 
council's duty to protect the residents of Oxnard from tobacco smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the highest category of cancer-causing agents -- like radon and 
asbestos," she said. "There is no safe place for it in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 But Plisky discounted evidence presented by smoking-ban advocates that 
suggests exposure to secondhand smoke can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is not conclusive and I will be hard-pressed to go along with 
their demands," Plisky said in an interview prior to Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of this stuff comes about because we've got too many dime-a-dozen Ph.D.s 
who have to justify their grants," he said. "As long as (Oxnard employers) have 
a choice, I think (the council) has done a sufficient job." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by Ventura County Public Health conducted in 1992 concluded that only 
8% of diners request seats in a smoking section of a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the survey found, only 4% of restaurateurs reported a drop in 
business due to smoking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the president of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce said before the 
council meeting that Oxnard merchants are opposed to regulating smoking in 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we have the right to tell a business owner what he can do to 
run his business," said Pat Plew, owner of the Kwik Kopy printing shop. "There 
are myriads of other places you can go to eat that are nonsmoking. It's time we 
started to get the government off our back -- at all levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Vega, the community services official who will prepare the options for 
revising the law, said that despite receiving an average of one complaint a day 
about violations to the current smoking law, no citations have ever been 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have given quite a few warnings," he told the council.

HOLYFIELD IS STOPPED BY A HEART CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four days after losing the heavyweight boxing title for a second time, Evander 
Holyfield announced his retirement Tuesday, failed by the one part of his body 
no one had ever questioned -- his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying it was a miracle that Holyfield, 31, could continue fighting through 
his 12-round loss to Michael Moorer last Friday, Holyfield's personal 
physician, Ronald Stephens, said post-fight examinations in Las Vegas and 
Atlanta showed Holyfield is suffering from a congenital heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Described as a non-compliant left ventricle, what doctors call a "stiff 
heart," Holyfield's heart is unable to expand properly during extreme exertion, 
causing severe exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Holyfield fought this fight in heart failure," said Stephens, who added 
that he did not believe Holyfield's life had been in jeopardy during the bout 
and said his condition is under control. "I don't know anybody else in the 
world who could have possibly done this." 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield entered a Las Vegas hospital immediately after losing to Moorer to 
be treated for a shoulder injury and dehydration. As the doctors treated the 
dehydration, they realized his heart was having trouble handling fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield later was flown to Atlanta's Crawford Long Hospital, where Stephens 
consulted with cardiologists, who diagnosed the problem late Monday night. 
Stephens advised Holyfield to retire immediately and Holyfield complied. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, who said that before learning the diagnosis, he had been hoping for 
a rematch with Moorer, said the condition explains the fatigue he had 
experienced for approximately a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although last week he had publicly declared a desire to fight until 1996 -- 
when, he figured, Mike Tyson would be out of prison and back in the ring and 
they could have the fight they missed when Tyson was convicted of rape -- 
Holyfield (30-2) said Tuesday he never wavered about retiring once his 
condition was explained to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of had a feeling that I would get a rematch with (Moorer) and beat 
him," Holyfield said at a news conference at the Atlanta Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 "But once I was told it wouldn't be good health-wise, I realized that I had to 
let that go. I was always praying about when should I step down, anyway. . . . 
I often asked myself what I was fighting for, and it was the thrills. It was 
something I loved doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love life a little bit more than just going out into the ring just 
swinging." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said Holyfield had shown only one previous indication of a problem. In 
1991, in routine examinations before he beat George Foreman, Holyfield had an 
abnormal result on an electrocardiogram. But follow-up tests, including a heart 
catheterization, revealed no heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had noticed since the Foreman fight that (Holyfield) was a little slower 
and doing a little less punching," said his manager, Shelly Finkel. "Each fight 
after that seemed even slower (with) even less punches. Now there's a 
reasonable explanation for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens emphasized the heart problem was not caused by Friday night's fight 
and Holyfield should lead a normal life away from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost a blessing in disguise," said Dan Duva, Holyfield's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 Duva says Holyfield retires having earned $102 million in purses and with the 
knowledge that he brought dignity and pride to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed you don't have to be a bad guy, you don't have to be a loudmouth, 
you don't have to be a braggart," Duva said. "You could be a decent, 
hard-working human being and still succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Duva said he hopes Holyfield, one of the fiercest competitors in sports, 
doesn't leave boxing feeling unfulfilled because he did not fight Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's accomplished everything he ever set out to accomplish and more," Duva 
said. "Everybody said he couldn't beat the big men, then he beat George Foreman 
and Larry Holmes. Then they said, well, he can't beat a young, big, strong 
fighter, and he beat Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fought everybody in his era. The only one he didn't fight was Mike Tyson 
and that wasn't his fault. He's accomplished more than anybody ever dreamed 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, who took the World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation 
titles that Holyfield had won from Bowe last November, expressed concern for 
Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel for him," Moorer said. "I'm glad nothing serious happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield -- the former light-heavyweight champion who first won the 
heavyweight title when he knocked out Buster Douglas in 1990, lost it to Bowe 
in 1992, then regained it in a rematch with Bowe in 1993 -- said he can leave 
boxing comfortably and without rancor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have proven to everybody that I was a champion, so I don't feel that I 
really owe anything else in boxing any more," he said. "I hope I've touched a 
lot of people's hearts and souls. Now I just see myself leaving boxing. I hope 
that I left boxing in the right spirit, that everybody will have something to 
be happy about."

MIKE PENNER: REALLY BAD IS GOOD ENOUGH IN THIS DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In British soccer, they call it the second division, the place where the 
weakest clubs are banished, a sort of purgatory for those teams not quite good 
enough to compete with the elite but not quite bad enough to disband 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In American baseball, they call it the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 They are virtually one and the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, 
difference: 
</P>
<P>
 In British soccer, no one from the second division is eligible for the 
postseason championship tournament. The best a team can hope to do is play well 
enough this year to earn admittance into the first division next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so in the American League West, and this frightens a good many people. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone in the American League West will participate in this year's major 
league baseball playoffs. It doesn't matter how badly the Angels, the 
Athletics, the Mariners and the Rangers play. It doesn't matter how many games 
they lose. 
</P>
<P>
 80? 
</P>
<P>
 90? 
</P>
<P>
 100? 
</P>
<P>
 Go, teams, go. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever loses the least gets the chance to lose a few more come October. 
Whoever loses the least will be christened an American League semifinalist, 
granted the same status as, say, the Blue Jays, White Sox and Yankees. It's in 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the pole position in the American League West belongs to the 
Angels, on pace to lose 94 games this season. That nudges them ahead of 
Seattle, which is on pace to lose 99 games this season, and Oakland, on pace to 
lose 105, and Texas, on pace to lose 111. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't playing baseball in the American League West -- that's been 
obvious since opening day -- they're playing golf. Hacker golf. Shoot a 94, 
make the cut. Shoot a 94, take some money from the other three stiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 What's your handicap? 
</P>
<P>
 In the American League West, nobody has to ask, because everybody already 
knows. 
</P>
<P>
 This is life inside baseball's Bermuda Triangle: 
</P>
<P>
 The other night in New York, the Angels are smoked by the Yankees, 11-1. Just 
pounded. Angel starter Mark Leiter serves up seven runs in three innings, 
including a grand slam to the Yankees' backup catcher. Angel reliever Bill 
Sampen gets three outs and lets four more runs in. Three Angel fielders commit 
errors. It was the low point of a 3-5 East Coast trip for the Angels, their 
fourth loss in a row, dropping their season record to 8-12. 
</P>
<P>
 And how does Buck Rodgers, the Angel manager, respond? 
</P>
<P>
 By emptying the bat rack and slinging lumber, three by three, onto the field? 
</P>
<P>
 By dismantling the dugout water cooler? 
</P>
<P>
 By resurfacing the clubhouse floor with what was supposed to be the postgame 
spread? 
</P>
<P>
 No, Rodgers sits in his office and chats calmly with sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what," he tells them, "I sure feel better about our club now 
than at any point I ever did last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course he does. Last year, an 8-12 pace, a .400 winning percentage, would 
have put the Angels 29 games behind first-place Chicago and 19 behind 
third-place Kansas City over the course of an entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Chicago and Kansas City play in the American League Central. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, 8-12 on the last Tuesday morning of April leads the American League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 Realignment is to blame for this. Realignment and geography. Combined, they 
conspired to take baseball's four existing divisions, chop them up and turn 
them into five divisions and one subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the fault of the western United States that none of its American 
League teams can hit, catch or throw a baseball in 1994. It just worked out 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the A's won three consecutive World Series titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the Angels won three division championships in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the Rangers and the Mariners . . . well . . . all right, the 
everything-comes-around argument had to end somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Many preseason publications predicted that the Mariners would finish first in 
the American League West, on the supposition that somebody had to. But this 
overlooked a Seattle bullpen led by one Bobby Ayala, who now leads Seattle 
relief pitchers with one save. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the club, Bobby. Billy Taylor, a 32-year-old rookie, also leads the 
Oakland bullpen with one save. (Dennis Eckersley has blown all three of his 
save opportunities.) Tom Henke has two saves for Texas. Joe Grahe, Angel closer 
by default, has four saves -- or as many as the rest of the division combined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers' chances have been dashed by moving into a new ballpark, which has 
been named, rather colorfully, The Ballpark, while forgetting to bring The 
Pitching Staff with them. Ace starter Kevin Brown is 0-4 with an ERA near 11. 
The team ERA is approaching seven. And those new red uniforms complete the look 
-- recalling the Rangers' past incarnation as the Washington Senators, the Dick 
Bosman years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oakland, the deterioration has been sad to watch. Three seasons ago, it was 
McGwire and Canseco; now it's Berroa and Noboa. Stan Javier, who sat the bench 
for the Angels, now bats leadoff for the A's. You look at a box score today and 
you scratch your head. Brumley, Brosius, Bordick. Who are these guys? And when 
does Sandy Alderson get back from sabbatical? 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, first place is left to the Angels, 9-12 as they return home tonight, 
with $27 million tied up in two disabled starting pitchers -- Mark Langston and 
Joe Magrane -- along with two rookies platooning at catcher and another, Brian 
Anderson, anchoring the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you get to be in a division like that?" Yankees outfielder Luis 
Polonia wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Polonia was an Angel until last winter, so he shouldn't have to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 All he had to do was re-sign.

A HISTORY OF TICKET TROUBLE; ROSE BOWL: MAZZONE WAS ACCUSED OF BUYING PLAYERS' 
TICKETS IN 1978. UCLA'S YOUNG REGRETS RECENT DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND and RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angelo Mazzone III, the former UCLA athletic official who was allowed to buy 
4,000 Rose Bowl tickets from the school, was accused by football players in 
1978 of buying complimentary tickets from them at up to three times face value. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pacific 10 Conference investigation, which included interviews with football 
and basketball players, and UCLA officials, found there was an inappropriate 
use of the tickets. But neither Mazzone nor the school was charged with 
violating conference rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, who agreed to talk only on the condition their names not be used, 
said Mazzone had been brokering tickets since 1973, which would have been a 
violation of NCAA rules. At the time, Mazzone categorically denied ever 
purchasing players' tickets, as did then-UCLA Athletic Director J.D. Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the players said they were paid in cash in sealed envelopes. "Angelo 
was in charge of the whole operation," one former player said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone did not return calls from The Times on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young, meanwhile, said Tuesday he regrets approving 
the controversial sale of the 4,000 Rose Bowl tickets to Mazzone, who resigned 
as associate athletic director in 1982. The sale was linked to a $100,000, 
tax-deductible donation Mazzone made to the school for athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said angry reaction from UCLA alumni who were unable to buy extra 
tickets after the school said none were available has prompted him to rethink 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were to do this all over again . . . I would have made a different 
decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local tickets brokers said Tuesday that UCLA could have generated a lot more 
than $100,000 for athletic scholarships if it had sold the 4,000 Rose Bowl 
tickets to the highest bidder, rather than selling them to a university 
booster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anything wrong with a school helping out their athletic 
department, but they could have made $200,000 more from me," said Jerry 
Adelman, owner of Murray's Tickets, one of Los Angeles' oldest and largest 
ticket agencies. He paid $400 for some of the 2,000 tickets the agency handled 
and had to turn away customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Ross, the owner of Front Row Center ticket agency in Westwood, said he 
also would have liked to bid on tickets to the Rose Bowl, which featured a 
matchup between UCLA and Wisconsin. Tickets to the game became hot commodities 
and sold for hundreds of dollars more than face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said his office was deluged with calls from desperate tour operators who 
didn't have enough tickets for Wisconsin fans.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did what everyone else did, which was to scratch and claw for every 
individual ticket we were fortunate enough to buy," Ross said. "If UCLA is 
going to sell large blocks of tickets to sporting events, they should throw it 
open to everybody, the general public included." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said Tuesday he was told the $46 tickets ended up in the hands of 
Wisconsin fans who bought Rose Bowl tour packages. It's unknown how much 
Mazzone's tickets eventually cost fans, but the day before the game, scalpers 
were getting $450 to more than $1,000 from Wisconsin fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said UCLA never considered offering the 4,000 tickets for sale to ticket 
brokers but that Mazzone was eligible to buy tickets under an agreement between 
the Pac-10 and Big Ten conferences and the nonprofit Tournament of Roses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Joseph D. Mandel, UCLA vice chancellor for legal affairs, said the 
agreement allows UCLA to sell Rose Bowl tickets to students, alumni, donors and 
others connected to the university, but required the school to seek approval 
for a public sale to anyone outside the university community. 
</P>
<P>
 Young reiterated that UCLA officials wanted to sell a large block of tickets 
because they feared in early December having to pay for unsold tickets. Last 
year, the University of Washington ended up having to pay for about $240,000 in 
unsold tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 But ticket brokers and travel agents in Los Angeles and Wisconsin said that by 
early December the prospect of a desirable matchup between UCLA and Wisconsin 
made it highly unlikely tickets would go begging. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket agencies began placing their first ads in The Times seeking Rose Bowl 
tickets on Nov. 21. Wisconsin tour operators began trying to line up Rose Bowl 
tickets for their travel packages in late November. The Badgers didn't clinch 
the Rose Bowl berth until Dec. 4 with a victory over Michigan State in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazzone reportedly sold the tickets through the Al Brooks Theatre Ticket 
Agency, but it is unclear how much money he received. Jay Brooks, owner of 
Brooks Tickets, has declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Funjet Vacations, a Milwaukee tour operator, bought about 3,000 travel 
packages from Brooks' agency that included Rose Bowl tickets, hotel 
accommodations and transportation for $600 to $700 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Wade, Funjet's vice president of marketing, said Tuesday that he did not 
record the exact locations of the Rose Bowl tickets, so there is no way now to 
tell if they came from Mazzone. He estimated the cost of the Rose Bowl tickets 
at about $150 each. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by Wisconsin Atty. Gen. James Doyle indicated that 2,788 
Wisconsin fans paid scalpers' prices for tickets, while 1,000 were stranded 
with no tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Travgo Travel, a Madison, Wisc., travel agency, had to pay 
$121,000 more than anticipated for 720 scalped tickets in the days before the 
game, owner Curt Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Mueller feel about a UCLA booster receiving 4,000 at face value when 
he and his clients were forced to pay a lot more to brokers and scalpers? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's highly suspect," Mueller said. "Suppose the bowl game was in 
Wisconsin. How would those people out there feel if they brought their families 
to Madison, Wisconsin, and were treated that shabbily?"

MIKE DOWNEY: PITINO IS PUT IN HIS PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Pitino will not be the Lakers' coach and I have never been more pleased. 
Pitino is a preening little prima donna and a Napoleonic know-it-all who has 
never won anything, but for some egocentric reason thinks he is Supercoach. The 
only thing the Lakers could have counted on with Pitino as coach is that he 
would have hogged credit for the victories and passed blame for the defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 I only hope Pitino's announcement that he is staying at Kentucky does not put 
Laker-maker Jerry West in much of a bind. My advice would be, find a good 
lawyer who can get Phil Jackson out of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 As things stand, West must find somebody to run the Lakers, literally, because 
owner Jerry Buss wants this team to run, run, run. None of this holding the 
opponent to 70 points the way the New York Knicks do. The reason Jerry Buss 
brought Magic Johnson back is because Jerry Buss wants to play Magic Johnson 
basketball. Fast and loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it worked for one week. Then Johnson discovered he was the engineer in a 
train wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 West will find a coach. Experience is preferred, but not required. Very few of 
the Laker coaching appointees, from Pat Riley to Mike Dunleavy to Randy Pfund, 
had any pedigree as a pro head coach. Riley and Pfund virtually got their 
promotions by default. And the temp, Magic Johnson, was presented from one 
Jerry to the other Jerry as a done deal, even though Johnson wanted to be a 
coach about as much as he wanted to be a taxidermist. 
</P>
<P>
 All we found out for sure in that last Laker month was that Pfund did a better 
job than anyone seems willing to acknowledge. That 10-game losing streak to end 
the season demonstrated that this was a club of second-rate talent and 
outrageous nonchalance that even Magic couldn't motivate. You couldn't light a 
fire under Elden Campbell with a can of Sterno. People have to stop expecting 
Campbell to play up to his potential, because he already has. 
</P>
<P>
 There are quick cures around, notably Horace Grant and Danny Manning. With 
either one, the Lakers vault back into playoff contention, and I mean 
overnight. But everyone's after those two. I doubt the Lakers will end up with 
either. Everyone's after Horace because everyone needs help with a capital H. 
And bet you anything Manning re-ups with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Dominique Wilkins, the man is chicken soup; he couldn't hurt. He would 
make the Lakers more fun to follow. Long term, OK, Wilkins solves nothing, but 
who cares about long term? Let's win now. The Western Conference is a 
man-eater. All I know is the Lakers with Wilkins would be better than the 
Lakers without Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 'Nique has to make up his mind -- need or greed. He isn't worth what he is 
demanding from the Clippers, but the man understandably has the Clipper people 
over a barrel. What he must decide is whether he wants to win a championship 
before he's done or whether he wants to be seriously rich. He cannot win a 
championship with the Clippers in this lifetime. They can outbid most clubs, 
but how much money does Wilkins need? He should sign with the Knicks for 10 
bucks a night. 
</P>
<P>
 And, speaking of the Knicks, they will be in the finals this season against 
the Phoenix Suns. Just so you know. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never been so sure of anything as I am that the Knicks will be the 
champions of the Eastern Conference. They have everything it takes. They play 
serious, almost manic defense. They have a go-to guy. They have a coach who 
keeps them on edge by not putting up with any guff. They have John Starks 
coming back. They go nine-deep, maybe 10. Atlanta is strong and has the 
home-court edge, but this is New York's year. 
</P>
<P>
 To win it all? I'm not sure. A voice inside my head keeps saying Phoenix, 
although, as I have pointed out many times, the next time Phoenix wins anything 
will be the first. Arizona people go boo-hoo whenever someone suggests that 
their Suns won't win the championship, but that's because they never do, in 
case you people still haven't noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this time, though. I know other people are fixating on Seattle, with 
nods toward Houston and San Antonio as the teams from that conference to watch. 
Not me. I thought the Suns might have seen their day come and go when Charles 
Barkley was suffering back spasms and mentioning retirement, but suddenly 
Barkley seems primed to make a run at one championship before he leaves us. 
Kevin Johnson, Dan Majerle, A.C. Green, Cedric Ceballos, hey, I like this team 
a ton. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how I view the playoffs: 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando will eliminate Indiana, but that will be it for Shaquille O'Neal, who 
might be more famous than any man alive who has never won a thing. I like 
Chicago over Cleveland, shakily, and Atlanta over Miami, handily, and New York 
over New Jersey, no sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some think otherwise, but I look at the Western first round as four 
no-brainers. Seattle, Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio. The only one of the three 
others that has a chance, in my mind, to keep Phoenix from reaching the final 
is Seattle. But something tells me when the big games are on the line, Phoenix 
will have somebody to go to, Seattle won't. 
</P>
<P>
 Knicks vs. the Suns? It could go either way. I guess I'll go with the Knicks, 
mostly because their coach is no longer Rick Pitino.

BOOM OR BUST?; SUPERSONICS POSSESS THE NBA'S BEST RECORD, BUT NOT THE RESPECT A 
TOP TEAM CAN EXPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere between Los Angeles and Anchorage, the greatest team in the history 
of the 1993-94 NBA regular season awaits its reward. 
</P>
<P>
 And waits . . . and waits . . . and waits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics have the best record, best finish (26-5), best point 
differential (nine a game, two more than the No. 2 Knicks), not to mention the 
most crowd-pleasing style. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, few crowds get to see them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a crowning indignity, NBC scratched the SuperSonics' late-season game with 
the Houston Rockets that matched the teams with the two best records and showed 
Phoenix-San Antonio, which featured the larger personalities of David Robinson 
and Charles Barkley. Barkley, demonstrating the candor stardom demands, called 
sportswriters a vulgar name on the air afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics have only Shawn Kemp, who barely averages 18 points and 
doesn't bite the heads off chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see their problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly feel that sometimes we are treated like the rebels from South 
Alaska," Coach George Karl says. "Why, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fun to watch. I think we play the right way. We might trash talk a 
little bit too much and we kind of get goofy every once in a while, but I think 
we play a brand of basketball that fans and players like to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Says center Michael Cage: "Last year we won 55 games. This year we come back 
and we kick butt the whole . . . year . . . long. Someone told us (NBC 
commentator) Bill Walton said that we wouldn't beat Phoenix. I'm going, 'My 
God, we got the best record in the NBA, the best home record, the best road 
record, what does it take to make you start giving us some slack?' All of a 
sudden people look up and say, 'Damn, Seattle's got 63 wins?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Every franchise needs a longshot, but the SuperSonics have outdone themselves. 
One of their All-Stars, Kemp, didn't play college ball and joined the league at 
19. 
</P>
<P>
 Their other All-Star, Gary Payton, was a trash-talking showboat with so little 
respect, they offered him to Dallas for Derek Harper two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Their coach, Karl, had fled the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Legitimacy means something to anyone who has been denied it, which might 
explain why the SuperSonics seem to collect insults and store them close to 
their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, questions abound: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will their trapping defense work as well in the slow-down playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How about their shaky outside shooting? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Good teams are supposed to have a go-to guy, so where's theirs? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Who cares what you do in the regular season anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the SuperSonics have already won. Five years ago, they were no one, 
headed nowhere. Now they are on top. 
</P>
<P>
 They began the '90s a carved-in-stone .500 team, roiling in frustration at 
their inability to repeat their '87 drive to the Western finals. 
</P>
<P>
 They might not have been more divided than any team -- guard Nate McMillan 
insists they were closer than they are now -- but they certainly had more 
colorful fights. Once, the wives of Dale Ellis and Alton Lister rumbled. 
Another time, Ellis punched Xavier McDaniel, who was holding one of his 
children and had to put the tyke down before he could retaliate, perhaps 
explaining why Ellis is alive today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis had problems with DUIs, McDaniel with his knees, so a combined 40 points 
a night had to be traded. Go-for-it SuperSonic President Bob Whitsitt even 
traded for Benoit Benjamin on the theory, since discredited, that all they 
lacked was a center. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever they did, the SuperSonics stayed .500. 
</P>
<P>
 They were 41-41 in Bernie Bickerstaff's last season. 
</P>
<P>
 They were 41-41 in K.C. Jones' first season. 
</P>
<P>
 They were 18-18 when Whitsitt pulled the plug on Jones the next season. 
</P>
<P>
 They were 2-2 under interim Coach Bob Kloppenburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Karl. 
</P>
<P>
 The enfant terrible of his profession, he had been an NBA coach at 33 and left 
the league at 37 after impressive, combustible stints with Cleveland and Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 He was serving his penance in Madrid when Whitsitt, sensing that recycling 
another nice guy wouldn't do, flew over to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he wasn't in the group of guys that you read about and hear about all 
the time," Whitsitt says. "But for whatever reason, George made a lot of sense 
to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured he was a very talented guy. He'd had some success very, very young. 
He showed me a lot by working hard and doing a great job and winning a 
championship in Europe and continuing to be a head coach after he pretty much 
got booted out of the NBA and sort of blackballed around the league. . . . The 
passion was still there." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as if Karl took the job, gestured hypnotically and everything 
changed. But it was close. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl wanted to press and run. The SuperSonics, in no shape to run after having 
walked it up in Jones' half-court power game, lost three of four. 
</P>
<P>
 The players waited to see if their new coach would grow fangs like a werewolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, I thought we had a wacko," McMillan said. "He came in with a 
reputation of a guy who was a little bit on the crazy side -- a yeller, a 
screamer, sort of a wacko-type guy. That's what I had heard of him. Watching 
him when he was at Golden State my first year here, that's all I thought of 
him. He did the same things he does here -- knocking on the scorer's table, 
grabbing his head, spinning around." 
</P>
<P>
 It just might have been a lunatic they were looking for, even a reformed one. 
The SuperSonics picked up the system and finished 26-12. 
</P>
<P>
 They went 55-27 last season and 63-19 in this one, making Karl 145-61. 
</P>
<P>
 They were entertaining too. In a slow-down era, the SuperSonics combined a 
tenacious defense that now ranks No. 5 in the NBA with a fast-paced offense 
that also ranks fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the era of the young and restless, Karl divides playing time among nine 
players. Kemp, the leading scorer, averages 12.5 shots. Nine players averaged 
more than 20 minutes. When Kendall Gill arrived, he told his old Illinois 
teammate, Nick Anderson of Orlando, he was sorry he had left Charlotte.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Anderson: "Kendall isn't a 30-minute player." 
</P>
<P>
 In a better world, players would understand, as Karl's Tar Heel teammates 
understood when Dean Smith wheeled three units in and out at North Carolina.  
</P>
<P>
 "A little different?" Cage says, laughing. "That's definitely putting it 
mildly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a certain kind of player to deal with it. Most players want to play 
big minutes, they want to get a lot of shots. In this system, it just doesn't 
happen. Everyone has to make a sacrifice, from No. 1 to No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something a player can compromise with. I don't know if he ever really 
can say it's comfortable because it changes all the time. Most people like to 
stay out there and get a feel for the game, but we've learned to play within 
that system. And as you can see, when it works, it works beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Karl: "At the beginning of the year, you kind of set some goals with 
them. And you emphasize to them, please give me the whole season to get to 
those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Vincent Askew -- the first four weeks of the season he was the kind 
of guy who gets left out a little bit. And I know it was bothering him and he 
got to the point where he got real frustrated with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Vince, give me some time. Give me a season to help you.' He hung in 
there with us and right now he's probably in our top four guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the way we play, you can play 40 minutes. . . . I don't want to 
play a style of game where 10% of the time, I'll have one or two guys coasting 
or maybe even more. Old Celtic style was OK, 'Let Bird do it this time, I'll 
take my little three-minute break. OK, let Parish have it now,' and Bird kind 
of had his break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to coach that game. We want to bring intensity and energy and attitude 
into as many possessions of the game as possible. And to do that, it takes 
energy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Energy, they've got. 
</P>
<P>
 Depth, they've got. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitsitt got Detlef Schrempf out of Indiana, but the SuperSonics had a loaded 
deck. Schrempf, about to become a free agent, had gone to college in Seattle 
and was building a home there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitsitt also landed Gill with the entire league bidding for him, also 
acquiring the right to switch No. 1 picks with Charlotte, which then fell into 
the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are more combinations than you can count. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Sam Perkins and Cage play forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, a forward, plays center. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan and Askew play guard or forward. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Karl has five guards, five forwards and three centers without using 
a player who couldn't start elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Attitude, they've got, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked away in their corner of the country, they glow with the holy fire of 
undiscovered artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell me why the Sonics get treated so bad by the national media," Karl says, 
sitting by a hotel swimming pool in Marina del Rey. "Bill Walton just kicked 
our butts: 'Seattle could lose to anybody any time. They could lose the rest of 
their games.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he says we don't ever win a big game on the road. We've got the best 
road record in the league!" 
</P>
<P>
 A woman walks up wearing one of those hotel bathrobes, looking for a towel. 
</P>
<P>
 She sees Karl, dressed in T-shirt and shorts with his baseball cap turned 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have anything to do with this?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been that kind of year, or life, or franchise. But their time is 
coming.

TWO PADRES ACCUSED IN CRIME SWEEP; BASEBALL: SCOTT SANDERS AND DEREK BELL ARE 
CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANOR OF PATRONIZING A PROSTITUTE IN NEW YORK CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two San Diego Padre players were arrested Tuesday for allegedly propositioning 
undercover policewomen during an anti-prostitution sweep on a Manhattan street 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Scott Sanders and outfielder Derek Bell were arrested about 2 a.m. EDT 
on a misdemeanor charge of patronizing a prostitute.The arrests came 18 hours 
before they were due at Shea Stadium to play the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 The two pleaded innocent Tuesday evening to soliciting a prostitute. They 
turned down a deal in which they would have pleaded guilty to a reduced charge 
of disorderly conduct, do one day of community service, spend a day in a health 
seminar and pay $45 in fees and fines. 
</P>
<P>
 They were released on their own recognizance and are due back in court June 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ballclub is investigating the situation to see what all is involved," 
Padre spokesman Jim Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We apologize to the San Diego fans. We were at the wrong place at the wrong 
time," Bell said Tuesday night. "Any time you're in New York, you're in the 
wrong place. We want to represent the team in the right way. We were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders pitched the final 1 2/3 innings of the San Diego Padres' 6-3 victory 
over the Mets on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all adults," Padre Manager Jim Riggleman said of his players. "Once 
the ump said, 'Play ball,' they did. (Sanders) shut out the comments from the 
stands. . . . the guys felt good for Scott. This was his first relief 
appearance in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell did not play. After the game he congratulated Sanders, his arm around the 
pitcher's shoulder.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; LIKE IT OR NOT, ALL ATHLETES ARE MODELS FOR THE 
IMPRESSIONABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All athletes are role models whether they like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they're worthy or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they deserve it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who works in front of an audience is a role model. Anyone who works for 
the public trust is a role model. Anyone who needs your vote, whether on an 
all-star ballot or a precinct election ticket, is a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are good. Some are bad. From the pros to the high schools, athletes serve 
as examples to the impressionable. 
</P>
<P>
 You should have seen how many autographs Nicole Erickson and her Brea-Olinda 
teammates signed this year. Small scale, big impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson relishes the opportunity, which makes her attitude considerably more 
noble than Charles Barkley's, Michael Jordan's, Nancy Kerrigan's and all the 
other athletes out there who complain they never asked to be put on a pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
 They are right about one thing: It's not their responsibility to raise your 
child. But they are wrong to think they don't have any influence. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an implied consent that exists in sports. If you're willing to reap 
the benefits of the game, whether it's the big money of professional sports, 
the camaraderie of college competition or the mere participation in high 
school, you're consenting to accept the consequences of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, you're consenting to be admired by those who live vicariously through 
you and your team, by those who weren't blessed with the same raw skills or the 
opportunity to excel in an athletic environment. 
</P>
<P>
 You are consenting to be praised -- and vilified -- publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 You are consenting to be recognized at the mall, or at the theater, or in the 
hallway, and being pointed out or approached when all you want is to be left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 You are consenting to be held to a higher standard because people look to you 
as an example of what they can become through hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to like it, but you have to learn to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are some of these high-profile athletes adamant about not being a role 
model? Perhaps it's because they're not very good at it. Nolan Ryan never 
complained about being Texas' favorite son. Joe Montana never complained. Magic 
Johnson never complained. He loves it. And Johnson took responsibility for his 
actions when he revealed he was HIV-positive. Whether you choose to admire him 
is up to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes are typically a spoiled lot. They get their way most of the time. The 
further they go in sports, the more pampered they are. 
</P>
<P>
 When the world is handed to you, it's pretty easy to get full of yourself. 
Though it usually begins with the free college education and might lead to 
$75-per-diem meal money, it can even start in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an unbelievable, yet confirmed, example that took place at one local 
high school: A prominent football/basketball player exposed himself in a 
classroom and was never reprimanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder some athletes develop enormous egos or unwieldy arrogance 
because of such "protection" from a blind administration? Pampering? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't fair that athletes can get away with murder. It isn't fair that 
athletes are held in such esteem. But they are. That's the one thing that makes 
sports what they are. They transcend common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it fair that Charles Barkley makes the salary he does for something as 
meaningless as bouncing a basketball. Not when there's a real world going on 
with men and women fighting fires and gangs, delivering children and mending 
broken bones, picking up garbage cans and knocking down society's barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, including a parent, is a role model. But some, like athletes, are 
more glamorous and appealing than others. Some are better than others. And no 
one can dictate who you choose to admire and emulate. You have to take 
responsibility for that. 
</P>
<P>
 The world is filled with role models. Choose wisely.

 It might not be fair to expect anybody to serve as a role model. But young 
people will continue to look up to someone, to hang on their every word and, 
perhaps, to copy their behavior. And that's always going to come with the 
territory of being a star.

</P>
<P>
 Michele Laughlin, Youth League Coach, Rancho Santa Margarita: YES 
</P>
<P>
 It's unrealistic for today's prominent athletes to expect that they simply 
have to go on TV and say they don't want to be role models. Just because they 
don't want to be role models doesn't mean children won't look up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most young people today don't have anyone to look up to because the news is 
filled with all the bad things people do. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the tremendous effort it takes professional athletes such as 
Charles Barkley and Nancy Kerrigan to stay on top, it's an excellent idea for 
children to emulate them. Athletes should consider this before making 
statements distancing themselves from the term "role model." Most children look 
up to professional athletes, regardless of what the athletes say. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important for kids to look up to athletes because it is quite an 
accomplishment to become a professional athlete in today's world. In addition 
to talent, it takes hard work, dedication and a belief in yourself to succeed 
-- all traits we want to foster in our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes have to expect children will look up to them as role models if they 
use their success to gain lucrative contracts with major companies who cater to 
children -- such as Disney or sporting goods companies -- and act in a more 
responsible manner. 
</P>
<P>
 As a soccer coach in the American Youth Soccer Organization, I have young 
players frequently tell me they want to grow up to be like Michael Jordan, 
Nancy Kerrigan, Wayne Gretzky or Julie Foudy (a standout on the U.S. women's 
national soccer team who got her start playing AYSO and club soccer and was 
county player of the year for three seasons at Mission Viejo High in the '80s). 
Most of these children look up to professional athletes, not someone who is 
almost anonymous to them, like the President. Their role models are the 
successful people they see on TV frequently -- in commercials or at sporting 
events -- the professional athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 With the World Cup Soccer Games coming to Los Angeles and the U.S. team 
practicing in Mission Viejo, I take every opportunity to tell my players about 
the achievements of our local sports figures and the generous contributions 
they make to the community. It gives the children an incentive to do their very 
best because they realize that someone local, from their city, has made the 
dream come true.

</P>
<P>
 Q: It is fair to expect any athlete to serve as a role model? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it is fair or not, prominent people are role models. Whatever line of 
business they are in, people in the spotlight will be looked up to by those of 
us who admire how they do things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether they want to be a role model, these individuals have a responsibility 
to behave in an adult manner and, if they make a mistake, admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a price to pay for stardom. That price is that people watch what you 
say and do. It's not only fair to be expected to conduct oneself intelligently, 
it's part of the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Rockley, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletes, or just people in general, who are in the public limelight, whether 
they want to be role models, their words do speak very loudly to the young and 
old alike. We, as Americans -- not only professional athletes but also the 
general public -- must serve as role models for one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Meyer, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with Charles Barkley saying he does not want to be a role model. 
Reggie Jackson was my sports hero when I grew up. And that is all he was, a 
sports hero. I did not try to model my life after him; I respected what he did 
on the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that I ask of a sports figure today is that they excel on the field. "The 
media place athletes' off-field lives in the limelight too much. Basically, I 
do not care what any athlete does off the field. Parents need to take the 
initiative to be a kid's role model. We cannot make our athletes assume that 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Swanbeck, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "Professional athletes should always expect to be looked upon as role models 
because that is the price the must pay for fame. I would think that any athlete 
would be proud to assume the responsibility of being a role model. There are 
some cases, though, where athletes don't understand how big a deal it is to be 
a role model and they don't take their actions into serious thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Reitz, Villa Park sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletes such as Charles Barkley and Nancy Kerrigan are role models by 
default. Fans and admirers seldom are going to have an opportunity to see them 
outside the arena, so when we get a chance to see them under the lights, what 
we see is what we get. They need to know that whether they like it, people are 
going to watch what they do and what they say." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Eastman, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the media put too much of a spotlight on some of the people 
who are just the media moguls -- the Charles Barkleys and Magic Johnsons of the 
world. Traditionally, professional athletes have been role models for decades, 
all the way back to Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth. The media weren't as strong back 
then, but if you put a little more emphasis on some of the silent giants as 
role models -- the J.T. Snows and Bo Jacksons -- the kids would have someone to 
look up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the people who don't want to be role models, let's not make them 
role models. But the children definitely need someone to look up to, somebody 
to emulate their life after." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garmon, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether these athletes accept it or not, the professional sports arena is 
going to magnify their presence and image. It is to their best advantage to 
serve the public in a positive aspect. Has Charles Barkley accepted his image 
on countless basketball cards being traded, collected and prized by young fans? 
All athletes should think twice before snubbing the backbone of support -- the 
fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Lyons, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "Public figures have a responsibility to the public. I've been a public school 
teacher and a coach for 30 years, and I felt that every time I walked out onto 
the field, I was a model for someone. They had to have my respect and my good 
ethical, moral responses to the kids, and I knew the kids were looking up to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what Charles Barkley or Nancy Kerrigan say, I think it's wrong. 
They just don't want that responsibility. I don't think anybody does, but we 
have the responsibility whether or not we want it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Wilson, Anaheim High teacher 
</P>
<P>
 "When athletes sign endorsement contracts for products or services and have 
their image used to promote something, I don't know where they think they're 
coming from when they say they are not role models because that's what they're 
being put up as. It's strictly their personality, what they do in their sport 
or whatever that makes them attractive to these people who pay them these 
mega-bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody is being paid the equivalent of 10 lifetimes of an average 
person's working salary, that certainly makes them someone to look up to." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Michaels, Brea 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes with the territory. It's something you have to accept. It's like 
being an airplane pilot -- is it fair that you can't drink on the job? Of 
course. It goes with the territory, just like other things go with other 
professions. It's something you get paid a lot of money for. You're high 
profile, and you owe something back to the community to act as a role model." 
</P>
<P>
 James Wicks, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports celebrities should not be looked up to as role models because most 
celebrities don't give a damn about what's going on in their communities 
because of all the money they're making. The real role models should be the 
parents -- or the parent. Why should a stranger be a role model to our kids or 
the kids in our community?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson Hernandez, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell the kids to look at the players as role models for how they play on 
the field, not off the field. To copy the best to try to be the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Haynes, Fullerton youth coach 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think it is fair for athletes to be role models anymore than any 
other portion of our society. I think young people can look up to athletes as 
people of outstanding abilities and in the pros, people with large financial 
success, but people of a young and impressionable age should look more to 
people within the community or their family to look up to and possibly emulate 
their successes." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Whistler, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is a role model regardless of whether you want to be. But are you a 
good or bad role model, or indifferent? Do you stay in or out of trouble? Do 
you live by the so-called Golden Rule? Do you give something back to the 
community? Everybody is a role model. What kind are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Staudinger, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 "Our athletes today, whether they be at the professional or amateur level, 
should not be expected to be role models. They should be allowed to pursue 
their private lives. It is the media that elevates them to role-model status. 
However, if athletes choose to accept sponsorship and endorsements, then they 
should also assume the responsibilities they carry. If they are to gain 
personally from media exposure, they should also accept the responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Youths in our society are in desperate need of role models and cling to 
whomever they can identify with or aspire to be like. In the '80s, many of our 
traditional role models fell to scandal, crime, greed, disgrace, etc. They 
included individuals in government, world leaders, business leaders, athletes, 
television, film and music stars. Youths are now grasping at whomever can fill 
this void. As a society, we must not ignore this -- especially the media." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Morrison, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has a responsibility to be a role model in terms of demonstrating 
the basic qualities and values they think are important. But this especially 
applies to athletes, especially professional athletes whose fame and fortune 
are directly resultant from fans willing to attend the games and buy the 
products that advertise the games that cause the players to be paid these 
wonderfully large salaries.  
</P>
<P>
 "But the quid pro quo is they should demonstrate qualities and values which 
are consistent with those the fans think are important. So if the majority of 
fans think sportsmanship, goodwill and friendly competition are important, 
those are the qualities that should be demonstrated."

NO DOUBT ABOUT TROUT; HEAVY STOCKING BRINGS TEEMING WATERS TO EASTERN SIERRA; 
WIND-DAMAGED CROWLEY LAKE DOCK REPAIRED AND READY FOR BOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trout in unprecedented numbers have been liberated from Eastern Sierra 
hatcheries and the rainbow-colored fish are teeming in practically every creek, 
river and lake from Big Pine to Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this will translate, many say, into perhaps the greatest trout opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the greatest year in history," predicts Don Barrett, 46, of 
Barrett's Landing, which overlooks the scenic, trout-rich Lake Mary, nestled in 
the mountains above town at 9,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 But down U.S. 395, at Crowley Lake, always the most popular lake on opening 
day, John Frederickson is keeping his fingers crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederickson, president of Crowley Lake Fish Camp, Inc., only last week put 
his boats in the water. And as soon as he did, the wind began howling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's happening again?" he wondered aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take much wind to remind Frederickson of the gale that raged over 
the Crowley grounds for hours on May 3, 1993, only a little more than a week 
after the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 It blew out all the windows at the tackle store, tore the docks from their 
anchorage and blew Frederickson's boats across the lake like so many paper 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the private boaters had gotten their craft safely ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 But a south to southwesterly wind that began at 2:30 picked up steadily until 
gusts up to 140 m.p.h. were blasting down from the steep mountain canyons, 
blowing clouds of dust and rocks across the largely barren ground at Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederickson's boats might have been OK, had not the docks given way. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came loose, everything came loose," Frederickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every window was blown out of the tackle store and the canvas roof was ripped 
off and carried away. 
</P>
<P>
 "By 6:30 we had had it," Frederickson said. "We lost 27 boats in the storm. 
Fifteen will never go back in water. The others we were able to repair." 
</P>
<P>
 They're back in the water now, ready for the fishermen. As for the docks, they 
don't figure to be going anywhere soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 17 anchor points, and each weighs 12,900 pounds, held together by 
three-quarter-inch steel cable," Frederickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they will withstand a 140-m.p.h. wind is anyone's guess. Frederickson 
hopes he will never have to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still wake up with a cold chill, thinking about that wind," he said. "But 
it's fun time now. Time to replenish the bank account." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frederickson's sentiments are shared by businesses throughout the Eastern 
Sierra, as up to 100,000 fishermen are expected this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimate might be higher than usual, but then this will be an unusual 
opener.  
</P>
<P>
 Access at most of the popular lakes, despite the recent storm, is the best in 
years. Last year, for instance, heavy snow restricted access to all but the 
lower lakes and streams, or those on busy roads that are plowed regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main reason for optimism is that the Department of Fish and Game, 
which says it can no longer afford to feed and maintain so many hatchery trout, 
has turned hundreds of thousands of them loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've stocked three times as many trout as normal," said Chris Boone at the 
Hot Creek Hatchery in Mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley Lake, between Bishop and Mammoth, received its usual allotment of 
350,000 rainbow trout late last summer, and an additional 1,300 trout weighing 
between three and seven pounds from a private hatchery. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's opening-day anglers complained not only about slow fishing, but 
about the lack of fight in the fish that did bite.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were frozen," said Curtis Milliron, a DFG fisheries biologist based in 
Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, fishing should be much better. The lake has been ice-free 
since late February, the water temperature, 39 degrees for last year's opener, 
is holding at 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Milliron said all the fish he caught last week for studies were full of midge 
larvae, which in his words means, "They're chowing big time." 
</P>
<P>
 Good news for fishermen, bad news for Crowley trout when the horn sounds at 
dawn Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A brief rundown on the four major Eastern Sierra trout-fishing regions: BISHOP 
</P>
<P>
 Leave the augers at home. For the first time in three years, there will be no 
ice fishing in the Bishop area. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Sabrina is ice-free and the ice on South Lake began breaking up Monday. 
North Lake still is iced over, but the Bishop Chamber of Commerce is 
discouraging fishermen from venturing out onto the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an unusually warm spring," said Sharon Lundstrom, spokeswoman for 
the city. "When that ice turns to slush in the day and then refreezes at night 
it becomes weak." 
</P>
<P>
 North Lake and South Lake are reachable only by foot because of snow, 
requiring walks of about a mile. Below the higher-elevation lakes is a Bishop 
Creek basin loaded with fish. "It may be a crazy opener," said Gary Gunsolley, 
owner of Brock's Sporting Goods in Bishop. MAMMOTH 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there was so much snow on opening day that fishermen had to walk, 
ski or snowmobile to their favorite fishing holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now things are somewhat back to normal, whatever that may be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had 500 inches of snow. So I don't know what a normal year is, 
drought or snow," said David Watson, mayor of Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the road to the lakes is open to Tamarack Lodge at Twin Lakes. The 
opening-day crowd will have to do some legwork to reach the lakes above upper 
and lower Twin. Lakes Mary and Mamie should be at least partially free of ice 
by Saturday. Lake George and Horseshoe will be iced over. But cutting through 
the ice should be relatively easy compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had two to three feet of snow on top of four feet of ice," said 
Barrett, watching a cross-country skier glide along the shore of Lake Mary. "We 
had to put an extension on our ice augers." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road at Convict Lake, which in the last two years has produced 
several trophy-class rainbows on opening day, access is no problem and fishing 
is expected to be outstanding again. JUNE 
</P>
<P>
 All four lakes along Highway 158, a.k.a., the June loop, are glimmering under 
the sun, reflecting the pines and steep peaks of the Sierra. There's no ice on 
June, Silver, Gull or Grant. Trout are so numerous in Rush Creek that they can 
be seen in almost every pool of the fast-moving water. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Lake and Walker Lake, both hike-in lakes, should be mostly ice-free and 
anglers might find the hike worthwhile. Parker Lake is a fair brook trout 
fishery, so anglers could conceivably catch a five-fish limit of rainbows, then 
hike to Parker and catch a 10-fish limit of brookies. Walker Lake usually 
yields a big brown or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher up, lakes Gem and Agnew are still frozen over, and Fern Lake -- another 
brook trout fishery -- may also be. But anglers might find themselves on thin 
ice. BRIDGEPORT 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects on the lower East Walker River are the best since the Walker 
Irrigation District all but drained Bridgeport Reservoir in 1988, and silting 
from the outflow through the East Walker led to a massive fish kill in the 
famed brown trout fishery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've finally got the environment cleaned up down there; now it's paying 
off," said Rick Rockel of Ken's Sporting Goods and a stream keeper for 
CalTrout. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's flushing and silt cleanup appears to have worked wonders. 
Catch-and-release anglers on the special-restriction portion of the East Walker 
should be pleasantly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 On prospects in the region in general, Rockel said things "should be cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 "From a fishing standpoint it should be an incredible opener for relatively 
basic reason: We already have 20% of our total allocation (of hatchery trout) 
in the water, plus it has been much warmer than normal," Rockel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lot of insect activity. Right across the border in Nevada, 
they're catching huge fish on dry flies right now, which is very unusual for 
this time of year. So I expect everything to really be cooking on opening day." 
</P>
<P>
 Best bets: Bridgeport Reservoir and the East Walker, above and below town. 
Twin Lakes and Robinson Creek should also produce limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bridgeport (Reservoir) will be the hot spot for medium- to large-size fish," 
Rockel said. "There will be plenty of fish coming out of Twin, but the bulk 
will be catchable size, 12-14 inches." 
</P>
<P>
 In the higher elevations, Virginia Lakes is almost reachable by car. A short 
hike is necessary and the lake is iced over. But walk on the ice at your own 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our opinion that the ice is not safe," Rockel said.  
</P>
<P>
 Kirman Lake, a popular brook trout fishery, let a lot of fishermen down last 
year and will probably do so again this year because of the DFG's decision two 
years ago to cut the plant of brook trout fingerlings in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, it is the rainbow trout that takes center stage this weekend, 
assuming of course that Mother Nature cooperates. The current storm is expected 
to pass, but the wind might blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the wind whip the lake into a froth late last week, Frederickson 
searched for a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather have the wind this week than next week," he said. "So let's keep 
our fingers crossed."

ANDERSON ENDS UP IN ATLANTA, NOT IN LIMBO; PRO FOOTBALL: NEARLY PASSED OVER IN 
THE DRAFT, HE KNOWS HE FACES UPHILL BATTLE -- BUT THAT'S NOTHING NEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A long journey ended Monday for Jamal Anderson when the former El Camino Real 
High and Moorpark College running back was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has climbed terrain some thought was too rugged for a 6-foot, 
244-pound fullback who was much smaller in high school and who had to fight for 
playing time at Utah until the middle of his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've watched him go from the West Valley Eagles in Pop Warner to high school 
to junior college to college," said James Anderson, Jamal's father. "Now this 
is the end. This is the top of the line. This is the show." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former bodyguard for boxing champions Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard and 
Mike Tyson and a current bodyguard for the rap group Boyz 2 Men, James Anderson 
knows what it is like to be in the show. But nothing could match the thrill 
James got when the Falcons announced his son's name in the seventh and final 
round of the draft Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's No. 1," James said. "That's my son. I'm part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 But actually, this is yet another small beginning. As the 201st player taken 
in a draft of 222, Jamal once again will have to fight to earn his place -- 
which James readily acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine," James said. "That only made him eight times more determined 
than he would be if they drafted him where we expected." 
</P>
<P>
 NFL coaches thought highly of Jamal, who rushed for 1,032 yards and 15 
touchdowns at Utah last fall -- most of it coming after the Utes switched to a 
one-back offense at midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal said he was rated among the top five fullbacks in the country by most 
publications, but an ankle injury after Utah's regular-season finale with 
Brigham Young worried scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those worries, Anderson scored on a 35-yard run against USC in the 
Freedom Bowl and had two touchdown runs to lead the West to a come-from-behind 
victory in the East-West Shrine game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ankle injury kept him out of some drills at the NFL Combine in March. 
When he returned to Indianapolis on April 8 for a physical, he was deemed 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, New Orleans Saints and Washington Redskins showed strong 
interest, but Anderson thought he would be chosen by the Kansas City Chiefs, 
who nabbed running backs Greg Hill of Texas A&M and Donnell Bennett of Miami 
with their first two picks. A disappointed Anderson finally stopped watching 
the draft after the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting in front of the TV going, 'Oh my God,' " Anderson said. "I was 
rated higher than guys who were getting picked. I didn't know what to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Anderson got a phone call from Falcon running backs coach Ollie 
Wilson, who said he couldn't believe Anderson was still available. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta, with new coach June Jones and new quarterback Jeff George, is 
abandoning its run-and-shoot offense and switching to a more conventional 
offense, including the one-back set Anderson ran at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 With his ability to block, catch and take off on a breakaway run, Anderson 
believes he compares favorably with the first fullback taken in the draft -- 
Florida State's William Floyd, selected by the San Francisco 49ers with the 
28th pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great blocker, and that's his No. 1 job," Anderson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He does that very well and I respect him for that. Personally, I think I'm a 
better runner than he is. But the one-back (set) is a different world. That's 
when you really see what kind of ability we've got." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson will compete against Atlanta incumbents Erric Pegram and Steve 
Broussard. 
</P>
<P>
 But fighting for a job is nothing new to Anderson, who was injured his junior 
season at El Camino Real but set a school rushing record (1,153 yards) in his 
senior year. He was overshadowed by All-American Freddie Bradley his first 
season at Moorpark College but rushed for 1,163 yards as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to fight my senior year of high school to get any type of accolades and 
at JC I was second fiddle," Anderson said. "When I went to Utah, I was their 
No. 1 recruit. But they didn't really do anything with me. I wallowed around 
here for a year. I'm used to this." 
</P>
<P>
 James Anderson, a former all-state football player in New Jersey, is not 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is perfect for (Jamal)," he said. "Every time I think there's an 
obstacle for him, he'll go over it. He might not start for Atlanta, but 
eventually he'll come to fruition and people will say, 'Hold it. What have we 
here?' 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be this year."

BIRMINGHAM GROUP LOSES ANNUAL MEET; TRACK AND FIELD: SPONSOR'S LACK OF MANPOWER 
CITED FOR NATIONAL SCHOLASTIC OUTDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS' MOVE TO N.C. STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The postseason national high school track and field schedule, which used to 
include an important meet staged at Birmingham High, has undergone several 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Scholastic Outdoor Championships, which had been held at 
Birmingham the past three years, has been moved to North Carolina State. In 
addition, the Golden West Invitational in Sacramento has a new format and the 
International Prep Invitational, run in suburban Chicago, has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of changes this year and not all of them are good," 
said Doug Speck, one of the promoters of the prestigious Arcadia Invitational. 
"Losing a meet such as the (International Prep) is not a good sign for the 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Scholastic Outdoor meet will be held June 19, a week later than 
in the past. The meet was sponsored by the Birmingham High Dad's Club for the 
first three years of its existence. However, the National Scholastic Sports 
Foundation in Chapel Hill, N.C., chose not to renew its contract with that 
group this year because of the way the meet was run. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't have enough people to do the job the way it should have been 
done," said Mike Byrnes, NSSF president. "The scope and magnitude of the meet 
was just too overwhelming for the people involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrnes criticized Lou Ramirez, the meet director and Birmingham's athletic 
director, for his insistence on being in charge of every aspect of the event. 
Ramirez refused to delegate authority, which led to disorganization at times, 
according to Byrnes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had done what they were supposed to do, raise money for the meet, and 
let us do what we were supposed to do, run the meet, it would have been a 
perfect marriage," Byrnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez conceded "we had too few people needed to run the meet," which last 
year was held at Birmingham and UCLA. He declined to respond to other 
criticisms, saying, "anything else would only hurt the sport and I don't want 
to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's meet was scheduled to be held at Georgia Tech in Atlanta but, 
because of the cost of staging a meet there, was moved to Raleigh, N.C., over 
the weekend. Still, Byrnes wishes the meet could have stayed in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad things didn't work out with (the Birmingham High Dad's Club)," 
he said. "The meet has become a major fixture and you have to credit them with 
that. But there were too many other problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden West Invitational, which began as a boys' competition in 1960 and 
added a girls' meet in 1988, will be held in Sacramento on June 11. Meet 
organizers dropped the seniors-only format this year to try to improve the 
quality of the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal has always been to have the top eight competitors in the country 
compete in each event," meet director John Mansoor said. "But we weren't 
reaching that goal in recent years, especially in the girls' meet where a lot 
of the top athletes are juniors or even sophomores." 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to draw top athletes also was linked to a scheduling conflict with 
the National Scholastic Outdoor Championships. Those two meets had been run on 
the same weekend because neither wanted to compete against the International 
Prep meet. That meet -- also known as the Keebler Invitational -- was canceled 
because of financial reasons after the Keebler Cookie Co. was purchased by a 
British conglomerate last year. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Golden West and National Scholastic meets will be held on 
successive weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "No (meet organizer) wanted to compete with the (International Prep) meet," 
Byrnes said. "They just had too much money . . . but now that they're gone, 
it's a good weekend for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The International Prep meet, which was held in Elmhurst, Ill., traditionally 
featured some of the top athletes in the United States, as well as in Canada 
and the Caribbean islands.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the envy of Golden West and National Scholastic organizers because it 
had a huge budget, estimated to be as much as $250,000.

COACHES PUNISHED FOR RECRUITING; PREP BASKETBALL: TWO FREMONT ASSISTANTS CUT 
OFF FROM THE SCHOOL, WHICH IS ALSO PUT ON PROBATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Two Fremont High boys' basketball assistant coaches must disassociate 
themselves from the team for allegedly recruiting players, the City Section 
Rules Committee said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After 3 1/2 hours of testimony by Fremont administrators and members of the 
coaching staff, the nine-member committee deliberated for an hour before 
handing down one of its toughest punishments in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the program was put on a year's probation. Fremont has one of the 
top teams in the City Section, having reached the semifinals of the Division 
4-A playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee ruled that assistant Keith Young made illegal contact with Kenny 
Washington last summer while Washington was enrolled at Wilmington Banning 
High. Washington, a 6-foot-3 forward, transferred to Fremont last September but 
was declared ineligible by the City Section for an insufficient change in 
residency. He sat out his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Irv Robertson, another Fremont assistant, was cited for recruiting Johnny 
Williams. Williams, a 6-7 center, was dismissed from Woodland Hills Taft last 
November for disciplinary reasons. The district reassigned him to North 
Hollywood, but Robertson told Williams if he came to Fremont he would gain 
immediate eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who is now attending North Hollywood High, also sat out his senior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Robertson denied any wrongdoing at Tuesday's meeting. Sam Sullivan, 
Fremont's coach the last 17 years, said he runs a clean program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody at this school is doing any recruiting," Sullivan said. "I have never 
done any recruiting, and I make sure my assistants follow the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches are not allowed outside contact with athletes not enrolled in their 
schools, according to CIF rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Fiege, City Section commissioner, said she will inform Fremont 
Principal John Haydel to make sure Young and Robertson are no longer connected 
with the program. They are eligible to return July 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second disciplinary action against Fremont's basketball program in 
the last three years. It was also put on probation for the 1991-92 season after 
a series of fights on the court the previous season.

HANKINS WILL SIGN WITH UNLV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Third baseman Ryan Hankins of Simi Valley High, a preseason All-American, will 
sign a letter of intent to play college baseball at Nevada Las Vegas, he said 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins chose UNLV over UC Santa Barbara.He will join his Pioneer teammate 
Bill Scheffels, who signed with the Rebels during the NCAA early signing period 
in November, but Hankins said that wasn't a factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "(UNLV) has a young team and I can go right in and play," said Hankins, who 
has met the NCAA-required minimum score of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins is second in the Marmonte League in batting with a .482 average. He 
has scored a league-leading 26 runs and he is tied for the league lead in home 
runs with five. He has 14 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins hit .500 with 12 home runs and 57 RBIs last year for the Pioneers 
(27-4), who lost in the Southern Section's Division I championship game. 
Baseball America magazine named him a second-team All-American in the 
preseason. JEFF FLETCHER

PAYTON'S PLACE; HE'S UNDER CONTROL, RUNNING SUPERSONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seattle Coach George Karl and point guard Gary Payton are communicating. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Karl: Pass the . . . ball! 
</P>
<P>
 Replies Payton: Sit your . . . butt down! 
</P>
<P>
 Both of them feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 No SuperSonic's development has been more important than Payton's. Shawn Kemp 
is vastly improved, but that could have been predicted when he arrived hungry 
to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton, second overall pick in the 1990 draft, arrived cocky and defiant, 
without judgment or a jump shot. No one bothered to guard him. His first coach, 
K.C. Jones, used veteran Nate McMillan in pressure situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl, arriving midway through Payton's second season, set about reclaiming 
him, noisily. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a battle every day," Karl says. "He never was totally disrespectful, 
but it was just pulling teeth, handling his street stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he wanted to be coached every day, but it was important for 
me for him to be coached every day because I knew he was the guy. If it was 
going to work, he had to be the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Payton responded. Now he plays under control, makes jump shots -- although he 
and running mate Kendall Gill will be challenged to make more in the playoffs 
-- and harries opposing point guards as the point man in Karl's pressure 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 A nonstop talker on the floor, Payton also is one of the team's spokesmen off 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was cocky then, but he couldn't play," Magic Johnson says, remembering the 
young Payton. "He's cocky now, but he can play." MARK HEISLER

SHORT-TERM RATES RISE; DOW EASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks closed mixed Tuesday, with blue chips slightly lower, as short-term 
interest rates continued to creep higher. 
</P>
<P>
 But long-term bond yields fell again ahead of today's market holiday in honor 
of former President Richard Nixon, who died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials slipped 6.24 points to 3,699.54 after 
rocketing 57 points Monday on a combination of falling bond yields and strong 
corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the market meandered for much of the day, and trading was 
relatively subdued ahead of today's unexpected holiday. "They had a big day 
(Monday) and took a little rest," said Pat Davis, trader at Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, winners topped losers by 13 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange, and 
smaller stocks posted stronger gains than blue chips. The Nasdaq composite 
index of mostly smaller issues rose 3.41 points to 734.21. It has risen 4.1% 
from its 1994 low last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds appeared to be more influenced than stocks by Tuesday's economic news. 
Another rise in short-term interest rates may have been tied to the Conference 
Board's report that its consumer confidence index surged in April to the 
highest level in nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising confidence bodes well for the economy, thus raising the chances that 
the Federal Reserve Board will boost short-term interest rates further to 
restrain growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders pushed the yield on three-month Treasury bills to 3.98% on Tuesday, up 
from the 3.94% on three-month bills auctioned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But longer-term interest rates may have taken their cue from a Labor 
Department report Tuesday. The department said its employment cost index, 
considered one of the best gauges of wage inflation pressures, rose 3.2% in the 
year ended March 31 -- the smallest annual increase on record. 
</P>
<P>
 Because long-term yields are sensitive to inflation fears more than anything 
else, the Labor report helped the bond market prolong the rally that began a 
week ago. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond yield fell to 7.10% on 
Tuesday from 7.15% on Monday. It was 7.42% on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are running a little scared that the market might start taking off" 
and that long-term yields may plummet further, said Michael Marzano, head of 
bond futures trading at Yamaichi International. People who sold bonds in recent 
weeks "are genuinely afraid of being left out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment in the bond market was helped further by Tuesday's Treasury auction 
of $17 billion in two-year notes, for which demand was surprisingly strong. The 
high yield on the notes was 5.59%, up from 5.15% at the last auction March 22 
but below the 5.61% to 5.62% yield that had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial issues continued the rebound that began last Thursday. 3M 
gained 1 to 48 3/4, Clark Equipment leaped 1 3/8 to 69, Monsanto added 1 1/8 to 
81, Phelps Dodge gained 1 1/4 to 54 7/8 and Dow Chemical jumped 1 3/8 to 63 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were mixed. Advanced Micro Devices jumped 1 1/8 to 26 7/8, 
Exabyte added 1 1/8 to 19 3/8 and FileNet gained 1 to 27 1/4, but Cabletron 
Systems fell 2 3/8 to 104 5/8 and Cray Research tumbled 4 1/4 to 21 3/8. Cray 
reported disappointing first-quarter computer orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tech loser was software firm Gupta, which tumbled 9 3/4 to 13 1/2 on a 
dismal earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many telecom stocks were strong. IDB Communications leaped 1 3/8 to 16 7/8 
after reporting a 117% rise in first-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners included Scientific Atlanta, up 1 3/8 to 29 3/8; Cencall 
Communications, up 2 to 23 1/2, and Tellabs, up 2 1/4 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some financial stocks came under pressure. Insurance firm Unum dove 4 1/4 to 
50 1/4 on its earnings report, and annuity firm SunAmerica's report also failed 
to impress. Its shares fell 1 7/8 to 36 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Also falling were BankAmerica, off 1/2 to 43; First Chicago, down 1/2 to 53 
1/8, and insurer General Re, off 1 3/4 to 112 1/4.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: NIGHTMARE AT THE MULTIPLEX: KILLER POPCORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robin Abcarian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We had a terrible time at the movies the other night. Almost walked out, in 
fact. "Sirens" was a waste of $7. For those of you who haven't made the mistake 
of seeing it, let's just say it was exactly like "The Witches of Eastwick" 
minus the acting talent, plot and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 But why be coy? 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was a two-hour excuse for supermodel Elle MacPherson to expose her 
breasts. And yes, in case you must know, they do defy gravity. Which may 
explain why my husband left the theater feeling considerably less ripped off 
than I. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of the evening -- for me, anyhow -- was the popcorn. It's so low 
in calories, so low in fat, so delicious. It's the last guilt-free snack food. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, and Elle wants my husband's phone number.  
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after strapping that bucket of popcorn onto my face like a 
feed bag, a nonprofit consumer group in Washington announced that movie popcorn 
is the nutritional equivalent of Hannibal Lecter. (Thank you, Center for 
Science in the Public Interest! Remind me to recommend you folks for a role in 
the remake of Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds." Your studies could plop from the 
skies like . . . never mind.) 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with movie popcorn? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, really. It's the cooking oil that takes a beautiful thing and turns 
it into something ugly. Turns out that about 70% of movie kernels are popped in 
artery-blockading coconut oil. Add "butter" -- a word that requires quotes in 
connection to movie popcorn -- and you have a product that could rival anything 
put out by Coppertone. Minus the health-enhancing sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, a small tub of popcorn without "butter" contains 19 
grams of saturated fat -- almost an entire day's recommended allowance, which 
is 20 grams. A medium tub of "buttered" popcorn at a typical theater contains 
"more fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, a Big Mac-with-fries lunch and a 
steak dinner with all the trimmings combined." 
</P>
<P>
 Ugh. Pass the fava beans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what should theater owners do? Outlaw coconut oil in favor of canola 
shortening, which contains far less saturated fat? Replace oil popping with air 
popping, which imparts nearly no saturated fat to the corn? 
</P>
<P>
 Hell no!  
</P>
<P>
 When a heart disease authority says, "It's unbelievable that theaters are 
still popping popcorn in this stuff when heart disease is the No. 1 killer in 
the United States," should they change their oily ways? 
</P>
<P>
 Hell no!  
</P>
<P>
 Theater owners should get their spin doctors on this immediately. Pooh-pooh 
the bad news. Make it look like a bunch of health-crazed nutcakes are making 
all the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 They were able to respond quickly to the bad news: 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person only goes to the movies five or six times a year," says 
one theater association executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people ask us why they can't get their home popcorn to taste as good as 
theater popcorn. The answer is the coconut oil," says another. 
</P>
<P>
 But what they need is a slogan. Something like: "Popcorn doesn't kill people. 
Worrying about not being able to enjoy popcorn kills people." Or something. 
</P>
<P>
 Give them a little time to fine-tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, when health-conscious theatergoers stop buying popcorn, they'll get 
the message. And by that time, maybe Elle MacPherson will have taken acting 
lessons, so we . . . I . . . won't mind if the popcorn doesn't taste as good as 
it used to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just movie popcorn under attack in the nation's capital this week. A 
second junk food is under fire in the U.S. Senate: soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont (the state that brought us perhaps 
the most fat-laden ice cream of all, Ben and Jerry's) has introduced a bill 
that would encourage schools to restrict or ban the sales of soft drinks and 
other foods with "minimal nutritional value." (Which would pretty much leave 
calcium- and protein-rich ice cream on the OK list, wouldn't it?) 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's time for a little junk food coalition building. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, popcorn and Coke go together like . . . I was going to say "Disney 
and Main Street," but truth obliges me to adjust the simile -- it now appears, 
thanks to Leahy, that they go together like Freddy Krueger and Elm Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft drink executives are fizzing mad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coca-Cola company has asked school officials to protest on the basis that 
schools stand to lose income produced by vending machines -- and incredibly, 
school officials in several states have complied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make no nutritional claims for soft drinks, but they can be part of a 
balanced diet," a Coca-Cola spokesman told one newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 I think he might have taken a hint from the killer popcorn spin doctors: "How 
could Coke in a school-based vending machine be bad? Most children only come to 
school five or six times a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people might actually believe him.

 Reader Martha Roy of Fullerton says that years ago, her sister worked in the 
toy department of a large general merchandise store: 
</P>
<P>
 A customer wanted a present for her grandson, and after a quick look around, 
she paused at a soda machine, asking if it was messy. My sister's greatest 
strength and worst liability in sales was her honesty, so she answered: "Yes 
ma'am, I'm afraid it is."  
</P>
<P>
 The customer next asked if the machine was also loud. My sister knew the sale 
was lost when she told the customer that some mothers had mentioned the noise. 
To my sister's surprise, however, the older woman said she would buy the 
machine.  
</P>
<P>
 Ringing up the purchase, my sister said: "You must really love your grandson." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Her customer smiled sweetly and replied: "No. I really hate my 
daughter-in-law."

LAUGH LINES; YO, ROSEANNE! TIME TO SPANK THAT INNER CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

talk-show host on KFI, AM-640.

<P>
 OK, so I think I've finally figured out the best thing about Tom and Roseanne 
Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who you are, they make your relationship look really healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, perhaps with the exception of that couple here in Los Angeles who 
reconciled after she cut off his testicles with a pair of scissors. Must be a 
variation on a theme of the "three strikes and you're out" bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But short of someone lopping off a body part (which, by the way, should be a 
teensy warning sign), how do you know if you're in a dysfunctional 
relationship?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, funny you should ask, because that's the subject of today's lesson. (Are 
you paying attention, Roseanne? You, in particular, will be tested on this 
later.) 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I hate the New Age, psychobabble-type connotation of the term 
dysfunctional . I think Tom and Roseanne each ought to find their inner child 
and spank it. Hard. 
</P>
<P>
 But I mean that in a loving way. So out of love, I offer them, and you, this 
handy 10-tip guide: "How to Know If You're in a Dysfunctional Relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 1. When more than three of your multiple personalities hate your spouse. And 
one of them starts channeling Lorena Bobbitt on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 2. When your husband wants something called "loose meat" on the menu at your 
diner, that's a good indication there may be some infidelity to deal with at 
some point. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonus tip: When your spouse refers to "my beautiful 24-year-old assistant" he 
always means "my sex slave-girlfriend, but I'm stupid enough to think no one 
knows it." 
</P>
<P>
 Extra bonus tip: When he asks you to marry a woman as a "joke," the joke's 
probably on you. 
</P>
<P>
 3. When your "disagreements" could be new events on "American Gladiators." 
</P>
<P>
 4. When she asks you to convert to her religion, and you look like Beaver 
Cleaver in a yarmulke. Or when he asks you to take his last name, and suddenly 
you realize that you're named after the pig on "Green Acres." 
</P>
<P>
 5. When your wife enjoys kissing Mariel Hemingway more than you. 
</P>
<P>
 6. When your husband's idea of your "marital duties" is getting him his own TV 
show. (Subtract extra points for multiple TV shows and really bad TV shows.) 
</P>
<P>
 7. When any of your dates include getting tattoos or dropping your pants in 
front of more that 70,000 people at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 8. When your spouse is making more than, oh, say $20 million a year off you, 
especially when some of that money comes from selling embarrassing personal 
information about you to the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 9. When your spouse has roughly the same amount of pharmaceuticals in him or 
her at any given time as Elvis -- or a medium-size Thrifty drug store. 
</P>
<P>
 10. When you begin to "recover" vague but horrific memories that your spouse 
made you embarrass yourself in front of the entire country by mud-wrestling on 
the cover of Vanity Fair, and made you sing the national anthem while you 
grabbed your crotch at a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, kids, I hope you did well on our little quiz today. But if you didn't 
(and you know who you are), never fear. I just did it as a publicity stunt 
anyway.

'TOMMY' TAKES PINBALL TO THE DESERT; THEATER: PALM DESERT IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT 
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PINBALL WIZARD MEETS THE GOLF BALL WIZARDS AT MCCALLUM 
THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the McCallum Theatre of Palm Desert's Bob Hope Cultural Center announced 
that "Tommy" was coming to town, folks said, "Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, (the McCallum) also had 'Tommy Tune,' " executive director Nancy 
Dolensek said this week. "So people thought that 'Tommy Tune' was back again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broadway hit "The Who's Tommy," about a "deaf, dumb and blind" pinball 
wizard based on the 1969 album by the British rock band the Who, is an unknown 
quantity in Palm Desert where one is more likely to find golf balls than 
pinball. This area due east of Palm Springs -- an oasis of lush golf courses 
and tennis courts surrounding gated retirement communities and resort hotels -- 
is hardly a haven for the rock 'n' roll generation devoted to rocker Pete 
Townshend's creation. "This is a stretch," Dolensek admits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palm Desert will find out what happens when the golf ball wizards meet the 
Pinball Wizard when the road company of "Tommy" opens tonight at the McCallum. 
Dolensek believes her audience is up for the challenge. As of Monday, she said 
tickets -- which range from $40 to $60 -- were selling at about 75% capacity 
for the 1,100-seat theater. The audience received its first introduction to 
"Tommy" on Friday in the McCallum Theatre lobby, with a "pinball wizard 
contest" using the giant machine from the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost hate calling it a rock opera -- it's a misnomer," she said. "While 
it is based on the music of the Who, there is a compelling and distinctive 
story line -- it's by no means listening to two hours of hard rock. And it's a 
production dream -- it's by far the largest production we've ever had in here. 
To put it in perspective, this show travels in 13 semi-trucks. 'Les Miz' 
traveled in five." 
</P>
<P>
 The Palm Desert engagement, which runs through Saturday, marks "Tommy's" 
return to California. While there have been various concert and theater 
presentations of "Tommy" -- as well as an expensive and unsuccessful 1975 film 
adaptation -- the Broadway version cut its teeth at the La Jolla Playhouse in 
July, 1992, before moving on to New York, where the $7-million production 
opened in April, 1993, at the St. James Theatre after substantial surgery, 
including a re-tooling of the second act. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, "Tommy" will head for Costa Mesa's Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, and in early June goes to the San Francisco Opera House. The show comes 
to the Universal Amphitheatre July 13-31. While the producers expect to have 
only one "Tommy" touring company in the United States, plans exist for other 
"Tommy" productions in Toronto, London and other European cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled that it's going to be in California during the summer. . . . 
It's pretty much a California product," "Tommy" co-creator and director Des 
MacAnuff said. "They attempted to produce the show in London in the '70s, and 
it failed. 'Tommy' is very much an American creation." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Zeiger, president of Pace Theatrical Group and executive producer of the 
"Tommy" tour, said he expects "Tommy" to be successful with Palm Desert's 
traditionally older audience, despite their unfamiliarity with rock. "Our 
second stop on this tour was Fort Lauderdale, and while there are certainly 
plenty of young people there, the traditional audience is retired," he said. 
"They stood on their feet and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did win five Tony Awards, and has been legitimized by Broadway. The 
primary difference between this and any other Broadway musical is that it was 
written by Pete Townshend, not Andrew Lloyd Webber. It has an electric guitar 
and bass in the orchestra, and it's definitely a rock music score, but it is a 
book musical. There is a real meaty story there." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeiger said that while "Tommy" has a built-in audience of Who fans, it 
requires aggressive marketing because it is such a new show, going on tour just 
a year after its Broadway opening. "People are seeing something fresh, but by 
the same token, unlike 'Phantom,' 'Les Miserables' or 'Miss Saigon,' we haven't 
been running long enough to develop a huge groundswell of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 While Zeiger said a single-budget figure for the tour is hard to calculate, 
the show costs approximately $500,000 a week to tour, and is booked through 
June, 1995. Reviews have ranged from ecstatic to lukewarm; Houston Chronicle's 
Everett Evans, for example, termed it "lavishly over-rated" and "emotionally 
empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of reviews, Randy Whitescarver, stage manager of the show, said 
"Tommy" has played to sellout crowds across the country. "We broke an all-time 
box-office record in Boston," he said. "The day after 'Tommy' won five Tony 
Awards, the Broadway production took in $494,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitescarver said that the show has been difficult to tour because of its size 
and technical complexity. "A lot of road shows go out that have one or two big 
effects. They'll travel with either a lot of lighting and a little scenery, or 
an automation deck that will move the scenery via computer instead of having 
stagehands pushing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a little bit of everything. We have the automated deck; we have a 
tremendous amount of lighting; we have front projection, rear projection, video 
-- still video, laser-disc video -- we have pyrotechnics, we have a pinball 
machine that's on hydraulics that spins and lifts and explodes. We pulled all 
the tricks out." 
</P>
<P>
 And Zeiger said Los Angeles will see the most lavish "Tommy" of all. "L.A. 
will be unique unto itself," Zeiger said. "Palm Desert will have a wonderful 
production, but L.A. is going to have a custom design that is going to be quite 
spectacular. Universal Amphitheatre is such a unique space, it's not a 
traditional proscenium stage. We are spending a great deal of time building a 
special set design." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Who's Tommy" will be at the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert today 
through Saturday, for information call (619) 340-ARTS or (619) 278-TIXS; at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, May 10-15, (714) 740-2000; and the 
Universal Amphitheatre, July 13-31, (213) 480-3232.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: INSPECTOR TENNISON RETURNS IN SOME 'PRIME' 
VIEWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time for the night crawlers in London's Soho district. So. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A ravishing female impersonator named Vera sings "Falling in Love Again" in 
husky Marlene Dietrich style to a rapt crowd in a gay bar. 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-aged boy is roughed up. 
</P>
<P>
 A spotlight transforms the bodice of Vera's slinky, white-sequined gown into a 
shimmery, phosphorescent glow. 
</P>
<P>
 A black-charred corpse is discovered in the ashes of a burned-out flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prime Suspect 3" opens with a fast-cutting juxtaposition of these incongruent 
scenes that rub against one another like sandpaper, then has the most 
interesting cop on television -- Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison -- 
spend the next four hours methodically exposing their film noir common 
denominators. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, happy nights are here again. That annual PBS highlight, Helen Mirren, 
returns to "Mystery!" on Thursday as the irresistibly driven, tightly coiled, 
tenacious, despotic protagonist of another "Prime Suspect" four-parter from 
Britain's Granada Television. Lynda La Plante's "Prime Suspect 3," although not 
quite the equal of last season's brilliantly tangled "Prime Suspect 2" (written 
by Allan Cubitt), is tingling, head-turning, rip-roaring television that leaves 
you ravenously awaiting the next course. Please let there be a "Prime Suspect 
4." 
</P>
<P>
 Also written by La Plante, 1992's original "Prime Suspect" concluded with 
Tennison out-bullying her sexist male colleagues only to wind up thwarted by 
the not-guilty plea of a serial killer from whom she had skillfully wrung a 
confession. Frustration also dogged Tennison in "Prime Suspect 2," which ended 
with her solving a grisly slaying through brilliant sleuthing, yet being denied 
a promotion because of a careless fling she had with one of her own men. 
Honoring tradition, Tennison III also mingles triumph and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prime Suspect 3" opens with Tennison again an outsider and an irritant to her 
old-boy superiors, having just been bumped from homicide to the Soho vice squad 
where, despite being so new she can't even locate the coffee machine, she 
aggressively heads an investigation into the death of a 15-year-old male 
prostitute. A jangle of flaws as well as talent, she remains brusque and 
strident, the sort of boss -- or "guv," as the Brits say it -- who sweeps into 
a room full of detectives barking orders. "Open the window! Shut the door!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, shut up, Jane," you sometimes want to tell her, even though the 
humanizing kinks in Tennison's character are a big part of her appeal. Hardly a 
candidate for a pedestal, she plays ruthless office politics as a way of 
navigating her career around the cesspools. She's still trying to kick her 
nicotine habit by chomping on gum as a big cat would a gazelle. And, as always, 
her antennae take in everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, there's much to take in, including the twisted jabs of her old 
nemesis from the original "Prime Suspect," the resentful, Machiavellian Sgt. 
Bill Otley (Tom Bell). Like competing predators, these old foes warily tolerate 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 A bombshell will rock Tennison's personal life at the end of the first 
episode, showing a bit of her private, softer side. Yet just as sexism and 
racism were the volatile undercurrents of "Prime Suspect" and "Prime Suspect 
2," respectively, pedophilia and homophobia are dominant themes in "Prime 
Suspect 3." 
</P>
<P>
 The hazy outlines of an apparent cover-up begin to appear through the 
tantalizing smokiness of La Plante's teleplay, as Tennison's superiors 
mysteriously deploy a mole to spy on her and stop her investigation from 
expanding. She settles on the villainous James Jackson (David Thewlis) as a 
suspect while aiming suspicious side glances at Edward Parker-Jones (Ciaran 
Hinds), the saintly operator of a halfway house for the kind of young runaways 
who Jackson turns to prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, "Prime Suspect 3" lacks the subtlety of its predecessors. The 
mole, by publicly hobnobbing with those who sent him, all but announces himself 
to Tennison, for example. And given her record as a troublemaker, Tennison's 
posting to this troubled, high-visibility vice unit is itself somewhat of a 
no-brainer. If her bosses wish to isolate her, why do they send her here? 
Moreover, there's little in "Prime Suspect 3" to match the smoldering racial 
volatility (especially the white Tennison's affair with a black detective and 
his subsequent abuse of a black suspect) that made "Prime Suspect 2" so hot to 
the touch. 
</P>
<P>
 What "Prime Suspect 3" offers in abundance, though, are striking sequences 
from director David Drury, whose ominous, dark-shrouded Soho streets are 
populated by the Fagin-like Jackson and his grimy, corrupted children of the 
night in scenes right out of Dickens. Drury also is relentless with his 
lingering tight shots, using them with meticulous skill, for example, while 
looking through Mirren's eyes as if they were keyholes and exploring the 
delicate nuances of her face as one would trace the intricate lines on a map. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, following the winding trail of a perpetrator known as the "keeper 
of souls," Mirren is again extraordinary as Tennison. In conjunction with La 
Plante and others, she has made Tennison television's most intriguing and 
seductive recurring character, giving up glamour for a luminous, glistening 
complexity. It's hard to get enough of her. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as previous "Prime Suspects" were nourished by stunning supporting 
work, "Prime Suspect 3" is also studded by very big performances in relatively 
small roles. Peter Capaldi's pivotal transvestite Vera is one, as is Thewlis' 
predatory Jackson, who spews oil with every sentence. And the crook-nosed 
Bell's slinking Otley wriggles through his scenes like a reptile on the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prime Suspect 3" carries the torch with style and honor. Like its 
predecessors, it's the keeper of superior television. 
</P>
<P>
 * The four-part "Prime Suspect 3" begins at 9 p.m. Thursday on "Mystery!" on 
KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15.

SCREENING ROOM; NUART OFFERS A DELIGHTFUL LOOK AT EARLY CAMPION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that New Zealand filmmaker Jane Campion has received international acclaim 
with "The Piano," the Nuart will present, today only, three short films Campion 
made as a student at the Australian Film and TV School. They were first shown 
locally by Filmforum in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a delight, showing that from the start Campion paid a great deal of 
attention to the everyday world, seeking to discover what makes seemingly 
ordinary people tick. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, we see her discovering -- with the support of 
extraordinarily acute cinematographer Sally Bongers -- fresh ways of expressing 
other people's emotions and concerns, and her own bemused feelings about them. 
That she deals with commonplace situations and individuals only underlines her 
distinctive style and sensibility, which is suffused with equal parts humor and 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-minute "Peel" (1982) is a hilarious take on a child's disobedience. 
Freckled, redheaded Ben throws orange peels from the car, and his father, Tim 
(also freckled and redheaded), stops the car and orders him to pick them up.  
</P>
<P>
 The somewhat more conventional 27-minute "A Girl's Own Story" (1984) is a 
recollection, shot in black and white, of growing up in a girls' school in the 
'60s, enamored of the Beatles, curious about sex and boys, and dealing with 
parents who have refused to speak to each other.  
</P>
<P>
 The 13-minute "Passionless" (1984) is the gem of the trio, a lovely experiment 
in dipping into the imaginations of other people at those moments when their 
random thoughts are free-associating.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing with Campion's films are two shorts by "Orlando's" Sally Potter, 
"Thriller" and "The London Story."

FOLK TUNES WITH JAZZY RUSSIAN SPIN; MUSIC: WITH ANKLE BELLS FOR PERCUSSION AND 
EVERYONE IN THE GROUP ON BALALAIKA, LIMPOPO PLAYS IT FOR FUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Limpopo is a river in Africa; it runs from Transvaal across Mozambique. Just 
look it up. 
</P>
<P>
 But Limpopo is also a band specializing in "crazy Russian folk 'n' roll." 
Billed as "Igor, Igor, Igor and Igor," the foursome appears today at Fullerton 
College and Saturday at the San Juan Capistrano Regional Library. 
</P>
<P>
 " Igor thought of the name," said Oleg Bernov, who, according to the group's 
flyers, handles "off-key vocals, mega-bass balalaika and R.E.M. (Rapid Eyebrow 
Movements)." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just to confuse everybody. There's a Russian children's story about the 
Limpopo River in Africa. The second half of the name sounds like the Russian 
word for a person's bottom. To us it sounds exotic and goofy."  
</P>
<P>
 So does the band.  
</P>
<P>
 "Four Igors is only for fun," Bernov, 29, said with a laugh. "Sometimes we're 
Igor, Igor, Igor and Lopez."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are only two Igors: Igor Yuzov on "vocals, balalaika and 
melodramatic emotions" and Igor Khramov on "vocals, balalaika, trombone and 
food." Yuri Fedorko is featured on "vocals, balalaika, accordion and ankle 
bells" and in "amazing acrobatics." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they offer distinctive "rock, funk and jazz" renditions of such 
Russian favorites as "Korobochka" and "Ochi Chorniye" and international fare 
including "Twist and Shout" and "La Bamba." A self-produced recording features 
the likes of "Rok Eraund Ze Klok" and "Gop-Stop," described in liner notes as a 
"robbery love song from Odessa Mama." 
</P>
<P>
 Such tunes are at once tongue-in-cheek and cheeky, and always schmaltzy, 
boisterous fun. Some are in Russian, some in English -- and some in Spanish. 
"Igor used to have a Cuban girlfriend back in Moscow," Bernov said. "Besame 
mucho, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bernov, there's no way they'd limit themselves to traditional 
Russian folk music. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much traditional Russian folk music that we could be doing that 
forever," Bernov said. "It's a very deep well, Russian folk music. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in Russia it's silly to play Russian folk music. Not really silly, only I 
wouldn't consider doing it, since it's around us all the time. If I would tell 
my friends in Russia that's what I'm playing, they'd say, 'Man, you have 
nothing else to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko and Yuzov met at college in Moscow in the mid-'80s. They started 
playing Russian regional music, rock and tangos together and formed a band. In 
1988, they met Khramov at a Polish music festival; Bernov introduced himself to 
the other band members at a peace walk in Moscow, where Fedorko also met his 
American wife-to-be, Debbie Zeitman. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief U.S. tour in 1989 persuaded the group, which then included a drummer 
and a violinist, that this was where they wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorko was the first to emigrate. The others followed over the course of a 
year and under a variety of circumstances. By 1991, they were together again 
and winning fans on the Venice Boardwalk and Santa Monica Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Limpopo won Ed McMahon's International Star Search. "That's talent 
from all over the world," Bernov said. "A comedian from Sri Lanka, a singer 
from Mexico, models from China, Norway and Uruguay -- most of whom live in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The group is featured in a TV commercial for Hershey's Kit Kat bar: "People 
come up and say, 'Oh yeah, we saw you guys on that Pepsi commercial!' "  
</P>
<P>
 Bookings throughout the United States and Canada this summer, including the 
Sawdust Festival in Laguna Beach on July 10 and 16, Aug. 20 and 27, preclude 
too many sidewalk appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernov wouldn't say the band has been discovered, exactly, but neither is that 
the most important thing on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to make everything fun," Bernov said. "Life is fun. I was happy back 
in Russia. I'm happy here. Little by little, you get bigger and bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving in the United States, the group has begun writing its own 
tunes, which Bernov characterized as "romantic melodramas. Very, very 
dramatic." (Like people shooting themselves after breaking up? "Yes.") And 
Fedorko provides percussion in lieu of a bona fide drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a snare drum now, like in a marching band," Bernov explained. "But 
usually we use ankle bells. For every song. To give it a jingle." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum is Bernov's "mega-bass balalaika."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost as tall as me -- kind of rare, even in Russia," he said. "You 
know the balalaika, the little triangular shape instrument with three strings, 
sounds like a ukulele? It's an exploded version of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * Limpopo plays today at noon at the International Faire at Fullerton College, 
321 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. The fair starts at 11 a.m. Free. (714) 992-7178 
or 992-7168. The group also performs Saturday at 7 and 9 p.m. at the San Juan 
Capistrano Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real in San Juan Capistrano. Show 
times, 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. $3. (714) 493-1752.

STORM PRODUCES FUNNEL CLOUDS, SHOWERS; WIND TOPPLES TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A storm system churned through Central and Southern California on Tuesday, 
producing funnel clouds and a band of showers that brought morning traffic to a 
crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another wave of weather was bearing down on the region, the National 
Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six funnels were sighted north of Bakersfield at about 9 a.m. Tuesday, the 
weather service said. None were reported to have touched down. 
</P>
<P>
 Showers in the Los Angeles area made the morning drive a headache. Spin-outs 
and collisions dotted the city's busy freeways as rain measuring from one-tenth 
to three-tenths of an inch fell in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a sudden and violent burst of wind felled a dozen mature trees on 
the Cal Poly Pomona campus about 4 p.m. as faculty and students were arriving 
for evening classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw lots of debris flying and we saw some of our play equipment flying and 
that got real scary," said Consuelo Rodriguez, who was minding youngsters at a 
campus day care center. "The children looked out the window and they were 
frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries resulted from the display of nature's power, a campus spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite sudden," said university spokesman Norm Schneider. "The fact 
that nobody has found any injuries to buildings or people -- we're considering 
ourselves quite fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service said the strong winds were not a tornado or 
funnel cloud but just a violent downdraft from a thundercloud as the cold front 
passed overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our radar showed just light rain, nothing out of the ordinary," said 
meteorologist David Gomberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the region, slippery roads snarled traffic and contributed to at 
least one death in a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities reported a rash of less serious accidents throughout the region.

FRED KILIAN; PIONEER TV PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Kilian, a pioneer producer of Chicago-based network television shows 
including "Tin Pan Alley," has died at his home in Atlanta. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilian, who died Monday, created and produced shows for ABC before turning to 
a career in advertising. Other than the half-hour musical variety show in 1950, 
he worked on "The Mary Hartline Children's Show" in 1951, "Studs' Place" 
starring Studs Terkel from 1949 to 1951, and "Terry and the Pirates" in 1952, 
based on the comic strip of that title. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his own success in television, in the mid-1960s Kilian advised his 
son, Fred, who later became a successful novelist: "You'll never learn to write 
at a television station so go to work for a newspaper. There's no future in 
newspapers, but you'll learn something." 
</P>
<P>
 After working as an advertising executive in New York City for many years, the 
elder Kilian also ran his own advertising agencies in Florida and most recently 
in Atlanta.

TYLER THOMPSON; MISSIONARY IMPRISONED BY JAPAN IN WWII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tyler Thompson, a Methodist missionary, minister and professor of philosophy 
who was imprisoned in Singapore by the Japanese during World War II, has died. 
He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who had undergone quintuple heart bypass surgery two weeks ago, died 
Friday at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, said his wife of 20 months, 
Patricia Smith Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Corona, Thompson earned a degree in theoretical physics at Caltech in 
1936 before deciding on a career in the ministry. After earning a divinity 
degree at Boston College, he went to Singapore as a missionary teacher with his 
first wife, the former Phyllis Oechsli, who was the daughter of missionaries 
and was born in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset of the war, Thompson's wife and the couple's first child, 
Francia, fled to India, but Thompson stayed with their mission school. He was 
imprisoned when Singapore fell to the Japanese on Feb. 15, 1942, and remained a 
prisoner until the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his career, Thompson believed that religious leaders should be 
involved in political affairs, particularly where civil rights were concerned. 
After the war, he advocated United Nations trusteeship for Indonesia and other 
Far Eastern areas. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he was arrested while 
working for blacks' rights in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving briefly as a minister at Methodist churches in Massachusetts, 
Thompson spent most of his career teaching philosophy of religion at Garrett 
Evangelical Theological Seminary near Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as president of the Illinois American Civil Liberties Union chapter 
from 1959 to 1964, and in 1960 he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring to Pasadena, Thompson taught at Fuller Theological Seminary, 
tutored in Pasadena schools and worked with the social services program at 
Pasadena's First United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his second wife, he is survived by five children, Francia, 
Wendy, Heidi, Becky and Peter, and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for 2 p.m. Saturday at the First United 
Methodist Church, 500 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena.

KOON AGAIN TESTIFIES THAT KING BEATING WAS JUSTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressed in a blue prison uniform and wearing plastic sandals, former Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. Stacey C. Koon testified again Tuesday that the beating of 
Rodney G. King was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third trial in which Koon, who was the senior officer at the Lake 
View Terrace beating scene on March 3, 1991, had testified that neither he nor 
the officers under his command had violated Los Angeles Police Department 
policy in subduing King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I didn't do anything wrong," he said, testifying in King's lawsuit 
against him and 14 other defendants "I acted in good faith; I've taken full 
responsibility and accountability for my actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a federal jury awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages 
from the city. The same jury is now hearing testimony for the consideration of 
punitive damages against the four former officers who were at the scene, former 
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and 10 bystander officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon also took responsibility for the officers under his command, saying their 
actions were necessary to apprehend a dangerous suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Koon took the witness stand, he was greeted by several of the officers 
he had supervised that fateful night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been pleasant," Koon said, when asked by one of the officers about 
prison life in Northern California. After five months behind bars, Koon was 40 
pounds thinner and seemed to have lost the confidence he had exhibited during 
two earlier criminal trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendly encounter was in stark contrast to the chilly reception the 
officers gave Theodore J. Briseno, who earlier in the day tearfully testified 
about how he has become an outcast within police ranks. Briseno testified 
against Koon and fellow officers Laurence M. Powell and Timothy E. Wind during 
the first trial in Simi Valley in 1992. The videotape of that testimony was 
considered key to the convictions of Koon and Powell in last year's federal 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around this courtroom at these officers," Briseno said. "Not one of them 
likes me. No one across the street (at police headquarters) likes me. What I'm 
telling these jurors is I did what I thought was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno and Wind were acquitted in state and federal court of charges that 
they used excessive force in the beating of King. Koon and Powell are serving 
30-month sentences for their federal convictions of violating King's civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Powell testified that he believed the beating was warranted because 
King posed a threat to officers trying to subdue him after a high-speed chase. 
He said he thought at the time that King was under the influence of the drug 
PCP. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon was equally adamant in declaring his innocence. As he did in the earlier 
trial, Koon said he shot King with a Taser electric stun gun and ordered 
Briseno, Powell and Wind to beat and kick the suspect because he was resisting 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "My belief today, as I sit here, is that this was a managed and controlled use 
of force that followed the (LAPD's) policy, and did so to the book," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from John Burris, one of King's attorneys, Koon refused to 
alter his perceptions of events that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Burris showed several portions of the videotape where King was lying on the 
roadway being beaten by Powell, but Koon insisted that King was about to attack 
the officer. Burris pointed to a segment where King was hit with a baton in the 
midsection and was wincing in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon said he thought at the time that King was surveying the scene and 
preparing to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier testimony, Briseno said his willingness to criticize the 
actions of his fellow officers at the scene had made him a pariah among police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For three years, I've put up with this and it hurts," he said "I look over at 
Larry and Stacey and I think, 'Is it only me that's admitted something wrong 
happened out there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno tarnished his own testimony by saying that although he believed at the 
time of the beating that the officers' actions were wrong, his repeated viewing 
of the videotaped incident had altered that view. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Stone, who represents Powell, played the video of the beating 
in slow motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You now believe (King) was resisting?" Stone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some points on the video, yes," Briseno responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's permissible to use the baton to defeat active resistance?" Stone 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir," Briseno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone suggested that what is seen on the video is more accurate than what 
Briseno saw in person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your perceptions that night were incorrect and erroneous, weren't they?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some of the things, yes, sir," Briseno said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he left the stand, the officer said under questioning by one of 
King's lawyers, Federico Sayre, that most of the video shows an unjustified 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion was I couldn't understand it, and I could not justify it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after viewing the video, do you feel the force exerted on Mr. King was 
excessive?" Sayre asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I do," Briseno said.

RELIEF EFFORT FOR BOSNIANS STALLS ON SAN PEDRO WHARF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seemed like the perfect symbol of both the compassion and frustration many 
Americans feel about Bosnian war victims: four tons of donated food, clothing 
and medical supplies sitting forlornly on a wharf in San Pedro, about 6,400 
miles from their intended destination and no way to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 The relief supplies, which include crutches, canned food, aspirin and 8,000 
cloth diapers, were brought to Berth 53 at Los Angeles Harbor over the weekend 
by hundreds of private donors. They had heard radio reports about a relief 
drive organized by Stewart Resmer, a 43-year-old Santa Monica tow truck driver 
and a Vietnam War veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Resmer had planned to load the supplies onto the Lane Victory, a renovated 
World War II cargo ship that a group of former merchant seamen, most of them in 
their late 60s and 70s, intend to sail to Europe for ceremonies marking the 
50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion on the Normandy coast of France. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem was, as carload after carload of relief supplies arrived at 
the wharf, the ship was not there. It was in the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, 
taking on a load of stabilizing ballast for the upcoming voyage. And when the 
Lane Victory got back Monday to Berth 53, where the relief supplies were piled 
up under large blue tarps, the retired merchant seamen who are running the ship 
said the whole idea was news to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bosnia?" said Clint Johnson, coordinator for the Lane Victory's 18,000-mile, 
four-month European voyage, which is expected to begin Thursday. "We're not 
going anywhere near Bosnia. We're going to France." 
</P>
<P>
 Resmer, meanwhile, says he knows perfectly well where Bosnia is. But he still 
wants the 455-foot Lane Victory to take the relief supplies to France for 
delivery to relief agencies that might take them to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got all this empty cargo space, so why not take some relief 
supplies?" said Resmer, an ex-Marine who has done some volunteer work aboard 
the Lane Victory during the past few years. "It's the height of hypocrisy if 
they don't do this. I mean, these are guys who helped stop the Nazis in World 
War II. We're facing the same sort of thing right now in Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of talk irritates the Lane Victory crew members, all of them members 
of the U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II. The San Pedro-based 
national organization that rescued the 1945-vintage ship from mothballs in 1989 
has spent countless hours and more than $1 million fixing it up. It's 
especially irritating, crew members say, when it comes from a relative 
youngster who was not even born when the merchant seamen were hauling cargoes 
through dangerous waters in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Resmer) started this whole thing on his own," said Jerry Turner, 67, who 
runs the ship's store on the Lane Victory. "He didn't even ask anybody on the 
ship about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Resmer, meanwhile, said that if the Lane Victory does not take the supplies, 
would load them into a metal shipping container and try to find another ship to 
take them to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, Lane Victory crew members said the relief supplies were being 
loaded onto a truck, their immediate destination unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the relief drive) probably should have been a little better organized," 
said Holly Collins, 40, a Santa Monica artist who collected more than two dozen 
boxes of supplies and brought them to the wharf. "But it came from the heart."

PASS THE SALT; THE GREAT POPCORN SCARE FAILS TO BREAK HABIT OF MATINEE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was heedless, raffish. You could almost smell it on her -- that air of . . 
. of . . . hot buttered popcorn at the movie matinee. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress tossed her famous black hair, grabbed her preschooler's tiny hand 
and swept into an afternoon showing of "Monkey Trouble" at the Beverly Center 
Cineplex Odeon with the saturated-fat-equivalent of 15 hot dogs under her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I know," spat Theresa Saldana with a devil-may-care laugh. "And I plan 
on enjoying every kernel." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you, too, have heard it by now -- the announcement this week that 
movie theater popcorn can be hazardous to your health. According to the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest, most theaters still pop their kernels with 
artery-clogging coconut oil -- a method that lards movie popcorn with so much 
saturated fat that a medium plain popcorn is actually twice as fatty as a Big 
Mac meal, including fries. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just the popcorn without butter. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Beverly Center on Tuesday, the matinee crowd was laughing in the 
face of obesity. This may be no big deal in, say, Minneapolis, but in Los 
Angeles, cottage cheese thighs are nothing to snicker about. This, in short, 
was news. But they took it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw," philosophized Valerie Armstrong, nursing a medium buttered popcorn, 
"there are so damn few things you can enjoy in life. I plan on enjoying this." 
</P>
<P>
 Giggling guiltily, she grabbed a handful of the greasy yellow stuff and 
knocked back a steaming kernel or two. There were approximately 11 cups worth 
of popcorn in her bag-o'-death, with almost as much saturated fat as a 
bacon-and-eggs breakfast, a Big Mac, a large fries and a steak dinner with all 
the trimmings -- combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she reconsidered, turned on her heel, and dumped about a quarter-cup of 
salt on top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to live on the edge," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were in denial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't! Don't tell me anything about this popcorn that I don't want to hear," 
begged Paulette McNeely as her toddler niece and her nephew crammed fat little 
fistfuls into their happy mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 Others expressed shock and vowed they would change, but it was clear their 
dependency had gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "So they've been lying to us," muttered 23-year-old actress Dru Mouser, 
obviously embittered. "Like everyone. Like the cigarette industry!" 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously in shock, she stared into space, absently reaching into her 
red-and-yellow sack for a steaming handful of hot buttered betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was the rare customer who was avoiding popcorn, even in the wake of 
this week's report. In fact, only one person out of perhaps 20 in a random 
moviegoer-in-the-refreshment-line survey was refusing even to consider such a 
snack, and that was the concessionaire working in front of the radiant, 
chrome-and-glass popcorn machine. (It turns out you feel a lot less friendly 
toward the stuff when you come home smelling like it night after night.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Fevrile Cohen, a 23-year-old makeup artist heading in to see "Backbeat," 
said she may start smuggling her own, homemade, popcorn into her matinees. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, she had not heard about the FDA studies three years ago, indicating 
that those little browning strips in some brands of microwaveable popcorn 
contain traces of cancer-causing benzene.

L.A. HELPS PAVE WAY FOR SPEED HUMPS; ROADS: COUNCIL OKS A PLAN TO LET 
NEIGHBORHOODS REQUEST THE ASPHALT HILLOCKS TO SLOW TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't call them bumps. They are humps. And they may be coming soon to a street 
near you, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday moved ahead with a plan that would allow the 
installation of asphalt humps to prevent speeding on residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 These humps would be slow risers -- peaking at just three inches above road 
level and stretching for 12 feet. That's supposed to be mild enough to spare 
automotive transmissions, but jarring enough to slow drivers by 10 miles per 
hour or more, city transportation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The humps should not be confused with bumps, their parking-lot cousins that 
are up to eight inches high and deliver a much sharper jolt, the engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the name, the city's lawmakers voted unanimously to draw up plans 
that would allow neighborhood groups to request installation of asphalt 
hillocks on their streets. A standard three-hump set -- typically spaced 250 
feet apart and striped with white paint -- will cost about $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in speed hump zones would pay for the installation. The council 
asked officials to search for public funds to help poor communities foot the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for speed humps is intense. About 200 informal requests have already 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get more calls about this than I do about crime," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan gets final council approval in about two weeks, neighborhood 
groups will be allowed to petition to have humps installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Signatures would have to be obtained from 75% of the residents on a block to 
initiate a request.  
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials will decide which projects to tackle first, and will 
give priority to requests for humps on the most dangerous streets and to the 
earliest applications. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Los Angeles has had 15 test sites. An analysis of the pilot 
program showed that on residential streets best suited for the humps -- speeds 
dropped by 10 to 17 m.p.h. That brought speeds down to a permissible 25 to 30 
m.p.h., said Tom Swire, a senior city transportation engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city attorney's office is concerned about the legal liability the 
humps might create if they cause accidents, particularly because the California 
Department of Transportation does not specifically authorize them as "traffic 
control devices." 
</P>
<P>
 That has led to some semantic and legal maneuvering. The city is trying to 
have the humps declared "roadway design features," akin to traffic islands or 
median barriers. Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) has attached a provision 
to an omnibus transportation bill that would make the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities that have gone ahead with speed humps without the state's imprimatur 
have apparently not suffered as a result, but Los Angeles and other 
jurisdictions have proceeded more cautiously, said Assistant City Atty. Shelley 
Smith. "We would feel more comfortable if the legal authority to install the 
hump had been established," Smith said. "It enhances the city's position if 
there is litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Transit engineers said that, regardless of legal underpinnings, the devices 
are safe. Police cars zipped over humps in tests at 50 m.p.h., according to a 
report, "with no loss of control, or discomfort." Heavy firetrucks had to slow 
considerably more, but would not be delayed much unless they hit an unusually 
large concentration of humps in one neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 And residents are clamoring for anything that will slow down speeders, said 
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. "People feel very strongly that pets and children 
and even seniors are having a hard time crossing (the street) with these high 
speeds." 
</P>
<P>
 The humps will come with signs. But, bureaucratic terminology aside, the signs 
will call them bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to call them bumps on the signs and not humps," Swire said. 
"Otherwise they tend to end up on fraternity house walls."

CLASHING SYMBOLS; SWASTIKAS ON GATES OF VALLEY BUDDHIST TEMPLE ARE SIGNS OF 
PEACE, BUT TO MANY THEY ARE A PAINFUL REMINDER OF THE HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS and SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two simple lines, bent into one of the Western world's most hated symbols, 
have also come to represent the complex weave, and increasing tangle, of 
cultures in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chinese monk and his students two months ago installed six one-foot-wide 
swastikas -- symbols of peace to Buddhists but symbols of Nazism to Westerners 
-- in the wrought-iron gates at the entrance to a Chatsworth home they are 
converting to a Buddhist temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The saffron-colored, two-story home is in the middle of a block that in some 
ways typifies the Valley. There are white, Asian American, Middle-Eastern and 
Latino neighbors, as well as a Jewish family who lost relatives during the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is not surprising that the emblems have prompted complaints to police 
and the local office of the Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern in looking into it was that some of the calls were rather 
threatening in nature," said Mary Krasn, director of the league's Valley 
office. "People who called implied that there might be harm to the residents." 
</P>
<P>
 No harm has come to anyone affiliated with the American Hwa Yen Buddhist 
Studies group that is building the De Soto Avenue temple. But recently two of 
the swastikas were sawed off -- the spent hacksaw blades left behind on the 
temple driveway, the fresh metal scars on the fence already turning to rust. 
</P>
<P>
 This sudden controversy has caught Mona Truong, a temple member, by surprise. 
She said what others call a swastika is a common symbol used to mark Buddhist 
temples throughout Asia. It is called van in Vietnamese. The Nazis called it 
Hakenkreuz.  
</P>
<P>
 "It means peace and it is in all the Buddhist temples," said Truong, of Canoga 
Park, who came to the United States from Vietnam 14 years ago. "It is like the 
cross in Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
 So common is its use that Chinese maps use the symbol to designate the 
locations of Buddhist temples. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Truong said, the emblem at the temple has perpendicular arms that 
point in the opposite direction of those on the swastika used in Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Evelyn Silverman, a neighbor whose relatives were among the 6 million 
Jews to die in the Holocaust, the emblem is a hated reminder of war, not peace. 
Her grandmother died en route to a concentration camp, she said. Her daughter 
saw the gates this past weekend and, like others who have seen the emblems, the 
two women reacted with shock and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that the gates were made for a Buddhist temple, Silverman said 
her anger has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 But, still, "I think when you live in the U.S. you have to conform a little 
bit to our culture. . . . I think they should realize why people would question 
it in this country and be more sensitive," she said. However, she does not want 
them removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Debbie Silverman, said she has mixed feelings about whether the 
temple should keep them on display. "I wouldn't want to inhibit their rights, 
but I think a lot of people are going to take it the way I took it." 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict is a typical growing pain for the Valley, which over the past 
decade has seen its white majority nearly overtaken by minority residents from 
around the globe. Whites made up more than 90% of the Valley population through 
the 1960s. By 1990, they made up a little more than half. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good example of the cross-cultural conflict that ignorance brings 
on," said Kenyon Chan, chairman of the Asian American studies department at Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The temple has a large responsibility in educating neighbors and helping them 
understand who they are and what they are. . . . And I think that someone's 
attempt to eradicate the symbol showed their ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the temple monk nor his representatives were available to talk about 
the controversy. Truong said they are abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Jewish leaders have come to the defense of the Buddhist temple. The San 
Fernando Valley is home to an estimated 250,000 Jews and an estimated 10,000 
residents who practice Buddhism or have been raised as Buddhists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who overreacted and who, before they got the information, 
were hysterical," said Rabbi Ronald Stern, 32, of Temple Ahavat Shalom in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern received so many calls about the gate that he sent faxes to local rabbis 
and temple directors this week explaining that the swastikas on De Soto Avenue 
were put up by Buddhists, and have no relation to neo-Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, as Jews, we have to do everything we can to assure their security 
and freedom of expression of religion to the extent that it doesn't infringe 
upon others' rights to express their religion," Stern said. "And in this case, 
it does not." 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, the swastika is a common symbol for blessings and when posted outside 
is meant to bestow good wishes on passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The swastika is a very old symbol and there is nothing bad about (a) 
swastika," said Havanpola Ratanasara, president of the College of Buddhist 
Studies in Los Angeles and executive president of the American Buddhist 
Congress. "Swastika in Asia is considered a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, one Los Angeles-area Buddhist leader said this week that he stopped 
using the swastika -- the word means blessings in Sanskrit -- once he learned 
of its negative connotation here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Chao Chu, abbott of the Rosemead Buddhist Monastery, said he used to 
bring back swastika pendants for children when he returned from trips to Asia 
until an American-born temple member explained why their use might be 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu, whose temple includes about 370 members from China and Southeast Asia, 
said he often works with Jewish groups in his role as a religious leader and 
did not want to offend anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to avoid misunderstanding if we want to stay here and work in 
harmony," Chu said. "Misunderstanding is the biggest problem."

U.S. HIGH COURT ORDERS REVIEW OF MURDER CASE; RULING: STATE JUSTICES ARE TOLD 
TO RECONSIDER THE CONVICTION OF A MAN ON DEATH ROW FOR KILLING A 10-YEAR-OLD 
GIRL IN 1982. HE WAS NOT READ HIS RIGHTS UNTIL 30 MINUTES AFTER POLICE PICKED 
HIM UP. 
</P>

<P>
 In a slap at California's high court, the U.S. Supreme Court told the state 
justices Tuesday to reconsider the case of a convicted Pomona child murderer 
who was questioned by police in 1982 before he was given the Miranda warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, although a setback for the state, gives prosecutors and state 
judges a second chance to explain why Robert Stansbury was not "in custody" 
after four armed police officers came to his home at 11 p.m. and took him to 
the jailhouse for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 On that September night 12 years ago, Los Angeles county homicide 
investigators were looking for the killer of a 10-year-old Baldwin Park girl 
who had been abducted the day before from her neighborhood. Her body was found 
in Pasadena after a man walking his dog saw a large turquoise car come to a 
stop and its tall driver throw something heavy from the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Police soon learned that two ice cream truck drivers were seen in the Baldwin 
Park area talking to young children. One of them was Stansbury. But based on a 
child's comment, police thought the other driver was the prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Police quickly tracked down both suspects and brought them to the station for 
questioning. But they failed to warn Stansbury of his right to remain silent or 
to offer the aid of a lawyer during the first 30 minutes of interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long, grueling trial in Pomona, Stansbury was convicted of the girl's 
murder, in part based on his statements made during the first 30 minutes of 
questioning by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Miranda vs. Arizona decision of 1966, the high court has said 
repeatedly that when a suspect is taken "in custody" for questioning, police 
must first warn him of these rights. In follow-up rulings, the court has said 
that a suspect is in custody when police have him under control and a 
"reasonable man in the suspect's shoes" would not feel "free to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the California Supreme Court upheld Stansbury's conviction and 
death sentence last year and rejected his Miranda claim on the grounds that 
homicide investigators had not "focused suspicion" on him as their prime 
suspect when they picked him up for questioning. In a brief, unanimous opinion 
Tuesday, the justices said that this "analysis conflicts with our opinions. . . 
. Our cases make clear, in no uncertain terms, that any inquiry into whether 
the officers have focused their suspicions upon the individual being questioned 
. . . is not relevant for purposes of Miranda." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, the high court said that judges should look at what the police 
did, not what they were thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely does the Supreme Court under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist reverse 
a criminal conviction based on a procedural violation. But during the oral 
argument last month, it was clear that most of the justices were upset by the 
legal standard adopted by the California courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they stopped short of reversing the conviction outright and ordering a 
new trial. Instead, their ruling in the case (Stansbury vs. California, 
93-5770) orders the state high court to restudy the case based on "the 
objective facts" of what took place on the night of Sept. 29, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys in the case disagreed on the likely outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco attorney Robert M. Westberg, who represents Stansbury, said that 
the "totality of the facts certainly indicate this person was in custody." He 
contended that any reasonable person would think he was in custody if picked up 
late at night by four armed police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Atty. Gen. Aileen Bunney said Stansbury "consented" to come in for 
questioning.  
</P>
<P>
 "I believe they (state judges) will look at the objective facts and the result 
will be the same," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane Gillette, who coordinates death penalty cases, 
insisted that Stansbury's conviction and death sentence will be upheld even 
with a stricter standard for Miranda rights. Tuesday's ruling, he said, 
contains "no implication that the end result is incorrect. It simply says there 
is a need to review the criteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard D. Burns, the deputy district attorney who prosecuted Stansbury, 
expressed confidence that the initial interrogation will be proven to have met 
the Miranda requirements. The ruling, he said, will turn out to be "much ado 
about nothing."  
</P>
<P>
 If the police officers' unspoken frame of mind can not be included in a 
decision about whether Stansbury was considered a suspect right away, then 
their treatment of him will show Stansbury did not merit an immediate reading 
of his rights, Burns added. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in 1982 asked Stansbury if he wanted to drive himself to the station 
and, when he declined, he was given a front seat in the police car. "He was not 
patted down, not handcuffed. He was put in the front seat next to the officers' 
weapons. This is not generally the manner you are transported if police suspect 
you have recently been involved in a murder case," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the state Supreme Court now concludes that police erred by not giving 
Stansbury his Miranda warnings, they can still rule that the mistake was a 
"harmless error." Prosecutors could argue that his initial admissions during 
questioning did not affect the jury's final ruling. If so, the court could 
still uphold his conviction and death sentence.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GRIEGO 
PLANS TO OPEN RLA OFFICES IN POOR AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After having trimmed the staff of RLA in half because of budget concerns, the 
riot recovery agency's new president, Linda Griego, told board members Tuesday 
that she plans to open three satellite offices in an effort to reach out to 
small businesses in impoverished neighborhoods across Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a quarterly meeting of the RLA board, Griego said the offices 
would be created in South-Central Los Angeles, Southeast Los Angeles and the 
Van Nuys/Pacoima area. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA staffers based in those offices would seek to set up networks of small 
businesses that could work together on marketing and training programs in order 
to reduce costs and increase jobs. The offices would also provide general 
business assistance and develop apprenticeship programs for some of the 
estimated 115,000 small businesses in neighborhoods that were scarred by the 
riots that began two years ago Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Since its formation as the city's main response to the rioting, the private 
agency has drawn fire from community groups that term it ineffective. RLA has 
targeted it efforts in Los Angeles County neighborhoods in which at least 20% 
of the population lives beneath the federally defined poverty level.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MAGIC JOHNSON, SONY TO 
OPEN 12-SCREEN THEATER IN BALDWIN HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by city officials, including Mayor Richard Riordan, and 
representatives of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Earvin (Magic) Johnson 
announced a new partnership Tuesday that will bring a 12-screen multiplex 
theater to Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Hills theater, which will be owned jointly by Johnson and Sony 
Theatres, will be the first in a chain that promises to locate in underserved 
minority neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a first-class operation with first-class service," Johnson said, 
flashing his trademark smile. "Everything this community has always wanted, the 
type of service it deserves, will be right here. You won't have to drive 20 
miles to get it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The new complex, expected to cost between $11 million and $15 million, will 
boast a large glass atrium, plush seats, state-of-the-art stereo sound and 
projection and lobby video monitors. It will be a prototype for a new, upscale 
theater that Sony Theatres, formerly Loews Theatres, says it wants to make its 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Theatres co-chairwoman Barrie Lawson Loeks said the demographics of the 
Crenshaw community, which includes affluent Baldwin Hills, Windsor Hills, View 
Park and Leimert Park, made the plaza an ideal location for the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I toured the neighborhood last fall, I was astounded at how many people 
with substantial incomes had such a paucity of movie theaters," said Loeks, who 
also operates Loeks Michigan Theatres and Loeks-Star Theatres, also in 
Michigan. "We didn't have to be convinced that this was a good deal. This was a 
no-brainer." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall, which was a joint venture of developer Alexander Haagen and the city 
of Los Angeles, has struggled financially since opening in 1988. After city 
officials threatened to sue Haagen last month when he sold the mall and cut 
them out of potential profits, an agreement was reached in which profits will 
be split evenly. A Community Redevelopment Agency official said the multiplex 
deal, which Johnson had proposed funding last year, hinged on a satisfactory 
resolution of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal caps a two-year effort to bring a multiplex to the plaza. ERIN J.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 20 MAY FACE CHARGES IN 
PHONE CALLING CARD FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG and PATRICK J. McDONNELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 20 suspects are expected to be charged this week with telephone 
calling card fraud in a Huntington Park case that authorities and industry 
representatives say may be the largest crackdown on such black market calls 
ever conducted in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park police teamed up with LDDS Metromedia Communications, the 
nation's fourth-largest long distance company, to target pirated long distance 
calls from pay phones in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, brokers stationed at phone booths place the calls using stolen 
calling card numbers. They charge clients a flat fee that is a bargain compared 
to commercial rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities arrested at least 20 suspects during a sweep last Sunday, said 
Detective Shawn Moore. Most placed calls to Mexico using the services of the 
middlemen who had stolen numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious violators -- those who allegedly peddled the stolen numbers 
and pocketed the fees -- could face up to a year in prison and fines of up to 
$10,000, Moore said. People who paid the brokers for the illegal calls are 
expected to be charged with misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five of the 20 arrested were brokers, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone fraud costs the communications industry $3 billion annually, said 
John Elerick, senior investigator for LDDS Metromedia, based in Jackson, Miss. 
More than half the losses involve calls made from pay phones using stolen 
calling card numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is particularly widespread in immigrant neighborhoods. Often, the 
calls are placed to families back home. 
</P>
<P>
 For users, the savings can be substantial. A broker using a stolen number may 
charge $10 or $15 for a lengthy call that may cost five or 10 times that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Park operation targeted suspects using pay phones from noon to 
4 p.m. Sunday along Pacific Boulevard in the city's downtown business district. 
Company officials used computers to pinpoint phone booths where the illegal 
calls were being made, and police moved in and arrested those making the calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "While they were on the phone to their mom back in Mexico, we could arrest 
them for using a bad card," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Huntington Park calls, it turned out, were charged to a single number 
belonging to a Texas firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Those dealing in fraudulent cards may acquire the numbers in a variety of 
ways, officials say, including spying on callers as they punch in numbers at 
pay phones and eavesdropping as users inform operators of numbers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY TO 
CHALLENGE HOMELESS RIGHT TO SURPLUS PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council will join lobbying efforts to amend a federal law 
that gives homeless groups the first right to surplus government property. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 12 to 0 Tuesday to direct its lobbyists in Washington 
to start work on proposed changes that would give local communities a voice in 
decisions made under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was brought to the council's attention last month when a 
South-Central organization was given permission to run a large homeless shelter 
on surplus Navy housing in San Pedro. Residents protested, saying the 
organization did not have the qualifications to run such a program.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal Health and Human Services Department approved an application in 
February by Turner's Technical Institute Inc. to run a homeless program for up 
to 880 people on Taper Avenue. Inconsistencies in the application are now being 
reviewed by the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing and Urban Development Department also is reviewing the approval it 
gave when it declared the property suitable for use by the homeless. Under 
federal regulations, two large tanks holding aviation fuel are too close to 
buildings on the site.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ADDITIONAL 
CREWS WORKING TO REMOVE QUAKE RUBBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a slow start to the city's earthquake cleanup program, Los Angeles 
officials said Tuesday they have speeded up the debris removal effort by more 
than doubling the number of work crews hired to haul away rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Works Department had put 100 work crews on the street by Monday, 
compared to 40 crews last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have a hundred crews we can really get down to picking it up," 
said Andy Santamaria, manager of the city's quake recovery program. The crews 
are expected to haul away 11,000 tons of rubble a day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sluggish start was attributed to an unexpectedly high volume of debris 
dumped on the streets immediately after the Jan. 17 quake, forcing city 
officials to exhaust all the federal cleanup funds available at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a new infusion of money from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, the city added 20 new crews on Sunday and an additional 40 crews on 
Monday, Santamaria said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of an ad hoc earthquake recovery committee of the City Council 
expressed relief with the accelerated cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really getting bad out there," said Councilman Hal Bernson, the 
committee chairman.

DWP VULNERABLE TO ABUSE IN CONTRACTS, AUDIT FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lack of well-defined controls has left the Department of Water and Power 
vulnerable to widespread abuses in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
outside contracts it grants annually, an independent audit revealed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that there are some very serious problems over at the DWP," City 
Controller Rick Tuttle said of the audit. Tuttle's suspicions of abuse led him 
to force the audit last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of money involved," he said Tuesday. "The findings cry out for 
the DWP to tighten its safeguards." 
</P>
<P>
 In its report released Tuesday, Ernst & Young, the consulting firm that 
performed the audit, said that although "many areas of the contracting process 
are working well," there are "significant and critical portions that lacked 
internal and management controls." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying there's any wrongdoing," Larry Seigel, an Ernst & Young 
partner, said Tuesday. "We're saying, instead, that there's an opportunity for 
wrongdoing."  
</P>
<P>
 Ernst & Young says in its report that "there are few formal, written policies 
and procedures which have been documented, agreed to, communicated and enforced 
throughout the department." 
</P>
<P>
 There is virtually no consistent measurement of performance or errors related 
to the contracting process, the report adds. "The result is a lack of . . . 
accountability for missed deadlines, avoidable amendments (to contracts), 
costly errors or slow payments." 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors say that 80% of the contract administrators interviewed said that 
they allow contractors to begin working before purchase orders are established, 
a practice that usually preempts review of the initial work. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five of 30 DWP contract administrators interviewed said they would 
request a contract, recommend who should get it, approve the contractor's 
production, review the contractor's invoices and authorize the payments to the 
contractor, the auditors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "While having contract administrators involved in every stage of the 
contracting process is efficient, it also makes it easier for the contract 
administrator to carry out inappropriate activities," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Moore, the DWP's director of communications, said Tuesday that the DWP is 
"pleased with the audit" and, "in large part, we agree with the suggestions for 
change. . . ."

VOTING STIRS EMOTIONS FOR SOUTH AFRICANS IN L.A.; CIVIL RIGHTS: THEY LINE UP AT 
CONSULATE TO CAST ABSENTEE BALLOTS. THE MILESTONE ELECTION INSPIRES EVERYTHING 
FROM JUBILATION TO FEAR OF NEW TURMOIL IN THEIR HOMELAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Samuel Paul -- who was jailed six times, interrogated repeatedly and 
beaten by police in his native South Africa -- voting for the first time was a 
bittersweet experience. 
</P>
<P>
 He had fought for all South Africans, regardless of color, to have the right 
to vote. And now that day was here. But as he waited in line in front of the 
South African Consulate in Beverly Hills to cast his absentee ballot in the 
country's first all-race election, he felt lonely rather than jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a need to celebrate with those who have sacrificed so much to make 
this day possible," said Paul, who left South Africa five years ago to attend 
theological school in Los Angeles. "Standing in this line I feel very alone."  
</P>
<P>
 After more than 40 years of apartheid, the overwhelming black majority in 
South Africa are casting ballots for the first time in the hopes of electing a 
government that will repudiate racism and pursue equality through multiparty 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In four consulates and more than 20 other voting locations in the United 
States, about 100,000 expatriate South Africans were expected to cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a mood of conflict, not camaraderie, in voting lines. Many said this 
reflected decades of separate and unequal conditions for whites and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a warm feeling in this line," Paul said. "Some whites, I think, 
feel awkward waiting in a voting line with blacks. And for me, regardless of 
how they vote, white people still symbolize oppression. That's something that's 
indelibly inscribed on my psyche. That's what living under apartheid does to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 For some in line, casting a ballot represents economic opportunity. Now that 
South Africa is no longer an international pariah, the country's economy is 
burgeoning, and some plan to move back home to take advantage of the boom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lebo Morake said he is returning because, for the first time in his life, 
he feels he belongs somewhere. "All those years of suffering in exile were 
instantly erased the moment I scribbled my vote on a piece of paper," said 
Morake, who came to the United States in 1979.  
</P>
<P>
 Morake said he intends to open the country's first black-owned movie sound 
track company. 
</P>
<P>
 While many in line still were angry that blacks could not vote for so long, 
Rick DuToit argued that the timing of the election was appropriate. "This isn't 
something you can rush through in a few months," said DuToit, one of a majority 
of whites in the Beverly Hills line. "It takes a while. The time was right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 DuToit, a computer software consultant, and his wife, Suzette, were not as 
sanguine about South Africa's future as others in line.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of promises made and people have a lot of expectations now," 
said Suzette DuToit. "If those expectations for a better life are not met, 
there is no telling what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But Samuel Paul contended that South Africa's future at least will be better 
than its past. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this day had not come now, there would have been a revolution in South 
Africa," Paul said. "Not being able to vote strips people of their humanity. 
It's pathetic that here I am, a 34-year-old man, and I am voting for the first 
time in my life."

<P>
 As 80-year-old Jale Inan tells the story in her sunlit living room above the 
Bosporus, a simple question of justice has taken her to war with the Boston 
Museum of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I excavated that statue; it was stolen from us, and it belongs in Turkey. I 
want my statue back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inan is battling to recover the top half of a 1,800-year-old statue of a weary 
Hercules. She says the marble chunk of history was stolen from an archeological 
dig she directs in southern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 No way, says the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am ready to go and sit there until I get it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sit-in against an American cultural icon by an octogenarian Turkish scholar 
who is something shorter than five feet and a good bit less than 100 pounds? 
Maybe not, but educated fur is flying, and Inan is a pertinacious soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Her herculean quest is symptomatic of a new combativeness among countries that 
are the often unwitting and always unhappy source of antiquities. Her campaign 
is underwritten by a Turkish government embarked in high-profile counterattack 
against what it considers three centuries of plunder by villains from 
grave-robbing farmers to eminent archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey wants its treasures back, and its assertive stick-and-carrot recovery 
program, which began to bear fruit last fall, is drawing attention from other 
Mediterranean nations alarmed at the loss of artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The undertaking is controversial. It is not calculated to comfort foreign 
collectors or museums. And it has become a national priority for Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey is the principal source of classical artifacts that find their way to 
First World markets today, about $100 million to $200 million worth per year by 
official estimate. A crossroads nation spanning Europe and Asia, host to 36 
civilizations across the centuries, Turkey claims more ancient Greek cities 
than Greece, more Roman cities than Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how much time I spend on the phone with our lawyers," said Engin 
Ozgen, the ebullient professor who is director general of monuments and museums 
at the Turkish Ministry of Culture in Ankara. 
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder. Export of cultural artifacts is illegal in Turkey, and Ozgen 
may become history's most litigious archeologist. He watches over a $50-million 
war chest that Turkey has earmarked to selectively pursue stolen or illegally 
exported antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will spend millions if necessary to prove our ownership. Sometimes 
collectors and museums can't afford legal costs, but Turkey is a country; it is 
rich enough to pay these large bills," Ozgen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke from an American cigarette wreathed his well-trimmed beard as rap music 
ricocheted off the baroque chandelier in his office. Ozgen caressed the glossy 
auction catalogues that he studies in search of purloined treasure. A New York 
gallery withdrew a 6th-Century BC marble torso of a boy from auction last year 
after Turkey claimed that it was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go after everything that has left Turkey, but we are making symbolic 
recoveries while at the same time educating people with the idea of stopping 
smuggling," Ozgen said. "Around the world, collectors are thinking twice now 
about the origin of what is offered them. 'Was it smuggled from Turkey? Will 
they chase us?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the Boston Hercules, Ozgen says he is also feuding with the Dumbarton 
Oaks Museum in Washington over 6th-Century religious objects from a Byzantine 
monastery. He has a lawsuit pending against a museum in Basel, Switzerland, 
over an inscribed stone pillar from ancient Phrygia, and he is demanding 
posthaste return of an errant 3,000-year-old sphinx from a Berlin museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece has also turned to American courts. It sued a New York dealer last year 
to recover Mycenaean jewelry from the 15th Century BC that it claims was stolen 
by grave robbers in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 A signal victory of the nascent Turkish offensive was the return last year by 
New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art of the 363-piece "Lydian Hoard," an 
exquisite collection of silver and gold jewelry, bowls, incense burners and 
coins from the 6th Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 1966, Ozgen says, villagers near Sardis in west-central Turkey robbed a 
series of neighboring tombs from the time of the Lydian King Croesus (as in 
"rich as . . . "). By 1968, the buried treasures had found their way to New 
York, where the Met paid around $1.5 million for three separate lots, 
cautiously labeled them "East Greek" and delayed displaying them -- a case of a 
bad conscience, it would turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, Turkish newspaperman Ozgen Acar dogged the treasure, 
eventually tracing it from the villagers who stole it to pieces in the museum 
first significantly displayed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum rejected Turkey's claims, and the lawyers took over in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years and almost $3 million later, with the lawsuit still unresolved, the 
Met bowed gracefully last fall to what Director Philippe de Montebello called 
"a unique confluence of factors." 
</P>
<P>
 "Turkish authorities did provide evidence that most of the material in 
question may indeed have been removed clandestinely from tombs in the Usak 
region, much of it only months before the museum acquired it," De Montebello 
said at the time. More, "our own records suggested some museum staff during the 
1960s were likely aware, even as they acquired these objects, that their 
provenance was controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lydian Hoard is now on display at the national Museum of Anatolian 
Civilizations in Ankara, where Director Tuzun Gunel says it fits seamlessly 
into a collection of objects recovered by Turkish specialists in the area from 
which it was originally stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet critics say Turkey is hardly in a position to boast about the preservation 
and display of antiquities it already controls. Storehouses full of 
less-valuable surplus antiquities slumber far from public gaze. The Lydian 
Hoard will eventually be displayed at a museum in Usak near where it was found, 
to be seen by a fraction of those who might have marveled at it in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozgen, who oversees 175 museums and 120 excavations, says legal action for 
recovery is a last resort. Turkey, where by his estimate there are 200,000 
burial mounds still waiting to be explored, has powerful incentives with which 
to repay foreigners who cooperate in the return of smuggled artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is the common cultural heritage of all humankind, and our policy 
is to share it. We will happily lend to exhibitions, give excavations permits, 
scholarships and access to our museums and archives," Ozgen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, there is also the charitable American-Turkish Society. 
Donors wishing to dispose of, say, an awkward 2nd-Century Roman sarcophagus may 
give it to the foundation and write it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the foundation does make occasional gifts to the Turkish government. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, there happened to be a particular garland sarcophagus in the Brooklyn 
Museum -- a three-ton marble coffin of splendid mien and dubious provenance. 
Its owner donated the sarcophagus to the society after the museum declined to 
accept it as a gift; journalist Acar and a colleague, Melik Kaylan, had 
reconstructed its weighty journey from Anatolia to Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Hoving, former director of New York's Met, says Brooklyn trustees might 
have accepted the sarcophagus had not Turkish newspapers a lot more recent than 
the 2nd Century turned up inside when the lid was pried off. The sarcophagus, 
valued by Turkish officials at $3.5 million, was flown home from Brooklyn last 
week and went on display Tuesday in the Istanbul Archeological Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in a recent issue of Art & Auction magazine, Hoving says, "When it 
comes to wresting illegally or illicitly ripped away pieces of the national 
artistic patrimony from the clutches of American museums, private collectors 
and dealers, and finagling them back home, nobody does it better than the 
Turks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoving calls the Turks' use of a charitable foundation as middleman "the most 
creative incentive in the history of museums and collecting to guarantee the 
successful regaining of their priceless stolen heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 The question of who owns cultural treasures of bygone civilizations -- Greek, 
Roman, Egyptian, Chinese or Incan -- has long vexed supplier and buyer alike. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, there have been Egyptian obelisks in Roman piazzas for 2,000 years. 
A procession of invaders looted Rome across the centuries: Nazi artistic 
pillage of occupied Europe was preceded by Napoleonic looting. Venice's four 
bronze horses galloping atop St. Mark's were lifted from Byzantine 
Constantinople, now Turkish Istanbul. The Istanbul Archeological Museum has a 
lovely set of ancient sarcophagi arduously transported from Sidon, then 
Ottoman-ruled, but now a city in Lebanon. Turkey, by contrast, has a powerful 
claim to the sphinx that German archeologists carted off in 1917 with the 
promise to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece, for its part, has for nearly half a century demanded the return of the 
Elgin Marbles -- the frieze from around the Acropolis removed in the 19th 
Century. The British Museum, where the Marbles are a prized exhibit (along with 
the Rosetta stone, a linguistic celebration of three civilizations found by 
French troops in Egypt), refuses, arguing that such a precedent could lead to 
the emptying of museums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The only international treaty governing the return of artifacts is a 1970 
UNESCO convention, notes Malcolm Evans, secretary general of Unidroit, an 
international legal institute based in Rome that is one of the United Nations' 
specialized agencies. "So few 'importing' countries have ratified that for all 
intents and purposes it doesn't work," he said. The United States ratified the 
treaty in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 A new convention expected to be open for ratification next year will make 
recovery easier for "exporting" nations ranging from Turkey to Mexico. For 
objects stolen from illegal excavations, and those illegally exported, the 
burden of proof will be reversed, Evans said. Buyers will have to prove they 
did everything possible to establish legal provenance. The treaty would apply 
only to antiquities stolen or smuggled after ratification. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is recent thefts that most often have Ozgen reaching for his 
phone. The Turks say the Boston Hercules is one such case, although the museum 
disputes it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, scholar Inan headed the dig at Perga in the Turkish south, a steady 
source of classical sculpture. One day, she recalls, word went round that 
something big had been stolen. Archeologists followed a suspect workman and 
recovered some statuary. Now, Inan says, they realize that they should have 
looked harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that summer, archeologists discovered the bottom half of a three-quarter 
life-size statue of a weary or resting Hercules. It was a 2nd-Century Roman 
marble version of a statue attributed to the 4th-Century BC Lysippos of Sikyon, 
a Greek whose bronze statues celebrated the harmony of the male body. 
</P>
<P>
 The Perga Hercules' lower half is now on display at the Turkish government 
museum in Antalya. Inan thinks the statue broke when it fell backward, with the 
two pieces lying close together across the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo, the next year the top of a weary Hercules turned up in New York. A 
collector donated a half share to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. And it 
wasn't long before the small world of archeology was atwitter over photographs 
showing a remarkable resemblance between the Boston top and the Turkish bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Inan went to the United States to see for herself. Could she examine the 
statue, and would they tell her where they got it? 
</P>
<P>
 "They said yes, they said no, they said maybe," she recalls. "They told such 
stories it was impossible to believe them. Maybe they really believed it was 
not the same statue. But it was -- the same marble, the same dress, the same 
aging. 'She's wrong,' they said. 'She's wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inan persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 After much to-ing and fro-ing and rattling of lawyers, the Turkish government 
hired an American sculptor to make an exact copy of its bottom half, a cast 
that was fitted with the Boston top in a museum storeroom under the expert and 
doubting eye of Cornelius Vermeule, the museum's curator of classical art. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, from Art & Auction, is Hoving's account of 1992's Hercules showdown day 
in Boston: 
</P>
<P>
 "The marble torso was gingerly placed on top of the cast and the two pieces 
virtually clicked into place -- perfectly, almost as if they had been 
magnetized -- Vermeule looked up in utter astonishment. 'I'm shocked,' he said. 
'I'm so surprised! Well, I never . . . ' He gazed placidly at the experts 
representing Turkey's interest and suddenly asked, 'Say, would you be willing 
to discuss a shared loan?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inan remembers: "Our lawyer was so nervous he couldn't watch. Then everybody 
yelled and kissed me. 'Congratulations,' they said. A director of the museum 
said we'd have the statue back in two weeks. That was two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 "The museum does not acknowledge Turkey's claim of ownership," said Robert P. 
Mitchell, the museum's director of public relations and marketing in written 
response to questions about the statue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been any evidence that the statue was stolen, and allegations 
to that effect were entirely unsupported. . . . Indeed, the break between the 
top and bottom halves of the statue appears to be an ancient one, such that the 
top half could well have been removed long ago from the territory that is now 
known as Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the unfortunate event that the current settlement discussions are not 
successful, a lawsuit would be necessary. Such a case would raise significant 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ankara, Ozgen says dryly that Boston is reconsidering its position on 
Hercules. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statue probably cost $100,000 to $200,000," he said. "It may cost them $2 
million to defend it in a case we think we'll win. Is it worth that?"

NIXON'S BODY IS RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On a sodden Tuesday afternoon, the remains of Richard Nixon were returned to 
California for burial today in a plot beside his boyhood home. 
</P>
<P>
 After simple ceremonies at El Toro Marine Air Station and at the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace, a slow-moving line of mourners -- the people the former 
President called the Silent Majority, filed past the flag-draped mahogany 
coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 19 years, eight months and 17 days ago that Nixon, aboard the same 
blue-and-white presidential jet bearing the tail number 27000, crossed the 
continent to return in disgrace from the shambles of Watergate to the 
sheltering shores of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the ceremonial presidency that the Nixon White House used so 
effectively as a political tool was returned to the 37th President of the 
United States for one last time: "Ruffles and Flourishes," "Hail to the Chief," 
21-gun salutes and military honor guards dressed up the nation's farewell to 
the only chief executive to resign his office. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose roles in the 
national political arena were born in the angry heat of the 1972 presidential 
campaign and the impeachment proceedings against Nixon, will lead the mourners 
at the 4 p.m. state funeral, to which 1,800 people have been invited. 
Afterward, Nixon will be interred next to his wife, Pat, who died last June. 
Nixon died Friday of complications from a stroke, at the age of 81. 
</P>
<P>
 If today's ceremony belongs to the dignitaries, Tuesday's brought the 
solemnity of the presidency -- and the death of a President -- to the people 
who put Nixon in office, first as a young member of Congress, then as a 
senator, then twice as vice president and twice as President before the 
Watergate scandal forced him into political retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderclaps rang out, then the rain began to fall, a drizzle at first and 
then a steady drenching rain, just before the short motorcade bearing the 
former President's body arrived at the library about 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Billy Graham, long a friend of the Nixon family, and Ron Walker, a 
personnel executive who worked as a chief advance man for the Nixon White 
House, emerged from the library's portico at the arrival of the motorcade: a 
California Highway Patrol car, two black sedans, a hearse flying U.S. flags 
from both front fenders, and two more limousines, the first bearing Nixon's 
daughters, their husbands and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Solemn-faced, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower greeted Graham and 
then stood quietly as an honor guard from the five military services eased the 
coffin from the hearse. Eight members of the guard unit carried it up the steps 
to the library's glass front doors, past scores of reporters and photographers 
in an area cordoned off with velvet ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the public stood to the side, in near silence as the procession 
moved, measured step by measured step, into the library. The coffin was 
followed by Mrs. Cox and her husband, Edward, accompanied by Graham. Behind 
them walked David and Mrs. Eisenhower, followed by Nixon's two grandsons and 
two granddaughters. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred yards to the east, workers had set up grandstands for the funeral. 
On Tuesday, they prepared the speaker's platform, covered in green all-weather 
carpeting. The backdrop is the small, white clapboard house in which Nixon was 
born on Jan. 9, 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people had stood in line for several hours to view the coffin. 
Just as the line began to inch forward, hail started to fall. Lively chatter 
tapered off into silence as the mourners moved closer to the coffin, a large 
photograph of the smiling former President looking down on the scene, just 
above a large display of red roses. Scores of other flower arrangements of 
every color decorated the lobby, where the coffin was placed. 
</P>
<P>
 The mourners, behind a velvet cordon, paused no more than a second or two and 
then moved along. A five-member honor guard, from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, 
Air Force and Coast Guard, stood guard, three on one side of the coffin, two on 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 As evening set in, the line outside grew to several miles in length and moved 
at such a slow pace it was taking about six hours to arrive at the library 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the mourners and troops formed an American tableau, a Norman 
Rockwell-like scene not painted in this country since the death of Lyndon B. 
Johnson in January, 1973: Troops in crisp uniforms, parents with children in 
scout uniforms, grandparents, mourners in dark suits, others dressed in jeans, 
babies in strollers and elderly people in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see him coming back to California in a casket. Just a year ago he 
was here for his wife's funeral. It's an emotional thing for us," said Jerry 
Woudenberg, 63, manager of a food bank in Whittier. He brought his 14-year-old 
son, Kees, who wore a Boy Scout uniform and called Nixon "my favorite 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 Margret Howard, 61, of Baldwin Park, came with her daughter, Cindy Howard, 23, 
and granddaughter, Stephanie Bailey, 4. Margret Howard cast her first national 
vote for the Dwight D. Eisenhower-Richard Nixon presidential ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was an honest man, and I didn't like the raw deal he got in 
Watergate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each visitor was given a cream-colored card, bearing in green ink the 
presidential seal and the message: "The Nixon family thanks you for visiting 
and for expressing your affection and respect for the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Three times Nixon had left California: first in victory, as a freshman member 
of Congress in 1947, then in defeat after losing his race for the California 
governorship to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. in 1962, and finally in 1980, after 
more than five years of self-imposed post-Watergate exile, when he moved to New 
York and eventually New Jersey so he and his wife could be closer to their 
children and grandchildren, who live in New York and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his presidency, Nixon would return to the state, landing at El Toro 
and then flying by helicopter to the "Western White House" in San Clemente. And 
it was to El Toro that he returned on Aug. 9, 1974, after his emotional 
departure from the White House he had turned over to Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 A large, sad crowd softly sang "God Bless America" that day as the same 
airplane arrived with private citizen Nixon aboard. On Tuesday, civilians were 
kept off the base, and only several dozen members of Marine families who live 
there were allowed to stand in a fenced-off area to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon family members, who flew to California with the former President's 
remains, emerged from the front door of the aircraft that had taken Nixon to 
Moscow, Beijing and other corners of the globe. The coffin, maneuvered at a 
45-degree angle from the aircraft's blue-carpeted floor, was removed from the 
back door, near the galley. 
</P>
<P>
 Howitzers brought in from Camp Pendleton boomed a 21-gun salute, a Marine band 
played "Hail to the Chief," and within minutes, the cortege began the 20-mile 
trip to Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the route, thousands of people tried to catch a glimpse of the 
procession, many giving the two-fingered "V for victory" signal that Nixon 
adopted from Winston Churchill. On overpasses, ramps and front lawns, they put 
up with the downpour -- the same sort of dreary weather that often greeted 
Nixon when he tried to escape the tumult of Washington in the throes of 
Watergate in the summer of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 For the funeral today, Clinton has declared a national day of mourning. 
Federal offices will be closed, Congress will be in recess and many financial 
markets will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The four remaining former Presidents -- Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush -- plan to attend the service. So, too, do representatives of 
nearly 90 countries, including some, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, that did not 
exist as independent entities during the Nixon presidency. But other than 
Clinton, no heads of state were expected.

U.S. OFFICIAL RETIRES AMID FREEWAY REPAIR GRUMBLING; BUREAUCRACY: FEDERAL 
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATOR MAY BE A CASUALTY OF THE STATE'S HANDLING OF POST-QUAKE 
PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's top federal highway administrator has abruptly taken early 
retirement, the first apparent casualty of the Clinton Administration's 
unhappiness with the state's handling of the federally financed rebuilding of 
the quake-damaged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger E. Borg, 55, quietly stepped down earlier this month as the California 
director of the Federal Highway Administration, after his superiors expressed 
dissatisfaction with his oversight of the state's reconstruction of vital Los 
Angeles freeways damaged in the Northridge earthquake. The reconstruction has 
been a joint federal-state project, with the state directing the work and the 
federal government providing all the financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Borg said in an interview Tuesday that he had been considering retirement but 
decided to end his 29-year career after Washington officials criticized him for 
being unaware of the state's dramatically accelerated schedule for reopening of 
the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the Washington reaction a "disappointment," Borg said the criticism 
had come at a time when he thought top officials should instead be praising his 
staff for their round-the-clock efforts to rebuild the freeway. "I was thinking 
we should be sitting here celebrating and we were not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Los Angeles hailed the speedy restoration of the Santa Monica Freeway, 
delivered 69 days ahead of schedule, Borg's handling of the contracting and 
reconstruction work came under fire within the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Top U.S. transportation officials confirmed that Borg and his staff had been 
questioned about several issues, including why they had allowed the state to 
mislead them on the date the Santa Monica would open to traffic and to grossly 
overestimate the costs of the rebuilding effort. Initial estimates of $1.3 
billion were cut by $547 million earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said they also were upset that they had to learn from a Times 
report that the two newly constructed bridges on the Santa Monica would need 
seismic strengthening at the abutments to prevent the freeway's closure in a 
major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was his (Borg's) general oversight of the reconstruction project, and the 
fact that we didn't have any information about the seismic retrofit issues, 
that the estimates for the highways were grossly overstated, that the 
construction schedules were not really on the mark," said a federal 
transportation official who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Borg said it was unfair that he was criticized for the initial inflated 
estimates because he was in Central America on vacation when they were 
calculated. When he returned, he said, the estimates already had been forwarded 
to Congress for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal criticisms, Borg said, also focused unfairly on relatively minor 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were working to restore service. We were working to serve the people of 
Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His direct supervisor, Regional Federal Highway Administrator Tom Ptak, said 
that Borg had asked approval to take early retirement a few days after the 
reopening of the Santa Monica, and it was granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal highway officials who worked for Borg said he came into the office 
April 15, announced his retirement and left for the day. He has not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 As California director, Borg headed the largest division within the federal 
agency. From his headquarters in Sacramento, the engineer supervised a staff of 
55 and oversaw the expenditure on California highways of about $2 billion a 
year in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 With his early retirement, effective May 1, Borg gives up a $105,556 annual 
salary and the opportunity to collect his maximum pension. His supervisors said 
they had not yet calculated his pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Wilson Administration and the Clinton Administration have sought to 
take credit for the early reopening of the heavily traveled Santa Monica 
Freeway. Less than three months after two of its bridges collapsed in the Jan. 
17 earthquake, construction was completed on replacement structures and the 
world's busiest freeway was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 To the chagrin of the Democratic Administration in Washington, however, 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was the one who basked most in the glory. One day 
after state officials advised a U.S. Senate hearing that construction on the 
bridges would not be completed for another month, Wilson made headlines by 
announcing that the freeway would in fact be opened in just a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson scheduled the formal opening for 10 a.m. on April 12 and Vice President 
Al Gore announced that he would attend. But then with only two hours notice, an 
informal opening of the freeway -- with Wilson presiding -- was staged the 
night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials were stung. "We felt we had been working fairly well in 
partnership with the state and the city. Then for this to get sprung was 
certainly a violation of all we worked toward," said Richard Minz, an assistant 
to Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the criticism was directed at Borg. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Highway Administrator Rodney Slater had not asked Borg to retire but 
Slater had "aggressively sought" to find out why he had not been better 
informed about the retrofitting of the new bridges and the opening of the Santa 
Monica, according to one transportation official. 
</P>
<P>
 Ptak said he, too, had told Borg of his displeasure over the way the opening 
of the freeway had been handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was I disappointed that we didn't have better information on some of the 
opening dates? That is correct," said Ptak. "And did I discuss this with Roger? 
That is correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Borg said he had been as surprised as everyone else by the announcement. "We 
had no information whatsoever to refute (what was said at the hearing)," he 
said. "Our folks had been on the construction job, had talked with the resident 
engineer, had inspected the works and we had no basis to say it was going to be 
done any quicker that that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Dunphy, Wilson's secretary for business, transportation and housing, said 
the suddenness of the retirement was bewildering to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "He rather suddenly retired after having done what the vice president and 
others said was a magnificent job of opening the freeway early," said Dunphy. 
"So it certainly caused some questions as to whether or not he retired on his 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 At the informal opening of the Santa Monica, federal officials were further 
embarrassed when reporters asked for comments on a Times story reporting that 
the newly finished bridges would have to be retrofitted because of a seismic 
weakness at the abutments. Not having been briefed, Pena said erroneously that 
the abutments did not need to be retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 This came on the heels of another surprise. Dunphy had announced that Caltrans 
had overestimated the cost of reconstructing the quake-damaged freeways. After 
closer review, he said the initial cost estimates of $1.3 billion were being 
reduced by $547 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry federal officials pointed out that eight states during last summer's 
Midwest floods were able to provide better estimates of damage than Caltrans 
did in assessing its losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are issues of accountability," one official explained. "When we go to 
Congress and say we need $1.3 billion to reconstruct freeways, they trust us -- 
and so do the American people -- that the number is going to be fairly 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy defended Caltrans' action, saying that in order for Congress to take 
emergency action costs had to be estimated before there was time for a thorough 
inspection of the freeway damage. After site visits, he said, officials were 
able to determine that many of the damaged bridges first thought to need 
replacement would need only repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the opening of the freeway, he insisted that Wilson was not trying to 
preempt federal officials. He said the governor did not want to announce the 
reopening until inspectors could definitely confirm from a walk-through of the 
construction site that the bridges would, indeed, be completed by April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that walk-through was not conducted until the day Wilson announced the 
reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 Although formal ceremonies were scheduled for April 12, he said the contractor 
had been directed to push the work as fast as he could. It was determined, he 
said, that traffic would be allowed on the freeway whenever that work was 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "My specific direction coming from the governor was to open that freeway as 
soon as it could possibly be opened and not wait for a ceremonial event, a 
ribbon cutting on the freeway," said Dunphy. "Our challenge was not to stage 
events but was to get that freeway finished."

261 DIE IN CRASH OF TAIWANESE JETLINER IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Taiwanese jetliner crashed and burned Tuesday night while trying to land at 
an airport in central Japan, killing 261 people in Japan's second-worst air 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot of the China Airlines Airbus A300-600R, with 271 people on board, 
tried at the last moment to abandon his landing approach and go around for 
another attempt, witnesses and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, en route to Nagoya from Taipei, crashed several hundred yards from 
the runway, broke into pieces and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten badly injured survivors rescued from the flaming wreckage were being 
treated in hospitals this morning. The rest of the passengers and crew were 
confirmed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plane was coming in on a glide path but suddenly pulled up in a steep 
ascent," a local resident told NHK television. "Then I saw the engines catch 
fire. It crashed and there was an explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses said they heard three explosions after the crash. One witness 
quoted on television said the plane did not have its landing gear down. 
Visibility was good and there was little wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters needed 40 minutes to extinguish the blaze. For several hours 
after that, Japanese television showed rescue workers picking through the 
wreckage. One large section of the white-red-and-blue fuselage remained intact, 
but the rest of the airplane was shattered into pieces spread over a large 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of ambulances raced to the scene. About 3,000 police, firefighters 
and troops, equipped with arc lights and metal cutters, joined the rescue 
effort. Some operated cranes, lifting pieces of the charred jetliner in the 
grim search for bodies. Tents were erected at the site to serve as temporary 
morgues, while additional bodies were simply covered with orange blankets and 
set in rows near the wreckage. Tearful relatives and friends looked on 
helplessly from the distant airport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Takahide Miyagi, a Nagoya assistant fire chief, told reporters that when he 
arrived at the crash site, "it looked so bad that I thought everyone must have 
died." 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I heard a woman calling in pain for help, and I called for a 
stretcher and we rescued her," Miyagi said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 158 of the passengers on Flight 140 were Japanese, many returning from 
package tours; 63 were from Taiwan. No further breakdown of the passenger list 
by nationality was available. The plane had 257 passengers and a crew of 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after receiving permission to land at 8:14 p.m., pilot Wang Lo-chi 
contacted air-traffic control to say he would abandon the landing approach and 
try again. His last transmission, a Transport Ministry official said, was 
"Going around." The plane crashed 30 seconds later without any further 
indication of any trouble, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A badly injured survivor quoted by Fuji TV said passengers had received no 
warning of any danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane would have plowed into a residential area had it gone another 200 
yards. It stopped near hangars of an air force base at the airport, and the 
airmen's quick response helped save some lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang Tai-shih, manager of the airline's Japan branch, said the right wing of 
the plane touched the ground just before it burst into flames. He apologized 
for the accident and pledged that the carrier will do all it can for the 
families of the victims and survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang said the ill-fated jetliner had no record of trouble. The plane was 13 
minutes late taking off from Taipei for its 1,180-mile flight to Nagoya, 170 
miles west of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Airbus Industrie said the company will send investigators to the site. This is 
the first crash of an A300-600R, a twin-engine wide-body jet. The plane was 
delivered to China Airlines in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's worst air disaster was Aug. 12, 1985, when a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 
crashed into a mountain, killing 520 people. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger on an earlier China Airlines flight from Nagoya to Taipei on 
Tuesday was quoted on Taiwan television as saying his airplane had engine 
trouble. But a spokeswoman for Airbus Industrie in Paris said this was a 
different jetliner from the one that crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "An A300-600 had an engine problem departing from Nagoya that same morning. It 
was not the aircraft that had the accident," she said. That problem involved 
the aircraft's starter engine, but after some difficulty the engine started 
normally, she said.

STATE BILL WOULD JETTISON 'JUNK LAWS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you know there's a law in California requiring anybody who kills another 
in a duel to support the widow and children and pay off the loser's debts? 
</P>
<P>
 Or that frogs injured in jumping contests must be quickly destroyed -- but not 
eaten? 
</P>
<P>
 Or that it is illegal to sell a new automobile with the radiator cap or 
ornament extending through the grille? All there. You can look it up. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just what Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) did. What he 
found were lots of oldies but doozies, some dating back to the Gold Rush days 
of 1849. He calls them "junk laws" and he wants them trashed. They are, he 
says, obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no longer a need, he says, for "wanted dead or alive" reward posters 
for criminals or for regulations governing the sale of quicksilver used by the 
unscrupulous to "salt" gold mining claims and then sell them to unsuspecting 
prospectors. 
</P>
<P>
 And where is the constituency clamoring for the law prohibiting horses from 
mating within 100 yards of any city limits unless they are placed in an 
enclosure so they can't be seen by passersby? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing when you realize some of the junk laws that remain on the books 
in California," O'Connell said Tuesday. "(These laws) belong in our history 
books under the Old West or the Gold Rush. Many served a purpose at one time 
but have clearly lost their significance over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his approach is light-hearted, O'Connell, a candidate for a state 
Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), is 
serious about getting as much deadwood as possible out of the lawbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 He has invited his Assembly colleagues to submit other old and useless laws 
they know of for inclusion in his repeal bill, which is moving through the 
Legislature. So far, O'Connell has identified 53 laws that would be repealed 
under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Constituents tell me over and over how complicated the (state) codes are," 
the Southern California lawmaker said. "This is partly in response to their 
wishes. I want to get rid of the junk to make our other laws easier for 
Californians to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 The origin of the frog-jumping contest rules, for example, probably don't have 
anything to do with the annual Calaveras County event made famous by the Mark 
Twain story. "But nobody is still alive who knows that for sure," O'Connell 
said, adding that the rules could have been put into law to regulate a 
competing frog-jumping event. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the 1939 statute prohibiting the sale of automobiles with radiator caps 
or ornaments that stick through the grille, O'Connell quipped, "Some very 
important person must have gotten skewered to get that one on the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the statutes earmarked for repeal are no longer the state's business 
or are simply moot. For example, California law allows the killing of beavers, 
burros and coyotes if they threaten farm crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, says O'Connell, the state doesn't have many beavers any more; burros are 
controlled by the federal Bureau of Land Management, and coyotes are under the 
supervision of the federal Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the outdated laws are of more recent vintage, such as a 1974 statute 
calling for the California Highway Patrol to study the feasibility of hiring 
women to be officers. Since the CHP now has 477 female officers, the hiring 
study is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are just plain useless, such as the one requiring those in charge of a 
bear to keep the beast from running wild. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell's bill sailed through the Assembly Water, Parks and Wildlife 
Committee on Tuesday without opposition. Its next stop is the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
 While the vote was a unanimous 7 to 0, at least one Assembly member, David 
Knowles (R-Placerville), wondered why a law repealing the consequences of 
dueling was fodder for a committee dealing with water, parks and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee aide replied earnestly that many other parts of the bill dealt 
with subjects within the committee's jurisdiction.

CIA SPY SUSPECT, WIFE REPORTEDLY TO PLEAD GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing one of the biggest spy cases in American history, CIA official Aldrich 
H. Ames and his wife have agreed to plead guilty to espionage and federal tax 
evasion in a settlement that would put Ames in prison for life but would 
recommend no more than a five-year sentence for Rosario Ames, sources said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Paving the way for their guilty pleas Thursday before U.S. District Judge 
Claude M. Hilton, a federal grand jury in nearby Alexandria, Va., will return a 
sealed indictment against the couple containing the two felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a provision crucial to the government, Ames, 52, has pledged "full 
cooperation" with federal investigators who have been attempting -- so far 
unsuccessfully -- to learn precisely which secrets he sold to the Soviet Union 
and later to Russia during an eight-year spying career, the sources said. He 
also has agreed to describe any assistance he received from colleagues at the 
CIA who acted either knowingly or unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is prepared to recommend a term of life imprisonment without 
parole for Ames, the same maximum sentence he could have expected if convicted 
after a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have found no evidence that Rosario Ames, 41, directly 
participated in passing secrets to U.S. adversaries, although they say she 
helped her husband make bank deposits of large sums of cash and helped exchange 
messages with his Russian handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 She has acknowledged difficulty coping with her incarceration since the two 
were arrested Feb. 21 and expressed concern about the welfare of their 
5-year-old son, Paul, who is being cared for by a relative. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Ames, a 31-year veteran of the agency, one source said: "He's 
falling on his sword for the sake of his wife and son." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence introduced by the government during pretrial court hearings suggests, 
however, that the case against Ames is overwhelming. The FBI, which had him 
under surveillance for nine months before his arrest, said it intercepted 
telephone calls between Ames and Russian agents. It also reported finding more 
than 100 classified CIA cables on computer discs at his home, including many 
outside his area of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a nine-page letter later found in Ames' study spelled out the 
priorities set by his Soviet handlers several years ago. They said the handlers 
were especially interested in information about CIA penetrations of the Soviet 
KGB and its military intelligence service, the GRU. During much of the period 
in question -- 1985 to 1991 -- Ames was chief of Soviet counterintelligence in 
the CIA's Soviet-East European Division. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in a statement made shortly after her arrest, Rosario Ames 
acknowledged to FBI agents that her husband had received millions of dollars 
from the Russians for his spy work. After conferring with an attorney, she 
declined to say more. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials and chief defense attorney Plato Cacheris refused 
Tuesday to respond to questions about the plea agreement. But officials had 
said previously that the government would benefit enormously from Ames' 
cooperation -- something they would not obtain if he insisted on going to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Ames' help, CIA analysts have been unable to assess fully the 
espionage damage to CIA operations. They also have not determined how many 
sources of information used by the agency were compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the assessments was curtailed out of concern that any paperwork 
created before trial might be obtained by defense attorneys and used in framing 
a defense, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax evasion charge to which the pair will plead guilty flows from 
government allegations that Ames received at least $2.5 million in cash from 
the Russians -- none of which was ever reported to the IRS. The amount is more 
than twice the amount Moscow has been known to give to any other American spy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames' CIA superiors became suspicious after he paid $540,000 in cash for a new 
home in suburban Virginia and bought a luxury automobile with a $25,000 down 
payment. But he passed a polygraph test in 1991 after telling his superiors 
that his wife inherited money from her late father in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plea agreement, the government is expected to require the 
Ameses to give up hundreds of thousands of dollars that they still hold in 
foreign bank accounts, along with penalties and interest for failing to declare 
it as income. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, directors of the CIA, the FBI and the Justice 
Department have agreed in "broad principle" to a plan that would alert the FBI 
sooner to counterintelligence problems inside the spy agency, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, drawn up by the National Security Council staff in the White House, 
is likely to be outlined in Administration testimony next month before the 
Senate and House Intelligence committees. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Tuesday that the plan is being 
developed at "the President's request in the wake of the Aldrich Ames arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the FBI was helping the CIA hunt for a mole inside the intelligence 
agency in 1991, the bureau did not learn that Ames' polygraph results were 
suspicious until two years later, said Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), 
chairman of the Intelligence Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department official said the changes probably would be accomplished 
by a combination of a presidential order and legislation giving investigators 
expanded access to financial information about people working in intelligence 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the FBI would be designated as the primary agency for 
overseeing counterintelligence investigations in all U.S. spying organizations, 
and a senior FBI official would head a new counterintelligence center.

U.S. ACCORD CLEARS WAY FOR NEW ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and Congress privately reached an agreement last 
week that will open the way for hundreds of millions of dollars in new U.S. 
arms sales to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although China normally opposes such sales, the agreement was, in fact, a 
compromise that will prevent a further strain in relations between the United 
States and China. It will leave in effect a 12-year-old communique between the 
two nations in which the United States promised gradual reductions in arms 
exports to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress was moving to pass legislation that would have effectively scrapped 
the communique, a step that would remove any limits on U.S. arms sales to 
Taiwan. Under the compromise, the communique is left on the books as a general 
understanding, but Taiwan will be allowed to buy some specific new weapons 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret negotiations between the Administration and Congress took place at 
a sensitive time for U.S. relations with China. The Administration must decide 
by June whether to curb China's trade privileges in this country if China does 
not improve its human rights record. China has said such action would prompt it 
to retaliate against U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole fight took on increased importance, almost to the point of frenzy, 
because the decision (on China's trade status) is so close," a congressional 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 China would have viewed overturning the 1982 arms communique as a serious 
affront and as tangible evidence that relations between the two countries have 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode also illustrates how foreign governments and private U.S. defense 
contractors maneuver in Washington over weapons sales. In this instance, 
American companies succeeded in winning the right to export previously banned 
weapons systems to Taiwan by gaining support in Congress for a measure directly 
challenging U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted that the Congress and the Administration and the defense 
exporting community were able to resolve their differences on this issue to the 
satisfaction of all," said Anna Stout, executive vice president of the American 
League for Exports and Security Assistance, a defense industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the Capitol Hill negotiations, the Administration will approve 
export applications for U.S. companies to sell Taiwan advanced American 
military electronics for frigates that Taiwan is buying from France. These new 
items include radar, electronic countermeasure systems and "the entire 
electronic combat suite . . everything that turns (a frigate) from a ship into 
a warship," according to one U.S. defense industry official. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies such as Litton and Raytheon had sought licenses to sell this 
high-tech military equipment to Taiwan for almost two years but had been turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue between the Administration and Congress was a provision sponsored by 
Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) with the strong support of the League for 
Exports and Security Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision, which would have removed all limits on arms sales to Taiwan, 
was attached to a State Department authorization bill approved 20 to 0 last 
year by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It passed the Senate by voice 
vote early this year. Top-level Administration officials then launched an 
intensive campaign to derail the measure in a Senate-House conference. 
</P>
<P>
 White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake met privately with 
Murkowski; Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott wrote Congress to threaten 
a presidential veto, and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord worked the 
phones to line up support for the Administration on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Li Daoyu, China's ambassador to the United States, also worked actively 
against the measure, Capitol Hill sources said. A spokesman for China's embassy 
in Washington declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Congress agreed to water down Murkowski's amendment and to limit 
its legal effect. In exchange, the Administration said it would supply a 
private letter from Secretary of State Warren Christopher reaffirming U.S. 
policy toward Taiwan and would approve a series of specific applications for 
arms exports to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a reasonable compromise," one senior Administration official said. 
"It doesn't change U.S. policy toward China, but it reassures American 
supporters of Taiwan." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have been a sensitive subject since 1979, when the 
United States established diplomatic relations with China and broke off its 
mutual defense treaty with Taipei. At the time, Washington and Beijing were 
unable to reach agreement about what should happen to U.S. arms sales to 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Taiwan and China consider these arms sales important, not only because of 
their effect on Taiwan's ability to defend itself against any invasion from the 
mainland but also because the arms sales strengthen Taiwan's hand in its 
dealings with China. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1982, the Ronald Reagan Administration reached agreement with China 
on a communique in which it promised to freeze arms sales to Taiwan at a 
maximum of about $820 million a year and to gradually reduce them over time. 
</P>
<P>
 This agreement immediately became one of the "three communiques" that the 
Chinese regime regularly calls the bedrock of relations between Washington and 
Beijing. The others were the communique signed by President Richard Nixon on 
his 1972 trip to China and the one signed by President Jimmy Carter in 
establishing diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, in the midst of his reelection campaign, President George Bush opened 
the way for a major new arms sale to Taiwan -- of F-16 fighter planes that 
Taiwan's Nationalist government had been trying to buy for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, China protested angrily that sale of the planes violated the 
1982 communique. But Bush Administration officials took the position that the 
United States was still honoring the 10-year-old agreement. They said the sale 
of the F-16s was legal under the communique because they were merely replacing 
older warplanes that Taiwan could no longer use. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-16 sale did, however, serve as a signal to the U.S. defense industry 
that Washington might be prepared to lift some of the restrictions on arms 
sales to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Murkowski's amendment would have said that a 1979 law, the Taiwan Relations 
Act, which requires the United States to help in Taiwan's defense, supersedes 
any agreement reached by the executive branch. That would have gutted the 1982 
U.S.-China communique. 
</P>
<P>
 After negotiations, Murkowski and Senate colleagues agreed to change this 
provision from a law, which is binding, to a "sense of Congress" resolution 
that does not have the force of law. They also changed the language to say the 
law requiring American support of Taiwan is "primary over" any communique, 
wording that leaves the 1982 agreement in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain these concessions, Administration officials had to pledge that 
Christopher would send a private letter adopting the language Congress passed. 
Administration officials insisted that Christopher's letter merely restates a 
legal truism that laws of Congress take precedence over agreements reached by 
the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Lin, a spokesman for Taiwan, said the measure passed by Congress "helps 
to ensure that we can maintain adequate defense capability. . . . We appreciate 
the concern of our American friends for our security, as well as the initiative 
and goodwill they have expressed through this amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry sources suggested that the deal between the Administration and 
Congress also could open the way for other new military sales to Taiwan, such 
as Harpoon anti-ship missiles and new torpedoes. "It's a whole new ballgame," 
one defense industry official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insisted they had approved only the military 
electronics for Taiwan's ships and minimized the importance of this 
transaction. "It's not like selling them the B-1 bomber," one senior U.S. 
official said.

S. AFRICANS CAST HISTORIC VOTES; ELECTION: HOSPITAL PATIENTS, THE DISABLED AND 
RETIREES FLOCK TO POLLS IN HIGH SPIRITS ON FIRST DAY. A BOMB EXPLODES AT 
JOHANNESBURG'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. 
</P>

<P>
 Democracy dawned with a flourish across South Africa on Tuesday as hospital 
patients, pensioners, the disabled and other "special voters" flocked to this 
country's first all-race polls in unexpectedly high numbers and remarkably good 
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening day of the historic three-day election for the post-apartheid 
government was marred by widespread confusion and hundreds of complaints of 
logistic problems and technical glitches at urban and rural polling stations. 
These included missing ballots, late starts and long lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In a resurgence of violence apparently aimed at disrupting the watershed 
election, an explosion rocked the international departures hall at 
Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport today, wounding at least three people, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an explosion on the second floor of the international departures 
hall. . . . Three people have been injured," said Col. Jan Myburgh, according 
to the Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast is the latest in a series of bombings that have killed 21 people and 
kept South Africa on edge since the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no major poll violence on Tuesday. Sick and elderly black voters 
who have waited all their lives to cast a ballot began lining up before dawn in 
cities, towns and townships across the nation. Some were carried in blankets 
and wheelbarrows. Many waited as long as eight hours under the baking sun in 
columns that extended for more than half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more voters showed up than were anticipated, officials said, although no 
official count was available. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the 22.7 million eligible voters -- including up to 18 
million first-time black voters -- will cast ballots at 9,000 heavily guarded 
polling stations today and Thursday. It remains to be seen if the glitches that 
dogged Tuesday's balloting will become nightmarish obstacles and lead to 
violence under a flood of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the country's largest black township, patients at the sprawling 
Baragwanath Hospital, one of the biggest hospitals in Africa, hobbled in on 
crutches, rolled up in wheelchairs and marched up in tattered bathrobes and 
threadbare pajamas to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought this day would come," said a beaming Mary Lele, 72, clutching 
her grandson's arm as she walked slowly, but with pride, to cast her first 
ballot. "I'm very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Mashaba, 73, carried her 2-year-old granddaughter in a red sling on her 
back. "I want her to see freedom," she said with a toothless smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettie Mogatwe, 42, rode in a wheelchair, her broken left leg in a new cast. 
Despite the pain, she grinned with delight when she left the polling booth. "I 
think it's the end of apartheid," she said. "We'll not be oppressed anymore. . 
. . We'll all be equal." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the first day's 2,219 fixed and mobile polling stations were 
equal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Zulu strongholds of KwaZulu and Natal, a plan to deliver special 
stickers to attach to the ballots for supporters of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party apparently went awry. Scores of 
polling booths did not receive the stickers, or got them late in the day, 
leaving thousands of disappointed and angry voters in one of the country's most 
volatile areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, who only last week dropped his militant boycott of the elections, 
called for an extension of the three-day voting period to alleviate the 
problem. "I'm extremely, extremely worried," Buthelezi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 He also complained hourly to the head of the Independent Electoral Commission, 
Judge Johann Kriegler. At an evening news conference, Kriegler said the voting 
could not be extended but acknowledged that the commission had been overwhelmed 
on its first day of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell, the picture is far from perfect, but much, much further from 
disastrous," he said. But Kriegler, who has labored from the campaign's start 
to gloss over allegations of inefficiency and disorganization in the election 
preparations, called the day a "godsend." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a trial run today and picked up a large number of bugs and hitches and 
glitches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 IEC Commissioner Ben van der Ross said the worst problems were in three areas. 
"Very serious shortages" of election materials were reported in Transkei, he 
said. Communications had broken down in northern Transvaal. And several tribal 
chiefs had tried to "take the law into their own hands and commandeer the 
polling stations" in Natal, he said. Allegations of fraud were reported in 
several areas, but none was substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from other areas around the country were also worrisome. Voting was 
delayed for up to eight hours because of missing ballots or equipment in the 
mining town of Kimberly, while voting at Durban General Hospital did not begin 
until midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Polling was also delayed up to seven hours in townships in the East Rand and 
along the coast in Port Elizabeth and Port Shepstone. Only ballots for the 
National Assembly arrived in parts of Newcastle, although voters must mark 
another ballot for provincial legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials reported tension at two prisons after voting was delayed until the 
afternoon. And the boat carrying election officials and ballot papers to Robben 
Island, the infamous prison that once was home to Nelson Mandela, broke down in 
Cape Town Harbor. The 700 prisoners voted later. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africans in 80 countries around the world were also able to vote. 
Mandela's niece Nomoza Patin was the first to cast a ballot, by virtue of her 
location in Wellington, New Zealand, which is closest to the international 
dateline. "It means a restoration of dignity . . . for every South African 
person," she told news services of her vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In Johannesburg, African National Congress spokesman Pallo Jordan told a news 
conference that the first day of voting had been rockier than expected. "We 
aren't that shocked by it, although we are dismayed by it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, enthusiasm and a sense of forgiving seemed the order of the day for a 
people finally able to choose their own leaders and rule their own land. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an incredible feeling, like falling in love," gushed Anglican 
Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his 
outspoken campaign against apartheid. He will vote today. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederik W. de Klerk, who will trade his job as Africa's last white head of 
state for one as deputy executive vice president under Mandela, said he had no 
regrets about freeing Mandela from prison in 1990 and starting the transition 
from apartheid to democracy. "I wanted this election to take place. . . . That 
is what I have been working for," he said as he escorted his 89-year-old 
mother, Corrie, to vote in Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORY: B9 At the Ballot Box 
</P>
<P>
 Democracy has arrived in South Africa, with a three-day nationwide election. 
For the first time, all South Africans over age 18 are eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The choices: Voters will select the party that best represents their views. A 
400-member National Assembly will be chosen based on those votes. The party 
with the most votes will choose its leader as president of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The major parties 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC: The largest black-dominated political group in South Africa. It is 
expected to score an overwhelming victory under its leader is Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 National Party: In power since 1948 and all-white until 1990, it appears 
headed for a secondary role in national politics. The party is headed by 
Frederik W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha Freedom Party: The Zulu nationalist party has emerged as the main 
rival to the ANC. It is closely tied to the Zulu monarchy and claims to 
represent 8.5 million Zulus, the nation's largest ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible voters Black: 69% White: 19% Mixed race: 10% Asian: 3% Does not add 
up to 100% because of rounding

BOSNIAN SERBS AVERT AIR STRIKES WITH PULLBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb gunmen grudgingly withdrew tanks and artillery from around 
battered Gorazde on Tuesday, U.N. officials said, averting the threat of NATO 
air strikes against weapons that had been savaging the "safe haven." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. forces patrolling Gorazde reported evacuation of all known gun 
emplacements by nightfall, although it remained unclear whether the weaponry 
had actually been removed from the 12-mile exclusion zone proclaimed by the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before U.N. ground forces in Gorazde relayed their general impression 
that the Serbs had complied with the withdrawal order, the peacekeeping mission 
here showed itself to be extremely reluctant to approve the use of force to 
impose the NATO ultimatum, probably fearing that any outside attack could do 
more damage to its operation than to the defiant rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to go to war over a broken-down tank," British Lt. Gen. 
Michael Rose, commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia, said of the 
uncertain Serbian compliance and mounting Western pressure to show the rebels 
some military resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15,000-plus troops of the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia are deployed on 
a neutral, humanitarian mission, and Rose has stated he sees no prospect of 
"bombing our way to peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the monthlong crisis triggered by the Bosnian Serb offensive 
against Gorazde, Rose and other top U.N. officials have played down the 
severity of the fighting that killed or wounded nearly 3,000. They have also 
granted vast leeway to the rebels each time they violated cease-fire orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the sites in the 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone where the Bosnian 
Serb army's heavy weapons were previously located have been reported by U.N. 
military observers as being cleared," said a U.N. spokesman, Cmdr. Eric 
Chaperon. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 U.N. troops have been deployed to Gorazde over the past two days to 
separate the Muslim-led government forces and the rebel Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO reconnaissance flights in the afternoon showed some tanks and artillery 
still within the weapons exclusion zone, and Chaperon earlier conceded that 
some Serbian infantry remained within a 1.9-mile radius of central Gorazde -- a 
safety zone from which the rebels were supposed to have pulled out three days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Bosnian Serb soldiers retreated from the inner protected zone Sunday, 
they looted and burned hundreds of houses and blew up a water plant. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi, the civilian head of the U.N. peacekeeping 
mission for the Balkans, denounced the "scorched earth" tactics and lodged a 
protest with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite evidence to the contrary, the Bosnian Serb leadership had announced 
itself in full compliance with the withdrawal edict 12 hours before the NATO 
deadline of 5:01 p.m. PST Tuesday, or 2:01 a.m. Wednesday local time. 
</P>
<P>
 When NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner warned Friday that the alliance 
would call in air strikes against the Serbian war machine unless shelling of 
the haven ceased immediately, the rebels pulled back their troops to the 
protected zone border by early Sunday, and all U.N. troops and relief 
operations were granted unhindered freedom of movement. Yet Bosnian Serb forces 
have continued to hamper troops and aid convoys throughout Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 A food convoy was let into Gorazde in the morning after a 24-hour blockade by 
Bosnian Serb gunmen, but a separate delivery of shelter materials was turned 
back by the rebels who claimed the tents and plastic sheeting were military 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs also have been sighted moving tanks and other heavy weapons 
back into an exclusion zone proclaimed around Sarajevo in February, after NATO 
threatened to bomb the hardware if it was not surrendered or pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rebels have failed to adhere to the letter of any of the recent 
peace orders, U.N. officials have been reluctant to approve punitive air 
strikes. Two token attacks by U.S. warplanes on April 10 and 11 prompted a 
massive campaign of harassment and hostage-taking that handcuffed U.N. 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in London on Tuesday, a new, international "contact group" on Bosnia 
-- which consists of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union 
and Russia -- agreed to begin negotiations with the warring parties in Sarajevo 
on Thursday, senior U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new diplomatic initiative is dependent on Bosnian Serb compliance with 
the NATO ultimatum that the rebels pull back their heavy weapons around 
Gorazde, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher emphasized.

SCIENTISTS GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TOP QUARK PUZZLE; PHYSICS: TEAM BELIEVES IT 
HAS FOUND EVIDENCE OF THE ELUSIVE SUBATOMIC PARTICLE THAT IS PART OF ALL 
MATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ and JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory announced Tuesday that 
they have detected strong evidence of an elusive particle at the heart of all 
matter in the universe, providing the best proof yet of the hidden structure of 
the material world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't looking at the face of God, but we are deciphering his 
handwriting," said Thomas Muller, a UCLA physicist who was a member of the team 
that detected the presence of the top quark, as the subatomic particle is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending years of rumor and speculation, the announcement culminated a 17-year 
search that cost more than $100 million and involved 440 researchers from 49 
universities and five national governments -- the United States, Japan, Canada, 
Taiwan and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery of the top quark, if confirmed, completes one set of subatomic 
building blocks whose existence is predicted by the prevailing theory, called 
the Standard Model, of the particles and forces that determine the fundamental 
nature of matter and energy. In the whimsical lexicon of modern physics, the 
elementary particles are called quarks, leptons and bosons. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray Gell-Mann, the Caltech physicist who won a 1969 Nobel Prize for 
pioneering the theory of the Standard Model, said the news was "splendid." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not finding it would have been shocking," Gell-Mann said. "We theorists would 
have to fall on our fountain pens. It would be an inconceivable disaster for 
theorists if they could not find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Ruth, head of the accelerator theory department at the Stanford Linear 
Accelerator Center, said, "It is the final piece of the puzzle. This puts to 
rest the doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery may be the last hurrah for American high-energy physics, under 
whose banner three generations of scientists have dominated the search for the 
fundamental building blocks of matter. Only one other particle -- called the 
Higgs boson -- has yet to be tracked down, and, with the cancellation of the 
Superconducting Supercollider project last year, no U.S. atom smasher will be 
powerful enough to detect it. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding of the top quark has an impact similar to filling in the last 
blank in the periodic table of the elements. Many of the elements have little 
or no direct impact on everyday life, but their existence affirms scientists' 
picture of the composition of matter. 
</P>
<P>
 All matter is composed of atoms, which are made up of electrons, neutrons and 
protons. Those in turn contain even more elementary pieces, such as quarks. 
Gell-Mann named them after a word he found in a cryptic reference in the novel 
"Finnegan's Wake" by James Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
 There are six kinds of quarks in all, linked to each other in pairs. The top 
quark, the most massive and last to be detected, has puzzled physicists for so 
long that they hope finally understanding it will lead to new insights into the 
origin of matter. The top quark by itself is as heavy as an entire atom of 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called bottom quark, which is linked to the top quark, was detected by 
Fermi researchers 17 years ago. But the top quark was remarkably hard to find 
because it decays so quickly, existing for less than a trillionth of a 
trillionth of a second before breaking down into lighter particles. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has laid eyes on a top quark or captured its direct image on film. 
Instead, physicists at Fermi collected evidence of its brief existence by 
tracking the distinctive trail of byproducts it leaves behind. The search is 
particularly difficult because a top quark can decay in several different ways, 
producing a number of possible electronic signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tevatron particle accelerator at Fermi outside Chicago is the most 
powerful in use today, spinning protons and antiprotons at close to the speed 
of light in a giant underground ring four miles in circumference. 
</P>
<P>
 When the particles collide, they create a tiny fireball of energy as intense 
as the Big Bang itself when the universe was barely a trillionth of a second 
old -- its energy safely contained by Tevatron's massive magnetic field. As 
they smash, particles fly off in all directions. For that hellish instant, the 
Tevatron contains the hottest spot in the solar system -- still just barely 
enough energy to create the conditions for the top quark to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 By repeating such collisions millions of times, researchers believe they 
caught a dozen glimpses of the top quark on the Tevatron's 5,000-ton detector. 
</P>
<P>
 Data from test runs in August, 1992, and June, 1993, provided the most 
persuasive evidence of the top quark, said Melvyn J. Shochet, a physicist at 
the University of Chicago who is a spokesman for the Fermi project. The 
particles detected, Shochet said, were actually the ones into which a top quark 
would eventually break down, "the grandsons and granddaughters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The top quark could decay in several different ways, and two of those patterns 
were spotted. "Our confidence grew when we discovered the second interaction," 
Muller said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the apparent paradoxes that abound in particle physics, researchers 
had predicted that the top quark would be heavier than the proton from which it 
came. From their data, Fermi scientists measured the top quark's mass at about 
200 times that of a proton, well within the range predicted by the theory. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Fermi conference late last year, participating physicists agreed that 
they should write a journal article analyzing their results, but wrangled over 
what their videotapes showed. Although they were certain they had highly 
significant results, they could not agree on whether they had gathered enough 
data to be absolutely sure they had actually created the missing particle. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Tuesday to announce the discovery, William C. Carithers 
Jr., a senior staff physicist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory who is a visiting 
researcher at Fermi, said, "The evidence is too large to ignore, but too small 
to cry 'Eureka!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers were anxious to stake their claim to the discovery as soon as 
practical but equally anxious to avoid the embarrassment of a public error. 
After all, a European lab had announced the discovery of the top quark 
previously and then retracted its claim because of mistakes in interpreting the 
background of vast numbers of particles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the team submitted its 150-page manuscript to a peer-reviewed 
science journal called Physical Review D. A separate team of 420 researchers at 
Fermi is attempting to independently confirm the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fermi officials said they decided not to wait for the usual outside scientific 
review and make their announcement at the news conference. Word of the Fermi 
data was leaking out, and the group felt confident enough to declare it had 
found evidence of the top quark. 
</P>
<P>
 Some misgivings still linger. 
</P>
<P>
 John Peoples Jr., director of the Fermi Lab, said Tuesday, "I am persuaded 
that the evidence is very strong." But, he said, "there are some 
inconsistencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Carithers said that there is only a "1-in-400 chance" the scientists are 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Shochet said he would like to see "two or three times" as much data 
"fingerprinting" of the top quark before declaring a definitive discovery, but 
that "this is the first time you have a serious hint of something."

BILLBOARDS DRAW IRE OF CANCER PATIENTS; ADVERTISING: POPEYES CHICKEN ORDERS 
SIGNS TAKEN DOWN AFTER COMPLAINTS THAT AN INTENDED JOKE IS OFFENSIVE.

<P>
 The owners of Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits have learned a lesson: There are 
some things you just don't joke about. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to consumer complaints, the chain of Cajun-style chicken 
restaurants is pulling down billboards with the slogan: "The Best Breasts in 
Southern California Without Plastic Surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 "Irregardless of whether I was a cancer victim or not, this cheapens women," 
said Carol Forhan, a member of a breast-cancer survivors group called Ladies of 
Courage in Lancaster. Forhan complained to the company Monday after seeing the 
billboard near her church, another church and a nursery school. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, after half a dozen complaints from breast cancer victims, the 
company began to take down more than two dozen signs bearing the same message. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Scafido, vice president of marketing for Popeyes in Atlanta, said he was 
surprised that the advertisement drew such strong opposition.

<P>
 "We thought we were just poking fun," Scafido said. "We were just looking for 
a humorous spin. A lot of people in Southern California have plastic surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards are part of an advertising campaign designed to introduce more 
than 80 new Popeyes restaurants to the Southland. Before February, there were 
16 Popeyes in Southern California. But the company's purchase of the Pioneer 
Chicken restaurant chain in the last few months has made the Los Angeles area 
the most Popeyes-dense in the country, with more than 90 from Santa Ana to 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising campaign, and the move into Southern California, coincides 
with a national push to update the 22-year-old company's image. Marketing 
directors have replaced the restaurants' lava rock exteriors with stucco and 
switched gaudy reds and oranges to contemporary grays and blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 100 billboards, 26 carried the breast braggadocio. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to replacing the billboards in question, which have been up about 
a week and a half, the company has offered billboard space to the Central Los 
Angeles Chapter of the American Cancer Society to use in October to coincide 
with National Breast Cancer Month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly did not mean to offend anyone," said Sherri O'Riley, field 
marketing manager for Popeyes in Phoenix. "We were trying to extend our 
goodwill to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But several women lunching at a Popeyes in Chatsworth on Tuesday said the 
message was no way to attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't think of putting breasts with chicken in that manner," said Aleta 
Williams, 29, who had not seen the billboard. "It's kind of offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Harrod, 20, a student at Cal State Northridge, said the billboard 
mystified her, although that didn't stop her from swinging by the restaurant 
for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to boycott them," she said, waiting for her order. "But I don't 
know who they are trying to attract with a sign like that."

DMV SPENT $44 MILLION ON FAILED PROJECT; TECHNOLOGY: AGENCY'S DIRECTOR SAYS 
SIX-YEAR EFFORT AT COMPUTER MODERNIZATION CAN'T BE SAVED. LEGISLATIVE PROBE IS 
ORDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Department of Motor Vehicles has spent $44 million over the 
last six years on a computer modernization project it now admits is a hopeless 
failure, prompting the Legislature to order an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV Director Frank S. Zolin, who has been on the job since 1991, said Tuesday 
that the project got off on the wrong track and that he has ended it. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the independent legislative analyst's office said the DMV didn't 
understand the technology and mismanaged the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Zolin, an appointee of Gov. Pete Wilson, has offered to accept responsibility 
for what may shape up as an election-year embarrassment, but critics in the 
Legislature want much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless he's got $44 million in his pocket, I'm not interested," said 
Assemblywoman Valerie Brown (D-Sonoma). "Just taking responsibility doesn't 
solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's office refused to comment on the matter and directed reporters 
to Robert Pipkin, assistant secretary of the Business, Transportation and 
Housing Agency. Pipkin said the DMV "apparently made a false start on this 
thing and now the goal is to get the best deal we can for the taxpayers" by 
finding another use for the computing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The botched project came to light Monday at a subcommittee hearing of the 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over state spending 
proposals. Zolin had asked for an additional $7.5 million to pay off equipment 
costs of the failed project and to launch a dramatically scaled-down version. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members said they were stunned at the taxpayer investment gone awry 
and ordered an investigation by the Legislature's lawyers, fiscal advisers and 
auditors to determine if any of the investment could be recouped, possibly by 
suing the computer contracting companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Zolin on Tuesday denied assertions that the Administration had been 
inattentive and allowed the project to get out of control. He said he became 
concerned about its feasibility shortly after he became DMV director and 
ordered an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he became convinced the project could not be revitalized without 
spending $157 million more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've pulled the plug on it," Zolin said. "What happens in these kinds of 
projects (is) they kind of run away from the folks who are managing and the 
problems keep accumulating, almost geometrically." 
</P>
<P>
 The project was conceived in the mid-1980s during the Administration of Gov. 
George Deukmejian and launched in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV in the mid-1980s needed to modernize its antiquated computer systems 
so it could easily match up such fundamental information as a name on a 
driver's license with a vehicle's registration number. 
</P>
<P>
 According to DMV officials, however, the programming language of the DMV 
system was not compatible with later developments in technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Zolin said department officials worked with Tandem Corp., the computer 
hardware vendor, and Ernst & Young, the accounting firm and software vendor, to 
try to make the proposal work during a five-year period, but failed. In the 
meantime, costs of what started out as a $28-million enterprise soared. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the Legislature in February, the state legislative analyst's 
office branded the project a failure and said the DMV had not provided a 
substantive explanation for the its botched database project. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the analyst blamed the department's limited experience in 
computer technology, a gross underestimate of the project's scope and size and 
lack of consistent and sustained management. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Brown, a committee member, said she believes the issue went 
unnoticed by the Legislature because the DMV was under no requirement to 
periodically advise the Legislature on the status of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is beyond my belief that this kind of thing happens," Brown said. "They 
(DMV) came to the committee asking for more money to start something new. My 
reaction was, wait a minute. You've spent $44 million on a computer system that 
you are now telling us does nothing and is worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), chairman of the subcommittee scrutinizing 
the department's budget, and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of 
the Transportation Committee, criticized the department for lack of attention 
to business. 
</P>
<P>
 "For an Administration that likes to indicate that government ought to be run 
like a business, there is certainly a lack of follow-through in this area," 
Costa said. "We are going to determine what can be salvaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said the contracts with the computer vendors would be examined to 
determine if they bore any liability. Katz and Costa said it appears the 
contracts may not have contained strict performance or liability standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Tandem Corp. and Ernst & Young could not be reached for comment 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Zolin said his office tried to fix the problem and save the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a major effort to analyze and see if there was a way to put it back 
on the right track," Zolin said. "Probably, it was on the wrong track from the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 With costs hitting the $44-million mark, he said he pulled the plug months ago 
and believes that the department now can embark on a drastically scaled-down 
program that involves purchasing off-the-shelf computer software.

SCANDAL IMPERILS YOUNG POLITICAL CAREER; POLITICS: AFTER MONTHS OF DENIAL, A 
RIVERSIDE CONGRESSMAN ADMITS SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH A KNOWN PROSTITUTE. 'I WAS 
FEELING INTENSELY LONELY,' HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It would not have been an easy reelection bid in any case for freshman Rep. 
Ken Calvert (R-Riverside), who barely made it to Congress two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Calvert's biggest reelection hurdle may be his own indiscretions, 
which also could pose a problem in surviving even his own party's June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: After months of denying it, Calvert, 40, has admitted having sex 
in his car one night last November with a woman who police say is a known 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Calvert -- a member of a prominent Riverside County family -- said 
he was doing nothing wrong with the woman when police saw them together on a 
Corona street. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona police said simply that the congressman was spotted sitting in his car 
with a female, that there was no criminal activity and that after a few words 
the congressman drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Riverside Press-Enterprise newspaper went to court to press Corona for 
release of confidential police reports that had been prepared by officers who 
were sensitive to the fact that they had a street-level encounter with their 
local congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was ordered to release the report, which indicated that there had 
been evidence of a sex act under way, and an embarrassed Calvert responded with 
a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "My conduct that evening was inappropriate," he said -- not because it was 
illegal, but because "it violated the values of the person I strive to be." He 
admitted that he was caught in "an extremely embarrassing situation." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not pay for the sex. He said he "panicked and tried to drive 
away" when the officers confronted him, but "came to my senses" and cooperated 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona Police Capt. John Dalzell said Calvert was not detained or arrested 
because "while the officer saw certain things, he didn't see everything 
necessary to support a finding that a crime was committed." Dalzell said there 
was no witness to an exchange of money for services, and neither party claimed 
to be a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalzell said Calvert did not try to exert influence to avoid arrest. He said 
the officer's decision not to pursue the matter "wasn't a close call. He didn't 
even call for a supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
 In his explanation for his conduct that night, Calvert said he had come back 
from a rough week in Washington and was reeling from his father's suicide a 
year earlier, as well as his wife's request for a divorce, which had been 
granted just a few weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling intensely lonely," he said. "I realize now that this, or a 
similar incident, was probably inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert, who worked in commercial real estate before his election to Congress 
in 1992, was expected to coast to his party's nomination this year to represent 
western Riverside County in Washington. His opponent in the primary, 
conservative Joe Khoury, 47, a professor of finance at UC Riverside, ran second 
behind Calvert in the primary two years ago but thinks he can prevail this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was vulnerable, even before this incident," Khoury said. 
"Riverside is conservative, and voters' reaction to this is not pleasant. It 
plays differently here than it would in, say, Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert's campaign manager, Ed Slevin, agreed that Calvert will have his hands 
full winning the primary because of the Corona incident. "I assume he's more 
vulnerable in June among conservative Republicans than he'll be in November," 
he said. "I think that, by then, it'll be considered old news." 
</P>
<P>
 If Calvert wins the primary, his Democratic challenger is expected to be Mark 
Takano, a high school history and English teacher and trustee of the Riverside 
Community College District. Takano lost to Calvert by a little more than 500 
votes in 1992, and is expected to handily win his party's nomination in June 
against a single challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Takano scolded Calvert for not coming clean earlier about the Corona incident. 
"Mr. Calvert has only himself to blame for his becoming a bigger issue than 
putting people back to work, fighting crime and improving our schools," Takano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Party strategists said that, even before Calvert's encounter with 
the woman in Corona, the 43rd Congressional District seat had been targeted for 
turnover because of what they characterized as Calvert's lackluster performance 
in Washington during his first stint there and his vulnerability back home.

APRIL GLOWERS AND WHITENS PARTS OF SOUTHLAND WITH SNOW, HAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A cold, blustery storm system hopscotched across Southern California on 
Tuesday afternoon, drenching some areas with sudden downpours, peppering others 
with pea-sized hail and dusting San Dimas and Mission Hills with snow. 
</P>
<P>
 A funnel cloud was reported over the ocean south of Camp Pendleton, and 
several others were sighted near Bakersfield and in rural areas of Riverside 
and San Bernardino counties. None of the twisters touched down and there was no 
major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain forced postponement of Tuesday night's battle in the Medfly war, 
grounding helicopters scheduled to spray the Corona and Norco areas with the 
insecticide malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning strikes peppered Southern California, and several brief power 
outages were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Although brief, heavy cloudbursts struck in Malibu and Altadena -- areas 
stripped of ground cover during last fall's devastating brush fires -- there 
were no large mudslides and no reports of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise was the snow -- unusual almost anywhere in Southern 
California at this time of year and especially rare in relatively low-lying 
areas of the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mission Hills, Lee Ann Ercolono 32, watched two cars spin out on slushy 
Sepulveda Boulevard as she drove north toward the car dealership where she 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed behind the bus and followed its tracks," said Ercolono, who admitted 
she was a novice at driving in snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street at the Hair Lib barbershop, Cassandra Phillips, 35, and her 
husband, Jesse Torres, 40, did what any thinking Southern Californians would do 
in an April blizzard: They broke out a camera to record the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," Phillips said. "Of course I've seen snow before, but 
not here." In San Dimas, streets and yards turned white briefly under a 
short-lived dusting of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically all over San Dimas," said Warren Toy, a deputy at the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department substation there. "This is totally new to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said the inclement 
weather was spawned by an unusually strong spring storm system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jet stream has been driving straight south from Western Canada, pumping a 
lot of cold air into California," Brack said. "When the cold air and moisture 
combine, you can get some snow, even in Southern California. The thundershowers 
generally were fast-moving, though, and they didn't stick around long enough in 
any one place for anyone to get a lot of precipitation." 
</P>
<P>
 Rainfall totals from the storm generally were light, with 0.71 of an inch 
reported in Anaheim, 0.70 in Woodland Hills, 0.56 in Monrovia, 0.45 in 
Beaumont, 0.37 in San Juan Capistrano, 0.29 in Pasadena, 0.20 in Redondo Beach 
and 0.06 in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-hour total at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Tuesday night was 0.09 of 
an inch. That raised the season's total to 7.65 inches, compared with the 
normal season's total for the date of 14.47 inches. Yearly rainfall recording 
is based on a calendar that runs from July 1 through June 30.

ON CALIFORNIA: ANOTHER FUNERAL OF NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hearse was preceded through the cemetery gate by Channel 9 and Channel 7. 
This was one week ago today, before the death of Richard Nixon, and it seemed 
every television station in the L.A. Basin had sent news vans to the Olivewood 
Cemetery. The cameras had not been invited, but their attendance was no 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The deceased was Gloria Ramirez. Not everyone will recognize the name, for 
this was a woman who lived her 31 years outside the news. "A simple homemaker," 
said the minister who came to bury her. Only as a corpse did Ramirez become 
public property. The circumstances of death -- "that bizarre incident at the 
hospital," the Rev. Brian Taylor had put it obliquely at a service the night 
before -- unleashed one of those quirky news stories that occasionally grab the 
public imagination and don't let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez had been brought to the Riverside General Hospital on Feb. 19 in 
cardiac arrest. Her skin, a nurse would recall later, was oily, "like you see 
on the ground of a gas station." As blood was drawn, a nurse noticed a strong 
smell and passed out. Other members of the medical team began to collapse. The 
emergency room was evacuated. Gloria Ramirez died, and eight weeks of headlines 
began. Headlines like: 
</P>
<P>
 DYING PATIENT BLAMED FOR SICKENING FUMES 
</P>
<P>
 And, GLORIA'S NOT AN ALIEN, SAYS DISTRAUGHT FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
 And, SHUT COFFIN ORDERED IN FUMES CASE 
</P>
<P>
 And, SMELLY BODY TO BE RELEASED, BUT NO FUNERAL HOME WANTS IT. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The case was cast as a medical mystery. Even today it remains a matter of 
contention what caused the powerful stench. Riverside County authorities 
suspect that the odor came from the body of Ramirez; her survivors contend that 
the hospital was to blame. More than scientific uncertainty, however, provided 
what the family attorney would call "the steam behind this story." A surreal 
autopsy conducted by investigators in toxic suits and a macabre battle over the 
remains also kept it alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond all that, though, something else seems to have happened to Ramirez. It 
is an awkward point to make, but she became a gag line -- an inspiration for 
water cooler comedians all over the country. The tiniest wink, the barest 
smirk, often seemed to play across the faces of news readers as they provided 
the latest "fumes" update. And radio's morning talent, a species that thrives 
on bad taste, could not contain itself. On the very morning she was buried, one 
team of L.A. deejays offered a concocted "new disclosure" that the CIA and MTV 
were to blame for the "mystery odor." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the death of Gloria Ramirez had elements of a Monte Python skit -- 
slapstick, tasteless. Humor, though, can be a matter of distance, and her 
survivors found nothing funny in her death. Also, the twittering did not escape 
their attention. Her brother-in-law has complained of a descent into "a 
science-fiction entertainment fiasco," and her sister, Maggie Ramirez-Garcia, 
said through anger and tears last week that "everyone is making her look like 
she was some type of freak." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria," the Rev. Taylor said simply at the memorial service, "has not been 
treated right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The service was short, simple and sad. It was painful to notice how Buddy, 
Ramirez's youngest child, looked away from his mother's portrait on the pearl 
white casket, as if to keep himself composed. Restoration of dignity was a main 
theme. The stories Taylor told about Ramirez were banal and ordinary, and this 
made them more powerful. For the first time since her death, she was presented 
in public not as a toxic corpse, but rather as a simple woman who looked after 
her two children, cooked meals, helped with homework and "made people laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 At the cemetery the next morning, camera crews and reporters were kept at a 
distance. The family had ordered it. So the cameras rolled from across the 
road, their operators whistling angrily at anyone who stepped in the way of the 
shot. The minister sang "Amazing Grace." The mourners hugged one another, wept 
and then headed for their cars. A few paused for interviews. Most just drove 
away, followed by the news vans. 
</P>
<P>
 And today, exactly one week later, the cameras -- their numbers greatly 
multiplied -- take up positions at a grave site 15 miles to the west, in Yorba 
Linda. Richard Nixon is to be buried. So far, the posthumous analysis has been 
uniformly kind to the first U.S. President ever to be chased from office. This 
kindness seems fitting enough. Speaking well of the dead, allowing them a final 
dignity, is a basic human courtesy. Gloria Ramirez just got cheated.

VOTERS, INCLUDING BOMB VICTIM, RELISH MAKING MARK ON HISTORY; SOUTH AFRICA: 
WHITES AND BLACKS WAIT SIDE BY SIDE AT POLLS. IT'S SOMETHING MANY THOUGHT THEY 
WOULD NEVER SEE.

 Two days before, a car bomb blew shrapnel into Zibani Dube's chest as he 
walked to church here. But on Tuesday, the tall 19-year-old, in a hospital bed 
and barely able to move, used his uninjured right hand to cast his first vote 
as a free black man in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very satisfied," he said, wincing in pain as he spoke from beneath a 
plastic oxygen mask. "The government I am voting for is the one that will meet 
our needs. But I feel it has got to take some strong measures so we do not face 
these kinds of criminal actions again." 
</P>
<P>
 Whom did he vote for? "That's my secret," Dube said, managing a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day that many in South Africa, and many more around the world, 
thought they would never see. White suburban women stood in line to vote with 
their black maids. Retired white businessmen were there with elderly black 
gardeners. All across the country, South Africa's black, white, mixed-race and 
ethnic Indian citizens began choosing their country's government -- together -- 
for the first time in 350 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of three days of balloting was set aside for special voters, such as 
the elderly and the ailing, as well as police and election workers. At a 
suburban Johannesburg school, used for dozens of whites-only elections in the 
apartheid past, a black policeman was the first voter through the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It actually put a lump in my throat to give him that ballot," said Jennifer 
Dunn, 45, a white voting officer in the school. "It's all very exciting. It's 
incredible the enthusiasm I see, especially among the older black voters." 
</P>
<P>
 At Hillbrow Hospital, which has mostly black patients and staff, men and women 
in hospital-issue checkered robes, some on crutches and others carrying bags of 
fluid for intravenous drips, stood in a line that snaked up two flights of 
stairs to voting booths in the hospital auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they had been taught how to cast their votes, many blacks appeared 
tentative at first. Election officials checked each voter's identity document. 
The voter's hand was put beneath an ultraviolet light to ensure that he had not 
already voted, then the fingers were sprayed with a dye. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters received a national ballot first and went to a row of small booths 
where they marked an X next to one of the 18 parties. That ballot was placed in 
a box, and the procedure was repeated for the provincial ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in my life," said August Renoto, 32, who was in the 
hospital with pneumonia. "My father -- even my grandfathers -- never has been 
allowed to vote in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Under South African law, voters cannot be asked how they voted as they leave 
the polls. But Renoto volunteered that he voted for the African National 
Congress, the likely election winner. "There is no one else but Nelson 
Mandela," he said of the ANC president. 
</P>
<P>
 Francina Malatye, a 49-year-old black woman, said she was confident that her 
vote would "bring a new South Africa. It's going to be nice from now on. We 
will live well, just like in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Zibani Dube had been so determined to vote that he obtained his laminated 
temporary voter card more than a month ago. When the bomb blast killed nine and 
landed Dube in Hillbrow Hospital, his first request was for his voter card. His 
parents brought it in, placing it in a steel drawer next to his bed.

 On Tuesday, election officials walked the bare halls of the hospital to find 
the bedridden and others unable to make the climb to the hospital auditorium. 
They found Dube almost alone in a 20-bed ward, surrounded by black nurses and 
lying beneath a long white sheet with tubes running out of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election is going to help this country a lot," Dube said. "Things are 
going to change, and there will be an atmosphere of peace and love in South 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "if the new government is not aware of the right-wingers who 
threaten the system, it will cause much trouble for the country. Every South 
African, be he black or white, must be able to live in safety." 
</P>
<P>
 If the recent spate of bombings, which killed 21 Sunday and Monday in the 
deadliest campaign ever waged by the far right, was designed to keep voters 
away from the polls, it didn't appear to have worked Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk had sought to reassure voters that they would 
be safe, and at least a dozen police and army soldiers guarded most polling 
places. Most voters said they felt the day was too important for them to be 
deterred by small groups of right-wing terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did have a little worry," said Christine Oxton, a 43-year-old white woman 
who uses a wheelchair. "But I had to be here. And this is long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxton, who does volunteer work for a black education aid group, said she hoped 
the voting will foster big changes in race relations. "As a white South 
African, I actually feel cheated that I know so little about my black brothers 
and sisters," she said. "That will change now. I just hope it will be the right 
thing for this country at the end of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Loudon, a white woman from Johannesburg's suburbs who has voted in 
elections for three decades, arrived at a polling station with her retired 
husband and a disabled son. She said she was concerned more about the country's 
future than her safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about where this country is going," she said. "And I think a lot 
more whites are going to vote than ever before, not because of the bombings but 
because we're worried about the country." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said that voting alongside blacks, who have been denied the vote by 
white governments in South Africa, seemed only fair. "They should have had the 
vote long ago," she said. "I don't think black people would have run the 
country as well, but they still should have been able to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, J. R., added: "There's really no question who's going to win. It 
will be the ANC. But the important question for us is who finishes second and 
third. That's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Many blacks, as well as whites, seemed to take the new, all-race voting in 
stride. Despite the racism that has been a characteristic of South Africa for 
years, blacks and whites do work together, though often in situations that make 
it clear who is the boss. And many millions of them share a desire for calm in 
their society. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorah Kubela, a black maid from Soweto, has cleaned white-owned houses and 
taken care of white children all her life. While visiting her daughter, who 
works as a maid in a white household in Johannesburg's suburbs, she cast her 
ballot in a voting station used primarily by whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very nice that charwomen and madams are voting together," said Kubela, 
69. "But I just wish it would all be over. There is just too much trouble in 
this country."

U.S. AID PLAN FOR S. AFRICA CRITICIZED AS SHIFTING FUNDS; ASSISTANCE: SOME 
LAWMAKERS SAY IT WOULD HURT OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS BY DIVERTING MONEY FROM THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The glow of goodwill that the Clinton Administration hoped would follow the 
unveiling of its South African aid package has been dimmed by complaints that 
it apparently will rely in part on money diverted from other struggling African 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 At a White House meeting Tuesday to discuss the all-race elections in South 
Africa and plans for U.S. aid, some lawmakers and pro-African groups told 
President Clinton of their concerns that the diversion of funds would set back 
other sub-Saharan countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior members of African affairs subcommittees of both the House and Senate 
also have voiced unhappiness over such a shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can and should find funding sources for South Africa that will not 
jeopardize the already underfunded assistance given the rest of Africa," Rep. 
Donald M. Payne (D-N.J.) said in recent testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The aid package, expected to total between $160 million and $200 million, has 
offered Administration officials hope of improving strained relations with the 
Congressional Black Caucus over the Administration policy on Haiti. Generally, 
caucus members and other lawmakers interested in Africa policy are pleased with 
the South African aid plan, which some sources said will be announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the caucus already has written to the White House registering its formal 
objection to the plan, largely because it will rechannel about $70 million in 
aid from other African nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, the plan is quite thoughtful," one congressional aide said. "It's 
just this idea that the extra money would have to come out of the hide of other 
African countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Africa advocates contend that because the Administration has hailed the 
dismantling of apartheid as a historic event, like the demise of communism in 
Eastern Europe, the aid should have the same magnitude as assistance to the 
former Communist states. South Africa itself should merit the $2 billion in 
regional aid earmarked for the former Soviet republics, they have argued. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have acknowledged that they are fighting a tough battle at a moment 
when the foreign aid budget is stretched thin and powerful interests would 
fight to block any shift of aid earmarked for the former Soviet republics and 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid to South Africa in the current fiscal year totals $80 million, all of 
which has been funneled through non-governmental groups to avoid subsidizing 
the apartheid system. 
</P>
<P>
 A large part of the new money will take the form of housing guarantees, in 
hopes of helping finance a rapid expansion of badly needed shelter for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of housing guarantees tends to exaggerate the size of the aid package, 
since a modest amount of capital can generate a far larger amount in 
guarantees. Only $5 million in U.S. aid, for example, might generate $50 
million in guarantees from South African lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials declined to discuss details of the plan, which they 
said remains incomplete. They noted that aid to East Asia and Latin America was 
cut sharply in the current fiscal year while African aid was not decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 American aid to South Africa is expected to remain at the same level for two 
years, beginning with the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. U.S. officials hope 
to be able to reduce the level of aid in subsequent years, once the country 
begins meeting long-neglected needs for housing and electricity and education 
infrastructure. Aid to all other sub-Saharan countries totaled $704 million 
this year.

PUBLIC OPINION; POLLS FIND U.S. IS UNWILLING TO FORCE TOBACCO'S LAST GASP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BRENNAN, TIMES POLL DIRECTOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years after the U.S. surgeon general first warned about the health 
risks of cigarette smoking, Americans are convinced that the practice is 
harmful -- but are not ready to make this a tobacco-free nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress and the Clinton Administration are pondering sweeping anti-smoking 
measures. And a landmark class-action lawsuit recently charged tobacco 
companies with conspiring to addict smokers to their product. 
</P>
<P>
 But new national polls, including one by The Times, show that the public 
remains torn between concerns over health and smokers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveys have lots of bad news for the embattled tobacco industry: Despite 
its claims to the contrary, almost 8 in 10 Americans think secondhand smoke is 
a health risk, an ABC News poll found. About the same number believe that 
nicotine is an addictive drug, and two-thirds support its regulation by the 
federal government. That possibility recently was raised by Food and Drug 
Administration Commissioner David A. Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll found that 73% of those surveyed support raising taxes on 
cigarettes to help pay for health care reform. And more than 3 in 5 favor a 
proposed Labor Department directive to ban smoking in almost all indoor 
workplaces, including restaurants and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 That rule would still allow for smoking in designated enclosed areas with 
separate ventilation systems -- a policy that fits well with the public's 
feelings. For despite concerns about smoking, a Gallup Poll found that 63% of 
the public still wants some kind of set-aside where people can smoke in the 
workplace. Fifty-seven percent back smoking areas in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one-quarter of adults say they smoke at least a pack per week, the Times 
survey found. But even among nonsmokers, support for radical anti-smoking 
measures is limited. Just 45% of the public told Gallup that they would back a 
complete ban on cigarette advertising, and only 11% would ban smoking entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are Americans ready to make tobacco firms the prime culprits in the 
smoking battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the companies or the individual smoker bears more of the 
responsibility for smoking, just 23% fault the industry "for making cigarettes 
and encouraging smoking." Almost two-thirds blame smokers "for deciding to 
start and for not taking the steps to quit." Smokers Blamed More Than Industry 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Americans think nicotine is addictive, most still blame smokers 
more than the cigarette industry for people smoking. Addictive: 79% Not 
addictive: 15% Don't know: 6% * Smokers: 64% Industry: 23% Neither/both: 11% 
Don't know: 2% Source: Los Angeles Times Poll of 813 adults taken nationwide 
April 16 to 19. Margin of error is 4 percentage points.

DATELINE: SEATTLE; NORTHWEST IS NOT READY FOR THE BIG ONES; WARNINGS OF A MAJOR 
QUAKE, TSUNAMI AND VOLCANIC MUDFLOWS ARE BEING IGNORED BY MOST RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Floods, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, brutal winter storms -- the Pacific 
Northwest has escaped the worst of nature's recent uprisings. 
</P>
<P>
 But -- ah, yes, there is a very big BUT in this story -- only the most 
fatalistic here can sleep easily, amid growing evidence of great dangers 
lurking below, beyond and above. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that a pitiful lack of preparation and little experience with 
large-scale urban disasters, and you hear Northwesterners shrug uneasily among 
themselves and remark: "Boy, it's going to be awful. Hope I'm away on 
vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 The triple threat is for a colossal quake, a giant tsunami and rampaging 
mudflows from the volcano Mt. Rainier, 60 miles from Seattle. The picture is 
further darkened by unfavorable regional geography, suburban sprawl into 
volcanic danger zones, a plethora of old brick buildings, heavy reliance on 
bridges for transportation and a civic infrastructure already stretched thin. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, scientists from Washington and Oregon issued the latest in a long 
string of eerie warnings: The region is ripe for a deep, giant jolt caused as 
the floor of the North Pacific thrusts itself under the North American 
continent -- a subduction earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the scientists measured unexpectedly rapid uplift of 
ground level along the Northwest coast, bulges rising 10 times as fast as 
elsewhere along the coast. The release of this pent-up energy could generate an 
earthquake of magnitude 8, the scientists figured. Other studies said a 
magnitude 9 quake could be expected from this bumping of tectonic plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the geologic record, such great quakes are infrequent. But their 
impact is huge: One point of land within sight of Seattle rose 23 feet during 
such a quake about 1,100 years ago. Scientists say there is evidence of a 
tsunami inundating Puget Sound, which is well inland from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 In modern times, a 7.1 quake shook Puget Sound south of Tacoma in 1949; and a 
6.5 quake hit Seattle in 1965. Since then, Portland experienced a 5-plus 
earthquake, but Seattle has not moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither have government officials. The state commissioned an earthquake 
preparedness study in 1991, but few of its recommendations were accepted. For 
several years, Washington governors have requested appropriations to upgrade 
earthquake preparedness but were rebuffed by the state Legislature. This year, 
for the first time, $650,000 was approved. This may allow the state to hire its 
first earthquake planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Washington look at California with envy when it comes to 
readiness. "If California is a 10 on the scale, the most prepared, we are still 
a 1 or 2," says Terry Simmons of the state Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 With all of its lakes, rivers and Puget Sound islands, the region is 
inordinately dependent on bridges. The state has begun strengthening these 
lifelines, but unless the pace is increased, it will take 71 years to complete 
work on all of the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 After January's 6.8 Northridge quake, experts here expressed frustration with 
the "so-what?" attitude of many here. "They're going to have to be actually 
dragging bodies out before there's a concerted effort in this state," state 
geologist Steve Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle has undertaken a preparedness program, but only recently. In the 
process, officials discovered two public buildings -- the police station, where 
the 911 emergency switchboard is located, and the Seattle City Light utility 
headquarters -- are too unsound to retrofit and will have to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsunamis, huge ocean waves, are often associated with coastal, subduction-type 
quakes. In 1992, scientists here began re-evaluating the Northwest's 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand berms were discovered on the Washington coast from what is believed to 
have been a tsunami 300 years ago. This is considered significant in view of 
the scant evidence remaining from the 9-plus earthquakes of the 1960s in Chile 
and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as worrisome is Mt. Rainier, which the Cascades Volcano Observatory in 
Vancouver, Wash., calls the most dangerous volcano in America. That's because 
of its size (14,410 feet high), its massive mantle of stored ice and snow and 
its proximity to the dense population of Seattle-Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain has not sprung to life for 150 years, and has not seen a 
full-scale eruption in about 2,000 years, but Rainier has a history of 
generating giant mudflows, or lahars. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 156 billion cubic feet of ice and snow are stored on its unstable 
flanks, more than all the other Cascade volcanoes combined. Even a small quake 
or the everyday rotting of the mountain could trigger a stupendous, fast-moving 
mudflow.

RUSSIA, ISRAEL PLAN STRONGER TIES, RABIN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wrapping up the first visit to Russia by an Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak 
Rabin emerged from talks with Kremlin leaders Tuesday saying he is convinced 
that Moscow is working constructively toward peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the book on more than 40 years of hostility between the former Soviet 
Union and the Jewish state, Rabin said Israel and Russia expect to strengthen 
their ties in everything from trade to military cooperation. Plans include a 
visit to Israel by Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, whose visit was prompted in part by signs that Moscow is seeking a more 
active Middle East role, stressed that he has the Kremlin's agreement that 
neither Russia nor the United States should meddle in Israeli-Palestinian peace 
talks now under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The understanding, I believe, on the part of Russia, as well as on the part 
of the United States, is to leave the negotiations to be done between us and 
the representatives of the PLO in Cairo," Rabin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 His trip to Moscow followed a visit last week by Palestine Liberation 
Organization leader Yasser Arafat -- who, like Rabin, acquainted Russian 
leaders with his views on the snags in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia and the United States co-sponsored the Mideast peace process launched 
in Madrid in 1991, but Moscow took a clear back seat to Washington at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev has been pushing to make 
Moscow's foreign policy more assertive in general to steal the initiative from 
rising Russian ultranationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Israel's interest in Russia, Rabin emphasized mainly the possibilities 
for expanded trade, saying that an agreement on economic ties and free trade 
expected to be signed today is the most important of more than half a dozen 
concluded during his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The warming of Israeli-Russian relations came in striking contrast to Moscow's 
Cold War-era role of supporting the Arab nations against U.S.-backed Israel. 
The Soviet Union and Israel established diplomatic relations only in 1991, 
after a 24-year break.

'HOUSE OF HORROR' IN BRITAIN FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain's "House of Horror," where police have exhumed nine female bodies, is 
being put up for sale, lawyers for accused serial killer Frederick West and his 
wife, Rosemary, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 West, a 52-year-old builder, has been charged with the murder of nine young 
women whose remains were dug up by police from the yard, cellar and a bathroom 
wall at the house in a police operation that began in February. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also been charged with the murder of his first wife, Catherine, whose 
remains were found in a field near the village of Much Marcle, northwest of 
Gloucester. Rosemary West has also been charged with one of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Tuesday began digging for bodies at a second home once occupied by 
West, also located in Gloucester. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they had no objection to the sale of the house at 25 Cromwell St., 
dubbed the "House of Horror" by British media.

JAPAN'S PREMIER FACES PROSPECT OF MINORITY GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata faces the prospect today of forming a 
minority government lacking authority at home and credibility abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejected on one side by the Socialists, who bolted the nation's ruling 
coalition early Tuesday, and condemned on the other by the Liberal Democrats, 
Japan's rulers from 1955 to 1993, Hata failed for a second day to form a 
Cabinet and participate in a ratification ceremony in the presence of Emperor 
Akihito. 
</P>
<P>
 A policy speech he had been scheduled to deliver also was postponed 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the imperial ceremony, limited power to implement routine business 
remains in the hands of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his Cabinet 
ministers, all of whom resigned Monday before Parliament elected Hata prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Japan -- a nation that, with the same party controlling the 
government for 38 years, enjoyed such stability that critics charged it was not 
a real democracy -- had no functioning government. And a return of stability 
and credible government was nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripped of assured support from its former partners -- the Socialists and the 
New Party Harbinger, which earlier declared it would not join the new Cabinet 
-- the four parties and three splinter groups now in the coalition hold only 
37% of the seats in the lower house and 24% in the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a government would be able to pass legislation only with help from its 
opponents and would lack international credibility to carry out promises. A 
plan to present to the United States in June a program of economic policies to 
substantially reduce Japan's trade surplus appeared threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters and opponents of the coalition agreed that the 1994 budget must be 
enacted quickly, offering hope that opponents might not try to throw the 
coalition out of office until the budget is passed, probably in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yomiuri newspaper today reported a growing possibility that the lower 
house will be dissolved and a general election held after the budget is passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Budgets normally are submitted to Parliament in late January and approved by 
late March before the fiscal year begins April 1. Japan is operating on an 
interim budget, and deliberations on the spending bill have not begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshiro Mori, the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, urged Hata to decline 
his designation by Parliament as prime minister. Meanwhile, the party's 
president, Yohei Kono, offered to cooperate with the Socialists and the New 
Party Harbinger, while Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the same offer 
to the Liberal Democrats and Harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata continued his efforts to persuade the Socialists to rescind their 
decision. But his pleas fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama declared that the Socialists' former partners had broken faith with 
his party, which holds 74 seats in the lower house, by secretly establishing a 
130-member "parliamentary negotiation bloc" -- which acts like a single 
political party in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Establishment of the bloc, "which must have been planned some time ago," was 
an attempt to "contain the Socialists" through "the power of numbers," he 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Vice Chairman Jun Oide declared: "We won't go back. The only path is 
to create a new political structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition hopes that a rebellion might develop within the Socialist Party also 
faded. The party's central committee, a caucus of its members of Parliament and 
even its most conservative faction all officially approved Murayama's decision 
to withdraw from the coalition. Party executives also rejected a coalition 
offer to abolish the controversial negotiating bloc if they would return to the 
government.

WHITE HOUSE MAY DILUTE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT; SENTENCING: OFFICIALS ARE PUBLICLY 
QUIET ABOUT THE CONTROVERSIAL PLAN. BUT THEY ARE DISCUSSING WAYS TO EASE DEATH 
ROW MEASURE THROUGH CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After months of maintaining a low profile on the issue, Administration 
officials are quietly seeking a compromise to retain a pared-down version of 
the controversial Racial Justice Act in the final crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In preliminary talks with members of Congress, Administration officials are 
discussing revisions that would significantly narrow but not eliminate the 
measure -- as Republicans and some Senate Democrats are demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 As passed by the House, the racial justice measure would allow all prisoners 
on Death Row to challenge their sentences with statistics showing that the 
jurisdiction sentencing them had applied the death penalty proportionately more 
often to minorities than to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is exploring alternatives that would allow such challenges 
only by prisoners sentenced after the act is approved and that would lower the 
burden of proof prosecutors must meet to overcome the inference of bias, a 
senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the official said, the Administration is discussing limiting 
the bill solely to capital cases in the federal system -- a change that would 
essentially reduce the legislation to a symbolic precedent since more than 99% 
of the prisoners now on Death Row have been sentenced through state courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledged that it will be like "threading a 
needle" to craft a compromise that satisfies House liberals who favor a 
stronger version of the act and Senate Democrats who fear that any racial 
justice provision will prompt a Republican filibuster when the crime bill 
returns to that chamber from conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many inside the Administration are skeptical it can be done," said the senior 
official. But Administration officials appear committed to ensuring that even 
if the racial justice bill ultimately is dropped, the liberal legislators and 
constituencies supporting it do not blame Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 While seeking compromise in private, the Administration is struggling to 
articulate a public position on the polarizing issue. In an appearance Tuesday 
before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno would say little 
about the House version of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, President Clinton also spoke cautiously about the bill, although he 
said: "We think that you can absolutely have a racial justice provision that 
will do some good." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as any other single provision, the racial justice measure illustrates 
the imposing difficulty of holding together a legislative majority for the 
sprawling crime bill. While the anti-discrimination provision is extremely 
important to liberals, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, it is 
anathema to Republicans and conservative Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 If the provisions are dropped in conference, it is likely that more members of 
the Black Caucus will condemn the bill and sharpen the racial divides implicit 
in the crime debate. If they are included, they could prompt a Republican 
filibuster in the Senate -- and heated charges from conservatives that Clinton 
had undermined enforcement of the death penalty, despite his strong support for 
capital punishment in the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights groups and other backers said that the measure is necessary to 
end a pattern of discrimination in the enforcement of capital sentences. 
Opponents, including a national organization of district attorneys and state 
attorneys general, maintain that the procedural hurdles would effectively 
eliminate the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 During the House debate, the Administration studiously avoided a public 
position, frustrating proponents and opponents alike. But officials said that 
the Administration is involved in quiet talks with proponents, including Rep. 
Don Edwards (D-San Jose), to craft a compromise Clinton could support. 
</P>
<P>
 Those talks blew up just before the Easter recess, when opposition from the 
Black Caucus and civil rights groups convinced Edwards not to offer an 
amendment narrowing the act to future and federal cases, Administration sources 
said. Supporters took that broader version to the floor and prevailed in a 
217-212 vote last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Edwards warned against further dilution of the measure. "We've 
already drawn a line in the sand," he said. "We're absolutely not going to give 
in on that. . . . It would send the worst possible signal to African Americans 
that whites don't care about black lives." 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate leaders already have sent clear signals that the House bill has no 
chance of clearing the upper chamber.

ABORTION DOCTOR'S ATTACKER GETS 11-YEAR TERM, SHOWS NO REGRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Comparing herself to Jesus and insisting that she had not done anything wrong, 
a woman who admitted shooting an abortion doctor outside his clinic was 
sentenced Tuesday to nearly 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachelle Shannon was convicted March 25 of attempted first-degree murder in 
the attack on Dr. George Tiller, whose Women's Health Care Services clinic has 
long been a target of anti-abortion activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiller was shot in both arms as he left his clinic Aug. 19. The wounds were 
minor and he returned to work the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, 38, of Grants Pass, Ore., told Sedgwick County District Judge Gregory 
Waller at her sentencing hearing that attacking Tiller was not wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't do wrong? You did wrong," Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said that about Jesus," Shannon replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon also was convicted of aggravated assault for pointing a gun at a 
clinic employee and was found in contempt for refusing to say where she got the 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal authorities in several jurisdictions are investigating her 
possible links to violence against abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Waller sentenced Shannon to nine years and eight months in prison on the 
charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault. He also sentenced her on 
the contempt charge to a year in county jail, to be served after the prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison sentence could be reduced to seven years and nine months for good 
behavior. There is no automatic reduction of the county jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon has been in custody since the shooting in lieu of $1-million bail. She 
will get credit for jail time already served. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon told the judge that she felt sorry for Tiller when she saw photos of 
his wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But she agreed with Dist. Atty. Nola Foulston's assertion that she showed no 
remorse, because "it would be hypocritical to pretend like I feel like I did 
something wrong when I know I didn't," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she would never again touch a gun, not because of what she did to 
Tiller but because of what her actions have done to her and her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, David, and daughter, Angi, were not present for the sentencing.

MITCHELL OFFERS 3 OPTIONS TO SPEED UP HEALTH REFORM; LEGISLATION: THE CHOICES 
ELIMINATE OR CUT EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY ARE MEANT TO EASE THE FINANCIAL 
BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESSES, THE PLAN'S BIGGEST FOES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), trying to speed up progress 
on health care legislation, offered three options Tuesday for easing the 
financial burdens of reform on small business owners -- the most implacable 
foes of the President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 His effort marked the second time in the last two weeks that he has undertaken 
such an exercise, and it underscored the degree to which he is taking control 
of the course of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 All three choices were prepared with the help of Administration officials and 
are designed to stimulate thinking among senators about the single most 
controversial element in President Clinton's plan: a requirement that all 
employers pay up to 80% of the cost of their workers' health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton would offer discounts to small businesses employing low-paid 
workers, lawmakers have expressed fear that the requirement could force many 
firms to lay off workers or close their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Mitchell's alternatives, similar to an approach by House Energy and 
Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), would exempt firms with 
fewer than 10 workers from any obligation to contribute toward their employees' 
health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet Clinton's goal of coverage for every American, however, that approach 
would require employees in those firms to pay as much as 3.9% of their income 
for premiums with government subsidies assisting those who could not afford it. 
That would cost the federal treasury as much as $55 billion over the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The second option would extend the mandate even to the smallest firms but 
would lower the share of payroll they would be required to spend. Once again, 
however, that would require Washington to spend more -- as much as $35 billion 
over 10 years -- to assure that all workers are fully covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's final option -- the least costly -- would reduce the ratio of 
employer-employee contribution for all firms from the 80-20 formula proposed by 
Clinton to 50-50. That would put a greater burden on individuals, with families 
paying as much as 6% of their incomes for health benefits, compared to 3.9% 
under the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 All three efforts to ease the burden on small businesses raise new problems, 
Mitchell noted in his presentation at the Democratic Caucus weekly luncheon. 
Among them: encouraging large firms to splinter into smaller ones whose health 
costs would be lower, increasing the complexity of administering the system and 
shifting costs and raising the program's price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a massive survey released Tuesday by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 
underscored how difficult it will be to persuade businesses to support any 
government requirement that they pay part of their workers' health insurance 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 40,000 employers, 75% of whom are small business owners, responded to 
the survey and 71.2% said that an employer mandate is "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, chamber officials said, the organization intends to be "extremely 
active" in fighting such an employer mandate -- a key element in Clinton's 
reform agenda as well as in a variety of competing proposals taking shape in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be pushing hard -- opposing mandates," said Richard L. Lesher, 
president of the nation's largest business group, which has 220,000 members. 
That opposition, he said, would include even a mandate with a 50-50 split 
between employer and worker. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that 55.3% of respondents oppose the notion that all 
Americans should have guaranteed coverage -- Clinton's one non-negotiable goal. 
As a result, Lesher said, the chamber will continue its current "suspension" of 
support for universal coverage.

TEXAS CITY'S HISTORIC DOWNTOWN LEVELED BY TORNADO THAT KILLED 3

<P>
 A business district dating to the years just after the Civil War was left in 
ruins Tuesday after a tornado smashed through town, killing three people and 
destroying up to 200 homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot of hard days ahead, a lot of them," Police Chief Mac 
McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
 A building that once housed a bank robbed by Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker 
lost all of its second floor except for a corner facade. 
</P>
<P>
 A mattress dangled from a tree in front of the 119-year-old Odd Fellows Hall, 
which lost much of its second floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The twister struck this former cotton farming region Monday night. The area 
has become one of Dallas' fastest-developing suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornado's path through Lancaster was six miles long and a half-mile wide, 
said Trooper Robert White of the Texas Department of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadly weather moved north Tuesday to Gainesville, 70 miles away, where a 
tornado heavily damaged a trailer park and tore apart billboards and other 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 In Minnesota, homes and other buildings sustained heavy damage Tuesday when a 
tornado touched down west of Stillwater, authorities said. No serious injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday morning, the weather in the northern Plains had reverted to wintry 
conditions. Up to eight inches of snow fell in northeastern Wyoming and a foot 
fell in the Black Hills of South Dakota, closing some roads and schools. 
Blizzards clogged roads across North Dakota, and Gov. Edward T. Schafer closed 
the state Capitol.

JUDGE REINSTATES FIRST-DEGREE RAPE CHARGES AGAINST 5 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has agreed to reinstate first-degree rape charges against five men who 
were fined $750 after they had sex with a woman they found unconscious in a 
restaurant bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting state Supreme Court Justice Eugene L. Nicandri issued his decision 
Tuesday, clearing the way for a possible trial for the men. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a victory for all victims," Krista Absalon said. "There is justice in 
the world after all. It shows if you work hard enough and cry loud enough, 
someone will hear you." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1991, Absalon passed out while drunk in a restaurant in 
Gouverneur, about 20 miles south of the Canadian border. She learned a week 
later that five men dragged her from a restroom and took turns having sex with 
her while she was unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 The men -- Mariano Pistolesi, David Cummings, Michael Curcio, Mark Hartle and 
George Streeter -- were charged with felony rape and faced up to 25 years in 
prison. They pleaded guilty to misdemeanor sexual misconduct and were fined 
$750, with no jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea bargain set off such an uproar that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo appointed 
state Atty. Gen. G. Oliver Koppell as special prosecutor, and Koppell sought to 
have the rape charges reinstated. He argued that the original indictment was 
illegally dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Absalon went public after the plea agreement.

FOOD SAFETY BILL TARGETS CHEMICAL RULES, PESTICIDES; HEALTH: THE PROPOSAL DRAWS 
MIXED REVIEWS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL AND INDUSTRY GROUPS. IT WOULD ENCOURAGE 
FARMERS TO USE SAFER PEST CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration introduced legislation Tuesday to overhaul food 
safety and pesticide laws by relaxing the standards for cancer-causing 
chemicals in processed foods and phasing out the use of hazardous pesticides on 
fresh fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which was crafted by the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, would encourage 
farmers to use safer pest-control methods while placing new restrictions on the 
use of chemical pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an urgent need to protect public health by reducing the risks of 
pesticides," said EPA Administrator Carol Browner, noting that the use of 
pesticides has virtually doubled in the last three decades. "Today we have a 
sound, realistic proposal for ensuring a safe food supply for all Americans, 
especially our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns have risen in recent years over the ingestion of pesticide-treated 
food by children, whose smaller body weights may make their exposure riskier. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, first announced last September, has drawn mixed reviews from 
environmental and industry groups. Environmentalists have praised the emphasis 
on safer farming practices but oppose loosening a Congress-passed ban on 
cancer-causing chemical residues in processed foods. The food industry has long 
sought to replace the ban but has attacked other aspects of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would require one standard for determining the amount of pesticide 
residue that could safely be allowed in food sold in U.S. markets, replacing 
the current patchwork of confusing and inconsistent standards. 
</P>
<P>
 While the so-called "negligible risk" standard would replace the more 
restrictive ban in the case of processed foods, it also would tighten 
regulations governing fresh fruits and vegetables. Those regulations now permit 
the use of some hazardous pesticides for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also restricts the ability of farmers and the food industry to 
justify use of pesticides for economic reasons and it sets procedures for 
phasing out chemicals that pose a significant health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill gives chemical manufacturers seven years to prove that pesticide 
residues in food are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 It also expands the FDA's authority to recall and embargo food that contains 
pesticide levels in excess of those set by the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who, with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), has long sought greater regulation of pesticides, called it 
"imperative that we amend our pesticide laws in order to protect the public." 
</P>
<P>
 It "is especially compelling" because "our laws are wholly inadequate in 
protecting children from pesticides that may cause them serious harm," Waxman 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The public interest Natural Resources Defense Council praised elements of the 
plan but said that further reforms are needed. It is "a step in the right 
direction -- particularly for our children," said Erik Olson, a senior attorney 
for the organization. "Unfortunately, it doesn't go far enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The council said that it supports tightening food safety regulations to better 
protect infants and children and the streamlining of government procedures to 
cancel the most dangerous pesticides. But the group criticized the bill for 
failing to prohibit the most dangerous pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America said that the 
organization supports replacing the "antiquated" ban on all cancer-causing 
residues but had "significant concerns about the real practicality" of the 
overall proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Food Processors Assn. called the Administration proposal "costly 
and unworkable."

YORBA LINDA WEATHERS STORM OF CEREMONY; SCENE: WITH THE COFFIN ARRIVES CHAOS, 
AND A COMMITMENT TO A NATIVE SON. RESPECT FOR NIXON RISES ABOVE THE DIN OF A 
MEDIA-EVENT STATE FUNERAL. 
</P>

<P>
 For a long time, Yorba Linda was a tiny town of avocado trees and lemon 
groves. In the past 10 years, it started to boom. On Tuesday, it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The noise, the compressors, the sirens, the sound checks, the helicopters, 
the hammering. They've been going at it all night," Russ Watroba said, having 
just that morning engaged in a nasty spat with looky-loos as he tried to put 
his trash cans on the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 This enclave of horses and trees and low crime and almost no graffiti finds 
itself in the eye of a storm of media and mourners and rubber-neckers and cops 
as preparations continue for the burial of Yorba Linda's native son, Richard 
Milhous Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 All the commotion is getting to be a pain in the birthplace. Homeowners can't 
go to the market for milk without being asked to show proof of residency to go 
home again. The helicopters are waking up babies. The dogs won't stop barking 
at all the invaders, and there is no place to park. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, Yorba Linda wouldn't trade places right now with any other city 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hassle," Brian Gibson said as he mulled over the idea of getting out 
of town when the real hordes converge today. "But how often does this happen? I 
might as well stick around and say six Presidents were 100 yards from my house 
on a single day." 
</P>
<P>
 They call Yorba Linda the Land of Gracious Living, and never has a motto been 
more tested. Cars filled with strangers prowl up and down residential streets 
searching for a place to park. The merchants on Main Street spent most of 
Tuesday morning shooing non-customers out of parking spaces and watching 
woefully as clients drove impatiently away. There were shouting matches in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've given up," said Leo Reilly, owner of the Yorba Linda Hardware store, 
where a young Richard Nixon once swept floors for pocket money. "I told one 
lady this is a 15-minute parking space. She waited a minute then got out of her 
car and left." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon Library & Birthplace is surrounded by California bungalows and 
mom-and-pop businesses where people take pride in being welcoming and friendly. 
This is a Quaker town, where grandsons live across the street from their 
grandmothers. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did Carol Sasaki find herself leaping from her car Monday as she fought 
to make a right turn into her son's school and hollering at the barricade of 
cars that refused to let her pass? "Do you know how rude you are?" 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just no privacy," said one resident, who has taken to putting on a 
pair of pants when he gets out of bed. "You can't walk through the house at 
night with a light on without somebody looking in." 
</P>
<P>
 If all of this was not imposition enough, there was talk of shooting off some 
kind of cannon. Rootless Southern California has never been much for protocol, 
but Washington is the brains behind this operation, and according to the rules 
set out by the U.S. Military District of Washington, the death of an 
ex-President is grounds for all sorts of tributes, including the firing of one 
gun every half-hour from dawn to dusk, a 21-gun salute fired at one-minute 
intervals during the funeral ceremony, and a 50-gun salute fired at five-second 
intervals when the burial is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon funeral has attracted four ex-Presidents and one current one, 
several foreign dignitaries, media from around the world and Nixon devotees, 
some who traveled from across the country at great personal expense ($4,000 for 
a family of three from Washington, D.C., to Orange County) just to pay their 
last respects to a man they figure was long past due for some. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Nixon's Cabinet coming to the funeral include former Labor 
Secretary Peter Brennan; former Commerce Secretary Frederick Dent; Elliot L. 
Richardson, former attorney general and secretary of defense; former Secretary 
of State William P. Rogers, former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger; 
former Secretary of Health, Education and Human Resources Caspar W. Weinberger 
and former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., who was Nixon's chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnificence of it all was not wasted for a minute on Jenny Fae Sprague, 
who sat in a lawn chair in her son's back yard, a stone's throw from the little 
white house where Nixon was born 81 years ago. She had an Instamatic camera in 
one hand and her grandson's dog, Booger, in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Booger had the run of the grassy yard until Monday, when his owner, 
23-year-old Jamie Rice, gave ABC News in New York permission to erect a 
four-story metal scaffold in his back yard. As his grandmother was busy making 
a photographic record of the emerging scaffold, Rice was dragging two big trash 
cans into the street to save a coveted parking space for an ABC reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," Rice said, smoking one of the five packs of Camels he 
purchased Monday so as not to have to go to the store in all this traffic. 
"Also, there was a little bit of money involved." 
</P>
<P>
 As long as they were going to be overrun, John Hansen and Jason Moquin, who 
live across the street from the library, figured they'd try to make a buck too. 
After all, Nixon was a capitalist, wasn't he? They and their neighbors sold 
parking spots in their driveways for $10 a pop. Moquin made some extra money by 
getting one taker at the television van rate of $100. 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipation seemed to undercut the sadness this community felt when word 
of Nixon's death came Friday. Yorba Linda had never blamed Nixon, and it is 
determined to give him a proper tribute one last time, all the traffic and 
noise be damned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've watched him come in lots of times in helicopters. We were here for the 
opening of the library," Kay Rogers, a retired kindergarten teacher at the 
Richard Nixon School, said as she tiptoed through the mud to peek through the 
rails of a fence at the freshly dug grave, just a few feet from where Pat Nixon 
was laid to rest. "I think it's wonderful he's getting his due."

SCHOOL WORKERS CAN MOURN NIXON, BUT NOT ON OVERTIME

 At the request of worried California education officials, President Clinton on 
Tuesday revised his executive order declaring today a day of mourning for 
Richard Nixon to make clear there was no intent to create a state or local 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's original declaration urging Americans to honor the 37th 
President had raised the possibility of an overtime bill totaling $20 million 
for schools in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A court case arising from the "days of Thanksgiving" proclaimed by 
then-President George Bush at the end of the Persian Gulf War could have made 
some non-teaching school workers eligible for holiday pay in this instance. The 
case is pending before the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 After California education officials were deluged with calls from school 
districts, they prevailed on the Clinton Administration to add language Tuesday 
specifying that the declaration applied only to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very grateful," said Maureen DiMarco, Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary for 
child development and education. "Clearly it is perfectly appropriate to have a 
national day of mourning. Nobody (in the federal government) realized the 
impact it could have."

ORDINARY FOLKS SAY FAREWELL TO FAMOUS FRIEND; NIXON: EX-PRESIDENT'S RELATIVES 
AND CLASSMATES EULOGIZE HIM AS DIPLOMATIC AND A TEAM PLAYER. HIS BROTHER 
RECALLS THE EARLY YEARS WITH 'A GREAT MAN.'

 The dignitaries will honor him at formal services today in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday was a time for ordinary people to eulogize Richard Nixon, as 
friends and relatives gathered in Whittier to remember the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 The local high school band played as former classmates, members of the Nixon 
and Milhous families and townspeople filed into the Whittier College gymnasium 
-- decorated with a simple arrangement of mums next to a photograph of the 
school's most famous alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 2,000 heard Nixon remembered for being the college's student body 
president before becoming the nation's 37th President. They heard how he helped 
edit the school newspaper long before his own name became a fixture in the 
news. They laughed as he was described as a failure at football who never 
forgot the importance of being a team player. 
</P>
<P>
 "For over 60 years Richard Nixon was a friend, an interested and an 
interesting friend," said Dolores Ball, a classmate of Nixon's at Whittier. It 
was a relationship that led to "many lively discussions around the dinner 
table" as Nixon became an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
 World events and domestic issues "were much more real when a personal friend 
was involved. He made history come alive," Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former football teammate Clint Harris said that what Nixon lacked as a player 
he more than made up for as a friend. "He was a live wire right to the last 
days," Harris said. "I thank God he went peacefully when the time had to come. 
I'll think of him always." 
</P>
<P>
 Cousin Theodore F. Marshburn talked of Nixon's Christmas gifts and the 
firecrackers that he always managed to rustle up each 4th of July. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've often said he inherited his diplomatic skills from his mother and his 
determination from his father," said Marshburn, an ophthalmologist. "We feel 
his skills have led to a more peaceful world." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Nixon, a businessman who at 63 bears a startling resemblance to the 
late President -- right down to the ski-nose and jowly cheeks -- recalled how 
an automobile trip through Arizona with his older brother had prompted him to 
become a geologist. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother occasionally let 9-year-old Edward sit between his legs and steer 
the car on straightaways, Edward Nixon said. And he agreed to pull over and 
stop to see a huge hole left by a giant meteor. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Nixon said his mother used to laugh about how 9-year-old Richard 
sat on the kitchen floor reading newspaper accounts of the Teapot Dome 
political scandal. Looking up, he said: "Mother, when I grow up I want to 
become an honest lawyer," according to Edward Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 As an older brother, Nixon would sometimes mediate playground disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you started breaking the rules, Dick would grab the football and say, 
'Nobody gets the ball until you play by the rules,' " Edward Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a brother to me, and a brother to a lot of people all over the world. 
He was a great man, a great brother. And a great friend to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Tears rolled down the younger Nixon's cheeks as the ceremony drew to a close 
and the college choir sang the hymn "Immortal Love, Forever Full." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Muller lingered as the crowd slowly filtered out of the gym. No one 
was watching as she placed a tiny bouquet of flowers next to Richard Nixon's 
portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 "His aunt and uncle lived across the street from me when I grew up," Muller 
said afterward. "His death is a personal thing here. I thought Richard Nixon 
was a good man."

NIXON STAMP EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED ON JAN. 9

<TEXT>
<P>
 A commemorative stamp honoring Richard Nixon will be issued Jan. 9, 1995, if 
past U.S. Postal Service practices are continued as expected, a U.S. Postal 
Service spokeswoman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service practice has been to issue commemorative stamps of 
Presidents on their first birthday following their death, said Monica Hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents are the only individuals selected for a stamp who are exempt from 
the Postal Service's customary 10-year wait following death, Hand said.

BEASTIE BOYS MEMBER SENTENCED IN ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A member of the Beastie Boys rap group pleaded no contest Tuesday to a 
misdemeanor battery charge in an attack on a television cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Horovitz, 27, was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to perform 
200 hours of community service, pay a $200 fine and make restitution to victim 
Herbert Goebert. 
</P>
<P>
 Horovitz was accused of attacking Goebert, a cameraman for the television news 
magazine "Hard Copy," during a Nov. 2 memorial service for actor River Phoenix. 
The service was held across the street from Horovitz's Mt. Olympus home. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Theodore Loewen urged Municipal Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt to 
sentence Horovitz to 30 days in jail. He said Horovitz and an unidentified man 
confronted Goebert and beat him when he refused to give them videotape he had 
taken of people arriving at the service for Phoenix, who died of a drug 
overdose.

TRACKERS HUNT MOUNTAIN LION THAT KILLED JOGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trackers hunted Tuesday for the mountain lion they say stalked and killed a 
jogger in the rugged Sierra Nevada foothills northeast of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The mutilated body of Barbara Schoener, 40, was discovered Sunday in the 
isolated Auburn Lake Trails area of El Dorado County. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives said she had been attacked by a cougar that bit her neck 
and crushed her skull, then dragged the partially consumed body about 300 feet 
and buried it under leaves and debris. Experts said mountain lions often 
conceal their prey and return when they are hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department, releasing preliminary autopsy results, said in a 
written statement that Schoener apparently was running along the trail when the 
lion jumped onto the path about 20 feet behind her and attacked her from the 
rear. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the animal's assault knocked her off the path down a steep slope. 
She struggled to her feet, was attacked, then moved farther down the slope "to 
a location where the final attack occurred," the sheriff's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the 120-pound, 5-foot-8 Schoener tried to fight off the 
animal. "Defensive wounds on Barbara's forearms and hands make it apparent she 
did struggle with the lion," the sheriff's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lion's prints were identified on and near the path. 
</P>
<P>
 State experts said Schoener is believed to be the first person this century 
killed in California in a mountain lion attack. In 1909, a woman and child in 
Santa Clara County were attacked and died later from rabies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain lion trackers using dogs sealed off a 4,200-acre portion of the 
recreational area to hunt for the cougar. They planned to kill the animal to 
prevent further attacks on humans, said Pete Weisser, a spokesman for the state 
Fish and Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (lion's) behavior is likely to be repeated," Weisser said. "We are still 
tracking. We are still looking. When we find it, we'll shoot it."

NAVY TESTS DELAYED TO PROTECT MARINE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the detonation of 
underwater explosives west of the Channel Islands to test ship hull strength, 
after ruling that the blasts would irreparably harm marine life in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles granted a preliminary 
injunction to stop testing until the case is decided at civil trial later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge concluded in a written decision that "plaintiffs have shown a 
near-certain likelihood of prevailing in their claims" that the Navy and the 
National Marine Fisheries Service violated federal law in approving the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge has decided to uphold environmental laws in the face of the Navy's 
wish to conduct these tests in the worst possible ecological area in the 
continental United States," said Richard Kendall, lead attorney for five 
environmental groups that sued to block the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials had no immediate comment Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing was scheduled to start this week about 20 miles off Navy-owned San 
Nicolas Island and about 85 miles southwest of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons 
Station, where the tests were to be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson agreed with the environmental groups' attorneys, who argued that the 
Navy had filed no valid environmental report, had failed to examine alternate 
test sites and had not adequately protected marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials have acknowledged that the testing could result in the deaths 
of a small number of marine mammals but have insisted that the tests are 
environmentally safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmental groups say that 22 species of marine mammals -- including 
seals and sea lions -- would be killed, injured or harassed by the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called ship-shock tests would involve the detonation of underwater 
explosives as large as 10,000 pounds each to determine the strength of the 
Navy's new Aegis-class destroyers, the sturdiness of their electronics 
equipment and overall crew survivability under simulated battle conditions.

SPECIAL ENVOY TO HAITI RESIGNS AMID CRITICISM OVER PLAN 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Department released a terse statement Tuesday announcing the 
resignation of Lawrence Pezzullo, the U.S. special envoy to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Pezzullo was the author of a plan to restore ousted Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. But the effort succeeded only in creating a 
widening split between Aristide and the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid growing criticism from its liberal allies in Congress, the Administration 
abandoned Pezzullo's plan last week in favor of an effort to displace the 
leaders of the September, 1991, coup against Aristide by tightening U.N. 
sanctions against the country.

2 STATE GOP OFFICIALS JOIN GAY REPUBLICAN CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a gesture of outreach to the state's gay Republicans, two executives of the 
state Republican Party have joined the Log Cabin Club, a gay Republican 
organization that has often felt itself to be on the chilly edges of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before the Los Angeles chapter of the club Monday night, Bob 
Carpenter, executive director of the state Republican Party, and his wife, Pat 
Giardina, the state party finance director, paid $50 each to become members of 
the nationwide group. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I had discussed it and we had made a decision that many of the 
tenets of the Log Cabin Club are things we believe in and stand for, so we 
thought it was appropriate to join," Carpenter said in an interview Tuesday. 
"We felt that they are active, good Republicans and we wanted to support them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carpenter said he did not want his Lob Cabin membership to be 
interpreted as "any big statement," it was an implicit rejection of the 
fiercely anti-gay positions espoused by the most conservative GOP factions -- 
as well as the perceived political costs of such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all sense the only way to become the majority party is to be 
inclusive," Carpenter added. "I don't think a super majority of our party 
agrees with discrimination of any kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Log Cabin officials welcomed Carpenter's overtures as a significant step. "The 
party itself is rejecting any sort of narrow definition of what it means to be 
a Republican," said Ritch Colbert, president of the Los Angeles club. "They're 
saying the right wing fringe doesn't have the right to define the Republican 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's Log Cabin appearance reflected last year's ascendancy of moderate 
Republicans within the state party apparatus after years of dueling with the 
conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Republican political consultant Paul Clarke recalled Tuesday that the 
current state party chairman, Dr. Tirso del Junco, attended a Log Cabin meeting 
more than a decade ago, when he was also party chairman, to welcome the group 
to the GOP fold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's coming full circle," said Clarke, who thought Carpenter's move was a 
wise one. "From a political point of view, it makes extremely smart sense to 
take every Republican you can get."

L.A. MONSIGNOR SLAIN ON VISIT TO SAN DIEGO

 Msgr. Louis A. Gutierrez, who planned to celebrate his 30th anniversary this 
weekend as a Los Angeles priest, died early Tuesday in San Diego of gunshot 
wounds after an unknown assailant accosted him in his motel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, 61, was with another priest on a post-Easter break visiting 
relatives. The fellow priest, staying in an adjoining room, reported hearing a 
crashing sound and a door slamming about 6 a.m. in Gutierrez's room at the 
Surfer Motor Lodge in Pacific Beach, San Diego Police Lt. Greg Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said the other priest, who was not identified, opened the door and found 
the room ransacked and Gutierrez lying on the floor dressed in casual clothes 
and jogging shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office said Gutierrez died at the scene of a gunshot wound to 
the head. Police said they have no suspects and no motive. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last week, Gutierrez had been assigned as pastor of Holy Spirit Parish in 
Los Angeles, Msgr. Michael W. Meyers said. "Everyone here is in shock," Meyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez had just finished serving nine years at St. Paul Parish in Los 
Angeles. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1964.

SEE MOMMY WORK; DAUGHTERS DAY STRIKES A CHORD -- AND SOME CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has drawn some sneers and potshots, but as the second annual "Take Our 
Daughters to Work Day" arrives on Thursday, one fact stands out: It is catching 
on remarkably quickly in workplaces across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the program -- predicted by its promoters to draw 3 million girls this 
year, up from 1 million last year -- strike such a responsive chord? Why are so 
many parents pulling their daughters out of school for a day and bringing them 
to work? 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary workers, as well as social scientists, advocates for women's causes 
and corporate managers, all have their theories. Above all else, they cite the 
simple pleasure of family visits at work and the natural appeal of a program 
intended to build the self-esteem and expand the horizons of young girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also note that it's a healthy tonic, a dose of human warmth, at companies 
that have been demoralized in an era of layoffs and restructurings. And 
skeptics point to posturing by big firms and government agencies that want to 
appear "politically correct" without making a serious commitment to advancing 
the cause of women in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a thing catches on like this, it's usually because it fulfills several 
needs," said Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a social psychologist at the University 
of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the program, girls in Southern California will be doing such things 
as touring the Port of Los Angeles and learning about the roles of women 
employed there, sitting in on development meetings and rehearsals at five movie 
studio lots, and observing how health care and employment counseling is 
provided at the Chinatown Service Center. School districts across the state, 
including Los Angeles Unified, are excusing students from their classrooms to 
participate in the program and are classifying it as an "independent study" 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's sponsors include some of the nation's biggest and best-known 
companies, including IBM, AT&T, American Express and Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie C. Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, which organized 
the "Daughters" effort, said the initial program last year was an immediate hit 
because "it was elegant, it was easy to do and it gave people a way to deal 
with a problem without overwhelming them with bad stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem Wilson was referring to -- and the reason the Ms. Foundation 
launched the program -- is a loss of self-esteem that psychological research 
has shown many girls begin to suffer as early as age 9. Foundation leaders 
decided to set aside a special day for girls, chiefly those in the 9-to-15 age 
group, to counteract the trend by opening their eyes to career opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and other adults who participated last year say they got an unexpected 
lift out of it. Karen Meyers, a community relations coordinator at Orthopaedic 
Hospital in Los Angeles, brought her 9-year-old and 13-year-old daughters with 
her for the program. The girls watched intently as she gave safety tips and 
answered questions from a group of more than 700 runners who were starting 
training for this year's Los Angeles Marathon. Afterward, the two said they 
were proud of how smoothly their mom had handled the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If your child sees a good quality in you, it's mind-boggling," Meyers said, 
adding that her elder daughter, Bhrea, seemed to be especially impressed. "She 
did an evaluation of me and said, 'You did a good job!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bhrea said she liked the program because "it shows you a different side of 
your mom." The experience also convinced her that she would like to become a 
physical therapist specializing in sports medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the program has stirred a measure of controversy. It has been called 
elitist, aimed mainly at the daughters of professionals and neglectful of the 
problems faced by women working in sweatshops and other low-paying, sometimes 
dangerous jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also been attacked as emphasizing "the feminist bias against the home 
and family" by the Concerned Women for America, which bills itself as the 
nation's biggest "nonpartisan, politically active women's organization," with 
more than 600,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women who believe they can 'have it all' try to make motherhood an 
illegitimate profession," said Beverly LaHaye, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Siller, president and founder of the National Organization for Men, 
which calls itself the largest heterosexual men's equal rights advocacy group 
in America, says the "Daughters" program is subtly divisive and carries an 
implicit anti-male message. 
</P>
<P>
 "It pits young boys against young girls, and the young boys are left out," 
Siller said. "If the program said we want parents to take their children to 
work, I'd be 100% for it and I'd be cheering for them. But when it's one-sided, 
we can't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some organizations have decided to include boys in their programs or 
have set aside another day for boys to visit their parents at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many smaller companies have no plans to officially participate in 
the "Daughters" program. Some are concerned about the children's safety -- and 
the potential for costly lawsuits -- and others aren't even aware of its 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a real burning issue," said Karen Kukurin, spokeswoman for Employers 
Group, whose 5,000 members consist mainly of small and medium-size employers in 
California. The members, she said, "usually are so busy just trying to get 
their work done they don't have time for that. . . . They're real concerned 
with just staying in business at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some major California organizations back the program, including 
the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Fox Inc., MCA Inc., Food 
4 Less and both the Los Angeles Times and its corporate parent, Times Mirror 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the Ms. Foundation president, conceded that some organizations 
probably participate in the program only as "window dressing," but she said 
that "when the girls get inside, something happens" to open the eyes of both 
the children and the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists also say the program can have a positive impact on parents and 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adults' lives are a mystery to children," said Carol Tavris, a Los Angeles 
research psychologist whose most recent book, "The Mismeasure of Women," is a 
critique of psychological studies of women. "Getting a chance to peek behind 
the curtain and see what the parent does is very exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
 The program also fills the needs of middle-age parents, said Csikszentmihalyi, 
the University of Chicago psychologist, many of whom are at a point in their 
lives where they have a strong desire "to leave behind some trace of ourselves. 
It's very universal." 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you going to pass on what you know and what you care about? I can see 
more motivation for the adults than for their children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this little ritual as a symbolic gesture, but it does touch on a 
sensitive spot," Csikszentmihalyi said.

U.S. CIGARETTE UNIT TO BE SOLD TO BRITISH FIRM; TOBACCO: PROPOSED $1-BILLION 
SALE OF AMERICAN BRANDS' DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARY IS SAID TO ILLUSTRATE PRESSURES ON 
THE INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With opposition to cigarettes growing while the popularity of smoking drops, 
American Brands on Tuesday agreed to sell its domestic tobacco subsidiary, 
which makes Lucky Strike and Carlton cigarettes, to BAT Industries of Britain 
for $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by the nation's fifth-largest tobacco company to dump its U.S. 
tobacco holdings follows exploration by the industry's giants -- Philip Morris 
and RJR Nabisco -- of deals that would split their cigarette and food divisions 
into separate companies. And it comes as government officials propose tougher 
regulation of tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sale illustrates the changes and the pressures in the U.S. tobacco 
business," said Ellen G. Baras, an industry analyst for Duff & Phelps in 
Chicago. "It's a shrinking business." 
</P>
<P>
 BAT Industries already owns Brown & Williamson, America's third-largest 
tobacco firm and the maker of Kool and Raleigh cigarettes. Analysts said its 
acquisition of American Brands' American Tobacco Co. unit -- which must win 
U.S. government approval -- would strengthen its position in the highly 
competitive industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale would boost BAT's share of the $50-billion domestic market to nearly 
18%, according to Wheat First Butcher & Singer, a Richmond, Va., brokerage 
firm. Philip Morris claims 42.2% of the market, while RJR Nabisco has 30.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 For American Brands, the sale would give it cash to pump into its diverse and 
lucrative lineup of consumer products, ranging from Jim Beam whiskey to 
Swingline staplers and Titleist golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
 American Brands, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., will also retain its Gallaher 
unit, the largest tobacco company in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the sale distances the company from U.S. investor concerns over the 
long-term future of tobacco companies. And it rids itself of a unit -- with 
brands past their heyday -- that has steadily lost ground to larger rivals and 
whose profit took a beating amid an industry price war last year, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, American Brands reported Tuesday that its first-quarter operating 
income fell 23.8% from a year earlier to $328.3 million, as earnings from 
domestic tobacco sales fell 46% to $55.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, this transaction, when completed, would remove potential uncertainty 
from American Brands while also fostering competitiveness in the domestic 
tobacco industry," Chairman William J. Alley said. "This is an excellent 
strategic move for American Brands and its stockholders, a move that would 
enable us to focus more sharply on businesses with powerful market positions 
and greater long-term profit growth potential." 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of American Brands rose $2.875 on 
Tuesday to close at $34.625. BAT's American Depositary Receipts gained 56 cents 
to close at $13.75 on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tobacco stocks also gained ground Tuesday, with Philip Morris surging $2 
to $54.25 on the NYSE, while RJR Nabisco added 37.5 cents to $6.875. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has warmed up to tobacco stocks in recent weeks as the companies 
released better-than-expected financial results for this year's first quarter, 
including improved sales of more expensive and profitable lines of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were divided as to how the sale of American Tobacco would influence 
proposals to spin off the tobacco businesses of RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris. 
Executives of those firms are said to blame their tobacco businesses for 
depressing stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Philip Morris -- which makes Marlboro, the nation's leading 
cigarette brand -- said its board had considered the matter last week during an 
annual strategic planning meeting. But no decision was made, and the proposal 
remains under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, RJR Nabisco attempted to spin off its food group, but canceled the 
offering in the face of weak demand for food industry stocks. Despite the 
deal's collapse, executives reportedly remain interested in splitting up the 
company.  
</P>
<P>
 But those views might be changing as tobacco stocks rise and profits improve, 
said industry analyst Roy D. Burry at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Tobacco sale "will mean an industry with fewer players," Burry 
said. As a result, "you are likely to get more favorable pricing and less price 
competition."

JAMES FLANIGAN: U.S. NEEDS TO STOP LECTURING JAPAN AND MAKE ITS OWN LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As news came from Tokyo that Japan's ruling coalition was breaking apart, 
imperiling new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's tenure, leading experts on Japan 
and Asia were meeting in Los Angeles to hear author James Fallows talk about 
his new book, "Looking at the Sun: The Rise of the New East Asian Economic and 
Political System." 
</P>
<P>
 Insofar as Japanese politics is concerned, the experts agreed that Hata would 
be out of office in a matter of weeks, possibly to be replaced by Ochiro Ozawa, 
the deputy leader but real power in Hata's Renewal party. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more significantly, Japan is changing its electoral system to one of 
constituencies voting for a single member of Japan's legislature, similar to 
congressional elections in the United States. Indeed, Fred Notehelfer, director 
of UCLA's Center for Japanese Studies, predicted that after their next 
election, Japan's parties would realign philosophically along the lines of U.S. 
Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But such political change in Japan won't make it an Asian model of the United 
States. On the contrary, party realignment will be only one change among many 
in the next few years, including a move toward Japanese rearmament and defense 
and foreign policies more independent of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications for global business and for future trade and other relations 
among the United States, Japan and the rest of Asia are profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent policies "would make Japan a real country, one that bears 
responsibility for its own sovereignty and makes its own policies," Fallows 
writes. As it is, Japan's dependence on the United States for military and 
foreign policy only exacerbates disputes over Japan's trade surpluses -- $141 
billion with all the world's major nations and trading blocs, including roughly 
a $50-billion surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But look beyond numbers, says Fallows. A lot more is happening in Asia. His 
book covers the economies of half a dozen countries from Japan to Thailand, but 
its real subject, says the author, is the political and historic watershed 
marking the end not only of the post-World War II period but of centuries of 
colonial history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the region there is the sense that must have prevailed in much of 
Europe in the 1800s and the United States through the past century, that 
economic activity is changing life even as you watch," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fallows, 44, a Harvard graduate and Rhodes scholar who took a diploma in 
developmental economics from Oxford, is more sharp-eyed than wide-eyed. He 
recognizes how closely linked the Asian nations are to Japan, which has become 
the main source of investment and technology for Southeast Asia. Japanese 
industry has invested roughly $30 billion in Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, 
a total now greater than that of U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallows points out how reliant the larger economies of South Korea and Taiwan 
are on Japanese technology. 
</P>
<P>
 And he reports that despite the current recession, Japan's industry has been 
investing for the future -- a total of $3 trillion in new plants and equipment 
between 1987 and '92. Private investment has been augmented by $400 billion a 
year in public works spending by government. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, writes Fallows, East Asia, centered on the industrial might of 
Japan, has become the fastest-growing part of the world economy and should 
remain so "through the 1990s and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 The region owes a lot to the United States, which last year bought $100 
billion more in goods from Asia than it sold in return, and also protected the 
region with military forces on land and sea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Asia is not in a mood for gratitude these days. As Asia's economies have 
prospered, and social change has brought pressure on its traditional societies, 
Asia's leaders have become resentful of lectures from Washington -- about 
free-market economics or democracy or the punishment of vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, says Fallows, Asian governments may be authoritarian and their trade more 
statist than free-market. But the way they see it, those policies have brought 
them prosperity, and U.S. officials are not helping the American cause by 
finger-wagging lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallows' book has been attacked for saying such things, but it is only 
reporting what Asian scholars are saying: that the West could learn some values 
from their societies. 
</P>
<P>
 More bluntly, Asians find U.S. protests of Singapore's caning sentence for an 
American vandal pathetic when Asian students are shot to death in U.S. streets. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, should be the U.S. approach to this fast-changing world? In 
effect, "to thine own self be true," says Fallows, who lived with his family in 
Asia for more than three years while researching this book. Develop and 
strengthen the unprecedented values of the American system, which has always 
welcomed outsiders and encouraged individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, he writes, fix U.S. education so that "the worst educated" reach 
a level of competence. The best of U.S. education is better than anything in 
Asia, including Japan, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In trade, he counsels, don't lecture Japan -- or other countries -- about open 
markets or "fair" trade. Simply demand that they buy U.S. goods, as was done in 
the U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement of 1986. If they stall or refuse, cut 
off their sales to the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 And increase incentives for Americans to save, and put the money behind U.S. 
industry, Fallows recommends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States should make itself less dependent on Japan" for capital and 
technology, he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan does not look upon its relationship with the United States as something 
that inherently is desirable or that should be maintained out of a 
philosophical commitment to shared ideals," Fallows says. 
</P>
<P>
 So as Japan and Asia change, America needs to change also, to strengthen 
itself. "Now, as in the past," Fallows concludes, "economics favors those who 
are determined to make their own luck."

THE TEXTBOOK NIXON; HE ADDED A KEY DATE FOR ECONOMICS STUDENTS: 8-15-71 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The top movie in town was "Klute," starring Jane Fonda. "The Godfather" was 
being filmed on the streets of New York's Little Italy. Sonny and Cher were 
scheduled to do their popular Sunday night variety show, but they were about to 
get preempted because President Richard Nixon had a bombshell to deliver on 
national TV. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, Aug. 15, 1971, Nixon wrote himself into the economics books by 
imposing wage and price controls on workers and businesses and taking the 
American dollar off the gold standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists and participants in the Nixon Administration recall the 
simultaneous moves as among the most popular steps Nixon ever took as 
President. As the country prepares for his funeral today, it is worth noting 
that his decision to let the dollar float in value against other world 
currencies is the foundation of the modern-day global financial market -- 
certainly one of Nixon's most enduring legacies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything (in the markets) today is about learning how to deal with 
fluctuating currencies," says Herbert Stein, then a member (and later the 
chairman) of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon observers and his former advisers argue that few things exemplified his 
streak of practicality -- and opportunism -- as much as his economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a pragmatist on economic affairs, which was very much to his credit," 
says Robert Eisner, an economist at Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the wage and price controls, he assured a more rapid short-term economic 
recovery," says Nobel Economics Laureate Paul Samuelson, "and he made it 
absolutely certain he would be the overwhelming victor in the 1972 election." 
The morning after, as it happened, came during the Administration of his 
successor, Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's approach to business and economics exemplifies how hard he could be to 
categorize as a political being. As a Republican President, he established the 
Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, enduring Republican whipping boys as symbols of government 
regulation. He also tried to get welfare and health care reform through 
Congress but failed; this week, Hillary Rodham Clinton herself invoked his 
memory in promoting her own health care reform initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as his overtures to China and the Soviet Union contradicted his image as 
a Cold War hard-liner, Nixon's wage and price controls won him praise from 
liberals and curses from conservatives.  
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon Administration spanned a period of considerable economic uproar. He 
took office during a period of relatively high inflation and unemployment and 
spent the first two to three years of his term contemplating measures to 
stimulate the economy.  
</P>
<P>
 America's balance of trade emerged for the first time in years as a major 
political issue: Administration critics were warning that the country was on 
the verge of recording its first foreign trade deficit of the century. The 
nation already had a trade deficit with Japan of $3.2 billion ($63.2 billion 
today).  
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1973 came the first of two "oil shocks" when the OPEC cartel decided 
to sharply raise the price of crude oil, leading to gasoline shortages and 
lines at the pump. But by that point, Nixon had made his stand.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Aug. 13, 1971, he sequestered himself with his top economic and 
political advisers at Camp David. The group included Nixon speech writer 
William Safire, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Paul McCracken, Treasury 
Secretary John Connolly and Stein, all of whom were set for working out details 
of the wage-price freeze and the end to the gold standard.  
</P>
<P>
 That Sunday night, Nixon went on television to inform the American public that 
the United States would "temporarily" suspend the right of foreign governments 
to trade their dollars for gold. The move, he said, would result in a "slight" 
devaluation of the dollar (in the event it sank by more than 10%). 
</P>
<P>
 The wage-price controls began with a 90-day period in which all wages, prices 
and rents were frozen. Under Phase 2, beginning Nov. 14, 1971, two government 
commissions had the right to set strict guidelines on price increases and wage 
hikes. The Price Commission limited price increases to 2.5% during 1972, for 
example. The Pay Board announced a plan to limit wage increases to 5.5% a year, 
but under pressure from organized labor, it subsequently approved some major 
contracts at higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon knew at the time that the freeze was an economic mistake, but he saw it 
as a political necessity," says Stein, adding that the boldness of the move 
could be traced to Connolly, the former Democratic governor of Texas. "Connolly 
was a person for the dramatic gesture," Stein says. The idea was that the 
freeze would enable Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur Burns to institute 
hugely stimulative policies without worrying about higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The country reacted with enthusiasm. The stock market soared, sending the Dow 
Jones industrial average up a then-record 32.93 points to 888.95 on record 
volume of 31.72 million shares. (By comparison, the Dow closed at 3,699.54 on 
Tuesday; New York Stock Exchange volume today averages nearly 10 times the 1971 
level.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most popular thing he ever did," Stein says. "People thought, 'Now 
someone will protect us from our butcher and our landlord.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Americans contemplating that era from today's vantage point can be forgiven 
for wondering what all the fuss was about. The inflation rate in 1971 before 
Nixon's speech was 4.6% and the unemployment rate was 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The wage-price freeze did succeed in shutting down inflation -- temporarily. 
The increase in consumer prices dropped to a 2.7% annual average from August, 
1971, through June, 1972. But by then, wholesale price pressures were building 
throughout the economy. Food shortages began to appear as farmers kept goods 
off the market. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries drove up oil prices in 
1973, the Administration knew it had lost the price control battle. In 1974, 
the nation entered its worst recession since the 1930s; inflation reached 
12.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the only good thing you could say about Nixon's controls is that 
because of him, no one will try them again for a long time," Stein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking America off the gold standard was a different issue. At the time, 
Americans were forbidden to privately own gold in bulk. Meanwhile, foreign 
countries owned so much U.S. currency that there was not enough gold in Ft. 
Knox to settle their claims if they all turned in their cash at the fixed rate 
of $35 per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 The overvalued dollar made imports cheap and exports expensive, exacerbating 
the growing U.S. trade imbalance. To limit capital outflows, the government 
imposed heavy taxes on foreign investments by U.S. companies, which made 
American businessmen howl. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the gold window ended all that. The dollar quickly fell by more than 
10%. Within months, today's system of floating exchange rates began to take 
shape. Its offspring govern the modern world of finance; the volume of world 
trade in goods and services in 1992 was about $3.7 trillion, but the value of 
foreign exchange transactions designed to finance that trade and to hedge 
fluctuations in currency rates was an astounding $220 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only with floating exchange rates could we possibly have had the explosion in 
world trade we've seen over the last 25 years," McCracken says. "Without it, 
we'd just have been limping along." 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORY: A1 Nixonomics: The Greatest Legacy? 
</P>
<P>
 On August 15, 1971, President Richard M. Nixon made economic history by 
imposing wage and price controls and taking the American dollar off the gold 
standard. Here's a snapshot of the way things were on that fateful day,

 THE IMPACT 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoning the gold standard: Nixon suspended the so-called Bretton Woods 
system under which world currencies were pegged to the dollar and through it to 
gold, thus maintaining fixed exchange rates. In suspending that system, Nixon 
wanted to let the dollar fall to a new level that more realistically reflected 
international assessments of the U.S. economy's strength. He reasoned that such 
action would give the United States more flexibility in economy policy. But by 
1973, inflationary pressures and volatile capital flows led governments to give 
up attempts to maintain fixed exchange rates. Floating exchange rates are now a 
foundation of the modern-day global financial market -- perhaps Nixon's most 
enduring legacy.  
</P>
<P>
 Wage and price controls: Nixon's imposition of controls on wages, prices and 
rents was an unprecedented U.S. government intrusion into a peacetime economy. 
The initial 90-day freeze initially worked, as the vast majority of Americans 
cooperated and inflation was temporarily stemmed. But Nixon later abandoned the 
controls amid growing inflationary pressures -- including those created by the 
1973 oil embargo. In 1974-75, the nation endured its deepest recession since 
the 1930s, following the worst inflation in the postwar era.

 California Settles With Prudential: The state, the last to hold out on 
settling with Prudential Securities Inc. over its limited-partnership fiasco, 
signed a final settlement.The terms were the same as those announced by the 
state Department of Corporations several weeks ago when it said an accord was 
imminent. Prudential will pay a $500,000 penalty to the state and reimburse it 
for its investigation costs. The brokerage will also have to report frequently 
to the state on compliance by its California branches. The Corporations 
Department urged Prudential partnership investors to call a toll-free hot line, 
(800) 589-4678, for information on reimbursement from a $330-million settlement 
fund Prudential has established.

 Keating Barred From Public Companies: Former Lincoln Savings & Loan operator 
Charles H. Keating Jr. agreed to be banned permanently from acting as an 
officer or a director of a publicly held company. Without admitting or denying 
liability, he settled a civil case in which the Securities and Exchange 
Commission accused him of insider trading, filing false financial statements 
and issuing a false press release while he was chairman of the Irvine thrift's 
holding company, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix.Lincoln and American 
Continental collapsed five years ago, the nation's costliest thrift failure. 
The settlement has little practical effect because Keating, convicted on state 
and federal fraud charges and imprisoned, is 71 and won't be eligible for 
parole until he is 79.

MESTRES OUT AS PRESIDENT OF DISNEY UNIT; ENTERTAINMENT: HIS RESIGNATION FROM 
HOLLYWOOD PICTURES WAS EXPECTED AFTER STRING OF UNSUCCESSFUL FILMS. A SUCCESSOR 
IS NOT NAMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ricardo Mestres is out as president of Walt Disney Co.'s Hollywood Pictures 
movie division, bringing an abrupt end to a six-year reign that left a string 
of lackluster films ranging from "Super Mario Bros." to "Swing Kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Mestres, 36, stepped down Tuesday and was given a long-term production deal at 
the studio. The move was widely expected, based on long-running speculation 
that Disney management had grown impatient with the division's poor 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rumors, Mestres' departure came so suddenly that Disney did not 
even have a successor in place. Sources say the front-runner for the position 
is a non-movie executive: Michael Lynton of Disney-owned Hyperion Books. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynton is a close friend of David Hoberman, who heads Disney's Touchstone 
Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures.  
</P>
<P>
 Mestres' resignation came after a brief high-level meeting at Disney's Burbank 
headquarters. Sources described the meeting as "curt" and "pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 The move was largely seen throughout the industry as a forced resignation 
because Disney executives are hoping to overhaul a studio that, for whatever 
reason, was failing to produce hit films. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're businessmen at Disney, and that division wasn't working," one 
agent said. 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of Mestres, other executives pointed out that it was Walt Disney 
Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, not Mestres, who gave the go-ahead to many 
of Hollywood's failed movie projects. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a struggle for power in 1988 between Hoberman and Mestres that led 
Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner and Katzenberg to create Hollywood Pictures, 
which they then funded with about $100 million in the hopes that Mestres could 
mold it into a powerful studio. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the box office success of "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" and the 
critical acclaim of "The Joy Luck Club," Hollywood Pictures more often produced 
such forgettable films as "Blame It on the Bellboy," "Born Yesterday" and 
"Guilty as Sin." It also tried to make comedian Pauley Shore into a movie star 
with "Encino Man" and "Son-in-Law." 
</P>
<P>
 Mestres said he did not regard his resignation Tuesday as a crushing personal 
blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he characterized his new deal with Disney as a unique opportunity and 
said he hopes to work closely with Hoberman on film projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had 14 very fun, prosperous and challenging years with Jeffrey and 
Michael," Mestres said. "Now I'm eager to launch into a new territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Mestres refused to comment on his rivalry with Hoberman. "It was time for a 
change," he said of his departure. "I embrace it. I'm excited by the new 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the new arrangement, Mestres will continue to develop and 
produce motion pictures for the studio on an exclusive basis and will have 
offices on the lot. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mestres joined Disney Studios in 1984 as vice president of production and was 
promoted to senior vice president 13 months later. During that time, he 
supervised such films as "Three Men and a Baby" and "Good Morning, Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 He began his career with Paramount Pictures as a development executive for 
producer Don Simpson and went on to serve for four years under Katzenberg, 
supervising the development and production of numerous films, including 
"Beverly Hills Cop."

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS STILL CLIMBING; ECONOMY: ANALYSTS SAY APRIL INDEX SHOWS 
AMERICANS UNSHAKEN BY INTEREST RATE HIKES OR MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Consumer confidence continued to rally in most of the nation this month, 
despite hitting a plateau in the West Coast and falling in New England, the 
Conference Board reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Americans expressed growing optimism about jobs and business 
conditions, as well as "somewhat more positive" expectations for the future, 
according to the New York-based business research group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latest consumer confidence readings continue to be optimistic, running at 
levels which have historically signaled a strong economy," said Fabian Linden, 
executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index, based on a survey of 
5,000 households, jumped 5 points to 91.7 in April. That score was 24 points 
higher than a year ago and the highest reading since 101.7 in July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey suggests Americans have not been shaken by rising interest rates or 
the recent gyrations in financial markets, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, workers feel better about the jobs outlook, following a flurry of 
highly publicized layoffs in 1993 and early 1994 and continuing efforts by 
corporate America to slash costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big bugaboo out of the way is concern about jobs and the labor market," 
said Gary Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group, a large New 
England bank. "Consumers are seeing opportunities for re-employment." 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists believe consumer confidence provides a clue to future levels 
of business activity, and the sharp increase in the index could be seen as 
increasing the risk of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, news of the survey was greeted warily on Wall Street, where some 
traders worried it would prompt the Federal Reserve Board to hike interest 
rates for the fourth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But inflation fears were offset by a Labor Department report highlighting an 
unusually small rise in labor costs for the year ended March 31. Short-term 
interest rates rose Tuesday, but long-term rates fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The upswing in confidence is not uniform. The Midwest and Rocky Mountain 
states showed sharp gains, while confidence fell in New England. 
</P>
<P>
 On the West Coast the April score was virtually the same as in March, slipping 
to 67.1 from 68.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, fewer people in April described jobs as "hard to find" than in 
March. Similarly, a smaller number said they believed business conditions will 
worsen in the next six months. 
</P>

 Senate Supports Interstate Banking Measure: Setting the stage for what would 
be the most important change to the structure of the banking system since the 
Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, the Senate adopted by voice vote a bill that 
would lower barriers to interstate banking dating to 1927. The legislation 
would make banking more convenient for Americans living near state borders and 
would make expansion easier for the nation's largest banks.Within a year of 
enactment, bank holding companies would be permitted to establish a bank in any 
state. The House adopted similar legislation in March. The two versions are 
expected to be reconciled in a conference committee and returned to both 
chambers for final approval by late spring or early summer.

JOB BIAS LAW NOT RETROACTIVE, JUSTICES RULE; WORKPLACE: CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATES 
DENOUNCE THE SUPREME COURT DECISION, WHILE CORPORATE LAWYERS EXPRESS RELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday saved employers from potential liability in 
thousands of job discrimination cases, ruling that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 
does not apply to bias that occurred before the law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 8-1 decision, they announced that the court will not apply the law 
retroactively unless Congress writes into the measure a precise provision 
extending it to pending lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights advocates denounced the ruling as a new blow to victims of 
workplace bias. Business lawyers said they are relieved that companies will not 
be forced to pay for past mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-year fight with congressional Democrats, President George Bush on 
Nov. 21, 1991, reluctantly signed the measure, which made it easier for workers 
to prove they were victims of discrimination and, for the first time, gave 
women the right to damages in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush stressed then that the law did not apply to thousands of pending claims. 
Democratic lawmakers, however, had wanted to apply the measure retroactively 
and had written such a rule into a 1990 version of the bill that was vetoed by 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise version that finally became law said nothing definite about 
retroactivity, and in the end, the question was left to be resolved by the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the justices said that only recent acts of discrimination are 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our 
jurisprudence," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court. It might even be 
unconstitutional, he said, to impose new punitive-damage verdicts on employers 
for past discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Only retiring Justice Harry A. Blackmun dissented, saying there is "nothing 
unjust" about forcing an employer to pay damages for discrimination that has 
been illegal for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 first outlawed employer discrimination 
based on race, religion, sex or national origin. But generally, victims of such 
bias could win only reinstatement to their jobs and back pay. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1980s, this once-powerful weapon against job bias had begun to seem 
somewhat feeble. Women's rights advocates, for example, pointed out that 
victims of on-the-job sexual harassment could not win much except a judge's 
order calling for a halt to the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when congressional Democrats pushed for a new bill to counter high 
court rulings that had made it harder for workers to win discrimination cases, 
civil rights advocates pressed for new damage remedies as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The final bill gave employees the right to have jury trials and set an 
escalating scale for damages based on the size of a company or agency. At the 
top end, employers with more than 500 workers can be forced to pay up to 
$300,000 to each employee who has suffered from illegal discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Though no precise figures were available, lawyers said that as many as several 
thousand cases could have been reopened if the high court had deemed the law to 
apply retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights lawyers argued that a majority of Congress favored retroactive 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's ruling decided the case of Barbara Landgraf, a Tyler, Tex., woman 
who was sexually harassed by a co-worker at a film-processing plant in 1985. 
She filed suit against her employer, and a judge agreed that she had been a 
victim of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he ruled in May, 1991, that she was not entitled to damages. In 
Landgraf vs. USI Film Products, the high court affirmed that judgment, saying 
the law did not apply to offenses that took place in 1985.

SPHERE OF INFLUENCE; UNOCAL REISSUES ITS LITTLE ORANGE POP ICON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSANNE GAYLE HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some segments of the business community, the 1960s counterculture was a 
winning proposition. The music business cashed in on the British invasion and 
American folk rock movement. Fashion trends such as miniskirts and bell-bottoms 
propelled retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the chintzy little orange Union 76 Styrofoam ball that, for 
some reason, hundreds of thousands of young Southern California motorists 
turned into a pop culture icon by sticking them atop their automobile antennas 
in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the balls are back, bidding once again to become a traveling billboard 
for Unocal Corp., which could certainly use the help in a tough gasoline 
market. The company is trying, with some success, to tap into the nostalgia 
genes of the baby boomers who helped popularize them in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, some boomers have lost their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put a 5-cent piece of plastic on this car? What are you, crazy?" an indignant 
Mercedes-Benz owner from Westwood asked a station attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unocal dealers, who ran a free-gasoline promotion last month for selected 
people with orange balls on their antennas, had trouble keeping them in stock. 
Richard Hiltzik, a San Fernando Valley resident, had to station-hop to find one 
for his new Oldsmobile Cutlass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great fun to have the ball back, and if someone wants to give me free 
gas, I'll take it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion was in the grand tradition of gas station giveaways of Ram 
glasses, Dodger trinkets and the like. It ended March 31, but Unocal credits it 
with boosting sales 5% to 10% and said it may revive the promotion. The company 
has distributed about a million of the balls so far. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hollywood has learned, some sequels work and some don't. Those who seek 
meaning in such matters are cautious about this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campaign is assured of some success, since the baby boomers are known for 
persistently reliving their teen years," says David Stewart, a USC marketing 
professor. "But we'll have to wait and see if the antenna ball becomes a sort 
of status symbol for the youth market the way it did the first time around." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, Unocal, then Union Oil Co., rendered a mini-version of its corporate 
symbol in Styrofoam -- a bright orange sphere marked "76" for the company's 
Union 76 brand of gasoline. They were handed out to customers as an antenna 
ornament. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they first came out, I'd say the antenna balls increased activity in my 
station by about 50%," recalls Ferdie Pitta, a Beverly Hills station manager 
for 28 years. "Even kids got them to put on their pencils at school." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, mania would so far be too strong a word. Where is the VW 
Bug with 25 balls on its aerial? Why aren't people making Hawaiian leis out of 
them like they used to? 
</P>
<P>
 Though one cutting-edge sort painted the ball black to match his Camaro, the 
most original behavior by '90s ball-bearers seems to be crowning their cellular 
phone antennas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it appears clear that economics rather than some whimsical passion 
for the orange balls got things rolling. Dealers randomly handed out about 
1,800 scratcher cards, most of them good for $5 worth of gas and five good for 
a lifetime of fuel, to people whose cars sported the orange balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few months ago, we couldn't give them away," says Alvaro Vicente, a night 
attendant at a station in West Los Angeles. "Then the customers heard about 
free gas, and suddenly everybody wanted one." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody. West Los Angeles resident Sharon Carey was miffed when an 
attendant "put that thing on my car without asking first." It then broke, and a 
friend needed half an hour to get it off with a pair of pliers. 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles resident Jeff Koontz, recalling his boyhood when vandals broke 
the antenna on his parents' car in order to get one of the orange balls, 
declined to place one on his Toyota Pathfinder last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly the spirit of 76.

 Walt Disney Co. on Tuesday reported a 16% rise in fiscal second-quarter 
earnings, with video sales of animated movies and consumer product sales 
offsetting lower theme park attendance and box office bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the January-to-March period, the company posted a record profit of 
$248.4 million, or 45 cents a share, compared to $214.9 million, 39 cents a 
share, a year earlier.Revenue rose 12% to $2.28 billion, from $2.03 billion a 
year earlier, also a record. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of its fiscal year, the Burbank-based company's revenue 
rose 13% to $5.0 billion, from $4.42 billion. Profit was $617.0 million, or 
$1.13 a share, more than four times the $118.4 million, 22 cents a share, 
earned during the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier six-months figures included reductions in earnings of $371 
million, reflecting onetime events. The largest charge, of $271 million, went 
to pay construction costs and other pre-opening expenses for new facilities, 
mostly at the troubled Euro Disney theme park in France.

 Capital Cities-ABC Inc. said its earnings doubled in the first quarter due to 
rising advertising demand and stronger performances in its broadcasting, cable 
TV and newspaper businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based media company said it earned $116.1 million, or $7.56 a 
share, in the three months ended April 3, compared to $58.4 million, or $3.55 a 
share, in its first quarter ended March 28, 1993. Revenue rose 19% to $1.40 
billion, from $1.18 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent results were inflated because the quarter was six days longer 
than usual and included the network's broadcast of the Academy Awards, which 
came earlier this year than in 1993.

Earnings increased 13% to 45 cents a share, from 40 cents in the first quarter 
of 1993.The figures include the result of applying new accounting standards to 
the 1993 earnings. Without taking those changes into account, the increase in 
first-quarter net earnings was 14% and the increase in earnings per share was 
18%. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue, excluding the effects of foreign currency conversion, rose 3% to

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HOW TO PROFIT AS YIELDS JUMP ON CASH ACCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 40 members of Congress wrote to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan on Tuesday, advising him to stop raising short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 They're forgetting that some people have waited a long time for this. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of loose money (though it may not have felt all that loose), 
the economy is growing at a healthy pace and the Fed is tightening credit 
accordingly -- quite a natural event, most economists agree. 
</P>
<P>
 And while most of the news stories since the first Fed interest rate boost 
Feb. 4 have focused on the negative aspects of higher rates, there are some 
clear winners here: Anyone who keeps money in short-term "cash" accounts, for 
example. That would include conservative savers, as well as the many smart 
investors who use a cash cushion as a buffer against turmoil in stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's say you're trying to squeeze the maximum return out of your 
short-term cash today. What are the best options? Here are details on some 
common cash instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Money market mutual funds. These funds typically own very short-term 
corporate debt, government securities and bank CDs, and for that reason they 
are the easiest way to ride rising short-term interest rates. As they 
continually turn over their investments, they're buying new paper at higher 
yields, so you earn more. 
</P>
<P>
 Money funds also are extremely safe; barring some catastrophe, your principal 
value stays constant at $1 a share, so many investors use the funds as 
substitutes for federally insured bank accounts. (The funds aren't insured.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since Feb. 4, the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark short-term interest 
rate from 3% to 3.75%. As other short yields have followed that rate higher, 
the average annualized yield on taxable money funds has risen from 2.71% to 
3.08%, according to fund tracker IBC/Donoghue Inc. in Ashland, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the funds have been shortening their investment maturities 
so they're turning money over faster -- the logical thing to do when the Fed is 
boosting rates. The average money fund maturity was 61 days on Feb. 4; now it's 
46 days. The upshot is that fund yields have further to climb, as they replace 
investments more rapidly at today's higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Frank, chief investment officer at IBC/Donoghue, figures that if the 
Fed raises its benchmark market rate to 4% soon as expected, money fund yields 
will level off at about 3.3% to 3.5% by summer. Fund management fees account 
for the difference between market rates and what the funds actually pay you. 
</P>
<P>
 One other option, if you're in a high tax bracket: tax-free money funds, which 
invest in short-term municipal paper issued by states and cities. But tax-free 
yields can be more volatile: The average fund yields 1.81% currently, which is 
actually lower than the 1.86% average yield of Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank CDs. Yields on certificates of deposit typically rise more slowly than 
money fund yields when the Fed is tightening credit, as banks try to keep their 
costs down for as long as possible. Still, CD rates are definitely in an up 
trend now, according to Robert Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor newsletter 
in North Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 One-year CDs now yield an average 3.34% nationwide, up from 3.03% on Feb. 4, 
Heady says. If you shop around, you can earn more. Bank of America had a 
one-day promotion last week, offering 5% yields on nine-month CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heady suggests that most savers stay short. "A three-month CD is as long 
as I'd go now," he says. The reason: He expects short-term interest rates to 
continue rising slowly through 1994 and perhaps into 1995 as the economy grows. 
If you keep your cash rolling over in three-month CDs (which average about 2.7% 
now nationwide), you'll ride the tide higher, he says. It's just too early to 
lock up cash in longer CDs, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Treasury bills. If you feel a strong need to go "long" and you have at 
least $10,000 in cash, buy T-bills. Their yields are far above those of bank 
CDs: 4.40% now on a six-month T-bill versus 2.97% on the average six-month bank 
CD, for example. And, unlike CDs, T-bill interest is exempt from state tax -- a 
big lure in high-tax California. You can buy three- or six-month T-bills direct 
from the Fed weekly. (Call (213) 624-7398 for order forms.) One-year T-bills 
are sold monthly. Many banks will also buy bills for you, for a fee. More for 
Your Cash 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how average yields on some common short-term savings vehicles have 
changed since Feb. 4, when the Federal Reserve Board began to tighten credit 
for the first time in five years. 03,23,10,10 *2*Annualized yield Instrument

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; IN DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 Virtual Instruments: Synthesized sound has always sounded -- well, 
synthesized. That's because synthesis chips were based on recordings of 
existing sounds, which do not take into account the range of different sounds a 
single instrument can make. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter waveguides, mathematical formulas that can model the way a violin string 
vibrates when it is bowed or the way a column of air vibrates in a flute. The 
result: virtual instruments. For heavy-metal fans, waveguides can also simulate 
screeching guitar feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 Waveguides were developed at Stanford University's Center for Computer 
Research in Music and Acoustics, which has licensed the technology to Yamaha 
and several U.S. companies, including Media Vision, which makes sound devices 
for personal computers. Yamaha has already announced the first commercial 
waveguide instrument, the VL-1 synthesizer, which will sell for $7,000. 
</P>

 Desktop Security: For all its ability to perform "smart" tasks, in one respect 
a computer is no different from a refrigerator or a television set: Anyone can 
use it when you're not around, with or without authorization. But what if your 
computer could tell who was sitting in front of it and block an intruder by 
refusing to turn on? 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers at Apple Computer's Advanced Technology Group are working with some 
of the same software technologies that guide smart missiles to bring 
object-recognition capability to the desktop. Equipped with this special 
software, the computer would, in effect, "acquire a target" when you or someone 
else entered your office. Based on pattern-matching, it would decide whether 
the person was friend or foe.

 World's Fastest Bean Counters: Figuring out how many pecks of pickled peppers 
Peter Piper picked would have been a snap using technology from Laguna 
Niguel-based Agricultural Data Systems and Dallas Semiconductor of Dallas. The 
latter has come up with programmable memory chips that, encased in stainless 
steel, can be attached to badges worn by field workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers press a button on the badge to record their pickings. At day's end, a 
simple touch of the button with a probe downloads the chip's lode of 
information, including date, time, field, crop and cartons completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, most growers use paper punch cards. For fields that typically use 
up to 2,000 workers per day, three or four clerks may be needed to do the 
tabulation. And despite injunctions not to fold, spindle or mutilate, punch 
cards are easily lost or mangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike bar codes, the new memory buttons are not affected by light or dirt. 
Agricultural Data Systems is using this DataTrack system at more than 35 sites 
in California, Texas, and Florida for produce ranging from strawberries, chili 
peppers and broccoli to apples and peaches.

 Compression Confusion: Video compression is the coming thing, but the big 
problem for people who want to include video in interactive kiosks, sales 
presentations and CD-ROM titles is which compression scheme to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no real standards, Doceo Publishing of Norcross, Ga. has put 
together a $49 CD-ROM sampler of over 250 benchmark video clips compressed to 
various resolutions and data rates. The clips illustrate the strengths and 
weaknesses of the leading software-only video compression "codecs" -- systems 
of compression and decompression -- from Intel, Microsoft, SuperMac, Media 
Vision and Xing Technologies. The sampler also includes the drivers needed to 
play back these clips on a standard personal computer, and a side-by-side 
display program helps compare one codec with another.

 Mapping Out Roadblocks: January's earthquake turned Cal State Northridge into 
a minefield for blind students unused to the radically altered state of the 
campus. But university officials have hit upon a solution: digitally mapping 
the place. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, visually impaired students will be able to get around CSUN this 
fall using a pair of new products due from Arkenstone, a San Jose-based 
nonprofit provider of reading machines. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Atlas Speaks, is essentially a talking map that lets anyone with a 
personal computer capable of speech synthesis "walk" an area, based on a 
digital map on the hard drive. As the user moves along a street, the software 
provides verbal directions. Once the route has been worked out using the 
computer's directional arrows, directions can be saved to a tape recorder or as 
Braille. 
</P>
<P>
 The second product, Strider, combines the Atlas Speaks software and maps with 
a portable computer and a Global Position System receiver carried in a 
backpack. As you walk along the GPS system tells you exactly where you are and 
what the next street will be if you continue in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The visually impaired and blind will be able to explore their own 
neighborhood, city or plan a trip anywhere in the country when Arkenstone 
introduces two products this fall.

 Building a Better Windshield: Making windshields and canopies for 
high-performance jet aircraft can be tricky, time-consuming and expensive. 
Worse yet, the process involves bending and cutting plastics in a way that can 
lead to weaknesses and cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 Now researchers at the University of Dayton (Ohio) and Air Force engineers 
have come up with a new process they say is cheaper and faster -- and even 
eliminates some of the weak spots. Canopies made from the new process are also 
lighter, resulting in a savings on precious jet fuel. Eventually, the 
developers hope, the canopies can even be used in cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The process uses injection molding to yield aircraft "transparencies," which 
the developers figure can be produced in an hour for $2,000, compared to a week 
and $20,000 for current F-16 canopies. Installation would take an hour instead 
of four days. Another hoped-for advantage: less optical distortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Pinnell, an engineer at the Flight Dynamics Directorate at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, says that in early testing, "we 
found the prototype was even stronger than anticipated."

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; CASE STUDY: HOW 
TECHNOLOGY CHANGED A BUSINESS; MAKING A CASE FOR THE PAPERLESS COURTROOM; 
TECHNOLOGY: USING COMPUTERS, ORANGE COUNTY PROBATE COURT HAS REDUCED ITS 
CRUSHING BURDEN OF PAPERWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every week, visitors from around the world file through the halls of a popular 
tourist attraction in Orange County -- not Disneyland, just the Probate Court 
in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourists are court administrators from Singapore, Kuwait and other distant 
places who have come to see how the court's staff uses computers to reduce 
paperwork. After four years of tweaking and an investment of $1.3 million, 
Orange County's Probate Court has moved a long way toward becoming a "paperless 
courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when Vice President Al Gore talks of "reinventing government" to 
make it more efficient, the Probate Court has done just that. With its updated 
technology, this unit of the Superior Court is now able to handle an expanding 
caseload without adding employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has made the court more accessible," the court's executive officer, Alan 
Slater, said of the change. "Before, files could be lost, and it could take 
days to find them. Now, our examiners get impatient if they have to wait 30 
seconds for a document. It has changed our concept of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic system has lifted a crushing burden of paperwork from the 
court's judges, clerks, attorneys and the public. Where once these parties 
fought over possession of case files, several can now read the same document 
simultaneously on the computer. The system shortens trial time and cuts the 
costs of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a terminal in my chamber and one on the bench," said Judge John C. 
Wooley, one of two judicial officers in the probate division. "Without 
question, it is a timesaver. I can bring a case to my fingertips with the click 
of a few buttons." 
</P>
<P>
 Cases are filed on paper and converted into digital images, or data that 
computers can understand and manipulate. A device known as an optical scanner 
captures an image of the paper much like an office copier and stores it in an 
electronic file. The computer image can be processed and shared by clerks, 
examiners and judges. 
</P>
<P>
 An optical disk -- a platter that resembles a music CD -- stores the file 
until someone using a computer workstation retrieves it. The court's computer, 
which changes optical disks much as a jukebox changes numbers, can store 90 
disks, equivalent to 14 million sheets of paper. Anyone, including the public, 
can get access to the data from one of 57 terminals located throughout the 
court building. 
</P>
<P>
 Imaging has not dispensed with paper completely, but it is improving 
efficiency and its use is spreading. Court files don't get lost; attorneys can 
talk more about their cases than their filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Such systems are in the future for paper-bound courthouses elsewhere. In 
Ventura County, court administrators are installing a system for their civil 
division for $250,000 -- cheaper than other systems because prices for computer 
hardware are dropping. Los Angeles Municipal Court uses an imaging system to 
process traffic fines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has been a real leader that we are looking at as a test," said 
Sheila Gonzalez, executive director of the Ventura County Superior Court and a 
member of a subcommittee that participated in a report released earlier this 
year on the future of the California court system. "Imaging is one of the tools 
we can use to revolutionize the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater said it made sense to start with Probate, since Orange County's 
retirement communities and wealthy estates generate as many as 3,000 cases a 
year and about 2,000 pages of paper filings daily, dealing with complex issues 
ranging from estate accounting to fights over wills. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cases often generate paperwork for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Orange County's became one of the first courts in the nation to try 
an imaging experiment. It used computers and software from Costa Mesa-based 
FileNet Corp., which specializes in imaging applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Such applications are abundant in banks and insurance companies, but 
cash-strapped government entities have moved slowly to adopt the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county looked at this as an investment, not a harebrained idea," Slater 
said. "That's not easy for government, and that's why we're always behind the 
private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater first had to make sure the court's old mainframe system could be linked 
to the FileNet workstations. 
</P>
<P>
 Having everything work together has enabled court employees to use electronic 
mail, tap into files and send documents to each other without leaving their 
terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 FileNet won the imaging contract in 1990 and worked with the court staff for 
eight months to get the system going. The court employees took part in 
designing a customized system they would use every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made it a lot easier for them to accept," said Jeannette McSkane, 
project manager and senior staff analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, after 47 years of dealing with paper, it was hard for Betty Schulte to 
learn to work as a probate examiner on the computer. "It took hands-on training 
to get used to it," Schulte said, "but I always like to learn something new." 
</P>
<P>
 The change has also enabled Roseann Soldan, a manager, to supervise examiners' 
work with a click of her mouse. She can find out how many cases were handled in 
a day and how much work was done. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the system hasn't eliminated warehouses full of court documents. State 
law mandates they be kept, but that may change when optical disk technology is 
proven suitable for long-term storage. Eventually, the system could be upgraded 
to allow for the electronic filing of documents from remote locations, cutting 
paper out of the picture entirely.

 If you want to explore the bottomless depths of the Internet, a gopher might 
serve as your guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gopher is a ubiquitous Internet program so named for its usefulness in 
burrowing beneath mound upon mound of data (and also because it originated at 
the University of Minnesota, home of the Golden Gophers).Gophers are useful 
because they let you find what you want with easy-to-use menus. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple way to gopher is just to type "gopher," since most systems have a 
default gopher available. But different gopher sites can serve as more direct 
gateways. One of the biggest such animals lives at Washington and Lee 
University in Lexington, Va., and offers a master list of more than 4,000 
Internet resources; just pick one and gopher takes you to it. To connect, type 
"gopher honor.uc.wlu.edu 1020" at your command prompt. 
</P>
<P>
 Another interesting gopher resides at Pipeline, a new Internet service 
provider in New York. The gopher menu here is very simple: Internet Highlights, 
the Reference Desk, Arts & Leisure, Weather Everywhere and Libraries On Line 
are a few choices from the top menu. To connect, type "gopher pipeline.com" at 
the prompt. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that you don't need any gopher software on your own computer; gophers 
live mainly on Internet servers. ADAM S. BAUMAN

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; PAGING THROUGH THE MANY OPTIONS OF COMMUNICATING WITH A PAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Since computers these days are as much communications devices as anything 
else, and since your PC can work with your pager, a primer in pagers doesn't 
seem out of order in this space. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, pagers seem ubiquitous. Doctors and managers have them, but so do 
plumbers, waitresses and even schoolchildren. Like telephones and automobiles, 
the first generation were black only. Today, you can get them in designer 
colors to match your wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers are about evenly divided between business and consumer users," 
said Glenn Chow of Pro-Group Cellular, a Redwood City, Calif., pager dealer. 
"Many of our customers are families who buy pagers for both the parents and the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents equip their teen-agers with pagers, although some schools bar 
pagers as potential tools of the drug trade. Other parents like their children 
to give out a pager number -- instead of the home phone number -- to their 
friends. "Kids like to wear them because they're cool," Chow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic pagers are small radio receivers that are carried in a pocket or worn on 
a belt. Like most categories of electronic devices, they range from the 
simple-to-operate to exotic and complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Some paging companies provide software to let personal computers and Macs send 
text messages -- rather than simply a phone number -- to their alphanumeric 
pagers. RadioMail of San Mateo, Calif., ((800) 597-MAIL) offers a two-way 
wireless electronic mail service that works with PCs, Macs and hand-held 
"palmtop" computers such as the Hewlett-Packard 100LX. 
</P>
<P>
 RadioMail plans to offer service for the Apple Newton, Motorola Envoy and 
other personal digital assistants. For $89 a month, you get unlimited two-way 
electronic mail via the Internet. RadioMail also offers a $20-per-month one-way 
paging service that lets you receive Internet e-mail via any standard 
alphanumeric pager. The service requires you to subscribe to an alphanumeric 
paging service. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic numeric pager consists of a little boxlike device that weighs just a 
few ounces. Usually you get a private telephone number to give to your callers, 
who punch in a numeric message (usually their phone number). A few seconds 
later, you get a beep or feel a vibration. The number appears on the pager's 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices vary greatly, but consider the whole package when getting a pager. 
There is the cost of the unit, the cost of activating the service, the monthly 
fee for the service and any extras. Companies that offer free or very low-cost 
paging units sometimes get you with long-term contracts, higher monthly fees or 
per-page charges. Some will sell you the pager outright and others will lease 
them to you. Pagers themselves are pretty cheap these days, so consider that 
when evaluating a lease option. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-cost pagers, which you can purchase outright for about $40, will store up 
to five messages. That may be adequate if you call people back promptly. For 
about $20 more, you can get a unit that stores 16 or more numbers. Some pagers 
just beep, while others vibrate to get your attention without disturbing people 
around you -- a must if you get paged in restaurants, theaters or during 
meetings. Most pagers come with a belt clip, but you don't have to wear them. I 
keep mine in my pocket and it works just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Most pagers come pre-configured to work with a specific paging company. You 
can change service companies, but with most pagers, you'll have to pay to have 
a new crystal installed to change frequencies. That, plus an activation fee, 
could cost you as much as $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Like cellular phones, the cost of the hardware is just the beginning. Most 
paging companies charge between $8 and $10 a month for basic service. Some 
limit the number of free messages but typically allow 200 or more free pages, 
which for most people is more than enough. There is also a variety of service 
options. Many paging services offer an option that lets your callers leave a 
recorded message. The system pages you with a special code, signaling you to 
call in. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile Telecommunications Corp. operates the SkyTel ((800) 759-1911) 
nationwide paging service. For $69 a month, they'll equip you with an 
alphanumeric pager with coverage in most metropolitan areas in the United 
States and Canada, as well as selected overseas locations. They offer regional 
service starting at $39 a month. The company offers a standard numeric paging 
service but also provides software for PCs and Macs that lets you type in text 
messages. Or, for 50 cents per incoming message, you can arrange to let your 
callers dictate messages to a live operator, who will transmit the text to your 
pager. 
</P>
<P>
 The service also has links to MCI Mail and other e-mail services to provide 
you with the first 240 characters of incoming e-mail messages. Another MTEL 
service, called SkyFax, provides you with an incoming fax mailbox. The pager 
notifies you of an incoming fax, and you can use a touch-tone phone to direct 
the fax to any machine in the country.

 NIXON TRIBUTE: While President Clinton eulogizes his predecessor at the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda today, sympathizers can sign 
a condolence book at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (B1). The Reagan 
library will be closed today like other federal offices. But the lobby remains 
open for those who want to join the 2,500 well-wishers who have penned missives 
in the book to be sent to Nixon's family. "Your father did make a difference," 
a Camarillo woman wrote.

 HUNGRY PICKETS: Ventura County Teamsters are planning a food drive for truck 
drivers who have spent three weeks on the picket line. . . . About 110 local 
Teamsters have joined the nationwide strike over freight companies' plans to 
hand more work to part-timers and ship more by rail. Strikers get $200 a week 
from the union, but lose health benefits this weekend. "We're preparing for the 
long term," said the union's Dennis Shaw. "We're going to start collecting 
foods to sustain our picketers."

 CERAMIC SENTRY: Sea gulls used to mob McAuliffe School, an elementary school 
near the beach in Oxnard. . . . They'd deposit their droppings on parked cars, 
the school's roof, the sidewalk. Parents complained of guano gumming up 
stroller wheels. Students were squeamish about sticky shoes. "We were 
desperate," said Principal Paul Kirk. So he turned to psychological warfare. He 
bought some ceramic owls, feared hunters in the bird world, and placed them 
strategically on light poles. Says Kirk: "The problem has dropped 
dramatically." 
</P>

 LESSON PLAN: Promoters of "Take Our Daughters to Work" day expect millions of 
participants tomorrow (D1). . . . The core idea is simple: Advance the cause of 
women in the workplace by expanding the horizons of young girls. Now Metrolink 
wants to add a message. It's offering a free ride to children of paying adults 
as a way to teach good commuting habits. Says Metrolink Chairman Larry Walker: 
"Kids need to understand that driving to work alone is not an example we should 
perpetuate."

COUNTY DROPS PLANS FOR JAIL AT TUSTIN BASE; LAND USE: IN A COMPROMISE WITH CITY 
OFFICIALS, THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS INSTEAD INTENDS TO MOVE AN ANIMAL SHELTER 
THERE WHEN THE NAVY LEAVES IN 1997. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Board of Supervisors unanimously withdrew a proposal Tuesday to build a 
work furlough jail, a second juvenile hall and an alcohol recovery center at 
the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station, part of a compromise with 
Tustin leaders and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the county plans to move its animal control shelter from Orange to 
the base, a change that comes after months of negotiations with Tustin 
officials over a list of potential uses for the 1,620-acre helicopter base that 
closes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the work done is commendable on both sides," board Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The base reuse plan also includes county proposals for a family resource 
center, a child-care shelter, a regional law enforcement training center and an 
urban regional park. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders and residents in Tustin opposed proposals for the work furlough 
facility, the second juvenile hall and sobering-up center, saying the uses were 
not economically feasible nor compatible with the rest of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Without support from Tustin officials, the county had little hope of seeing 
the proposals approved, officials said. Tustin officials, meanwhile, have 
greeted the county's revised plan with support. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of the Navy, which owns the base, ultimately will approve 
a reuse plan for it. Local officials hope to submit a final reuse plan to the 
Navy later this year, and it could take another year before the Navy makes a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin City Manager William A. Huston said Tuesday he's confident the plan as 
now proposed will be accepted by the Navy. The relocation of the animal shelter 
played a key role in bringing the compromise together, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something the city can live with and it helps the county meet some of 
its goals," Huston said. "That was the key to the decision on both the part of 
the city and the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The animal shelter relocation, however, remains a complicated issue in Orange 
and is connected to controversy over proposed expansion at Theo Lacy Branch 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1991 agreement, the city of Orange is supposed to pay for relocation 
of the animal shelter, estimated at several million dollars, in order to extend 
Metropolitan Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have not yet determined what they might do with the animal 
shelter site after the move. It's questionable, officials said, if the site 
could be used as part of a proposal to expand nearby Theo Lacy Branch Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange officials have indicated they might use the city's obligation to pay 
for the animal shelter relocation as a bargaining tool to prevent jail 
expansion.

BOY DIES IN APARTMENT FIRE; FATALITY: MOTHER MANAGES TO SAVE 2-YEAR-OLD, WHO IS 
SAID TO HAVE IGNITED THE BLAZE, BUT COULDN'T SAVE SON, 6, WHO WAS TRAPPED BY 
FIRE. TWENTY-EIGHT TENANTS ARE LEFT HOMELESS.

 A fire accidentally ignited by a 2-year-old playing with a cigarette lighter 
swept through a Buena Park apartment Tuesday morning, killing the boy's 
6-year-old brother, who was trapped by flames in a bedroom, screaming for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' mother, who had dozed off in the living room, awoke to find the room 
in flames and rescued the younger boy but couldn't save her older son, who had 
stayed home sick from kindergarten, said Buena Park Fire Marshal Donald Tully. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother "grabbed the 2-year-old, took him out the front door and when she 
got back in the living room, the fire was everywhere," Tully said. "The boy was 
screaming for her and she was yelling his name but she couldn't get to him. She 
ran outside and tried to break his bedroom window but by that time it was too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Mangosing was trapped in his first-floor bedroom when the blaze roared 
through his family's apartment in the 7400 block of Franklin Street just after 
9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A firefighter found the child dead on the floor near a charred bunk bed. The 
boy suffered third-degree burns over his entire body but may have already died 
from smoke inhalation, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's 24-year-old mother, Mary Mitchell, told investigators that she had 
dozed off on a love seat in the living room when she was awakened by the heat 
of the fire, Tully said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the fire was extinguished, grief-stricken family members arrived 
at the apartment complex to comfort the boy's anguished mother, who cried 
loudly as she stood on the sidewalk surrounded by her relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a sweet little boy," said Bambi Mitchell, Mary Mitchell's sister, as 
the group made its way upstairs. "He was so outgoing and intelligent. I loved 
him so much. He was loved by so many." 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor on the second floor, 32-year-old Rose Madison, tossed her 
2-year-old son to rescuers from a balcony before jumping down to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't open my front door because it was too hot," Madison said 
breathlessly. "I didn't want to jump. I was scared. But I made sure my kid was 
safe. Then I jumped." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Mitchell's parents and three siblings, who live in an apartment directly 
across from her, heard the young woman's frantic screams and joined in the 
futile efforts to rescue Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard Mary screaming, 'Anthony is in the house trapped!' " said a sobbing 
Bambi Mitchell. "Mary tried getting him out, but couldn't. I tried but 
couldn't. The entire house was in flames before we knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park firefighter David Orr, 27, discovered the child's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a child the same age, so it kind of hits home," Orr said. "There was 
fire blowing out of every window by the time we got here, and were told there 
was a kid inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators could not explain why the fire spread so quickly through 
the apartment. The blaze caused an estimated $200,000 damage to the four-unit 
building and destroyed about $75,000 worth of its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 32 firefighters from Buena Park, Orange County and Los Angeles fire 
departments 49 minutes to control the blaze, Tully said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County chapter of the American Red Cross was called to the scene 
and is providing food and temporary lodging for the 28 tenants in the crowded 
complex who were left homeless by the fire, said spokeswoman Judy Iannaconne. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those displaced was 36-year-old Willie Bell, who shared a three-bedroom 
apartment with eight other relatives. Bell said many precious family 
photographs were destroyed in the blaze as well as expensive textbooks he had 
bought to study electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any insurance," said Bell, shaking his head. "I think I'm going 
to get some now." 
</P>
<P>
 Tully said apartments throughout the complex are equipped with smoke detectors 
but it is unclear whether the batteries in Mitchell's detector were working. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things I think we can learn from this tragedy," Tully said. "The 
first is to make sure you have a functioning smoke detector. The second is to 
secure any smoking material such as matches or lighters in a cabinet. Don't 
leave them on the coffee table. They need to be put out of temptation's way." 
</P>
<P>
 Tearful relatives and neighbors stood in front of the burned apartment 
building and fondly remembered the precocious child, who had celebrated his 
sixth birthday with a huge party on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Mitchell's boyfriend, 24-year-old Chris Gilliland, said the youngster was 
ecstatic over the birthday gifts he received at the party, which was attended 
by neighborhood children and his friends from Gordon H. Beatty Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anthony was not a shy boy," added upstairs neighbor Jocelyn Bell. "He was a 
child who loved to play and always had a smile on his face. He was a very good 
boy. He would always come and knock on my door and say, 'Can I come in? I want 
to play.' He was a happy child, very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Jocelyn Bell, 36, said her concern now rested with Mary Mitchell, whom she 
described as "a good mom." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was always taking care of them," Bell said. "She was always there, right 
at home. She would walk him to the bus stop in the morning. I feel so badly for 
her."

DANA POINT VOTE BINDS CITY TO HEADLANDS PLAN; DEVELOPMENT: LANDOWNERS WIN RIGHT 
TO BUILD $500-MILLION HOTEL AND 370 HOMES ON PRIME COASTAL PARCEL. APPROVAL 
COMES OVER ENVIRONMENTALISTS' PROTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A contract that binds the city for at least a decade to plans for a 
$500-million hotel and 370 homes on the Headlands peninsula near Dana Point 
Harbor was approved Tuesday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4-1 to adopt the 73-page development agreement giving the 
landowners the right to build the homes and a 400-room hotel on 121 acres of 
prime oceanfront land, one of the last undeveloped coastal properties in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which has been renegotiated over the past two weeks, is a 
document that legally secures the plan the council approved on April 5, despite 
the protests of several environmental groups that want to save the property as 
a natural resource. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority has for months insisted that not only does the landowner 
have the right to develop its property, but that the city will need the more 
than $2 million in estimated annual revenue that ultimately will be produced by 
the hotel and two planned commercial sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an economic insurance policy for the city," said Councilman Mike 
Eggers. "Ultimately, it will be good for the landowner and the taxpayers of 
Dana Point." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's opponents, who have fought for more than three years to save more 
of the bluff-top land for parks or open space, have urged the council to reject 
the agreement. One grass-roots group is circulating a petition calling for a 
citywide vote to overturn the council's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William L. Ossenmacher, who supports that effort and who cast the 
lone vote against the project, said, "This agreement looks to me to be 
extremely one-sided. There are some very small benefits to the city and some 
great benefits to the property owner."  
</P>
<P>
 Resident Bob Larwood, one of the plan's most outspoken critics, said before 
the meeting that the plan is not the financial boon some expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "All through this negotiation, (the council) has put through the idea there 
would be $2.3 million coming into the city from this plan," Larwood said. "But 
unless the hotel and commercial areas are built, we will never see that money, 
at least not for 10 or 15 years. There is this feeling that once this deal is 
passed the city will be rolling in money, but that's just not going to be the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the construction of the proposed hotel and retail centers was 
one of the key issues in the renegotiation of the agreement over the past two 
weeks. As the agreement now stands, at least 50% of the hotel would have to be 
finished before the last 65 homes could be built. The agreement does not 
require a guarantee that the commercial centers will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agreement also pushed up the completion of the hilltop park at the 
highest point of the bluffs and reduced the purchase prices on two parcels of 
land the city has the option of buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried to respond to all the requests the City Council has made," said 
Dan T. Daniels, a spokesman for the Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co., which 
owns the property along with the Chandis Securities Co. (Chandis Securities, a 
firm that oversees the financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a 
principal stockholder in Times Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles 
Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 The city also will get 59 acres dedicated as parks or open space and $2.8 
million in improvements to the parks, according to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the development agreement, especially now with these changes, gives 
an awful lot of benefits to the city of Dana Point," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Dana Point Headlands Conservancy said they will continue to 
work to save more land on the bluffs, despite the council vote. Jacqueline 
Cain, one of its founders, said the group did not take a stand on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are nonpolitical," said Cain, an eight-year Dana Point resident. "We are 
seeking federal and state grants and working on a bond initiative to purchase 
parts of the land. We are going to continue that no matter what happens."

HUNDREDS OF SOUTH AFRICANS CAST VOTES IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 South African Digane Boikanyo walked out of a polling station here on Tuesday 
with a smile on his face and hope in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a brand new penny today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloting was remarkable on all accounts. Here was Boikanyo, 52 and black, 
voting for the first time in his life as part of his nation's historic all-race 
elections, and he was casting his ballot halfway around the world from his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine polling place was one of seven such stations for the estimated 
30,000 South Africans living in California. There are some 20 remote polling 
places throughout the United States, including Boston, New York City and 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought sometimes that this day would never come," said Boikanyo, a Garden 
Grove resident who was exiled from his native country more than 25 years ago. 
"It is the greatest day of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Boikanyo was one of nearly 900 Orange County South Africans, most of them 
white, who went to Irvine City Hall to vote for a new government in their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 After proving South African citizenship, voters were handed a ballot that 
included 19 parties and identified them with a small, black-and-white 
photograph of each party's leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 25% of the black voting population in South Africa is illiterate, 
according to United Nations officials, the small pictures are included as a 
voter aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many choices were Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, and 
F.W. de Klerk's National Party. Hidden among the big names were lesser-knowns 
such as the Soccer Party dedicated to sports and politics, and KISS, the Keep 
It Straight and Simple Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Though in Orange County voters had only Tuesday to cast their ballots, in 
South Africa balloting continues for three days. Whoever wins, the new 
government is pledged to repudiate racism and seek social justice through a 
multi-party democracy. The balloting marks the end of 300 years of white rule 
and four decades of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really fantastic," said Nigel Visser, a white South African who 
moved to Laguna Beach 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel everyone has the right to participate in the elections. It's a great 
day for South Africa and today marks the day for us to move forward," said 
Visser, 42, a clothing maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viva the ANC!" said Gregory Lebona, a black South African, who strode 
jubilantly from the voting booth with his hands in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am looking forward to a new South Africa," said Lebona, a anatomy professor 
at a Johannesburg university who is attending a weeklong seminar in Anaheim. 
"It will bring peace to the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Other voters do not share Lebona's optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think today marks the beginning of the end. South Africa will soon fall 
into revolution," said Garry Purkiss, who is white. Because many different 
tribal groups harbor age-old hatreds toward each other, the elections will only 
serve to escalate the battle for power, said Purkiss, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dana Point marketing manager who has lived in California for a decade, 
Purkiss said his sister and her husband left South Africa last week, fearing a 
bloody aftermath to the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take 10 years until the country normalizes," Purkiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 All voters agreed, however, that Tuesday marked an irreversible change in the 
course of their homeland's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Still elated after voting for the first time, Boikanyo walked with his arm 
around his son, Ben, dreaming of a better South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to return soon. I am so happy it's hard to explain," he said, leaving 
Irvine City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 As he passed a group of white South African who were going to vote, one 
shouted to Boikanyo, "Saku bana, " or "hello" in Zulu. Boikanyo waved and 
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all speak each other's language. We are all one people now," Boikanyo 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; HOMETOWN HOOPLA FOR THE LADYCATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children enthusiastically circled this town's most famous athletes -- the 
members of Brea Olinda High School's girls basketball team -- hoping for 
autographs and handshakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be on the Ladycat team someday," said 11-year-old Mandi Prince, who 
has been a loyal fan for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with 17 cards, each with a photo of a different player, Mandi got her 
autographs at a ceremony Monday night honoring the undefeated team, which was 
ranked first in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 fans, including city and school officials, alumni, students and 
parents, gathered in the gymnasium to congratulate their hometown stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats, with a 33-0 record, were ranked first in the United States last 
month in USA Today's final poll of girls high school basketball teams. On March 
19, the girls had won the state championship for the fourth year in a row, 
beating San Jose Archbishop Mitty, 54-44. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three previous seasons, the Ladycats compiled a 130-5 won-lost 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Team players and coaches were showered with praise and proclamations from 
President Clinton, Gov. Pete Wilson, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, state Sen. 
John Lewis and other politicians and community groups. The team was honored 
with musical tributes and dance and cheerleading numbers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The national championship team "had talent, leadership and a tremendous work 
ethic," said Mark Trakh, the Ladycats' coach until last year, who led the team 
to three consecutive state championships. "They are a group of young people who 
were not afraid to fail. . . . Because of the way they prepared, they were 
winners. Even if this group had not won the championships, they would still be 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the team collectively boasts a 3.5 grade-point average, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hattrup, the coach who led the team to its undefeated season this year, 
said the girls practiced before and after school for 11 months. "All the hard 
work and sacrifice has definitely paid off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their national championship has brought the school together," said Craig 
Hawkins, 18, a Brea Olinda senior. "Everyone has a sense of pride. We all say, 
'That's our Ladycats.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats' fame "has completely put Brea on the map nationwide," said Brea 
Olinda Unified School Board member Todd Spitzer. "And the Ladycats have become 
role models for boys and girls throughout the district." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's Most Valuable Player and the Orange League's Athlete of the Year, 
Nicole Erickson, wept at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great end to our four years on this team. It's so special," said 
Erickson, 17, who has been playing with six other seniors on the team since 
they were in the seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Other team members are: Rochelle Anthony, Tammika Banks, Sarah Beckley, 
Marissa Bradley, Colleen Hudson, Lauri Jordan, Tara Llanes, Dawn Metz, Kiyoko 
Miller, Lee Moulin, Janelle Ralph, Susan Rhodabarger, Jennifer Saari, Joan 
Shipley, Stephanie Wettlin and Sarah Zachry.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; FIREFIGHTER, OFFICER WIN CITY HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of the city's public safety professionals were recognized last week for 
their dedication, commitment and willingness to put their lives on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Jim Perry and firefighter Ron Chamberlain received top honors during 
the annual Police Officer and Firefighter of the Year Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon was held by the Exchange Club of Fountain Valley and was attended 
by 148 people, including local elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were selected by their peers and were given special accolades from 
nearly every organization and service group in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it an honor and am very fortunate to have received it," said 
Perry, 36, who joined the Police Department 12 years ago and has been an 
investigator for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlain, 47, an engineer who began his career with the city 17 years ago, 
said: "It's quite an honor. It's like a second family at work." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry investigates homicides and crimes against people and has been involved 
in some of the city's most high-profile cases, including a double slaying in 
which a man killed his sister-in-law and a co-worker of hers at a local 
embroidery shop. The suspect in the case was taken into custody in Grand 
Junction, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also investigated a shooting outside a Vietnamese coffeehouse in which 
one man was killed and two others were wounded. The investigation led to the 
arrest of two suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's challenging," he said. "It's nice to track down people and hold them 
accountable for hurting other people. You get a sense of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Bill DeNisi called Perry the "quintessential police officer," who 
is well liked by his co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the guy we give the most serious crimes to. He is so unbelievably 
thorough. If I was a crook, I'd hate to have Jim Perry after me," DeNisi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, a Riverside resident who is married with two daughters, has also served 
as president of the Fountain Valley Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlain, a Costa Mesa resident who is married and the father of two sons, 
said it is rewarding to serve the public and help people. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, Chamberlain has been the Fire Department's map maker. He updates 
grid maps that help firefighters respond quickly to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
 A map, he said, "makes us know right out of the station exactly where we are 
going and the best route to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlain's co-workers described him as being a "ball of constant energy and 
one who gives 110% every day of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Bernard F. Heimos said being a firefighter of the year "means a 
whole lot more than a recognition of doing a really good job." 
</P>
<P>
 "For someone to receive the recognition from their peers and chief officers is 
quite remarkable," Heimos added. "The way Ron did it is he set his own personal 
standards a notch above what I think are already high standards." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; THE SETTING WAS GROUNDS FOR MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Week after week, over coffee, Barbara Robinson and John Beringer debated war, 
politics and religion. They should have known love wasn't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by friends and family, Beringer and Robinson were married Saturday 
in Cyrano's Coffee House in Orange, where they had met just over four months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as impulsive as it sounds," said Robinson, 45, a Superior Court 
clerk from Orange. "I just can't think of anyone else in the world I'd rather 
be with than him." 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship began brewing at a weekly coffeehouse discussion group. The 
group of about 20, ranging in age from 12 to 90, tackled a broad range of 
topics -- everything from gays in the military to quantum mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 Beringer 43, a professional mediator from Tustin, said he quickly became 
enchanted with Robinson's passion and honesty when addressing the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved watching her open up," said Beringer, who helped found the group. 
"Her insights into things, the way her mind works, it's really beautiful. She's 
a remarkable lady." 
</P>
<P>
 It was, alas, almost a relationship that didn't happen. Robinson said had it 
not been for a friend who practically dragged her to the coffeehouse, she never 
would have gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpectedly, Beringer and Robinson found the coffeehouse atmosphere a welcome 
relief from the bar scene, which they found superficial. With the aroma of 
coffee and compelling ideas in the air, Robinson and Beringer felt comfortable 
enough to be themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dating scene can be so phony," Beringer said. "I had really given up on 
dating, and dating services didn't seem to work. But Cyrano's was really 
special. It's the place we met, and (it) allowed us to sustain our 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson agreed: "There's just so few places where you can sit and talk openly 
and honestly about how you feel." 
</P>
<P>
 When the time came to plan the wedding, there was no doubt where it was going 
to be: Cyrano's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are terribly romantic, and that's where we met and fell in love with each 
other," Robinson said. "It's a very special place to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple plan to honeymoon in Laguna Beach. "We are just going to sit there 
and watch the sun set," Beringer said.MARTIN MILLER

<P>
 City apartment owners are eligible to receive free ultra-low-flush toilets to 
replace older, less efficient models under a new city program. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will deliver new toilets to apartment owners who replace at least 25 
old toilets.Apartment owners are responsible for installation. 
</P>
<P>
 In multifamily housing units, toilets can account for more than 40% of 
interior water use, city officials said. The new 1.6-gallon fixtures conserve 
up to five gallons per flush when compared to standard models. 
</P>
<P>
 "With rising water costs, conservation programs like this become Anaheim's 
most economical water supply source," said Mariann S. Long, Anaheim public 
utilities resource efficiency programs manager. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 5,200 toilets are available through the program. Old toilets will 
be recycled and crushed for roadbed material.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY TO PAY UPKEEP OF NADADORES' POOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost two years of uncertainty over a permanent home for the Mission Viejo 
Nadadores may have ended when the City Council appeared to concede that the 
city would pay $265,000 annual maintenance on the swim team's practice 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 City negotiators Monday night were not instructed to pursue an increase on the 
current $14,400 annual lease paid by the Nadadores. Instead, the team will be 
asked to pay more rent on the city-owned pool complex only if their fund 
raising is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no interest from anyone in the business community in (leasing) 
those pools," Mayor Susan Withrow said after the meeting. "What were we going 
to do, let it stay vacant?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although several points remain to be negotiated, the biggest is the cost of 
operating the two-pool swim stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at Marguerite and Oso parkways, the swim complex has been home to the 
Nadadores for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Mission Viejo Co. pulled its sponsorship of the swim team in late 
1991, it came up with a land swap in which the swim stadium and several other 
recreation centers went to the city. The Mission Viejo Co. got a two-story 
office building in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadadores officials say they raised $560,000 to pay for the cost of an 
internationally recognized swim program and cannot afford to pay more to lease 
the pools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, city officials have expressed doubts about paying $265,000 to 
support a group that counts about 350 active participants. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Nadadores presented new figures that show more than 1,000 
people are enrolled in their program. 
</P>
<P>
 Team spokesman Brian Murphy said the city spends more on Little League and 
youth soccer players. City officials have produced conflicting figures showing 
that considerably more city money is spent on Nadadores team members than other 
youth sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The contradictions aired on Monday typified the often tense, combative 
atmosphere existing between some city officials and the Nadadores. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, council members said they clearly recognized the value of the 
Nadadores program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, by a 3-to-1 vote, the council told city staff to bargain for: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 10-year agreement with a three-year escape clause for either party. 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision to allow lap swimmers to use the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guarantees that the Nadadores would pay more rent if their fund-raising 
revenues increase. However, the team would not have to include money drawn from 
corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Nadadores is to institute affordable swim programs for the community. 
Nadadores swimmers pay between $80 and $125 per month to participate in a 
program that has produced athletes who have won more than 40 Olympic medals.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; AID DEADLINE PASSES FOR VICTIMS OF FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after a firestorm swept through this city, the opportunity for fire 
victims to apply for federal and state disaster aid came to a close Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 1,000 people have come through the doors here," said Diane Turner, 
a spokeswoman for the state's Office of Emergency Services, which helps operate 
the Community Disaster Recovery and Preparedness Center on North Coast Highway 
in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said the center seemed to give residents "psychological comfort" while 
helping them get financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people just walk in and say, 'Oh, you're still here,' and then walk 
back out," she said. "They're just so pleased we're still here." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the state and federal relief center will remain open until June 17 to 
help residents prepare for other possible emergencies. The community-based Fire 
Relief Coalition next door also continues to operate. Director Marsha Bode said 
this is a tough time for fire survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the six-month anniversary of the fire," Bode said. "Some people do 
seem to be more frustrated and more depressed. I call it the 'hard middle' 
because the initial adrenaline has stopped and the end is not in sight at all. 
. . . This is where we're just slogging through, day after day." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 978 people applied for Small Business Administration loans to replace 
homes or other personal property, and 581 who were rejected for SBA loans filed 
applications for state grants to help cover their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 homes were damaged or destroyed here in the Oct. 27 fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said she noticed "a slight flurry" of activity at the center in the 
last several weeks as residents who had been approved for federal loans filed 
90-day extensions because of uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, several geologists told the city that there may be an ancient 
landslide under about 50 homes in the Mystic Hills neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 That jolted residents eager to rebuild and prompted the city to stop issuing 
building permits for that area and to hire a consulting firm to study the land.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; STUDENTS PUT STOCK IN PLAYING THE 
MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months ago, most of Karl Gittleman's high school economics class didn't 
know a bull market from a china shop. Margin purchases? Selling short, buying 
high? Mutual bond markets? 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street terms were like a foreign language until the class got involved in 
The Stock Market Game, a statewide 400-school competition that gives teen-agers 
a chance to build a financial empire on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with $100,000 in fake money, four teams of high school seniors from St. 
Margaret's Episcopal School set out in February to make a killing in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 They were introduced to the Wall Street Journal, taught how to read stock 
reports and analyze the market, and learned that a bull market means stock 
prices are going up. Then the economics class cast its newfound fortune into 
the sometimes bewildering world of high finance along with students from Santa 
Rosa to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 One team finished first in the state for three consecutive weeks until falling 
to 13th Monday. The shark-infested waters of Wall Street have claimed two of 
the St. Margaret's teams, which have finished far down in the weekly standings 
and have turned to time-honored methods for choosing stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, heads we buy, tails we sell," said senior Matt Maxey, 17, palming a coin, 
then flipping it in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Hayward runs the California version of the contest. The game is 
sponsored by Wall Street in New York and is played in various states. 
</P>
<P>
 Transaction sheets are filled out weekly, and Cal State Hayward issues a 
report that keeps track of the students' earnings. The top winners get 
T-shirts, trophies and enough cash for a pizza party. 
</P>
<P>
 Gittleman has seen how competition has fueled students' interest in economics 
during the three years the Stock Market Game has been played at St. Margaret's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most didn't know stocks from dividends, and now they're reading the Wall 
Street Journal every day," Gittleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Kelley, 17, and the rest of the class pretty much agreed: The Wall 
Street Game beats geometry class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's enjoyable," said Kelley, a senior. "My dad has investments, and we go 
over the business page to see how my stocks are doing. There's no pressure 
because it's pretend money." 
</P>
<P>
 Gittleman, a clothing retailer who volunteers to teach the class one day a 
week, decided to make economics class a hands-on experience when he started at 
St. Margaret's. 
</P>
<P>
 Gittleman wants his students to do well in the Stock Market Game, although he 
avoids passing out stock tips. What Gittleman doesn't want to do is create a 
class of Gordon Gekkos, the fictional symbol of Wall Street greed. Michael 
Douglas portrayed Gekko in the 1987 film "Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach business ethics," he said, "because business ethics is something you 
carry out into your life." FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COUNCIL BACKS BILLS ON LIQUOR LICENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week voted to support two bills in the state Legislature 
that would give state and local officials more power over granting liquor 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills, AS 2897 and AS 2742, would allow cities and the state's Alcohol 
Beverage Control board to consider how additional alcohol-selling 
establishments would affect neighborhoods that already have an 
over-concentration of bars, liquor stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Gwen Forsythe said that both pieces of legislation would give the 
concerns of residents more weight in the licensing process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us more guidelines to work with," Forsythe said. "It places limits 
on the overabundance of (liquor-selling establishments) in an area if they are 
proven to be detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
 Forsythe and other city officials have long argued that the Old Town district 
suffers from an over-concentration of bars and liquor-serving restaurants -- 
about 25 in the area around Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Town residents have complained that the establishments attract rowdy 
patrons who make loud noises at night and disrupt the peacefulness of the 
bedroom community. Merchants contend that such complaints are overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was the topic of several heated City Council meetings last year that 
dealt with an alcohol-selling restaurant's application to stay open later The 
application was eventually denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would classify Main Street as having an over-concentration," Forsythe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would not directly affect merchants who already hold liquor 
licenses, she said.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PLAN OF ACTION FOR BEES' ARRIVAL OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without fanfare, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved an Africanized 
honeybee action and response plan to deal with the arrival of the notorious 
creatures. The board unanimously approved the plan without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Public education about ways to live safely with bees is a major thrust of the 
27-page plan, which outlines roles for various county agencies in dealing with 
the bees. It caps about two years of preparation and work, similar to efforts 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan anticipates that private pest-control firms will respond to 
non-emergency requests to control bee colonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Vector control officials -- who will be responsible for a large part of the 
public information campaign -- say the aggressive bees can pose safety 
problems. But with education, people can safely cope with the bees, much like 
residents already do with rattlesnakes and black widow spiders. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 traps have been set locally to signal the arrival of the bees, which 
could reach Orange County by next winter. The so-called "killer bees," which 
have been the subject of fear since they were accidentally released from a 
breeding experiment in Brazil in 1957, have already been spotted in Texas, 
Arizona and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the bees more dangerous than the common European honeybee is that 
they will vigorously defend their hives, experts say. Both honeybees possess 
virtually the same venom and can only sting once, but Africanized bees are much 
more likely to swarm and attack if their colonies are disturbed. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; PIPELINE OPERATION AGREEMENT RENEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave preliminary approval this week to renew Shell Oil Co.'s 
franchise to operate an oil pipeline under Los Alamitos Boulevard and Cerritos 
Avenue. The city will receive $1,350 a year for the duration of the 15-year 
franchise and a onetime renewal fee of $2,500, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Shell Oil Co. will pay for street repairs and other damages to 
public properties that may be caused by the operation of the pipeline, which 
carries crude oil from Brea to refineries in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Thomas W. Allen said that the city has more protection under the 
new franchise agreement than before. The city received $50 a year in franchise 
fees under the old franchise agreement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said Shell Oil Co. will pay the city for environmental damage in case of 
leaks. He said the oil company has posted a $50,000 bond to assure compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider final approval of the franchise request on May 9.

COUNTY TO SPEND MORE TO BATTLE TUBERCULOSIS; HEALTH: SUPERVISORS OK 
$1.5-MILLION OUTLAY FOR ADDITIONAL WORKERS AT SCHOOLS, CLINICS AND JAILS. 
TESTING PROGRAM IS PLANNED AT SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the hope of preventing more local outbreaks of tuberculosis, the Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved spending an extra $1.5 million to 
help public health officials fight the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Health Care Agency will use the money to hire 33 more health 
workers for schools, clinics and jails. Health officials plan to test all 
first-time students from first grade through high school this fall and to open 
tuberculosis clinics across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1990 through 1993, the number of new cases of tuberculosis reported 
annually in the county increased 71%, from 258 to 440. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual midyear budget increase will strengthen the county's previous 
$5-million anti-tuberculosis program, which includes a 70-person staff. "The 
idea was to get started right away," Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley said. "This 
is certainly, in my opinion, one of the most important public health items that 
has come to the board since I've been on it. I'm really proud of the county 
staff for their ingenuity in getting this thing set up and moving in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Weismuller, the county's manager of disease control, said she was 
pleased that the board approved the funds without waiting for the usual budget 
process to take its course. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us the resources to move ahead and do a more effective job 
controlling this disease," she said. It will also allow health care workers to 
monitor more closely the treatment of people who are infected. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members previously had said they considered the program to be a top 
priority and were alarmed by the outbreak last year of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis at La Quinta High School in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 In that outbreak, active cases of the disease were diagnosed in 12 students, 
with all the cases linked to that of a 16-year-old girl. Federal officials 
later concluded that the outbreak at La Quinta was sparked by delayed diagnosis 
and inadequate treatment of the girl, whose disease was contagious for more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 An official with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has said that 
Orange County is among many public health care agencies throughout the nation 
surprised by the resurgence of the disease, which until the mid-1980s was 
thought to be on the brink of eradication. 
</P>
<P>
 The resurgence, officials say, is linked to a variety of factors, including 
more widespread poverty, increased immigration from countries where the disease 
remains endemic, and the AIDS epidemic, which leaves patients susceptible to 
TB.

1-DAY SICKOUT STRAINS SERVICES AT ORANGE SCHOOLS; LABOR: ACTION BY 900 
NON-TEACHING EMPLOYEES IDLES SCHOOL BUSES AS WELL AS AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS. 
UNION WANTS TO REOPEN CONTRACT TALKS WITH DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although classes went on as scheduled, about 900 non-teaching employees in the 
Orange Unified School District staged a one-day sickout Tuesday, virtually 
shutting down the school bus system and after-school programs as well as 
causing menu changes for its 26,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 While sickout participants are expected to return to work today, members of 
the California School Employees Assn. will meet tonight to discuss a strike. 
The union represents the district's 1,160 non-teaching employees, including bus 
drivers and food service, custodial and clerical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Union representatives hope Tuesday's sickout will pressure district officials 
to reopen talks about a controversial board-imposed contract, which went into 
effect April 10. The union has accused the district of unfair labor practices 
during negotiations. The contract cut health benefits, imposed furloughs and 
empowered the district to reduce hours or lay off workers without negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the district sees that it's not just leadership of CSEA, it's the 
rank-and-file," said union President Becky Mayers. "If they continue along this 
same line of not talking, then we are going to have to get the strike signs 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday afternoon, district officials said they had no intention of 
renegotiating the contract, and denied the district had treated the union 
unfairly during 11 months of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they approved the union contract to keep the 
cash-strapped school system solvent. The contract saved the district $484,000 
and helped close a $2.2-million shortfall in the district's $107-million 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district was well within legal requirements during negotiations," said 
Jack Elsner, head of district personnel. "I realize it's been frustrating for 
CSEA, but it's been frustrating for the district, too. They just have to face 
reality and realize it's not like it used to be, there isn't a big pot of money 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 District and union officials said Tuesday they will meet later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials say they called for the sickout after a key district 
negotiator failed to attend a meeting last Friday. But district officials say 
the union was informed the negotiator wasn't going to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has been bracing for a possible sickout or strike since early 
April when union membership authorized a job action. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the sickout, students normally accustomed to hot lunches were 
supplied cold ones instead, district officials reported. And many district-run 
child care facilities, which watch students before and after school hours, were 
unstaffed Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sickout's largest impact was felt by school bus riders, about 7,000 
students each day. District officials said most bused students made it to 
school Tuesday by getting rides from parents or neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely caused some inconvenience," said Cheryl Cohen, principal at 
Crescent Intermediate School, which buses the highest percentage of children to 
school in the district. "But there wasn't any service that we normally have 
that didn't get covered today." 
</P>
<P>
 At district headquarters, staff fielded about twice the usual volume of phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of questions, but not a lot of complaints," said 
interim Supt. Marilyn Corey. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has established an information number that provides instructions 
to parents on what to do in the event of another sickout or a strike. The 
number is (714) 532-6987.

'LAGUNA PRIDE' FESTIVAL GETS OK DESPITE SOME PROTEST; EVENT: OPPOSITION TO THE 
GAY AND LESBIAN 'BLOCK PARTY' ACTIVITIES SURFACED IN THE PAST WEEK OR SO. THE 
FESTIVITIES BEGIN FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a permit allowing activities 
related to the city's first gay and lesbian festival this weekend, while about 
a dozen irate residents voiced their objections.  
</P>
<P>
 "I truly feel this will cause a strong negative feeling against gays in this 
town," resident Sally Hales said. In particular, some residents objected to 
"block party" activities planned in the area of Mountain Road and South Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival itself will be held at the Festival of Arts grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 City approval is not needed for activities that take place on the festival 
grounds. However, event organizers had to get a temporary use permit to erect a 
tent in a liquor store parking lot and to allow food to be served in what is 
now an unused commercial space at the Coast Inn. Various exhibits will be 
displayed inside the tent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission unanimously granted the permit two weeks ago. But 
Councilman Robert F. Gentry appealed that approval so the City Council could 
consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Reilly, co-chairman of Laguna Outreach, the gay and lesbian community 
group organizing the event, said the action was a preemptive move to ensure 
that event opponents wouldn't file an appeal at the last minute. Had that 
happened, Reilly said, there would not have been enough time to schedule the 
hearing before the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to make sure that nobody can muck this up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, opposition to the event did not surface until the past week or so, 
when residents who live on the streets separating the Boom Boom Room and Little 
Shrimp -- gay bars between which most of the activities are expected to be held 
-- protested by handing in a petition to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation on our block is already way out of control," the group's letter 
says. "The last thing we need to have is 6,000 individuals come to our 
neighborhood for any event." 
</P>
<P>
 Problems in that area include drunkenness, trespassing and "lewd conduct," the 
letter says, adding that it is "ludicrous" for a block party to be staged by 
people who don't live on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Area residents took their opportunity Tuesday to object to an event they said 
could change Laguna Beach's image from an art community to what one resident 
called a "gay activities center." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry, however, praised the event and its organizers, who have taken pains to 
provide trolley service and additional police security for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you are bringing a great deal of credit to the city of Laguna Beach," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's staff has estimated that "Laguna Pride Weekend," which will begin 
Friday with a party at the Boom Boom Room, will draw up to 6,000 people. Flyers 
heralding the celebration have turned up in San Diego and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The block party amounts to advertised activities planned by area businesses, 
something the city does not regulate, city planner Ann Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The block party aspect of it we really can't control," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council had voted unanimously last month to endorse the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly has said the event will provide a boost for local businesses.

LOWERED RATING COULD AFFECT LAGUNA ART MUSEUM GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California Arts Council advisory panel has lowered its ranking of the Laguna 
Art Museum, where director Charles Desmarais was fired last month. The museum 
could receive a smaller state grant for fiscal 1994-95 as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking has been dropped from 3+ to 3 (of a possible 4), but the panel 
still considers the museum's status to be "good to excellent," said Scott Wm. 
Heckes, a program manager for the arts council. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, panelists are concerned about the firing and its possible 
effect on the museum's plans to hire a bilingual outreach coordinator and an 
assistant curator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those positions are typically hired by a director," Heckes said Tuesday, "and 
because there is no director in place, the panel questioned when it is going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Heckes also noted that the museum failed to notify the arts council of 
Desmarais' firing, but he said that was not a "serious infraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Panel rankings are a factor in determining grant amounts from the arts 
council. The museum received $12,325 last year and has requested $86,697 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's acting director, Susan M. Anderson, said Tuesday that an 
announcement may come this week or next week about the progress toward finding 
a new director. 
</P>
<P>
 At the full board meeting Tuesday night, a preliminary draft of desired 
qualities of the museum's next director, such as prior experience and "vision," 
was given to board members, who were asked to respond with suggestions by next 
week.

RELATIONSHIPS: BREAKING VOWS, BREAKING HABITS; WHEN A MARRIAGE ENDS, A PARTNER 
MAY HANG ON OUT OF OBLIGATION, FEAR, PASSION OR FRIENDSHIP. BUT GETTING OVER 
DIVORCE IS ESSENTIAL TO MOVING ON, SAY LOCAL THERAPISTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Boomerang love kept couples such as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton and, 
more recently, Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly from making permanent breaks 
after their divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 When a husband and wife begin to dissolve their marriage, going their separate 
ways can sometimes be so agonizing that one or both may cling to the other 
physically or emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Divorce is so painful, some people would prefer (to stay in) an unhealthy 
relationship" than to separate, explains Phil Hall, founder and director of the 
Centers for Psychological Growth and Development in Tustin, Anaheim Hills and 
Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is often plenty of pain in an unhealthy relationship, Hall says 
the difference in the severity of the pain between staying in a bad marriage 
and ending it, for some, is comparable to the difference in pain between a sore 
and a severed artery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sore doesn't heal, but a severed artery is life-threatening; that's what 
divorce feels like for many people," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, divorce is "the death of a relationship, and there is a mourning and a 
grieving time. As long as you hang on, you are not able to move through that 
process," says Linda Benson, a marriage, family and child counselor who 
practices in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging on to each other may stem from habit, passion, obligation or fear. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, as in the case with Jennifer (who asked, as did others in this 
story, that her real name not be used), companionship as comfortable as a worn 
slipper is the reason she can't break with her ex-husband.  
</P>
<P>
 The Corona del Mar resident says her relationship with her ex-husband, Darren, 
would probably mystify outsiders, but a deep bond holds them together. Though 
Jennifer has since become involved with someone else in the two years following 
their separation and filing for divorce, she continues to socialize with 
Darren. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual interests is her reason for keeping a less intimate form of their 
relationship alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see foreign films, concerts, things like that (that) my new (man) isn't as 
into," Jennifer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent developments -- Darren's beingdiagnosed with terminal cancer -- have 
shifted the relationship even more. Jennifer, who quit her job in September, 
has been at his bedside during her ex's ordeal, because Darren's family is in 
Europe. She was at his side for his chemotherapy treatments and plans to 
accompany him to Europe so he can say goodby to his family. She even purchased 
his airplane ticket with one of the couple's mutual credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved him; he's a very dear man," says Jennifer, who says the 
reason the marriage didn't survive is because he is 28 years older than she is. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes obligation and guilt serve as motivators for continued involvement 
in a former spouse's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven, who has been remarried for 11 years and lives in Tustin, called 
ex-wife Gloria after the January earthquake and offered to do extensive work on 
her San Fernando Valley house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often what happens is that the ex or separated husband will continue to act 
as the role of handyman, doing the jobs out of obligation. He may care about 
her welfare and in a limited way retain a small, familial part of the 
relationship, but he is no longer physically attracted to her because he is 
having his sexual needs met elsewhere," Benson says. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common tie that binds many divorced couples is children. 
</P>
<P>
 If a couple have children, "there will always be a connection between the two 
parents, especially if they have spent a third of their life or so with one 
another," says Linda Algazi, who has a psychology practice that includes 
marriage and family therapy in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family might assume that couples having trouble letting go may be 
candidates for reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa, a Newport Beach resident divorced since August, spent 25 years married 
to Bob. The two "tight friends" continue to run their family business together. 
"The love doesn't just go away, but since we still have the same problems, we 
both know that we just can't live together," Lisa says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the couple have identified problems and put forth the time and the effort 
to change their behavior, they have a chance of making it work," says Norman 
Wright, director of the Family Counseling & Enrichment Center in Tustin. 
Otherwise, it's important that people move on when the relationship is too 
impaired to be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the horse is dead, then it's time to stop beating it," says Bill Flanagan, 
a marriage, family and child counselor and single adult minister at St. Andrews 
Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan, whose biannual workshops have led 10,000 adults through divorce 
recovery since 1971, says healing is essential before people can move on to 
leading a full life.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning to let go means:  
</P>
<P>
 * Understanding the reality of the situation. "It's natural to deny or escape, 
but a person must wake up in the morning and assess his or her situation -- 
they are divorced or lonely or whatever -- instead of operating with a 'this is 
OK' superficiality," Flanagan says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dealing with the known and still-to-be-discovered effects of the divorce. 
"Someone needs to stand back in a position of emotional neutrality, to give 
perspective to people who are in the middle of the process," Flanagan says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overcoming obstacles to readjustment that crop up after the divorce. 
Sometimes a loss of order in a person's life becomes so unbearable he or she 
may seek out an ex-spouse for the sole purpose of trying to restore order, says 
Jim Head of the Mariposa Women's Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 * Making an emotional withdrawal from the marital relationship. This enables 
both people to feel comfortable reinvesting in another relationship. Once 
emotions and logistics are sorted out, spouses and children can move into a new 
kind of family, Benson says.

SMOKE SIGNALS; ACTIVISTS SOUND AN ALARM ABOUT YOUR WOMEN, MEDIA IMAGES AND 
TOBACCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the next few years, Lisa, a 17-year-old high school junior, will confront a 
series of milestones. In four years, she'll be able to walk into a bar and 
drink. In just a year, she'll be able to vote. And when she reaches that magic 
age of 18, Lisa will also be able to buy cigarettes legally. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that particular rite of passage doesn't mean much -- Lisa's been 
smoking since she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how terrible it is," she says emphatically. "I saw on some (TV) show 
all the stuff they put in it. It's terrible. They're death sticks." 
</P>
<P>
 But the looming possibility of chronic heart and lung disease is not enough to 
get Lisa, who asked that her real name not be used, to stop. Nor is the fact 
that her grandfather is in the hospital dying of lung cancer. Or that her 
father -- a surgeon -- offered her $10,000 to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Lisa: "You can't quit till you're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa's habit is shared by hundreds of thousands of girls nationwide who are 
spending their pre-adult years up in smoke. And that is alarming anti-smoking 
groups who don't want to see girls -- and young women -- succumb to pressure 
from tobacco companies, media images or their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-smoking camp sees red flags everywhere. One recent research report 
revealed that teen-age smoking in general is on the rise. Another found a link 
between cigarette advertising and smoking among teen-age girls. And still 
another suggests that women are more susceptible to lung cancer than men. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch-dog groups complain about recent portrayals of smoking in a variety of 
media. The already besieged Camel ad campaign, featuring the cartoon character 
Joe Camel, has come under more fire for featuring female Camels for the first 
time. Ads with beautiful, slim models touting thin cigarettes remain a focus of 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the popular movie "Reality Bites" has become a target because its young 
heroine, played by Winona Ryder, is a smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, teen-age girls and young women aren't the only concerns of health 
officials and anti-smoking camps -- they're concerned about everyone who might 
be susceptible to positive images of smoking.  
</P>
<P>
 But they are worried that when it comes to young women, tobacco companies are 
becoming more savvy about which buttons to push. And advertising, together with 
other influences, can make for a potent lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the powerful themes that the (tobacco) industry has used have been 
women's liberation, empowerment and the whole appeal to thinness," says 
research scientist Lloyd Johnston of the University of Michigan, who led a 
study of drug and tobacco use among high schoolers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the women's cigarettes are long and thin, the packs are long and 
thin, and the models are exceptionally long and thin. . . . Clearly there are 
different messages sent to the two sexes. For women, it's thinness and elegance 
and being liberated. For males, it's much more the macho or cool kind of image, 
self-contained, like the Marlboro man." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of young people and smoking has long fueled a volatile debate 
between anti-smokers and the tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first Camel ad that has these camel-ish-looking twiggy women 
cavorting in a nightclub, where the whole theme is 'Light Up the Night,' " says 
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Public Citizen's 
Health Research Group, the Ralph Nader-founded medical watchdog organization. 
"The idea is to lure young, impressionable teen-agers who want to look sexy and 
be socially accepted, and this is just the ticket for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco companies deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "(We) developed this campaign to change what had become adults' perception 
that Camel was a tired, old brand that their grandfather smoked," says Peggy 
Carter, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds, manufacturers of Camels. "We have, as 
with any ad campaign, tried to stay fresh with the audience to whom it's 
directed, which in our case is adult smokers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clare van de Mark, 15, started out as a "social smoker," having an occasional 
cigarette with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I just started smoking whenever. It wasn't like peer pressure. I was 
around it so much, it just grows on you. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends didn't even want me to start smoking," says the 10th-grader, who 
describes herself as a B-average student and "serious about my education." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'd ask my (older) friends to buy me cigarettes they'd say, 'You're too 
young to smoke.' But it was OK if they smoked. They were kind of protective. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my friends quit and that was fine," adds Clare, who lives in the San 
Fernando Valley. "We all supported her, it was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not even cool anymore," she admits. "It's looked down upon in society. 
It's not even trendy anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But smoking does seem to be picking up among high schoolers, according to a 
1994 report from the University of Michigan. Scientists, led by Lloyd Johnston 
at the school's Institute for Social Research, found that although smoking 
rates had been steady for nearly a decade, they've increased about 2% in the 
past year for high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Johnston: "I do think that the massive ads for cigarettes are effective 
in getting young people to start smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 And even if most young women's magazines, such as Seventeen and Sassy, don't 
carry tobacco ads, he says, teen-agers will see them while looking through 
Mademoiselle, Vogue and Cosmo. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong link between cigarette smoking and advertising was recently reported 
in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. Researchers found that about 1967, 
there was a marked increase in girls 17 and younger starting to smoke -- the 
same time cigarette ads targeted to women began to appear. The numbers peaked 
about 1973, declining as information about the harmful effects of smoking was 
pumped at the masses. But the study is considered significant for discovering a 
correlation between gender-specific ads and smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco companies have long denied that they're chasing after the youth 
market. They cite statistics saying that advertising doesn't encourage 
teen-agers to start smoking, such as a 1992 Journal of School Health report 
stating that the major reasons for 10th-graders beginning to smoke were 
curiosity, social norms and peer pressure -- not advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Carter of R.J. Reynolds: "To direct (the Joe Camel campaign) at a youth 
market would indeed be the dumbest thing we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Karen Daragan of Philip Morris, makers of Virginia Slims, "Not only do we 
not market toward teens, but advertising and promotion is not effective in 
influencing people to smoke. It can help people choose a brand if they already 
smoke, and it can enhance brand recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about such brands as Virginia Slims, Capri and Misty that use 
powerful images of young, thin, attractive, vibrant women? An ad for Capri 
Ultra Lights says they're "the super slim that's surprisingly rich." And Misty 
cigarettes are "fashionably inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco company marketing campaigns go beyond selling cigarettes. Virginia 
Slims has its V-Wear catalogue of chic clothes (leather jackets, vests) that 
can be bought only with proofs-of-purchase (Daragan says the items are 
available to smokers 21 or older, and participants must sign a form stating 
that). The brand also sponsors tennis tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Sarna, a registered nurse and assistant professor at UCLA's School of 
Nursing, takes these ads to task for emphasizing glamour and slimness. 
</P>
<P>
 The images become "insidious. It's part of the fabric of our society and it's 
difficult to escape." 
</P>
<P>
 And it doesn't help, she adds, that many young women view smoking as a way to 
stay thin and fear that if they stop, they'll gain an enormous amount of 
weight.  
</P>
<P>
 "I see the public's general thinking is that the lower weight is a better 
health advantage than not smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Lisa, who smokes Marlboros, cigarette ads are "just another page in the 
magazine." 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw another thing on TV about how Camel cigarettes are attractive to teens 
. . . maybe that's true for younger kids, but not for my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she started smoking, she has found few obstacles in buying cigarettes 
from neighborhood liquor and convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had this 18-year-old live-in baby-sitter from Australia. She smoked, and I 
thought she was the coolest thing -- I even dressed like her. One day I asked 
her for a cigarette -- she just gave it to me. I used to sneak into her room to 
smoke. She left a year later, and by that time I was smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa's father "flipped out" when Lisa told him. "My mother, who smokes 
occasionally, didn't believe me until I pulled out a pack of cigarettes from my 
purse and smoked it. She goes, 'Oh my God,' and that's all she really said." 
</P>
<P>
 But her parents still encourage her to stop -- witness the ten grand cash 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what happens from smoking," says Lisa, who lives in Los Angeles. "My 
dad has taken me to the hospital and shown me pictures of lungs from people who 
have smoked. And I saw my grandfather in the hospital hooked up to all these 
machines. But the only time I see myself quitting is when I plan to have 
children, and that's not going to be for a while. I'm addicted." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why anti-smoking groups aren't just attacking advertising. They are 
also scrutinizing smoking on television and in movies. Their latest target is 
the film "Reality Bites" -- specifically, the Winona Ryder character, a new 
college grad and neophyte video director who smokes up a storm throughout the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's think about the larger message," says Susan Swimmer, fitness, food and 
features editor of Seventeen magazine. "I'm in no way suggesting some form of 
censorship, but I think those of us who are sending a larger message have a 
responsibility. She could have smoked five cigarettes (Swimmer counted 15 
smoking scenes). I think they went a little overboard. I'm not saying smokers 
don't exist, but it would be as believable to not have them smoke. That was the 
choice they made, and I think it was the wrong choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Time magazine said of the film: "Winona Ryder in 'Reality Bites' showed that 
among Generation X, smoking is cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's screenwriter, Helen Childress, takes exception to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought something like this might happen," says Childress, who wrote the 
movie while a student at USC a few years ago. "I thought people might get a 
little put off by that character trait. (She says that Ryder herself doesn't 
smoke.) That's kind of the reality, though. Half the people I know do smoke, 
and it's not that big of a deal. It's like, no one cares. . . . I wasn't doing 
it to make her cool or a bad role model. It was just because I smoke when I 
write, and I just put that in. I was making an honest documentation of what was 
going on around me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know smoking's bad, and hey -- I want to quit," she adds. "I certainly 
wasn't trying to win over smokers." 
</P>
<P>
 If they tune out advertising, both Clare and Lisa are keenly aware of the 
much-publicized health risks that go along with smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Clare says her mother made her write a four-page report on the effects of 
smoking. Although she calls the project "a very big pain in the butt," she did 
learn about links between smoking, cancer and heart disease; the effects of 
secondhand smoke, and about additives in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It freaked me out," she says, "and it did make me think about quitting 
because it made me sad about what may happen later on. I know I'm not going to 
smoke when I get married, and when I have kids, I'm definitely quitting. . . . 
When I first started smoking, I got bronchitis and I quit for a month after 
that. But I haven't been sick at all this past year. My friends and I are 
really healthy, we eat well, take vitamins, and smoking is the one thing we do 
to ourselves that's bad." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's difficult for Clare to focus on the distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you read about something like (cancer), you don't really apply it to 
yourself. This is going to happen to another person, and it's hard for me to 
think about getting lung cancer and dying of it. You can't live in paranoid 
fear of cancer -- we do live in L.A. and we have smog. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan on smoking for the rest of my life, just until I get sick of it. 
Maybe that's unrealistic, but it works for me." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Sarna would like young women to think about the future -- long and 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of attention in the media on breast cancer, which is 
well-deserved," she says, "but (in recent years) lung cancer has become the No. 
1 cause of cancer-related deaths in women. If you look at the current health 
publications for women, you'll find there's almost nothing about the negative 
effects of smoking or about lung cancer. If they do, they'll talk about fetal 
risk -- but most women are not pregnant most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Women may even be more susceptible to lung cancer than men, according to a 
recent report out of the Yale University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Harvey Risch found that men who smoked about a pack of cigarettes a day 
for about 40 years had a risk of contracting lung cancer that was nine times 
higher than the rate of male nonsmokers. But female smokers' risk was 27 times 
the rate of female nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are inconclusive, although Risch speculates that a woman's 
disadvantage might be her slightly smaller lung capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be a cross-country runner," Lisa says. "I could run a pretty good 
mile in about six or seven minutes. At the end of last year I tried it -- no 
way. It took me about 10 minutes. I have chronic bronchitis, and of course, 
it's directly from smoking. It does scare me. But I smoke more than the times I 
really think about it."

FALL BUYERS CAN BE CHOOSERS

<P>
 California designers are mad about suspenders, plaids, aprons, snug little 
jackets and sweaters, fanny-grazing skirts, boot-topping skirts, pants, berets 
and vests. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also mad about faux fur, earth tones, long cardigan jackets, 
over-the-knee stockings, flowing white shirts, updated peacoats, shiny 
surfaces, hot pants, fanciful layering and melding patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, fall fashion, as seen on Los Angeles runways last weekend, is a mix 
master's dream and a reminder that, in a time of designer options, consumers 
have a choice -- to be fashionably conservative or wildly creative. Both 
extremes surfaced in a round of shows staged by the California Mart and the New 
Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Variety Arts Center Saturday night, Van Buren designers Maggie Barry 
and Ty Moore proved once again that they can dish up degrees of pizazz. First 
on the runway after a confidence-building preamble by Mayor Richard Riordan 
("People look to L.A. for what's exciting, what's new, what's next"), their 
collection included an itty-bitty three-piece leather aviatrix suit. Patterned 
leggings and high-vamped suede shoes made its fanny-grazing skirt more 
wearable. In contrast, a black Lycra gown trimmed with red patent-leather 
panels and suspenders dazzled without revealing too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening wear was in short supply and notable for its understated sex appeal. 
Theresa McAllen for Antony Moorcroft showed a tiny slip dress with spaghetti 
straps and a thin row of top and bottom lace. It was worn with two fall musts 
-- black thigh-high stockings and shiny black lace-up ankle boots. From Rated 
R/Biya came a stunning long black sleeveless dress banded in satin from knee to 
hem. The next night, its designer, Biya Ramar, wore the dress as street wear, 
with clunky boots and a jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ramar is any indication, boot-topping dresses and skirts will be back on 
the streets this fall. Vying for importance with very short dresses, they swept 
across four stages and came from such designers as David Dart and Tatiana Ruda, 
who showed at the New Mart. Dart's long, slim shadow floral in black on mocha 
was soft, simple and starkly dramatic. The Tiar collection by Ruda had its own 
brand of drama, including a long dress in distressed, uneven layers of khaki 
rayon, topped with a black crocheted tunic. 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa McAllen, this time as designer for Johnny Was, combined a long, 
slim-line flax-colored dress with a contrasting plaid apron and a black 
velveteen jacket. Janice Levin for Poleci showed a long, side-tied, 
slate-colored pinafore dress over a matching cropped, ribbed-jersey top that 
doubled as a jacket. And L. Bates showed one of the more sophisticated versions 
of long and lean. Her fitted wool-gabardine jacket in plum was worn over a 
sailor-front, flared skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Clayden's classy collection featured exquisite panne velvet tunics, 
coats and scarfs floating over long black chiffon dresses -- or pants. For 
women tired of the up-down skirt issue, pants from Clayden and others could be 
the answer. The freshest shapes are slim but not tight, often in wheat-colored 
tweeds or one of the browns, from faded bark to mocha. They hit the ankle or 
slightly above, with and without cuffs, to reveal short boots. 
</P>
<P>
 In a big season for knits, Chatillon's Anna Dodet used French acrylics for a 
collection of sexy jumpers, shorts, little dresses, jackets and flared skater 
skirts. Daniel Norzagaray for Cielo showed the requisite cropped sweater, worn 
in layers: over a white T-shirt and under a jacket as long as the super-short 
skater-style skirt underneath. The outfit appeared in a favorite combo of wheat 
and white. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby-doll silhouette lives on as a knit, looking sophisticated and 
versatile in the hands of Misc. designer Janet Howard, who offered a ribbed 
cotton version in forest green. She also reworked the vest, turning it into a 
short jacket to wear over a swing dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's golden consumer rule is simple: "Not to make the clothes look like 
the '80s. I don't see short with suntan nylons and high heels." Howard pictures 
her short dresses and skirts worn over seamed leggings, textured tights, even 
pants.

'90S FAMILY; THE PREGNANCY ZONE; A WOMAN WHO'S EXPECTING A BABY CAN LOOK 
FORWARD TO DREAMS FILLED WITH BEASTS, DISASTERS AND WATER, WATER AND MORE 
WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By day, Sharon Cordero was a picture of pregnant bliss. This was a planned 
baby. She was eager to be a new mother. She even escaped pregnancy's usual dose 
of emotional zig-zagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the long night came. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dreams were really hectic, fast, jumbled. They were awful nightmares. But 
I couldn't remember what happened. Maybe I didn't want to remember what it 
was," said Cordero of West Hollywood, now the mother of a healthy infant boy. 
"It was so jumbled. It was like a piece of old television film. You know how 
old movies break and sputter? It was like that." 
</P>
<P>
 In short, it was normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnancy dreams are among the strangest women experience, says psychologist 
Patricia Maybruck, author of "Pregnancy and Dreams" (Tarcher, 1989). Typically, 
they are filled with a parade of animals, half-animal babies, death scenes, 
burglars, blood, natural disasters, philandering mates -- and water, water and 
more water. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are different from those of any other group of women. They are very 
bizarre and vivid. And they are nightmarish," said Maybruck, who lives leads 
dream study groups in St. Helena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 As if morning sickness and bloated ankles weren't enough. But this bit of 
weirdness has a purpose, dream scholars say. Dreams open doors to the murky 
subconscious, where people bury worries and fears they don't want to face in 
the light of day. Pregnancy intensifies the emotional and mental cross-fire. 
Frans Bauer, a dream scholar and lecturer at Loyola Marymount University, 
considers that a gift of free therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because dreams are so vivid during pregnancy, that's the time that people 
become aware that dreams have something useful to say to them, which is 
actually always the case," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they are so important, why don't the dreams get to the point? Too 
often, the dreams are puzzling mixes of "Twilight Zone" scripts and Stephen 
King tales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so focused in our thinking, we can see things only one way (while 
awake)," Bauer said. "It's only through symbols that the enormity of the event 
can be expressed. Normal language is limiting."  
</P>
<P>
 The language of pregnancy dreams at least is relatively predictable, said 
Maybruck, who analyzed 1,000 dreams of 70 pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, she won't assign universal meanings to common dream images and 
themes. But pregnant women's dreams are strikingly similar because pregnancy 
spawns similar concerns, feelings and experiences, Maybruck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus enter the animals. First to arrive in early pregnancy are the bunnies, 
kittens and puppies. Gradually the fuzzy-wuzzies give way to bigger, bouncier 
critters until the third trimester, when women often dream of giving birth to 
lions and tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal images usually relate to how a woman views the growing fetus, Maybruck 
said. The untamed beasts arrive when the mother feels ponderous and may be 
anxious about the impending responsibility of managing a newborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Architecture and plants routinely appear and represent the woman's growing 
body, Maybruck said. Like the animals, they gain stature as the pregnancy 
progresses, evolving from houses and vines to skyscrapers and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the third trimester, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is a frequent one if you 
can believe it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the water. Overflowing toilets and washing machines fill the 
night picture in the first trimester. By the end of the pregnancy, the 
mother-to-be might wake feeling as if she has floated down a placid river or 
ridden out a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
 And the reason is? Amniotic fluid, Maybruck said. Swiss psychoanalyst Carl 
Jung also found water to be a universal dream symbol for creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Vergilio of Canyon Lake found water dreams to be a wild ride. Her son is 
10, but the memories of her seagoing pregnancy dreams are as vivid as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a whale migrating. I was one in a pod. I remember raising myself up to 
breathe and going back down. I was experiencing breathing without breathing 
through my nose or mouth. We were migrating somewhere. I remember the coldness 
of the water, the roll of the ocean," Vergilio said. "It was the only 
non-nightmare. I remember a very nice feeling about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her dreams were hellish scenes of holocaust, concentration camps, 
fires, disasters and breathless running. In retrospect, she attributes them to 
the breakup of her first marriage and money worries. At the time, she said, her 
days were too full to give her nocturnal woes much attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Women would be wise to heed nightmares, said Brea hypnotherapist Sandra Dileo, 
who specializes in self-hypnosis as a relaxation technique for childbirth. 
Nightmares are often clues to what anxieties a woman needs to discuss with her 
partner, nurse-midwife or physician. Secondly, she can change them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say, 'In my dreams tonight I will be more aware that it is a dream and I will 
be able to either leave it or create a positive outcome,' " Dileo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider it a dress rehearsal that just might help in the end. Maybruck found 
that women who were most assertive in their dreams had shorter labors. Women 
who educated themselves early about pregnancy, labor and delivery were able to 
allay at least some of their worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once women are really confident about the pregnancy and delivery, their 
dreams will change," Maybruck said. "Then they begin to have these incredible, 
beautiful dreams. Some women dream they are in the womb swimming around with 
the baby. For some, they're just beautiful dreams, almost spiritual dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how emotionally, physically and mentally ready women are to give 
birth, their childbirth dreams aren't likely to ever match the jolly scenes 
fathers can dream up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expectant fathers' dreams are quite similar to their wives," she said. 
"Except for their delivery dreams. They often dream of movie stars coming in to 
congratulate them with cigars and champagne. Mothers never have those dreams."

 Marriage Rights: If Assembly Bill 3130 becomes law, California brides and 
grooms will be hearing "congratulations," "best wishes" and "here are your 
rights under law." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Alhambra) says that because too many couples 
go into marriage with only a vague idea of what it all means, she has proposed 
a marriage brochure to be distributed by county clerks to all couples applying 
for a marriage license, starting June 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochure would cover state law on such topics as domestic violence, 
spousal rape, community and separate property, spousal support, child custody 
and support, and premarital agreements. Women will learn how changing their 
last names may affect their credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds as if Martinez is raining on their wedding, the legislator notes 
that two-thirds of all first marriages end in divorce in California. Many women 
suing for divorce cite domestic violence as a major complaint, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, most couples have less information about getting married than they 
do about buying a car, Martinez says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we expect couples to live up to the rights and responsibilities of the 
marriage contract, the least we can do is let them know what those duties are," 
she says.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed bill's first hearing is scheduled Thursday before the Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Although they may be growing in number, women who call the 
family's investment shots are still far from the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women in general -- but married women in particular -- are more involved with 
day-to-day finances than they are with investment decisions. But that will 
change," says Bridget A. Macaskill, president of the New York-based Oppenheimer 
Management Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationwide survey of 2,021 adults, the company found that 60% of the 
women who were married or living with someone were solely responsible for 
balancing the checkbook, 56% paid the bills and 38% were responsible for 
developing and maintaining the family budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,018 women surveyed, 90% said investing is not a man's job -- and 85% 
of the 1,003 men surveyed agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 17% of the women handled the insurance and 12% were solely 
responsible for making investments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playing at Sports: Sports participation among children should be adapted to 
both age and gender to prevent injury and to continue to foster a healthy 
enjoyment of the game, says Dr. Gerard Varlotta, a professor at New York 
University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Age especially is an important factor in helping a child enjoy sports. A child 
younger than 8, for example, is generally not skilled enough to be involved in 
a strict regimen of sports training, Varlotta says. 
</P>
<P>
 And instead of making sports activity a competition, he adds, emphasis should 
be placed on "free" playtime as well as having a child play at his or her own 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to limit any bodily contact in sports played by very young 
children. Contact not only increases the potential for injury, but also boosts 
the odds that any injuries sustained will be the more serious types.

'90S FAMILY; EVERY PICTURE TELLS HER TALE; AUTHOR-ILLUSTRATOR JAN BRETT THINKS 
CHILDREN'S STORIES SHOULD RING WITH OPTIMISM -- AND ANCIENT LEGENDS ARE A GOOD 
PLACE TO START. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outdoors one summer day at Tanglewood, the off-season home of the Boston 
Symphony Orchestra, Jan Brett began fixating on the double bass her husband, 
Joe Hearne, was playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett, Hearne and his double bass had been cohabiting happily for years. But 
it was only at that moment that Brett realized, "Something could fit right 
inside." She studied the carved "F" holes on the front of the tall stringed 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have to be a small something," she decided. A mouse? A caterpillar? 
Music does that, Brett reflected. "It leads one's thoughts to interesting 
places." 
</P>
<P>
 Her thoughts led her to create "Berlioz the Bear," the children's story about 
a band of ursine musicians in a quaint Bavarian village that was published in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As a testimony to the humor that binds Brett and Hearne, the artist freely 
admits she "took off Joe's glasses and mustache," lengthened his nose, and used 
him as the model for Berlioz. As a mark of the respect Hearne has for his 
wife's work, he was thrilled to be immortalized -- albeit as a bear. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of dozens of exquisitely illustrated titles Brett has produced, many 
of which have appeared on "best children's books" roundups. In 1990, "The Wild 
Christmas Reindeer" even enjoyed a sojourn on The New York Times' hardcover 
fiction bestseller list -- normally an adults-only distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair met 15 years ago when Brett signed up for flying lessons and Hearne 
turned out to be her instructor. Divorced and raising her daughter, Lia, on her 
own, Brett was on the verge of mega-success as an author and illustrator of 
books for young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett, 44, finds her professional trajectory unsurprising. A shy child, she 
had trouble verbalizing her feelings. "But put a piece of paper in front of me, 
and everything came right out," she recalled. By kindergarten, she was 
determined to be an illustrator. As a student at the Boston Museum School, 
Brett haunted the city's venerable Museum of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 She also steeped herself in fables -- the timeless tales from around the world 
that remain her preferred vehicle of storytelling. Leave divorce, death and 
dysfunction to others, Brett reasons. Her imagination functions best "set back 
in time," and in a place where optimism reigns. For the thousands of young 
readers who write to her each year, Brett has found, her message of hope serves 
as a channel of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing from ancient legends and traditions, Brett scrupulously researches 
her stories. To ensure accurate adaptation of the tale that became "The 
Mitten," for instance, she hired a Ukrainian woman to translate the eight 
versions of the legend that turned up at the Harvard University library. For 
additional verisimilitude, Brett visited a Ukrainian neighborhood in New York 
City, memorizing the tiny details that win plaudits in her books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feather-by-feather" precision is how critic Phyllis Theroux praised Brett for 
her remarkable border drawings and thoroughly believable central stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Why children's books? Brett, with her mop of blond hair and her clear-eyed 
view of the planet, paused not one second. "It's just that that's the way my 
art looks," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett and Hearne journey the globe relentlessly. In turn, both translate the 
teachings of their travels into their work. A forthcoming Brett book about an 
armadillo and a girl named Harmony Jane, as one example, was inspired by a 
Boston Symphony Orchestra trip to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in this Colonial village not far from Plymouth Rock, they share their 
home with Perky Pumpkin, a Siberian husky who frequently appears in her books. 
Life is calm, manageable -- and for the most part, exactly as Brett imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that has happened is what I expected," said Brett, living proof, 
apparently, that wishing can make it so. There was just a breath of hesitation. 
"Except that I always thought I would win all kinds of awards, and not make 
very much money." Brett, with a gigantic smile, laughed. "It turned out the 
other way around."

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; TELL KIDS THE SOBER TRUTH ON DRUG PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Did you take drugs when you were a kid?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question unique to this generation of children and parents. Maybe, like 
many baby boomers, you tried marijuana in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you gave it up as you matured. Or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, you have a variety of concerns for your children: Marijuana is more 
potent now and kids are tempted to try it at younger ages. They might get 
addicted or arrested. Drug-related short-term memory loss might threaten their 
academic success. If they try LSD, they might experience permanent vision 
problems. And on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you want to do the right thing, you want to set an example, and you don't 
know whether to lie, tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth or 
something in between.  
</P>
<P>
 Victor Strasburger, author of "Getting Your Kids to say 'No' in the '90s When 
You Said 'Yes' in the '60s," recommends "something in between." 
</P>
<P>
 Lying doesn't work, the Albuquerque pediatrician said, because children have 
built in lie detectors and can spot parents lying just as swiftly as parents 
can spot them. The complete truth is also a risk for those with a long list of 
gory details to relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids can either learn from parents' mistakes, or say to themselves, "If mom 
and dad did that, why shouldn't I?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One San Francisco father -- a successful computer software entrepreneur -- had 
dropped acid at the Fillmore in the '60s and decided that he did not want his 
son to do the same. But when he told him, the son replied: "You used it and 
you're a success. What's wrong with me doing it?" The son did understand, 
however, that he would be expelled from his private school for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a phenomenon of generational forgetting. Young people have 
to relearn the lessons of the '60s all over again," said David Smith, founder 
and director of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic. To show them just how bad acid 
trips can get, he periodically takes teen-agers to rock concerts with his 
medical unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Strasburger said what parents need to remember when confronting the truth of 
their youthful past is that kids are not snooping, nor trying to make them 
hypocrites when they ask about their sexual or drug past. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're asking for advice about what they should do. That's the question you 
should primarily respond to."  
</P>
<P>
 Much depends on the parents' basic relationship with the child, begun years 
earlier, and their pursuit of ongoing, honest communication (within limits), he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, parents who use drugs have zero credibility in trying to 
dissuade their children from using. On the other hand, some parents are 
resigned to their children's youthful experimentation with substances.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One mother, a 38-year-old postal worker who has gradually stopped using the 
drugs she took in her 20s, believes that fear-based prevention programs only 
serve to make children more curious about drugs. She said she tried a more 
sincere version of her own parents' line; i.e. "If you're going to do it, do it 
here at home," but found that it backfired with her 18-year-old son.  
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, she found him growing five plants at home. "He was going to 
do it for his own personal use so that he would not have to buy any more, which 
really made sense to me," she said. "Then I went, wait a second. It's against 
the law." Almost all his friends knew. Any one of them might inform on him for 
any number of reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 She cut down the plants and instituted a new house rule: No growing allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents do not have to feel like hypocrites for asking their children to do as 
they say, not as they did, Strasburger said. Perhaps for the first time in 
history, parents can get away with telling their children that times have 
changed -- because they have. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it's not necessary to go overboard if kids experiment once 
with marijuana, Strasburger said. "As a pediatrician, I have to tell parents 
that the single deadliest drug by far, overwhelmingly, is alcohol, and that's 
the drug you need to worry about."

CHEFS SHARE THEMSELVES AND FEAST ON THE FUN

<P>
 Proving that too many cooks don't spoil a marathon gourmet dinner, Orange 
County's leading chefs donned their aprons and whipped up an exotic feast to 
raise money for OrangeAid, the Share Our Selves Kitchen Project. 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 250 attended the gastronomic affair at the Robert Mondavi 
Wine and Food Center in Costa Mesa. The $150-per-person benefit was one of many 
"Taste of the Nation" fund-raisers held across the country and staged by Share 
Our Strength, a national nonprofit group in Washington, D.C., to raise money 
for local hunger programs. The gala raised $103,000, with 80% of proceeds 
earmarked for the Share Our Selves food kitchen in Costa Mesa and the rest to 
fight hunger nationwide. A Meal to Remember 
</P>
<P>
 For food lovers, the SOS dinner was a rare opportunity to sample the creations 
of 17 chefs in one evening. 
</P>
<P>
 This year organizers expanded the dinner and invited nine chefs to prepare 
hors d'oeuvres and desserts to be served in the center's garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile back in the kitchen, eight chefs were busy preparing the four-course 
dinner while jovially drinking red wine and poking fun at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are competitors by trade, "all that goes out the window 
tonight," said Michael Kang, owner of Five Feet, who helped coordinate the 
chefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners found each course to be a work of art. Kang and Ted Gray of the Newport 
Meat Co. prepared a "volcano of pork with black spiders" made from a 
hollowed-out mango with squid ink pasta cut into floral shapes. Alan Greeley of 
the Golden Truffle and Claude Koeberle of the Ritz created a smoked lobster in 
a "Bloody Mary Cascade" sauce and served in a seashell. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Rassinoux, chef of the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, and John 
McLaughlin of J.W.'s at the Anaheim Marriott prepared roulade of herb-marinated 
monkfish with bean ragout. Sarah Scott of the Mondavi center and Jean Pierre 
Lemanissier of Antoine at Le Meridien in Newport Beach made roasted quail with 
coconut rice. 
</P>
<P>
 As further evidence of the chefs' goodwill, they also donated the food for the 
dinner. Feeding the Hungry 
</P>
<P>
 OrangeAid was formed in 1991 by a group of restaurateurs, caterers, hoteliers, 
food suppliers and other volunteers to obtain food and build a kitchen for 
Share Our Selves. SOS solicits food, often leftovers from restaurants and 
manufacturers, and distributes it to the hungry in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get 400 requests a day for food from families and homeless people," said 
Karen McGlinn, director of Share Our Selves, who served as event co-chairman 
with her husband, John. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the dinner will go to the SOS kitchen, which processes and 
packages the food and will also be the site of classes taught by local chefs 
and others in the food industry. The classes will focus on nutrition and skills 
to help the needy find work in the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
 John Martin, chief executive officer of Taco Bell, was honored for his 
company's contributions to SOS. Taco Bell matched the evening's ticket proceeds 
dollar for dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael (Kang) made me aware that in affluent Orange County there are a lot 
of people who go to bed every night without food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin endured some good-natured jabs for the brouhaha surrounding Taco Bell's 
possible move to Texas. After informing guests that Martin enjoys riding his 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle, Karen McGlinn presented him with an OrangeAid 
motorcycle jacket that "doesn't allow him to cross the border of Orange County 
without getting a severe shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd included Frank and Jean Forbath, Share Our Selves 
founders; Bill and Ann Lusk, Mary Dell Barkouras, Mike and Lauri Mendenhall, 
Max Wood, Kathy Power, Kevin McQuarrie, Tom and Mary Catherine Payne, Clare 
Scarborough, Margarette Woodard, Harold and Lisa Hofer, Bob Chamberlain, Hal 
and Kay Rosoff, Will Rosoff and Linda Schilling, David Keefe, Wendy King Boyd, 
Wade Perry, Allen and Nancy Hubbell, Gene and Vivian Levin and Kathy Thompson. 
In addition, chefs in charge of appetizers were: Todd Clore, Carlito Jocson, 
Susan Kaitz, Jack Kalustian, Dan Marcheano, Michael Philippi, Paul 
Squicciarini, Nina Taweepong and Michael Waugh. KATHRYN BOLD

RELATIONSHIPS: GETTING HELP TO BEGIN TO LET GO

 If separated couples or individuals decide that therapy would be helpful in 
dissolving their relationship, care should be exercised in selecting 
professional services. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three types of help available: that provided by trained doctors, 
nurses and psychologists, available through individual counseling or group 
therapy; self-help groups facilitated by trained volunteers, and volunteers 
supported by professionals at a religious or mental-health institution. 
</P>
<P>
 In selecting one of these, consider the following criteria: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask for credentials and referrals from former clients when considering a 
therapist. Also ask family or friends for referrals, especially those who have 
gone through divorce counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure the professional or volunteer facilitator specializes in divorce 
recovery. Specialized counseling that may be beneficial for divorce survivors 
include anger, blended families, co-dependent relationships, forgiveness, grief 
therapy, single parenting and sexual dysfunctions and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gain an understanding of the goals the counselor sets out to achieve. "In 
Orange County, so many recovery programs offer almost no incentives for 
reconciliation, so very often there isn't any incentive to pursue it," says 
Phil Hall, founder and director of the Centers for Psychological Growth and 
Development in Tustin, Anaheim Hills and Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be afraid to switch therapists if results are not consistent with your 
goals. Says one Huntington Beach divorcee: "I went through four different 
people before I was able to make the decision to separate and divorce." CINDY

SOLEMN RITES MARK THE RETURN OF NIXON'S BODY TO CALIFORNIA; SERVICES: 
MILES-LONG LINE OF MOURNERS WHO WAITED HOURS IN RAIN BEGINS PASSING THE 
FLAG-DRAPED CASKET AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN YORBA LINDA, WHERE THE 
FUNERAL WILL BE HELD TODAY.

 On a sodden Tuesday afternoon, the remains of Richard Nixon were returned to 
California for burial today in a plot beside his boyhood home. 
</P>
<P>
 After simple ceremonies at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station and at the Richard 
Nixon Library & Birthplace, a slow-moving, miles-long line of mourners -- the 
people the former President called the Silent Majority -- began filing past the 
flag-draped mahogany coffin. Some had been waiting six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 19 years, eight months and 17 days ago that Nixon, aboard the same 
blue-and-white presidential jet bearing the tail number 27000, crossed the 
continent to return in disgrace from the shambles of Watergate to the 
sheltering shores of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the ceremonial presidency that the Nixon White House used so 
effectively as a political tool was returned to the 37th President of the 
United States for one last time: "Ruffles and Flourishes," "Hail to the Chief," 
21-gun salutes and military honor guards dressed up the nation's farewell to 
the only chief executive to resign his office. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose roles in the 
national political arena were born in the angry heat of the 1972 presidential 
campaign and the impeachment proceedings against Nixon, will lead the mourners 
at the 4 p.m. state funeral, to which 1,800 people have been invited. 
Afterward, Nixon will be interred next to his wife, Pat, who died last June. 
Nixon died Friday of complications from a stroke at the age of 81. 
</P>
<P>
 If today's ceremony belongs to the dignitaries, Tuesday's brought the 
solemnity of the presidency -- and the death of a President -- to the people 
who put Nixon in office, first as a young member of Congress, then as a 
senator, then twice as vice president and twice as President before the 
Watergate scandal forced him into political retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderclaps rang out, then rain began to fall, a drizzle at first and then a 
steady drenching rain, just before the short motorcade bearing the former 
President's body arrived at the library about 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Billy Graham, long a friend of the Nixon family, and Ron Walker, a 
personnel executive who worked as a chief advance man for the Nixon White 
House, emerged from the library's portico at the arrival of the motorcade: a 
California Highway Patrol car, two black sedans, a hearse flying U.S. flags 
from both front fenders, and two more limousines, the first bearing Nixon's 
daughters, their husbands and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Solemn-faced, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower greeted Graham and 
then stood quietly as an honor guard from the five military services eased the 
coffin from the hearse. Eight members of the guard unit carried it up the steps 
to the library's glass front doors, past scores of reporters and photographers 
in an area cordoned off with velvet ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the public stood to the side, in near silence as the procession 
moved, measured step by measured step, into the library. The coffin was 
followed by Mrs. Cox and her husband, Edward, accompanied by Graham. Behind 
them walked David and Mrs. Eisenhower, followed by Nixon's two grandsons and 
two granddaughters. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred yards to the east, workers had set up grandstands for the funeral. 
On Tuesday, they prepared the speakers' platform, covered in green, all-weather 
carpeting. The backdrop is the small, white, clapboard house in which Nixon was 
born on Jan. 9, 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people had stood in line for several hours to view the coffin. 
Just as the line began to inch forward, hail started to fall. Lively chatter 
tapered off into silence as the mourners moved closer to the coffin, a large 
photograph of the smiling former President looking down on the scene, just 
above a large display of red roses. Scores of other flower arrangements of 
every color decorated the lobby, where the coffin was placed. 
</P>
<P>
 The mourners, behind a velvet cordon, paused no more than a second or two and 
then moved along. A five-member honor guard, from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, 
Air Force and Coast Guard, stood guard, three on one side of the coffin, two on 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the mourners and troops formed an American tableau, a Norman 
Rockwell-like scene not painted in this country since the death of Lyndon B. 
Johnson in January, 1973: Troops in crisp uniforms, parents with children in 
Scout uniforms, grandparents, mourners in dark suits, others dressed in jeans, 
babies in strollers and elderly people in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see him coming back to California in a casket. Just a year ago he 
was here for his wife's funeral. It's an emotional thing for us," said Jerry 
Woudenberg, 63, manager of a food bank in Whittier. He brought his 14-year-old 
son, Kees, who wore a Boy Scout uniform and called Nixon "my favorite 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 Margret Howard, 61, of Baldwin Park came with her daughter, Cindy Howard, 23, 
and granddaughter, Stephanie Bailey, 4. Margret Howard cast her first national 
vote for the Dwight D. Eisenhower-Richard Nixon presidential ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was an honest man, and I didn't like the raw deal he got in 
Watergate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each visitor was given a cream-colored card bearing in green ink the 
presidential seal and the message: "The Nixon family thanks you for visiting 
and for expressing your affection and respect for the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Three times Nixon had left California: first in victory, as a freshman member 
of Congress in 1947, then in defeat after losing his race for the California 
governorship to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. in 1962, and finally in 1980, after 
more than five years of self-imposed, post-Watergate exile, when he moved to 
New York and eventually New Jersey so he and his wife could be closer to their 
children and grandchildren, who live in New York and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his presidency, Nixon would return to the state, landing at El Toro 
and then flying by helicopter to the "Western White House" in San Clemente. And 
it was to El Toro that he returned on Aug. 9, 1974, after his emotional 
departure from the White House he had turned over to Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 A large, sad crowd softly sang "God Bless America" that day as the same 
airplane arrived with private citizen Nixon aboard. On Tuesday, civilians were 
kept off the base, and only several dozen members of Marine families who live 
there were allowed to stand in a fenced-off area to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon family members, who flew to California with the former President's 
remains, emerged from the front door of the aircraft that had taken Nixon to 
Moscow, Beijing and other corners of the globe. The coffin, maneuvered at a 
45-degree angle from the aircraft's blue-carpeted floor, was removed from the 
back door, near the galley. 
</P>
<P>
 Howitzers brought in from Camp Pendleton boomed a 21-gun salute, a Marine band 
played "Hail to the Chief," and within minutes, the cortege began the 20-mile 
trip to Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the route, thousands of people tried to catch a glimpse of the 
procession, many giving the two-fingered "V for victory" signal that Nixon 
adopted from Winston Churchill. On overpasses, ramps and front lawns, they put 
up with the downpour -- the same sort of dreary weather that often greeted 
Nixon when he tried to escape the tumult of Washington in the throes of 
Watergate in the summer of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony at El Toro was a mirror image of the ceremony 5 1/2 hours earlier 
at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, N.Y. After his death, Nixon's 
body was taken to a mortuary in Wyckoff, N.J. Family members and close friends 
were given a private viewing and the body then was taken to the air base near 
West Point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon family awaited the hearse at the base. To the clicking in cadence of 
their metal heels on a ramp, eight military pallbearers carried the coffin to a 
hydraulic lift that slowly carried them up to the open back door of the jet, 
the military version of the old Boeing 707 that was designed to Nixon's 
specifications and then delivered to the Air Force in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Tuesday evening, the Nixon family returned to the Richard Nixon Library 
& Birthplace, spending time in the Nixon's birthplace home, where one of his 
grandchildren played the piano on which her grandfather learned to play 78 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the funeral today, Clinton has declared a national day of mourning. 
Federal offices will be closed, Congress will be in recess and many financial 
markets will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The four remaining former Presidents -- Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush -- plan to attend the service. So, too, do representatives of 
nearly 90 countries, including some, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, that did not 
exist as independent entities during the Nixon presidency. But other than 
Clinton, no heads of state were expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The President will be accompanied on Air Force One and other aircraft by a 
panoply of American political leadership, a most unique collection of 
Washington insiders of multiple generations. Their memoirs could write the 
history of the United States during some of its most turbulent decades, and 
would cross the political spectrum. More than one of them had engaged in sharp, 
even bitter, fights with Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying with Clinton aboard the new Air Force One, a jumbo Boeing 747, will be, 
among others, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John Shalikashvili, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott 
and Carol Browner, the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, which 
Nixon created. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aircraft were carrying House Speaker Thomas Foley and Senate Majority 
Leader George Mitchell; liberal Democratic Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.), 
who worked in the Nixon White House, and conservative House Minority Whip Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
 And there will be Nixon Cabinet members -- Secretaries of State William P. 
Rogers and Henry A. Kissinger. Elliot Richardson, the attorney general who 
resigned in the Watergate Saturday Night Massacre rather than fire, at Nixon's 
orders, the Watergate special prosecutor. Robert Strauss, the Democratic elder 
statesman and President George Bush's ambassador to Moscow. And former Sen. 
George S. McGovern, the South Dakota Democrat whose presidential campaign in 
1972 was swamped by the Nixon machine that ran up a 49-state victory, even as 
it began to feel the cold winds of Watergate.

YORBA LINDA'S 'GRACIOUS' MOTTO BEING PUT TO THE TEST; HOMETOWN: DESPITE CROWDS 
AND CHAOS, FEW WOULD PASS ON THE CHANCE TO PAY FINAL TRIBUTE TO ONE OF THEIR 
OWN. 
</P>

<P>
 For a long time, Yorba Linda was a tiny town of avocado trees and lemon 
groves. In the past 10 years, it started to boom. On Tuesday, it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The noise, the compressors, the sirens, the sound checks, the helicopters, 
the hammering. They've been going at it all night," Russ Watroba said, having 
just that morning engaged in a nasty spat with looky-loos as he tried to put 
his trash cans on the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 This little enclave of horses and trees and low crime and no graffiti (almost) 
finds itself in the eye of a storm of media and mourners and rubbernecks and 
police as preparations to bury Yorba Linda's native son, Richard Milhous Nixon, 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest, all the commotion is getting to be rather a pain in the 
birthplace; homeowners can't go to the market for milk without being asked to 
show proof of residency to go home again. The helicopters are waking up babies. 
The dogs won't stop barking at all the invaders and there is no place to park. 
And Yorba Linda wouldn't trade places with any other city in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hassle," Brian Gibson said, as he mulled over the increasingly 
appealing idea of getting out of town when the real hordes converge today. "But 
how often does this happen? I might as well stick around and say six Presidents 
were 100 yards from my house on a single day." 
</P>
<P>
 They call Yorba Linda the "Land of Gracious Living" and never has a motto been 
more tested. Cars filled with strangers prowl up and down residential streets 
searching for a place to park. The merchants on Main Street spent most of 
Tuesday morning shooing non-customers out of their spaces and watching woefully 
as customers drove impatiently away. There were shouting matches in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've given up," Leo Reilly, owner of the Yorba Linda Hardware store -- where 
a young Richard Nixon once swept floors for pocket money -- said in disgust. "I 
told one lady this is a 15-minute parking space. She waited a minute then got 
out of her car and left." 
</P>
<P>
 The Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace is surrounded by quaint California 
bungalows and mom-and-pop businesses where people take pride in being welcoming 
and friendly. This is a Quaker town, where grandsons live across the street 
from their grandmothers and the birds sing joyfully in the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 So how come Carol Sasaki found herself leaping from her car Monday as she 
fought to turn right off of her beloved Park Place Street to pick up her son 
from school, hollering at the barricade of cars that refused to let her pass, 
"Do you know how rude you are?" 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just no privacy," said one resident, who has taken to putting on a 
pair of pants when he gets out of bed. "You can't walk through the house at 
night with a light on without somebody looking in." 
</P>
<P>
 If all of this was not imposition enough, there was talk of shooting off some 
kind of cannon. Rootless Southern California has never been much for protocol, 
but Washington is the brains behind this operation, and according to the rules 
set out by the U.S. Military District of Washington, the death of an 
ex-President is grounds for all sorts of tribute, including the firing of one 
gun every half-hour from dawn to dusk, a 21-gun salute fired at one-minute 
intervals during the funeral ceremony, and a 50-gun salute fired at five-second 
intervals when the burial is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows what could happen? Yorba Linda can only be thankful that the ancient 
tradition of sacrificing a horse at a military funeral has somewhere fallen by 
the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's been a long time since anything so exciting happened to such a 
tiny place, and the residents were abuzz. Let's face it, the laying to rest of 
the 37th President of the United States is big stuff, and this one promised to 
attract four ex-Presidents and one current one, several international 
dignitaries, media from around the world and Nixon devotees, some who traveled 
from across the country at great personal expense ($4,000 for a family of three 
from Washington to Orange County) just to pay their last respects to a man they 
figure was long past due for some. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnificence of it all was not wasted for a minute on Jenny Fae Sprague, 
who sat in her son's back yard, a stone's throw from the little white house 
where Nixon was born 81 years ago. She was sitting in a lawn chair with an 
Instamatic camera in one hand and her grandson's dog, Booger, in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Booger had the run of the grassy yard until Monday when his owner, 23-year-old 
Jamie Rice, gave ABC News in New York permission to erect a four-story metal 
scaffold in his back yard. As his grandmother was busy making a photographic 
record of the emerging scaffold, Rice was dragging two big trash cans into the 
street to save a coveted parking space for an ABC reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," Rice said, smoking one of the five packs of Camels he 
purchased Monday so as not to have to go to the store in all this traffic. 
"Also, there was a little bit of money involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahhhh. So there is more than fame to be gained from all this pomp and 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the nuisance, some of the Yorba Linda business community and a few of 
its enterprising residents were more than pleased to welcome the world to their 
tiny doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as they were going to be overrun, John Hansen and Jason Moquin, who 
live across the street from the library, figured they'd try to make a buck. 
After all, Nixon was a capitalist, wasn't he? They and their neighbors sold 
parking spots in their driveways for $10 a pop. Moquin made some extra money by 
getting one taker at the television van rate of $100. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon was a fan of free enterprise," Hansen, a sales manager, pointed out, as 
his three children scurried around the front yard awaiting the motorcade. "This 
is providing a service." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Crisp, store manager of the local McDonald's Restaurant, reported that 
business was better than brisk. The Air Force Band, about 40 of them, showed up 
for breakfast Tuesday morning in uniforms so new the manager had to cut the tag 
off one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the anticipation seemed to undercut the sadness this community felt 
when word of Nixon's death came Friday. If the rest of the country had deigned 
to forgive its most disgraced President, Yorba Linda had never blamed him. So, 
it seemed fitting that the town that produced, nurtured and helped rehabilitate 
him would also give him a proper tribute one last time, all the traffic and 
noise be damned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've watched him come in lots of times in helicopters. We were here for the 
opening of the library," Kay Rogers, a retired kindergarten teacher at the 
Richard Nixon School, said as she tiptoed in mud to peek through the rails of a 
fence at the freshly dug grave, just a few feet from where Pat Nixon was laid 
to rest. "I think it's wonderful he's getting his due."

 Bernice L. Collins, 81, a veteran campaign worker for Richard Nixon, sat near 
the front of the long line of mourners. Raindrops had beaded on the chrome 
frame of her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby was Tom Nooner, 42, of San Clemente, who had stood outside the White 
House in 1974 to show his support for Nixon the day he announced his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Bustamonte, a former Marine rifleman who was pulled out of Vietnam more 
than 20 years ago by then-President Nixon, huddled under an umbrella with his 
teen-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here out of loyalty and to pay my respects, because if it weren't for 
Nixon, I might not be standing here right now," said Bustamonte, 41, of Alta 
Loma. "I'll never forget the elation of getting on that plane and returning 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 In the rain, thunder and hail of a lingering April storm, thousands of people 
Tuesday began turning out at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace to honor 
the former President. Clutching flowers and miniature American flags, they 
patiently waited along Yorba Linda Boulevard for hours before they were allowed 
a brief moment to pay their last tribute to Nixon, whose body lay in a simple 
wooden casket. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Tuesday night, the line of 5,000 to 6,000 people stretched for several 
miles down Yorba Linda Boulevard, and the wait in chilling temperatures was 
about eight hours. Several arguments broke out when people tried to cut in, and 
about 10:30 p.m., the Police Department asked the media to urge people not to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 About 355 police officers waited in reserve for the point when authorities 
would have to tell those still in line that they would not be able to see the 
casket, Police Lt. Mike Messina said. Police estimated that would happen about 
2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will probably be a lot of unhappy folks," Messina said. An Orange 
County sheriff's deputy stringing yellow crowd control tape along one area of 
ther line said, "It's a nightmare. It's just a nightmare. By the time people 
get to this point they've been in line 5 1/2 hours and their patience is pretty 
thin." 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 p.m., library officials estimated that 10,000 people had viewed the 
casket, and were passing through at a rate of about 2,500 per hour. Once inside 
the lobby, visitors slowly walked single file around the closed, flag-draped 
coffin -- their contact with one of the nation's most intriguing public figures 
lasting less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is American history," said Steven Heathcote, 28, of Yorba Linda, earlier 
in the day as rain streamed down his umbrella and drenched the cast on his 
broken foot. "I wouldn't miss this for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Most chose to remember Nixon for his personal strengths and foreign policy 
achievements, not for the Watergate scandal that drove him from the presidency 
or the Vietnam War that divided the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come here simply out of respect for my commander in chief," said 
Collins, who lives in Los Angeles and has worked on almost all of Nixon's 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 As evening set in, the line outside moved at such a slow pace that it took as 
long as four hours to arrive at the library entrance. The temperature had 
dropped into the 50s, and children were getting cranky. 
</P>
<P>
 All along the line of mourners, people were damp and cold, and babies were 
bundled up in their strollers. Some of those with families started to call it 
quits late Tuesday night but vowed to return during today's pre-dawn hours. 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the time, people sang songs and told jokes. Children from the 
surrounding neighborhood sold $1 cups of hot chocolate, dispensed from pump 
thermoses. The line at the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise down the block from 
the Nixon library seemed just as endless. 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring of sympathy was a solemn prelude to today's more elaborate 
state funeral, which will be held a few yards from the white clapboard house 
where Nixon was born. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time viewing started at 3 p.m., an estimated 10,000 people had queued 
up for a mile down the main thoroughfare of this bedroom community, which is 
now host to the largest international event ever held in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's closed casket will be on display until 11 a.m. today. For those not 
invited to the memorial service, it is the only chance to participate in 
honoring the former President before he is buried next to the grave of his 
wife, Pat. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the library, more than 200 bouquets of roses, carnations and irises 
surrounded the viewing area. Near the door was a large picture of Nixon smiling 
and giving a thumbs-up sign. A military color guard stood erect and 
expressionless by the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 For the viewing and funeral, the Clintons sent a wreath of red, white and blue 
flowers with red, white and blue ribbons. A red anthurium spray came from the 
emperor of Japan. President Lech Walesa of Poland sent a wreath of red and 
white carnations, and pianist Van Cliburn, a longtime friend of Nixon's, paid 
tribute with a large spray of red roses and white lilies. 
</P>
<P>
 One enormous wreath had been sent by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who felt 
snubbed by Nixon during his recent visit to the former Soviet Union. Its red 
and gold sash shimmered in the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon exiting the lobby, the library staff handed out a cream-colored card 
embossed with the presidential seal. "The Nixon family thanks you for visiting 
and for expressing your affection and respect for the President," the note 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
 People filed by for hours, some on crutches, some in wheelchairs, some pushing 
their children in strollers. A few had come from as far away as Oklahoma. Many 
were somber, showing little emotion, but as night set in people began emerging 
from the viewing area with tear stains glistening on their cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waiting in line so long you sort of forget why you're here and then it hits 
you. I cried when I saw it," said Jean LaPorte, 64, of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Iron Eyes Cody, with a big feathered war bonnet on his head, made the long 
walk through the television trucks and teaming crowd. He was so tired he had to 
sit down when he reached the portico. People rushed to give him a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody, now 90, is best known as the Native American who posed with a tear on 
his cheek for an "America the Beautiful" commercial years ago. He caught his 
breath and delivered a prayer outside the library entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were good buddies," Cody said of his relationship with Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's casket arrived at the library about 1:45 p.m. after being taken by 
motorcade from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, where the Boeing 707 bearing 
his family and that once served him as President landed an hour before. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Nixon motorcade approached the library and the hearse came to a stop 
at the entrance, the crowd remained silent. As the color guard carried the 
casket in a slow procession into the library, a U.S. Air Force band struck up 
"Hail to the Chief." The mourners finally surged forward as the front doors 
were opened for the viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to pay tribute to an old friend," said Polin Soth, 51, a 
Cambodian immigrant from Long Beach who had brought a huge standing wreath 
bearing the flag of the former Cambodian republic. "He was always there to help 
us in the fight against Communists." 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Berg said she didn't mind being pelted by hail and rain for her short 
glimpse of the President's casket. "How long did he serve us?" she asked. "I 
think we can stand in line a few hours for him." Other Observances 
</P>
<P>
 While the funeral for former President Richard Nixon is for invited guests 
only, other Orange County observances will be open today to the public: 
</P>
<P>
 * Beginning at 3:30 p.m., the funeral will be broadcast live at the Crystal 
Cathedral on a 11-by-14-foot Jumbotron TV screen. In keeping with President 
Clinton's call for national mourning, organizers at the cathedral -- at 12141 
Lewis St. in Garden Grove -- invite residents to observe the funeral in a 
prayerful setting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Messiah Lutheran Church, 4861 Liverpool St. in Yorba Linda, will have a 
memorial service for the former President beginning at 7 p.m.

BUDDHISTS' USE OF SWASTIKAS FOCUS OF CULTURAL CONFLICT; RELIGION: EMBLEMS ON 
GATES OF CHATSWORTH HOME MEAN PEACE, NOT NAZISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two simple lines, bent into one of the Western world's most hated symbols, 
have also come to represent the complex weave, and increasing tangle, of 
cultures in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chinese monk and his students two months ago installed six, one-foot-wide 
swastikas -- a symbol of peace to Buddhists and Hindus but a symbol of Nazism 
to Westerners -- in the wrought-iron gates at the entrance of a home they are 
converting to a Buddhist temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The saffron-colored, two-story home is in the middle of a block that in some 
ways typifies the whole Valley. There are white, Asian, Middle-eastern and 
Latino neighbors, as well as a Jewish family who lost relatives during the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is not surprising that the emblems have prompted complaints to police 
and the local office of the Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern in looking into it was that some of the calls were rather 
threatening in nature," said Mary Krasn, director of the ADL's Valley office. 
"People who called implied that there might be harm to the residents." 
</P>
<P>
 No harm has come to anyone affiliated with the American Hwa Yen Buddhist 
Studies group that is building the De Soto Avenue temple. But recently two of 
the swastikas were sawed off -- the spent hacksaw blades left behind on the 
temple driveway, the fresh metal scars on the fence already turning to rust. 
</P>
<P>
 This sudden controversy has caught Mona Truong, a temple member, by surprise. 
She said what others call a swastika is a common symbol used to mark Buddhist 
temples throughout Asia. It is called van in Vietnamese. The Nazis called it 
hakenkreuz.  
</P>
<P>
 "It means peace and it is in all the Buddhist temples," said Truong, of Canoga 
Park, who came to the U. S. from Vietnam 14 years ago. "It is like the cross in 
Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
 So common is its use, that Chinese maps use the symbol to designate the 
location of a Buddhist temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Truong said, the emblem at the temple points in the opposite 
direction of the swastika used in Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Evelyn Silverman, a neighbor whose relatives were among the 6 million 
Jews to die in the Holocaust, the emblem is a hated reminder of war, not peace. 
Her grandmother died en route to a concentration camp, she said. Her daughter 
saw the gates this past weekend and, like others who have seen the emblems, the 
two women reacted with shock and anger. They worried the gates were put up by a 
neo-Nazi group or sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that the gates were made for a Buddhist temple, Silverman said 
her anger has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 But, still, "I think when you live in the U.S. you have to conform a little 
bit to our culture. . . . I think they should realize why people would question 
it in this country and be more sensitive," she said. She doesn't want them 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Debbie Silverman, said she is relieved that the emblem was not 
intended to offend. But she has mixed feelings about whether the temple should 
keep them on display. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to inhibit their rights, but I think a lot of people are 
going to take it the way I took it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict is a typical growing pain for the Valley, which over the past 
decade has seen its white majority nearly overtaken by minority residents 
hailing from around the globe. But it is the first conflict between Buddhists 
and Jews over use of the swastika. Anglos in the Valley comprised more than 90% 
of the population through the 1960s. By 1990, they were a little more than 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sort of thing is becoming more common as more and more groups come 
here," said Eugene Mornell, executive director of the Los Angeles County Human 
Relations Commission. "There should be an educational process." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenyon Chan, chairman of the Asian-American Studies Department at Cal State 
Northridge, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good example of the cross-cultural conflict that ignorance brings 
on," Chan said. "The temple has a large responsibility in educating neighbors 
and helping them understand who they are and what they are. . . . And I think 
that someone's attempt to eradicate the symbol showed their ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the temple monk nor his representatives were available to talk about 
the controversy. Truong said they are abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 So this week, it has been local Jewish leaders who have come to the defense of 
the Buddhist temple. The San Fernando Valley is home to an estimated 250,000 
Jews, far larger than the estimated 10,000 or so residents who practice or have 
been raised Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who overreacted and who, before they got the information, 
were hysterical," said Rabbi Ronald Stern, 32, of Temple Ahavat Shalom in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern received so many calls about the gate, that he sent faxes to local 
rabbis and temple directors this week explaining that the swastikas on De Soto 
Avenue were put up by Buddhists, and have no relation to neo-Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 The property owner should be protected from vandalism or any other trouble, 
Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, as Jews, we have to do everything we can to assure their security 
and freedom of expression of religion to the extent that it doesn't infringe 
upon others' rights to express their religion," said Stern. "And in this case, 
it does not." 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, the swastika is a common symbol for blessings and when posted outside 
is meant to bestow good wishes upon passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The swastika is a very old symbol and there is nothing bad about swastika," 
said Dr. Havanpola Ratanasara, president of the College of Buddhist Studies in 
Los Angeles and executive president of the American Buddhist Congress. 
"Swastika in Asia is considered a good thing. To wish for somebody good things, 
to wish . . . happiness, prosperity and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Breitbart, senior researcher for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles, said, "The swastika is the oldest symbol there is, it's that simple. 
It was given a bad name by the Nazis who adopted it in the 1920s as their 
symbol, but it is thousands of years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, one Los Angeles-area Buddhist leader said this week that he stopped 
using the swastika -- which comes from the Sanskrit language, meaning blessings 
-- once he learned of its negative connotation here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Chao Chu, abbott of the Rosemead Buddhist Monastery, said he used to 
bring back swastika pendants for children when he returned from Asian trips -- 
until an American-born temple member explained why their use might be 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu, whose temple includes about 370 members from China and Southeast Asia, 
said he often works with Jewish groups in his role as a religious leader and 
did not want to offend anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to avoid misunderstanding if we want to stay here and work in 
harmony," said Chu. "Misunderstanding is the biggest problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. Ellwood Jr., a professor in the USC School of Religion who is an 
expert in Asian religions, observed that the name of the Chatsworth temple 
aptly counterbalances connotations of the Nazi swastika. The Hwa Yen Buddhists 
draw their name from a particularly long sutra , or scripture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scripture emphasizes the presence of Buddha nature in all persons and all 
entities," Ellwood said. "It follows that you respect all."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; BURST OF SUN HERALDS BODY'S ARRIVAL; CEREMONY: THE 
RAIN EASES LONG ENOUGH FOR THE SOMBER MILITARY RITES TO TAKE PLACE AT EL TORO 
MARINE CORPS AIR STATION.

<P>
 As if on cue, the brooding skies that hovered over El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station Tuesday suddenly burst with sunshine, as the plane carrying Richard 
Nixon to his final homecoming taxied to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Storm clouds had threatened to dampen an already somber military ceremony 
planned for the arrival of the former President's body. But the rain that fell 
on much of Southern California Tuesday eased long enough so the brief ceremony, 
which is steeped in military tradition, could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The flag-draped casket was bathed in sunlight as it was taken from the blue 
and white Boeing 707 with the tail number 27000, the same plane that brought 
Nixon to Orange County after his resignation in 1974 in the wake of the 
Watergate scandal. The plane landed at the Marine base about 12:30 p.m., after 
a flight from Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike 1974, when several thousand civilians were allowed on the base to 
welcome Nixon, the public was kept away from El Toro Tuesday. Only a few dozen 
Marine dependents who live on base witnessed the ceremony while standing in a 
fenced-off area, far removed from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's daughters, Julie Eisenhower and Tricia Cox, their husbands and four 
Nixon grandchildren, exited the front of the plane, after the casket was 
removed from the rear. The family was escorted by Army Maj. Gen. Fred A. Gorden 
as they stood and watched eight military pallbearers, representing the five 
branches of the Armed Forces, carry the casket. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members showed no outward emotion as a Marine band signaled "Ruffles 
and Flourishes," followed by "Hail to the Chief," and an artillery battery from 
Camp Pendleton fired a 21-gun salute to honor the dead President. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ceremony was relatively brief, the young servicemen and women who 
made up the welcoming troops endured long moments at attention before and after 
the ceremony. Everyone, including the Marines in the base ground crew, was in a 
crisp dress uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 21-gun salute, the band played "America the Beautiful," and the 
casket was slowly carried between an honor cordon of servicemen to a waiting 
hearse. A national color team of three servicemen, with the traditional Army 
soldier in the middle carrying the U.S. flag, marched in front of the casket. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the casket was in the black hearse, Nixon's family entered a waiting 
limousine, and the vehicles joined a short motorcade escorted by the California 
Highway Patrol to make the 37-minute trip to the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands stood along the 20-mile route to watch Nixon's body and his 
relatives pass, flashing the two-finger "V" for victory sign from overpasses 
and on-ramps as the five-car motorcade whizzed by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farewell, Our Native Son" read a homemade banner in front of Linda Vista 
Elementary School, on the banks of Imperial Highway, a stretch of which bears 
the name of the 37th President. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds more hovered near his birthplace and final resting spot, waving 
American flags and homemade tributes, poised with cameras to catch the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at the last minute, it rained on Nixon's parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunder, lightning and a massive downpour welcomed the curtained hearse, led 
by two black sedans and followed by the limousines as it arrived at 1:30 p.m., 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost that it was appropriate that it rained," said John Hansen, an 
ardent Nixon fan who lives across the street from the library and sold parking 
spots in his driveway at $10 a pop. "It was part of the mourning and grieving 
and cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrents of water turned the street into a patchwork quilt of umbrellas. The 
entourage was met by the Rev. Billy Graham, a longtime friend of the Nixon 
family, and there was another military honor guard. After a brief ceremony, the 
coffin was placed in the library lobby for the viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was about 20 rows deep, so few could see the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 But 9-year-old Cleve Samson had a good view from his perch atop his father's 
shoulders. He also got an instant lesson in using a 35-millimeter camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you see it?" Cliff Samson, Cleve's father, asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just whatever you can take pictures of," Cliff Samson continued. "Go ahead 
take another. Do it again. Click it again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Samsons were among about 1,000 people who had skipped work or school to 
share a moment of history. They began lining the streets around the library 
about noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some set up lawn chairs, others munched on snacks as television crews surveyed 
the crowd. Several even held banners aloft. "Jesus Saves Sinners from Hell," 
said one. Four Cambodian refugees from Long Beach offered a wreath from the 
"Khmer Republic." Someone was selling black armbands for $3. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's history being made here today," said 69-year-old Freda Halsey, who 
has lived in Yorba Linda for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the great events of our country," agreed Glendale resident 
Ruth Norwood, 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach resident Jennifer-Erin Jana, 9, stood in a red sweater with 
white stars, holding a poem she had written. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Nixon, what a man. Did his best at whatever he can," went the simple 
rhyme, which the girl had pasted on a piece of red construction paper. "We have 
lost a man that is brave. But now he goes to his grave." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana York sat on the corner of Yorba Linda Boulevard and Eureka Avenue, 
knitting a white sweater, waiting with Mitchell, 11, the oldest of her four 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he should know his heritage," York said of the young boy. "Nixon made 
a lot of mistakes, but he was a great statesman at the end of his life. I want 
him to see that."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; COURTS IN NIXON'S HOME BASE WILL STAY OPEN TODAY; 
LAW: CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH INCLUDES ORANGE AND L.A. COUNTIES, 
WON'T CLOSE ON NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING. THE IRONY ISN'T LOST ON FEDERAL 
OFFICIALS. 
</P>

<P>
 On a national day of mourning for Richard Nixon, federal courthouses and 
administrative offices throughout the country will be closed today with one 
conspicuous exception: the Central District of California, which includes 
Nixon's home base of Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is not lost on federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several people have said to me, 'Wait a minute, Nixon was born and raised in 
this district, he has his library here and he's going to be buried here,' " 
said one federal prosecutor who spoke on the condition that he not be 
identified. "And this is the only district anyone can think of that is not 
closed. What's the deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has declared today one of national mourning and closed 
Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court and all federal offices. Regular mail delivery 
also was halted. Clinton left the decision to close each federal district or 
circuit court to the particular chief judge in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times contacted federal district courts headquartered in New York City, 
Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Denver and San Francisco. Except 
for Denver, all were scheduled to be closed, but the chief judge in each 
district gave judges the option of conducting business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge that you close (today) absent some compelling reason to continue to 
conduct business," wrote Chief U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders, who runs 
the Northern District Court of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Central District of California, however, which includes the counties of 
Los Angeles, Orange and five others in Southern California, Chief Judge William 
Matthew Byrne Jr. said he was keeping the courts open as usual but offered to 
let any judge take the day off. The clerk's office, he said, would be open 
between 8:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted in South Florida, where he is attending a convention of clerks and 
chief judges, Byrne said he had polled some of the district judges before 
making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judges wanted to remain open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some court officers have wondered privately whether Byrne's action had 
anything to do with his involvement with Nixon in the Pentagon Papers case 21 
years ago. Byrne declared a mistrial in the case against Daniel Ellsberg and 
Anthony J. Russo, two RAND Corp. researchers charged with stealing the papers, 
a classified study of U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trial ended, Byrne said he had been contacted twice by John D. 
Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic adviser, about his interest in becoming head of 
the FBI. At the time, some wondered whether Nixon was trying to influence the 
outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said Tuesday that his decision had nothing to do with the Pentagon 
Papers case. 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues agreed, saying they had business to conduct today. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of courtrooms in which there is a trial in progress," said 
Judge Gary L. Taylor, a Bush appointee who is assigned to the federal 
courthouse in Santa Ana. "It costs you thousands and thousands of dollars a 
day. To go dark for a day would be a hardship. Nixon wouldn't want us to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 About two-thirds of the district's courtrooms will be active today, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the civil trial of Rodney G. King vs. the city of Los Angeles 
will be in session, as per the decision of Judge John G. Davies, a Reagan 
appointee. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury will conduct deliberations in a trial before Judge Dickran Tevrizian, 
also a Reagan appointee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to hold court," Tevrizian said. "I'm a Republican. I have a 
calendar I'm trying to get out from under. I've been in trial for about eight 
months continuously. . . . It's nothing disrespectful at all. There are 
priorities here." 
</P>
<P>
 But Taylor was closing down for the day because he had no trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good Lord, this is the garden spot of Nixonia," he said.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; RAIN, HAIL PELT LIBRARY MOURNERS; WEATHER: 
UNSEASONABLE STORM MAY RETURN DURING OUTDOOR NIXON BURIAL. CHILLY TEMPERATURES 
LIKELY.

 Mourners and onlookers who had gathered at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace here Tuesday got caught in a rare Southern California hailstorm and 
an unseasonal downpour of rain, which is predicted to make a return appearance 
during the outdoor funeral of Richard Nixon today. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a 30% chance of rain, partly cloudy skies and cool temperatures that 
likely would not rise above 60 degrees today, according to Curtis Brack, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The hail and rain hit with a Pacific storm that was passing over the 
Southland, a more common occurrence in the winter than in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this time of year in Southern California, it's unusual. Having heavy 
rains and strong thunder is something you might expect more in the winter 
months," Brack said, adding that a strong trough of low pressure in the upper 
atmosphere in Southern California caused the rain, which periodically was 
transformed into golf ball-sized hailstones. 
</P>
<P>
 At first only the blocks immediately surrounding the Nixon library were pelted 
with rain and hail Tuesday morning. But by mid-afternoon, many well-prepared 
onlookers at the library, huddling under umbrellas and too dogged to give up 
their place in line for the afternoon viewing of the presidential casket, were 
drenched as the occasional showers turned into a downpour. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also thunder -- one thunderclap so loud that it set off a car alarm 
-- lightning and hailstorms in Yorba Linda at 2:50 p.m. and 3:35 p.m., which 
experts consider unusual and don't expect today. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said that because the storm system is weakening, any rain in Yorba Linda 
today will likely be light. "We are not expecting any thunderstorms," he said, 
and there were no flood or storm warnings in effect for Orange County today. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of rainfall was no more than 1.3 inches at any one place in Orange 
County Tuesday morning, officials said, and no more than that is expected 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 But unseasonable weather took its toll Tuesday evening. At 4:15 p.m., the 
California Highway Patrol closed Carbon Canyon Road from Valencia Avenue to the 
San Bernardino County line because of icy roads and mudslides around Carbon 
Canyon Regional Park. Bad road conditions also caused a 10-car pileup at 3:45 
p.m. on Carbon Canyon Road north of Olinda Place in Brea, where area residents 
reported snow and hail. Ice and hail were also reported on the Riverside 
Freeway near Weir Canyon Road, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, about 20 weather-related accidents on Orange County freeways occurred 
Tuesday, most of which did not result in injuries. Officials blamed the pileups 
not only on the rain but motorists' stubborn refusal to slow down in bad 
weather.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; DATELINE: YORBA LINDA; SOME DRENCHED BY RAIN, OTHERS 
SOAKED BY FELLOW CITIZENS

 Line Time: Like weddings, funerals are said to bring out the best and worst in 
people. The rain-soaked, four-hour, miles-long lines to view the former 
President's casket at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace were no exception. 
Some residents along the route offered mourners cups of tea and coffee, while 
another charged two little girls $1 to use her bathroom. A similar treatment 
awaited journalists covering the event. Some were offered lemonade and tuna 
fish sandwiches; Others were charged $100 to park. 
</P>
<P>
 Tin Can: Admirers of Richard Nixon who did not want to brave the crowds in 
Yorba Linda paid their respects by visiting the one-room Nixon museum at Casa 
Romantica in San Clemente, which was decorated with bouquets of flowers for the 
occasion. Dorothy Fuller, president of the San Clemente Historical Society, 
said 47 people signed into the museum Tuesday, compared to "four or five" who 
usually come to see the memorabilia of the Nixon presidency on other days. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the mourners was Phil Wilson, a 40-year-old construction worker from San 
Clemente who paid tribute to Nixon with a few yellow roses standing in a 
Campbell's Soup can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a bachelor and this is the best stuff I have around the house in terms of 
glassware," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Takers? At the entrance to the Yorba Linda Station shopping center a few 
blocks from the library sat a sign: "FREE COFFEE FOR FORMER PRESIDENTS." 
</P>
<P>
 Cloudy Skies: As the former President's motorcade moved from El Toro to Yorba 
Linda, a cluster of helicopters hovered overhead. The sunny skies gave way to 
thunderclouds and a downpour as Nixon's hearse moved from the Riverside Freeway 
to Imperial Highway -- also called the Richard M. Nixon Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second time Nixon's come home under a dark cloud," one helicopter 
pilot observed over the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeboy: Yorba Linda city leaders said a private goodby to Nixon, presenting a 
wreath at the casket Tuesday in a brief ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by two Army sergeants, Mayor Barbara Kiley, City Manager Arthur C. 
Simonian and councilmen John M. Gullixson, Henry W. Wedaa, Mark Schwing and 
Daniel T. Welch slowly filed into the library's main lobby, where Nixon's body 
was lying in state. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley read a poem she wrote in honor of the former President, which concluded, 
"He now returns to where it all began, to the whistle of the train." 
</P>
<P>
 No Dummy: Ever since former movie star Ronald Reagan went to the White House, 
the Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park has placed an effigy of the current 
occupant in a reconstructed Oval Office, according to spokeswoman Betty 
Cholewinski. New arrivals are ushered in with an inaugural ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 When former Presidents leave Movieland, the figures are shipped up to the 
President's Gallery at the Wax Museum on San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, to 
join more than 20 of their predecessors. On Friday, museum officials there 
placed a black wreath in front of President Nixon's figure in the gallery. 
"We'll probably leave it there for a month," museum president Ron Fong said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Movieland figure closest ideologically to Nixon -- whose wax likeness 
never appeared in Buena Park -- is the President's old friend, John Wayne.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; NATIONAL, WORLD FIGURES TOP GUEST LIST; DIGNITARIES: 
DIPLOMATS FROM 86 NATIONS, PLUS CLINTON AND ALL FOUR EX-PRESIDENTS, WILL 
ATTEND.

<P>
 Diplomats from 86 nations will attend today's funeral for former President 
Richard Nixon, joined by a host of government leaders past and present in 
mourning a man who played a central role in American politics for five decades, 
officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For some who served under Nixon in an administration that was cut short by 
Watergate, the solemn occasion at the site of Nixon's birthplace will mark a 
reunion of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of old friends," said Robert H. Finch, a 
former California lieutenant governor who served under Nixon as Secretary of 
Health, Education and Welfare. "It'll be a chance to share war stories." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no shortage of luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton will be there, along with all four of his living 
predecessors -- Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Kissinger, Sen. Robert Dole and Gov. Pete Wilson will all deliver 
eulogies, and a planeload of current and former Administration leaders will 
descend on Orange County as well. Among the more well-known figures from the 
Nixon era who are expected to attend: Spiro Agnew, Caspar Weinberger, Alexander 
M. Haig Jr., George P. Shultz and Patrick Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 So wide is the political mix among the guests that a White House briefing in 
Washington on Tuesday quickly turned to speculation about whether Air Force 
One, which will carry both Nixon's old crew and current Administration 
officials, will have to be divided. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans on the right, Democrats on the left?" one reporter asked 
jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be an integrated trip," quipped White House spokeswoman Dee Dee 
Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 One reporter then wondered aloud whether there would be a seat reserved for 
"Deep Throat," the source that Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl 
Bernstein made famous in "All the President's Men," their book on the Watergate 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace have been promising to 
make public a list of guests since the weekend, but nothing had been released 
as of late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, names have been trickling out from around the country. In Washington, 
officials on Tuesday announced the 86 countries that are expected to send 
representatives -- from Angola to Zambia. The European Union and the United 
Nations will also send representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most prominent foreign diplomats expected to attend are former Prime 
Minister Edward Heath of Great Britain, former President Chaim Herzog of 
Israel, and former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 No current heads of state are known to be attending, a reflection, in part, of 
the fact that the service is being held in Orange County rather than 
Washington. Nixon made it known before his death that he did not want to lie in 
state in the Capitol Rotunda, in a city that he felt had abandoned him during 
Watergate. That effectively eliminated the chance for foreign dignitaries to 
combine the trip with diplomatic issues, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the guests from around the United States and the world began arriving 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point, hotel officials said they had five to 
10 rooms reserved for government officials who are attending the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dignitaries stayed away from the library Tuesday as thousands of 
people withstood rain and hail for the former President's public viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gov. Wilson and his wife, Gayle, made a late-afternoon appearance, leaving 
a wreath of yellow roses near the casket as they stood in silent prayer for a 
few moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a friend for more than 30 years," said Wilson, who served as an aide 
to Nixon when the former President ran unsuccessfully for California governor 
in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's potential opponent in November, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, will 
also attend. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't be all politicians at the funeral. Orange County fast-food baron 
Carl N. Karcher, who met Nixon in the 1940s when he was campaigning for a seat 
in Congress, said he, too, plans to attend today's event. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher recalled Tuesday that Pat and Richard Nixon used to send his family a 
holiday wreath each year to decorate the front door of their Anaheim home. Last 
fall, when Karcher was forced out as chairman of the Carl's Jr. restaurant 
chain, Nixon wrote him a personal letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wished me success. . . . He was a warm person, a person you could talk to 
very comfortably," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher said it's fitting for Nixon to be buried at the side of his wife, Pat. 
"I know that after her burial he wanted to be alone (at the grave site) for a 
while," Karcher said. "Now he can be with her for eternity." Who's Coming to 
Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; LAW AGENCIES WEAVE NET OF SECURITY; FUNERAL: SECRET

PROTECTION PLAN FOR PRESIDENTS, DIGNITARIES.

 A blanket of security was wrapped around the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace Tuesday as federal, state and local law enforcement agencies 
prepared to protect President Clinton and hundreds of other dignitaries with 
measures that included a no-fly zone above the burial site. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service in Washington said protective details 
have been assigned not only to Clinton but also to former Presidents Bush, 
Reagan, Carter and Ford, who are expected to arrive at the library today in 
separate motorcades escorted by California Highway Patrol officers on 
motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us," said Gayle Moore, Secret Service spokeswoman, "it's basically a 
logistic concern. Most of our security will fall under the presidential 
umbrella and it doesn't get any more secure than that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that everything will go smoothly," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House sent an advance team, including Secret Service, over the 
weekend to handle everything from press relations to security. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're dealing with a President," said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Martini, "it's very organized and very well-planned." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea Police Department, which provides police services for Yorba Linda, 
was assisting in Secret Service efforts, said Brea Police Officer Dan Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Secret Service has certain guidelines that they have to follow, and we 
are trying to work with them," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon said Brea Police Department, which has about 100 sworn officers, 
requested and received support from the Orange County Sheriff's Department and 
several other law enforcement agencies in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, law enforcement officers were evident everywhere, on foot and on 
bicycle and often in yellow rain slickers, at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace as Nixon's body was returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Tuesday at noon, the Secret Service ordered the Federal Aviation 
Administration to prohibit flights below 2,500 feet within a three-mile radius 
of the library. The no-fly rule will last until 8 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, with the President's arrival," said Fredrick O'Donnell, an FAA 
spokesman, "we can expect more stringent requirements such as a higher 
elevation for the restrictive airspace." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, helicopters chartered by the media were allowed to follow the 
motorcade carrying Nixon's body from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to the 
library, provided a flight plan was filed and Brea police notified, O'Donnell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the President arrives, the air restriction applies to all non-law 
enforcement aircraft, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed to protect those aircraft with legitimate reasons to be there," 
O'Donnell said. "The biggest problem with any major event is you can expect at 
least from six to 12 media helicopters. And add to that equation law 
enforcement helicopters for the Secret Service and police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then sometimes we get the sightseer, the guy who owns a business and who 
wants to bring friends and flies over the activity. Those people have 
absolutely no function with the event and potentially can be a danger to 
themselves, other aircraft and people on the ground," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies and reserves have been called in to help with traffic and 
parking control, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have a combination of patrol people, investigators and reserve forces, 
doing our best not to deplete any current service," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's Officer Moon said there were no major problems Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far it's business as usual for us" Moon said. "We're trying to maintain 
the flow of traffic around the events so that the residents experience as 
little inconvenience as possible. They've been cooperative and understanding."

NIXON, GRAHAM WERE CLOSE FOR 44 YEARS; FRIENDSHIP: MINISTER WHO WILL OFFICIATE 
AT FUNERAL HAD THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S TRUST. 
</P>

 It was during a game of golf at the Burning Tree Country Club in Washington 44 
years ago that the Rev. Billy Graham and Richard Nixon became friends. But 
Nixon's daughter Julie has said their friendship was well-rooted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stems from the days when my grandmother first began to follow the ministry 
of Dr. Graham," she told John Pollock, author of the evangelist's authorized 
biography. "I'm sure that part of my father's feeling that he can trust Billy 
Graham as a man of God stems from his knowledge that Nana believed with all her 
heart in the Graham mission." 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old minister will officiate at Nixon's funeral today at the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same setting where, with the Nixon family sitting silently at outdoor 
funeral services for Pat Nixon last June, Graham eulogized that "few women in 
public life have suffered as she has suffered and done it with such grace." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham and his wife, Ruth, became close to the Nixons soon after their first 
meeting, arranged by the late Sen. Clyde Hoey of Graham's native North 
Carolina. The two men became golfing friends and confidants. They took long 
walks together on Florida beaches, where Graham urged Nixon to run for 
President in 1968. The night Nixon won, he asked Graham to join his family in a 
prayer before leaving his hotel room to face the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham gave the invocation at Nixon's first presidential inauguration in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham also participated in events at Nixon's second inauguration and presided 
over White House religious services many times. He gave the eulogy at the 
funeral of Nixon's mother, Hannah, and offered a dedicatory prayer at his Yorba 
Linda library's opening in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon often took Graham's advice. In 1960, for example, it was Graham who 
urged Nixon to stay away from making an issue of Jack Kennedy being Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham listened to Nixon, too. In 1982, when Graham worried whether to take 
his gospel to Moscow, Graham biographer William Martin writes, Nixon told him: 
"Billy, you know I believe in taking big risks. This is a big risk, but I 
believe that in the long run it will be for the benefit of the gospel you 
preach." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's adoration for Nixon remained firm even in the face of criticism that 
he should have done more to influence Nixon on Vietnam and should have 
distanced himself during Watergate. Watergate did become a sore point for 
Graham, especially after he heard Nixon on the White House tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham told biographer Marshal Frady: "I'd had a real love for (Nixon). He'd 
always been very attentive to his friends, he never forgot a birthday. He 
seemed to love his country, love his children, love Pat. But then the way it 
sounded on those tapes -- it was all something totally foreign to me in him. He 
was just suddenly somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 But Graham stood firmly by Nixon's side, and they remained close after Nixon 
was forced to resign. When they would meet, though, Nixon would always 
apologize for his language on the tapes, Graham says: "It was the first thing 
he'd mention." 
</P>
<P>
 When Graham spoke at Pat Nixon's funeral, there was never any doubt that the 
family would ask him to return when it was time for the solemn occasion of the 
burial of his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 His statement about Nixon's death: It "marks the end of a remarkable career 
which touched the lives of people throughout the world. . . . America has lost 
a great statesman, and I have lost a great personal friend."

JUDGE BLOCKS CONTROVERSIAL STATE TEST FOR 2 STUDENTS; EDUCATION: YOUTHS' 
PARENTS OBJECT TO THE EXAM. BOTH SIDES CLAIM VICTORY IN THE SUPERIOR COURT'S 
TEMPORARY RULING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that left both sides claiming victory, a Sacramento Superior 
Court judge temporarily forbade the state Department of Education and two 
school districts Tuesday from administering the state's controversial CLAS test 
to two students whose parents objected to the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Earl Warren Jr. issued a temporary restraining order on a lawsuit filed 
by the conservative Rutherford Institute on behalf of a Sacramento couple who 
claimed "horrendous harm" might result if their children had to take the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The action came on the heels of a separate, 48-hour temporary restraining 
order issued in San Bernardino County earlier Tuesday allowing parents to 
exempt their children from CLAS testing in six school districts until a 
Thursday hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, which filed both suits, is one of a 
number of conservative nonprofit groups attacking the test because it requires 
students to call upon feelings and beliefs to write essay-style answers to 
questions about personal relationships or family situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In short, the purpose of this CLAS test is to invade the psyche of the 
students, and of their parents' homes," the Sacramento lawsuit states. "It is 
not to test the English skills of the student." 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that all public school students at certain grade levels 
take the California Learning Assessment System tests, which cost $25.6 million 
annually to develop and administer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Rutherford attorney Brad W. Dacus fell short of his goal of 
halting all testing statewide, he hailed the judge's order as 
precedent-setting, calling it "a victory for every parent in every school 
district in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren made it clear, however, that he viewed his order narrowly, intending 
only to give "peace of mind" to the parents of the fifth-grader and 
eighth-grader mentioned in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In denying a broader order, the judge said it would be unfair to allow 
Rutherford to advance its beliefs at the expense of others, noting that, "It 
may be terribly important that children be tested at certain levels for their 
education so they can be prepared later in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph R. Symkowick, general counsel for the state Department of Education, 
downplayed the significance of the temporary restraining order. "This means 
that those two kids can't take the test," Symkowick said. "Otherwise it means 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 While Dacus portrayed Tuesday's events as an erosion of the education 
department's authority to require the test, Symkowick called his opponent's 
remarks "a total mischaracterization." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some school districts have started excusing children from the 
exams if their parents declare opposition to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, a Department of Education spokeswoman, said other than notifying 
school districts that there is no provision for such exemptions, the department 
has not adopted a firm position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried not to say (anything) one way or the other and leave districts 
some room for their discretion," said Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members said the state seems to have softened its stance and is 
no longer threatening hardball sanctions if districts allow exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Loofbourrow, president of the California School Boards Assn., said her 
organization has asked the Department of Education for a clear statement on 
whether children can be excused on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Union High School District has gone one step further and 
became the first district statewide to refuse to administer the test 
altogether, prompting a letter of warning from the education department that 
board members face removal if they don't reverse themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But board President Billy Pricer said Tuesday it is unlikely the Antelope 
Valley board will change its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to be obstinate about this," Pricer said. "My goal is to have 
that test re-examined and re-evaluated." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Department of Education's threat to Antelope Valley that raised the 
eyebrows of Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight, he said Tuesday. The Palmdale 
Republican joined eight other GOP legislators at a Capitol news conference to 
line up behind Dacus in his call for making the test's content public. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight said the Assembly Republican Caucus has written a letter to acting 
state schools Supt. William D. Dawson to request copies of the test for 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Public review of the test is limited because CLAS, like other academic and 
testing materials, is protected by both copyright and trade secret provisions 
of the law, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of secrecy, it's confidentiality of the exam so we can 
protect the (validity and) fairness of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>

Moeser reported from Palmdale.

RESTAURANT TO REMOVE CONTROVERSIAL SIGNS

 The owners of Popeyes Chicken and Biscuits have learned a lesson: There are 
some things better left off billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to consumer complaints, the chain of Cajun-style chicken 
restaurants is pulling down billboards that made some people flapping mad with 
the slogan: "The Best Breasts In Southern California Without Plastic Surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 "Irregardless of whether I was a cancer victim or not, this cheapens women," 
said Carol Forhan, a member of a breast cancer survivors group called Ladies of 
Courage in Lancaster, who complained to the company Monday after seeing the 
billboard standing near her church, another church and a nursery school. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, after half a dozen complaints from breast cancer victims, the 
company began to take down more than two dozen signs bearing the same 
Southern-fried message. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Scafido, vice president of marketing for Popeyes in Atlanta, said he was 
surprised that the advertisement drew such strong opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were just poking fun," Scafido said. "We were just looking for 
a humorous spin. A lot of people in Southern California have plastic surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards are part of an advertising campaign designed to introduce more 
than 80 new Popeyes restaurants to the Southland. Before February, there were 
16 Popeyes in all of Southern California. But a takeover of Pioneer Chicken 
restaurants in the last few months has made the Los Angeles area the most 
Popeyes-dense of any in the country, with more than 90 from Santa Ana to 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Popeyes erected 18 billboards, about half of them extolling breasts, in the 
San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising campaign, and the move into Southern California, coincides 
with a national push to update the 22-year-old company's image. Marketing 
directors have replaced the restaurants' lava rock exteriors with stucco and 
switched gaudy reds and oranges to contemporary grays and blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited," said Scafido. "Certainly people in Southern California 
like spice." 
</P>
<P>
 But not that much spice. Of the 100 billboards, 26 of them carried the breast 
braggadocio. Two others read: "We Are Bringing Wings to the City of Angeles" 
and "It Took Us 21 Years to Get Here, But You Know How Traffic Is." Several of 
the traffic billboards were printed in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to replacing the billboards in question, which have been up about 
a week and a half, the company has offered billboard space to the Central Los 
Angeles Chapter of the American Cancer Society to use in October to coincide 
with National Breast Cancer Month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly did not mean to offend anyone," said Sherri O'Riley, field 
marketing manager for Popeyes in Phoenix. "We were trying to extend our 
goodwill to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But several women lunching at a Popeyes in Chatsworth on Tuesday said the 
message was no way to attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't think of putting breasts with chicken in that manner," said Aleta 
Williams, 29, who had not seen the billboard. "It's kind of offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Harrod, 20, a student at Cal State Northridge, said the billboard 
mystified her, although that didn't stop her from swinging by the restaurant 
for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to boycott them," she said, waiting for her order to go. "But I 
don't know who they are trying to attract with a sign like that."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 2 MEN CONVICTED OF FIREBOMBING HOME

<P>
 Two Glendale men have been convicted of using homemade explosives to set fire 
to the apartment of a man with whom they fought, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Lopez Camacho, 19, and Miguel Angel Gomez, 21, were convicted of arson, 
using Molotov cocktails made by filling bottles with gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 All four residents, including a 3-month-old boy, escaped unharmed in the Dec. 
12, 1993, incident in which residents of the 1000 block of South Mariposa 
Street in Glendale were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair face a minimum mandatory sentence of 30 years in jail without the 
possibility of parole for the felony crime, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the stiffest sentences for federal crimes around," said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory W. Jessner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing is scheduled for June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 After a fight on a Glendale street, Gomez followed four men to a studio 
apartment in Glendale. He then met with Camacho and manufactured Molotov 
cocktails by siphoning gasoline from a parked car into beer bottles. The 
defendants lit the handmade grenades and hurled them into the living room. One 
of the firebombs almost struck the baby sleeping in a crib, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, Molotov cocktails are considered destructive weapons, 
falling in the same category as bombs and machine guns, said Jessner. CHAU LAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SAME-SEX CHARGES OF HARASSMENT FILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three former female employees of Crossland Mortgage Co. have filed suit 
against the firm in Glendale Superior Court, alleging they were sexually 
harassed by two female managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty Easton, Peggy Maarup and Maria Scott contend that Betsy Lamonte, a 
company vice president, and Lorene Washington, an operations manager, asked the 
three women sexually explicit questions on almost a daily basis throughout 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed April 6, asks for unspecified monetary damages, and charges 
that each woman was forced to work in a hostile work environment filled with 
sexual innuendo, causing Maarup, 41, and Scott, 37, to quit their jobs. Both 
women were account executives at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the matter is set for Nov. 1 in Burbank Superior Court. Neither 
the women nor their attorney could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is the first of its kind after a California Supreme Court decision 
last month that upheld a Court of Appeal finding that same-sex harassment cases 
are admissible in state courts, said Sherman Oaks attorney Henry Bockman, who 
is representing the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is also the latest action in what has become a tangled dispute. In 
February, Crossland and Lamonte sued Maarup and Maarup's current employer, 
Dollar Mortgage Corp., in Los Angeles Superior Court for slander and unfair 
trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamonte alleges in the suit that Maarup called her a lesbian. The claim also 
states that Maarup took a list of clients from Crossland to Dollar and allowed 
Dollar to use that information. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit filed this month, Easton, 42, alleges that Lamonte and Washington 
would come into her office to see what she was wearing, "touch her, and lift 
her blouse, shirt and jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Easton, a former senior underwriter at the firm, contends she was fired after 
about a year of service when Lamonte, 33, discovered she had asked an attorney 
about her rights under anti-harassment statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maarup and Scott said in the suit that, during a birthday party for 
Washington, 40, Lamonte pasted nude photos of men on office walls and gave 
Washington a sexual device as a present. 
</P>
<P>
 Bockman said his clients were forced to sue Lamonte, Washington and Utah-based 
Crossland after the mortgage company rejected an offer to settle the case. He 
also denied the allegations in the suit filed by Crossland and Lamonte.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GIVING KIDS A HANDS-ON LOOK AT FARM LIFE

 Second-grader Natalie Endjilian edged behind her classmates to escape the 
squat billy goat straining at its leash to sniff the youngster's flowered 
skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they can kick you," Natalie said. 
</P>
<P>
 But 4-H club member Sarah Clayton assured the children that the 3-year-old 
pygmy goat -- known as Patty -- does not kick or bite. In fact, Clayton, 15, 
takes Patty for a walk in the desert near Lancaster every day after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty visited Balboa Elementary School students recently as part of a Farm Day 
sponsored by the Glendale Unified School District and the California Foundation 
for Agriculture in the Classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Potbellied pigs, peacocks, baby geese and turkeys, dairy goats, lambs and a 
1-year-old 200-pound Suffolk ewe joined horses, chickens and dwarf rabbits in a 
miniature petting zoo assembled on the children's playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students were shy around the animals, asking if it was all right to pet 
them and querying their owners about life on a farm. Others were braver and 
stepped up to ask 4-H members why a baby donkey -- who was really a goat -- let 
his keeper hold him. 
</P>
<P>
 As fifth-grader Alexis Allen leaned in to get a better look at the enormous 
Suffolk ewe known as Squirrel, the sheep let out a dismayed bellow. 
</P>
<P>
 "She sounds like a cow," Allen said. "And she's so very, very big." 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to show children that the milk they drink, clothes they wear 
and food they eat are made from real, live animals, said Debra Vandiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandiver owns Squirrel and transported the ewe, along with two pigs, baby 
turkeys, chickens and three goats, in a van from the high desert east of 
Palmdale to visit Balboa Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who grow up in the city do not understand what farmers do, said Don 
Fiske, California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom representative 
and Farm Day coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Many kids have never seen a cow before and think that milk is manufactured at 
the grocery store, he said, adding that Farm Day is designed to dispel many of 
these myths. 
</P>
<P>
 A caged male peacock convinced third-grader Arin Aghakhani that the peacock 
feathers he had at home had at one time actually been attached to a 
multicolored fowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he would be smaller -- his tail sure is long," Aghakhani said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; RESIDENTS TO PROTEST ZIP CODE REJECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Arleta residents are upset that the U. S. Postal Service denied their 
request for a ZIP code independent from Pacoima, and they are planning to 
protest the decision next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a demonstration, scheduled for mid-May at the postal service's 
San Fernando Valley headquarters in Van Nuys, community activists warned that 
Arleta residents whose mail is addressed to Pacoima will engage in a mass 
"return to sender" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to make the post office as miserable as we can," said Hawley Smith, 
an Arleta Chamber of Commerce member who is leading the ZIP code drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Smith presented the postal service with a petition containing 5,200 
signatures in favor of bringing back Arleta's old ZIP code from the 1960s -- 
91332. Arleta's post office was closed in 1968, and the area has since shared a 
post office, and the 91331 ZIP code, with Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Local postal officials in February wrote a letter recommending reinstatement 
of the old Arleta ZIP code to their Pacific area headquarters in San Bruno, 
which sent it to Washington for approval. The request was denied because "it 
did not support the postal service's mission of providing our customers the 
best and economical service," according to a postal service letter sent to Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
 Arleta residents had asked Boxer, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. 
Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) to help establish the independent ZIP code, 
which they see as a way of enhancing community identity and lowering insurance 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and other residents fighting for an independent ZIP code are upset that 
they were not told that the request was denied, eventually finding out through 
a copy of the postal service letter from a Boxer aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys post office has appealed the decision by the Washington 
headquarters, and the ZIP code is being re-reviewed, said Terri Bouffiou, 
Southern California spokeswoman for the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the review we did, it would not greatly impact operations," Bouffiou 
said. "Nothing will change, other than the last two numbers of their ZIP code." 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't cost them any money; it doesn't matter to them," said John Maxon, 
who has been active in the ZIP code fight for 23 years. "But it matters to us 
and our businessmen. It's a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Arleta residents say they have a difficult time attracting businesses and 
selling their homes because they are linked to Pacoima, which has a reputation 
for high crime, Maxon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of saying we're better than them," Maxon said. "It's just a 
way of clearing up confusion." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; VENTURA BLVD. PANEL URGES MORE DIALOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Better communication is needed to improve sometimes "adversarial" relations 
between Los Angeles City Council aides concerned with planning issues and a 
citizens committee seeking to revamp Ventura Boulevard, according to the 
committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 At a board meeting Monday night, Jeff Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard 
Specific Plan Review Board, suggested to a group of council staffers that they 
attend the panel's meetings on a more frequent -- perhaps quarterly -- 
basis.The board meets twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is that they hear what we've been doing secondhand, or we will 
hear that they are opposing something that we're for," Brain said after the 
meeting. "When two parties are doing business, they should communicate." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides express similar goals for the 17-mile stretch of Ventura 
Boulevard from Woodland Hills to Studio City: to spruce up its appearance, make 
the street more pedestrian-oriented and improve traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council appointed the board in March, 1992, to monitor the specific 
plan's feasibility and effectiveness. The 1991 specific plan is the area's 
premier planning document, setting forth guidelines for development and 
improvements along the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning aides said that due to time constraints and obligations to other 
planning areas, they will most likely be able to attend only those meetings 
dealing with major projects or their particular district area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason why we have the (board) is to be the eyes and ears for the council 
person," to keep the council informed about how the plan is working, said Tom 
Henry, planning deputy for Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Miscikowski, chief deputy for Councilman Marvin Braude, agreed that 
increased dialogue is desirable but denied that relations between the deputies 
and the board have been contentious. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BILL ADDRESSES QUAKE INSURANCE PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) introduced a bill Tuesday that would 
require insurance companies to make most checks for earthquake damage payable 
directly to homeowners, rather than to homeowners and their mortgage holders. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would permit homeowners to cash such checks without obtaining the 
endorsement of a lender or anyone else with a security interest in the damaged 
property "unless whoever had the security interest provided proof such coverage 
was required by the lending agreement," said Kip Wiley, a Hayden legislative 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders often insist that homeowners carry fire insurance, but not earthquake 
insurance. Since the Jan. 17 temblor, however, many homeowners who bought 
earthquake insurance on their own have been angry to get claims checks naming 
their lenders as co-payees anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Crystal, regional manager of Western Insurance Information Service, a Los 
Angeles group that represents about 125 residential lenders, said the 
industry's initial reaction to Hayden's proposal was negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it does indeed completely relieve the insurance companies from any 
potential lawsuit, then we don't have a real problem with it. However, I don't 
know that it does that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal added that insurance companies would still worry that "some banks 
would find a loophole and sue them" if a homeowner didn't repair the damaged 
property or defaulted on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Austin, spokeswoman for the California Mortgage Bankers Assn., declined 
to comment on the bill, saying the Sacramento-based trade group had not had a 
chance to review it.  
</P>
<P>
 Hayden decided to introduce the legislation after state Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi dropped a plan earlier this month to take action on the co-payee 
issue.  
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi backed off that plan last week when lenders promised to respond with 
a lawsuit. Garamendi said such a suit would only continue to hamper the 
rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Garamendi's retreat, a committee of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
has formed to study the possibility of suing insurance companies over the quake 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, homeowner association president, said Hayden's proposal 
wouldn't affect the group's decision.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would help the next time we have a earthquake, but wouldn't help people 
who have damage now," he said of Hayden's bill. JILL BETTNER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; CITY RENEWS REWARD OFFER IN YOO KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to stimulate new leads in a 1991 multiple murder case, the Los Angeles 
City Council renewed Tuesday a $25,000 reward for information that would solve 
the murder of a Korean-American family in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 On a unanimous vote, the council approved the reward in hopes of generating 
information that would lead to the conviction of those who killed four members 
of the Yoo family in their home in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Hee Wan Yoo, 36, his wife, Gyung Jin, 34, and their children, 
Pauline, 6, and Kenneth, 4, were found in the Granada Hills home by family 
members Nov. 20, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have said the Yoo family members were all murdered with a sharp 
weapon, but have declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, police have had few solid leads and have been unable to identify a 
motive, prompting Councilman Hal Bernson, whose district includes Granada 
Hills, to renew the reward. 
</P>
<P>
 The council originally offered the $25,000 reward a month after the killings. 
But it went unclaimed and provided no substantial new information, police said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PAIR MOURN SON WHO BRIDGED CULTURAL GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the nation took today to mourn the loss of a man who bridged the gap 
between China and the United States, Sue and Donald Raskin mourned the loss of 
a son who brought Japan a little closer to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Michael Raskin, 33, fell to his death on April 17 while climbing 
Japan's sacred Mt. Fuji. Born and raised in Calabasas, Raskin last year 
ventured to Tokyo as chief American counsel for Sony Corp., a position that 
took him away from his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hated the Japanese people (for taking our son so far away)," said his 
mother, Sue, 57, who was observing the Jewish Shiva, or mourning period, on 
Tuesday. "We couldn't understand why he was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, father Don can't say enough about Sony. "They were there for us. It was 
like family." 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge between Doug's Japanese and Calabasas families materialized when 
his parents flew to Tokyo last week to bring their son's body home for Sunday's 
burial in Mount Sinai Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 No less than six Sony executives greeted them at the airport and took the 
couple, accompanied by Doug's sister, Carrie Croick, 36, to Doug's office at 
Sony. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon entering the floor, the group was encircled by more than 200 of Doug's 
fellow workers. During the next three hours, each worker expressed their 
respects to the family, sometimes in tears, shattering the family's stereotypes 
of the expressionless, unfeeling Japanese worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such an intense feeling," Croick recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the tribute end there. In respect for Doug, the workers followed the 
family to the cafeteria, where all 200-plus of them sat down to enjoy Doug's 
favorite lunch: rice, tofu and a banana. 
</P>
<P>
 The respects followed the family home, where several top executives from Sony 
Corp. of America came to Doug's funeral. And executives sent faxes from Tokyo 
that credited Doug with bridging the gap between the two cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 While Doug's body may be finally laid to rest at a place where his mother can 
visit him, both Donald and Sue know that his spirit is back in Japan, still 
working away at that bridge between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 To honor that bridge, Donald wears his son's wristwatch from that fateful 
fall. The time is still set to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "To die on Mt. Fuji is the most holy thing that can happen to a man," said 
Donald, touching the watch gently. "His spirit now stays in Japan. This way I 
keep in touch with him." JEFF SCHNAUFER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kentucky Shooting Area off of Angeles Forest Highway in the Tujunga ranger 
district will be closed to the public from May 2 through May 4, U. S. Forest 
Service officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure, to take effect at 4:30 p.m. on May 2, is needed so officials can 
conduct a site inventory that will be part of an environmental assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Foresters said the horse shooting area near Wrightwood and "A Place to Shoot" 
on San Francisquito Canyon Road in the Saugus ranger district are recommended 
alternatives for those who want to shoot during the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Those desiring more information on the closure or other alternative areas are 
asked to contact the Tujunga ranger station at (818) 899 1900 or Angeles forest 
headquarters at 574-5200. MYRON LEVIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 50 WORKERS TO HELP REASSESS PROPERTIES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inundated by damage claims from the Northridge earthquake, the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to hire 50 temporary employees to 
help reassess the value of thousands of affected properties.  
</P>
<P>
 About 38,000 residents and business owners so far have asked the county to 
lower their property taxes because their properties sustained at least $5,000 
damage in the Jan. 17 temblor, said Gary Gillam, a spokesman for the Office of 
the Assessor.Property owners have until July 17 to file disaster reassessment 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary employees will process claims for the next eight months, Gillam 
said. The county expects to be reimbursed for the $2.1-million cost by the 
federal government, he said. The state will reimburse the county for the 
difference between the pre- and post-disaster assessments, he said. TRACEY

DRIVER SENTENCED TO PRISON IN FATAL CAR CRASH, INSURANCE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A driver accused of causing a freeway crash that killed one of his passengers 
has been sentenced to four years in prison for his role in an insurance scam 
involving staged accidents with big trucks, prosecutors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Sanchez pleaded guilty in Los Angeles Superior Court to one count each 
of vehicular manslaughter and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Max Huntsman said. Prosecutors dropped a murder charge originally 
filed against Sanchez in exchange for his April 7 admission of guilt to the 
lesser counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez received the toughest sentence so far of nearly a dozen defendants who 
have been convicted of charges stemming from the fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors accused Sanchez of purposely swerving the car he was driving in 
front of a big truck on the Golden State Freeway near Sun Valley, causing the 
truck to overturn and land on the back of his car, Huntsman said. The case 
gained widespread attention following the June, 1992, crash, which killed Jose 
Luis Lopez Perez, 29, a passenger in Sanchez's car. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was one of a chain of similar staged wrecks involving big trucks. 
It attracted nationwide attention as evidence of an escalation in the 
relatively common phenomenon of staged crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defendant in the case, Leonard Michel, an alleged driver in a 
different staged accident on the Golden State Freeway near Burbank, pleaded 
guilty to insurance fraud Tuesday and faces a maximum five years in prison when 
he is sentenced May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing to set a trial date has been scheduled May 10 for other defendants 
in the case, including Gary Miller, an Encino attorney and alleged mastermind 
of the ring, and Filemon Santiago, the accused "capper" who local authorities 
seized in Texas last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cappers, people who stage auto wrecks, work directly with attorneys to set up 
accidents aimed at collecting thousands of dollars in insurance claims on 
behalf of passengers hired to ride inside cars that are used to stage 
accidents.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Santiago, who is going through extradition procedures 
in Houston, organized accidents for Miller. Both men and two passengers in the 
fatal crash have each been charged with murder.

17 VALLEY SCHOOLS SEEK TO JOIN DISTRICT'S LEARN REFORM PLAN; EDUCATION: 
OFFICIALS PLEASED WITH CROSS-SECTION OF CAMPUSES. TEACHERS AND PARENTS WOULD 
GET BROADER POWER TO DESIGN PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty-two schools -- including 17 in the San Fernando Valley -- have applied 
to become part of the Los Angeles school district's ambitious LEARN reform 
program in which teachers, principals and parents are given broader authority 
to design their own educational programs.  
</P>
<P>
 The schools, whose applications must be approved by the Board of Education, 
would embark on the second phase of the LEARN effort, now under way at 34 
campuses. LEARN (Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now) was 
developed by a coalition of business, civic and education leaders and seeks to 
raise student achievement by granting greater powers to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new group of schools, which submitted applications by the Monday afternoon 
deadline, includes at least four senior high schools; another one is still 
considering applying. These would be the first senior high campuses to become 
part of the reform program. 
</P>
<P>
 District and LEARN officials, who had said they hoped for at least 60 schools 
to sign up, said they are pleased with the cross-section of campuses that have 
applied and that they will probably begin another application process in the 
fall. The current application process will remain open until May 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the very beginning, we tried to absolutely make sure this is not 
condemned to be a pilot program and that's what this shows," said Mike Roos, 
the head of LEARN and former state assemblyman. "It's very, very validating. I 
think we're on track." 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein, a LEARN supporter who 
serves on the group's executive working group, said she would have preferred 
fewer schools but that the numbers show that teachers, parents and 
administrators want their campuses to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be interesting and it will be a challenge -- for everyone," Bernstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the LEARN plan, approved by the school board last year, teachers, 
principals and parents are given broader authority to design their own 
educational programs. Principals have power over essentially all aspects of 
campus management, including budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible to apply for LEARN, 75% of the teachers have to agree. At 
Arminta Street School in North Hollywood, teachers fell one vote short of the 
required number. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some people who have been here a long time -- who are the status 
quo-type people," said Larry McCall, the assistant principal at Arminta. "Any 
school that has problems, it's probably because of the long-timers." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Hergesheimer, principal at Camellia Avenue Elementary in North Hollywood, 
where 91% of the teachers approved the plan, said it took the staff several 
months to decide whether to apply. She said the school had meetings with other 
LEARN campuses, interviewed teachers and principals and had speakers on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turning point for me and the teachers was when we started to figure out 
that it wasn't a list of changes or reforms," Hergesheimer said. "We wanted the 
definitions -- we wanted the rules, the format and the logistics. We still 
don't have it defined . . . but we really need to help our students be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN schools are asking for more financial independence and the school board 
will probably have to intervene in funding disputes, Bernstein said, adding 
that she believes the schools should be given more financial autonomy. The 
school board will take up the issue on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 LEARN officials must also raise the money for intensive training that will 
begin this summer for the new group of schools. The training will cost about 
$40,000 per campus and LEARN officials estimate they need to raise about $2.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Roos said the group has so far received $600,000 -- including a recent 
$500,000 grant from the Ahmanson Foundation and $100,000 from the Annenburg 
Foundation. But while Roos admits he has much more to raise, he says he is 
confident he will meet the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the money issues, the LEARN program is also fending off attacks 
from members of the teachers union who complain that the effort strips teachers 
of rights won after bitter strikes and contract disputes. The union's 
300-member House of Representatives agreed last week, in a heated meeting, to 
support the teachers at LEARN schools. Some members of the union had asked that 
the union take a position against LEARN. 
</P>
<P>
 Roos, however, said he remains optimistic about LEARN. "It's an evolving

PROSECUTORS WILL FIGHT NICHOLSON'S LEGAL MOVE; COURTS: THE ACTOR PLANS A 'CIVIL 
COMPROMISE' OVER CHARGES STEMMING FROM A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER MOTORIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Prosecutors said Tuesday that they will fight a proposal to be made next week 
by Jack Nicholson, who wants charges of attacking a Mercedes-Benz effectively 
dismissed because he settled a civil lawsuit with the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 An arraignment for the Oscar award-winning actor was delayed for the third 
time Tuesday so that the victim can appear in court next week and testify about 
the financial settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson's attorney, Charles R. English, for the first time Tuesday publicly 
acknowledged that he will ask a judge to stall prosecution in a legal move 
known as a "civil compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 English will make the motion, which could effectively dismiss the misdemeanor 
charges of assault and vandalism, Monday in Van Nuys Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 California law allows a judge to permanently stay misdemeanor criminal actions 
if the victim receives compensation as a result of a civil lawsuit. A civil 
compromise effectively dismisses the charges in a case and prevents authorities 
from later prosecuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Skirting the issue of Nicholson's fame and focusing on the "level of 
violence," Deputy City Atty. Jeff Harkavy said he opposes a civil compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson allegedly used a three-iron golf club to smash the hood and 
windshield of Robert Scott Blank's car following a traffic dispute Feb. 8 near 
the intersection of Moorpark Way and Riverside Drive in Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 English contended in court that Blank, a 38-year-old Hollywood resident who 
received an undisclosed sum to settle his lawsuit, will testify in favor of a 
civil compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkavy said that was not his understanding. Blank must agree to the civil 
compromise or else violate the terms of the settlement he negotiated with 
Nicholson, according to the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Blank is not free to come in and say he does not want a civil 
compromise," Harkavy said, "or else he would be sued by Nicholson." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is of course a concern," Harkavy acknowledged, "that the public may 
perceive that people like Mr. Nicholson can buy their way out of trouble, but 
that is not the reason we are opposing a civil compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said his position comes from the allegation that Nicholson 
swung the golf club "toward the victim's face" to either injure or intimidate 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkavy said Blank received minor injuries when glass from the windshield 
struck him in the face. English said the windshield was slightly damaged, with 
the shattered section only two inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson, who recently appeared in the film "A Few Good Men," won an Academy 
Award in 1975 for his portrayal of a mental patient in "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest."

HUGHES SAYS BULK OF MOVE FROM VALLEY TO BE FINISHED BY AUGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Setting a specific date for the first time, Hughes Aircraft Co. said that by 
August, most of its missile design work at its facility in Canoga Park will be 
moved to Tucson, effectively ending 28 years of operations in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A company newsletter issued Friday said that by August, fewer than 200 workers 
will be left at the Hughes Missile Systems Co. facility, which as of last month 
employed 1,200 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 By October, just a few workers will remain, the newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes first announced the move out of Canoga Park in March, 1993, citing an 
economic need to locate engineering and manufacturing at a single site. Since 
then, Hughes Missile has been slowly moving operations to Tucson as facilities 
were being built at its new headquarters site. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Missile staff, which includes a few hundred Ph.D.s, pioneered the 
development of guided missiles for the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of its units to be moved will be its RF Simfax operations, where a 
missile's performance is tested against simulated targets, the newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Hughes' buildings in its huge complex were severely damaged by the 
Northridge earthquake, but the quake did not slow the company's move to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the newsletter, Bob Knowles, Hughes Missile's vice president, said the 
company plans to hire a management company to maintain the site until it can be 
sold. Hughes Missile officials could not be reached Tuesday.

GROUP SAYS HATE GROUPS TARGETING VALLEY STUDENTS; EDUCATION: ANTI- DEFAMATION 
LEAGE TELLS LAS VIRGENES BOARD TO FIGHT RACIST FLYERS THAT ARE BEING PUT IN 
STUDENT LOCKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Racist hate groups are trying harder to recruit San Fernando Valley 
schoolchildren, and officials should aggressively combat the vicious flyers 
that are continuing to show up in student lockers, according to the Valley 
Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 The ADL on Tuesday night took its concerns to the board of the Las Virgenes 
Unified School District, the site of the most recent incident, and plans to go 
tonight to the William S. Hart Union High School District in Santa Clarita. A 
Santa Clarita junior high was targeted in March with hate leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever is doing this -- it may be one person, it may be several -- is making 
an attempt to lure young people into this movement," said Valley ADL Director 
Mary Krasn. "We're trying to turn something ugly into something positive. These 
(flyers) create an atmosphere where hatemongers can take it a step further, and 
that's what we want to prevent." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to raising awareness about what the ADL says is an emerging 
pattern of racist groups targeting schoolchildren, Krasn said her group has 
suggested better prejudice-awareness training for teachers and students; 
increased campus security to prevent trespassers from distributing flyers; 
formation of an inter-ethnic coalition to fight hate campaigns; education and 
recruitment of Valley legislators; and educating law enforcement officers about 
the limits of First Amendment free speech rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent leaflet campaign, about 200 students at Calabasas High 
School last Friday found anti-Latino and anti-Jewish leaflets in their lockers. 
At the bottom of an epithet-filled poem maligning Latinos and their "Kosher Kop 
protectors," is a number for the White Aryan Resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Naomi Perl, office manager at Calabasas High School, said students brought the 
flyers to the principal's office, and to teachers and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are outraged that someone would come on our campus and would say such 
things," Perl said. "They are disgusting and vile. Nobody is interested in 
these kinds of messages here." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, sets of four anti-Semitic flyers with demeaning caricatures and 
threats against Jewish people were put in about 70 lockers in La Canada High 
School and the Ability Plus School, also in the La Canada/Flintridge area. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, student lockers at Agoura Hills High School and Westlake High 
School in Thousand Oaks were stuffed with similar literature and racist 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools throughout Orange County have reported more incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how successful the people who are distributing this racist 
materials have been," Krasn said. "One thing we do know is that it has sparked 
a lot of concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clearly time to act."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; H. CLYDE SMYTH STILL COMES OUT ON TOP AFTER 
RECOUNT; ELECTION: IN RACE FOR THIRD COUNCIL SEAT, JILL KLAJIC IS DEFEATED BY 
15 VOTES IN TALLY REQUESTED BY HER CAMPAIGN MANAGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 H. Clyde Smyth has won a seat on the City Council for the third time in two 
weeks, edging out Jill Klajic by 15 votes in a recount Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic's campaign manager, Skip Newhall, requested another electronic tally of 
the ballot last week when the more than 10,400 ballots turned in to Santa 
Clarita precincts April 12 showed Smyth edging the incumbent for the third seat 
by 16 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly satisfied by the count," said Newhall, who peppered election 
workers with questions about the tallying process during the two-hour recount 
Tuesday morning. "One vote is certainly within the bounds of error." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third time that Smyth, former superintendent of the William S. 
Hart Union High School District, appeared as the winner for the election's 
third seat behind incumbents Jo Anne Darcy and Carl Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Election night results showed him with an eight-vote lead, but 174 absentee 
and provisional votes were still uncounted. When those were counted 36 hours 
later, Smyth had doubled the margin to 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall said he asked for the recount because Klajic's supporters otherwise 
"would always wonder 'what if?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth edged Klajic by 3,807 to 3,792 votes, according to the recount. Most 
candidates' vote totals shifted slightly in the new tally, but not enough to 
alter the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised it changed at all," said Klajic, who had been skeptical about 
winning back the third seat with the recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Klajic, 47, said she will remain active in Santa Clarita causes such as 
battling a proposed dump in Elsmere Canyon. She's undecided about running for 
office in 1996, saying she won't rule out the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first recount in the history of Santa Clarita, which became a city 
in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I can put this to bed, put this away and go back to normal," City 
Clerk Donna Grindey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyth expressed similar sentiments, but restated his comments of the past two 
weeks that he supports the democratic process and therefore the recount 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no animosity," said Smyth, 62. "How could you be upset at anyone that 
exercises their rights as a citizen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever requests a recount is charged for the staff time and supplies used, 
making a count by hand much more expensive than simply running ballots through 
the computer as is done election night. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's electronic recount took about two hours and will cost $276.32 -- 
about half the time and cost originally estimated, Grindey said. Recounting by 
hand was projected to take five days and would have cost $6,840. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall said that $145 in donations have come in for the recount and that $130 
remains in Klajic's campaign account.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HEARING BEGINS IN STRANGLING OF MARTIAL ARTS 
EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Testimony began Tuesday at a hearing for a martial arts instructor charged 
with murdering a nationally ranked Taekwondo competitor with whom he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, faces the death penalty if convicted of strangling 
Veronica Estrada, 29, while she was walking along Soledad Canyon Road in Canyon 
Country the night of Dec. 15. A preliminary hearing to determine whether 
Milburn will stand trial on first-degree murder charges with three special 
circumstances of lying in wait, committing forcible sodomy and attempted rape 
began in Newhall Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, a Canyon Country resident, was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s 
top-ranked female competitor in the second-level black belt division and was 
named instructor of the year at Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country, where she 
primarily taught 5- to 8-year-old students. Milburn, a former Canyon Country 
resident, was also a black belt instructor, and prosecutors said jealousy of 
her achievements and previous disputes between them may have led to the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Three witnesses told investigators that they saw portions of an apparent 
struggle between a man and a woman, and each of the witnesses picked Milburn 
from a photo lineup of six men, testified Sgt. Doral Riggs, a homicide 
detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. One witness, told 
sheriff's officials that she drove by a woman and a taller man standing at the 
side of Soledad Canyon Road about 8:15 p.m. Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "As she got closer, the taller person grabbed the shorter person by the 
shoulder or neck and pulled (the shorter person) over the embankment," Riggs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's partially clothed body was discovered hidden in brush the next day. 
Coroner's officials said she died of strangulation, possibly during or after a 
sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn's attorney, Darryl Mounger, said there is no physical evidence linking 
Milburn to Estrada's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he intends to present defense witnesses today, a rare occurrence at a 
preliminary hearing, where the prosecution is merely required to show that 
there is a strong suspicion the suspect is guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my intention to cast doubt on the identification of my client and on 
the credibility of the investigation," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NIXON OBSERVANCE MAY COST SCHOOL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The national day of mourning declared by President Clinton in honor of Richard 
Nixon may turn out to be a costly gesture for the Antelope Valley Union High 
School District, which is recovering from a $14-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 A clause in the district's contract with its classified employees requires it 
to pay those workers 2 1/2 times their standard pay when they work on a day of 
mourning or similar officially declared national observance. The 12,500-student 
district will remain open today. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials estimate that today's national observance to honor the 37th 
President who died Friday will cost them an additional $30,000 over the $20,000 
in daily payroll costs for the 300 classified employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a shame we have to spend money that way," said Norm Miller, the 
fiscal adviser who was assigned by the Los Angeles County Office of Education 
to oversee the district's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school district was discovered to be facing a multimillion-dollar 
deficit more than two years ago. The district was forced to lay off employees, 
slash programs and borrow $8 million from the county. The final loan payment is 
expected to be made at the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Girolamo, superintendent of the Antelope Valley district, said the 
district hopes to be able to avoid paying the $30,000. Once contacted about the 
issue by the classified employees union, Girolamo said the district will 
propose offering a vacation day to the employees later in the year or during 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting state superintendent of public instruction, notified 
school districts Tuesday that schools are not required to close and that the 
decision to do so "remains a local option." 
</P>
<P>
 Girolamo said the district chose to stay open primarily because it needs to 
meet the minimum 175 days of instruction mandated by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the days, it's not an option," he said. "There's a point it's 
more important to have schools open for the kids."

VALLEY BRIEFING: QUAKE DAMAGE UPDATE; ASSESSMENT OF VALLEY DESTRUCTION RISES BY 
A THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new assessment of building inspection records has placed the total 
earthquake damage to structures in the San Fernando Valley at more $1.22 
billion, a jump of 35% from the previously reported figure. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times' computer ZIP code analysis of the new information released by the Los 
Angeles City Building and Safety Department shows some changes in the quirky 
distribution of earthquake damage, as reported in a February study. 
</P>
<P>
 Shown is a comparison by ZIP code of estimates of the cost to rebuild damaged 
structures and the number of buildings deemed either unsafe or safe only for 
limited entry. The largest increase occurred in Northridge (ZIP code 91324), 
where the estimate of damage more than doubled to $199 million from $97 million 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 That increase eclipsed Sherman Oaks as the community incurring the most damage 
in the Jan. 17 earthquake. Still, both Sherman Oaks and Canoga Park had more 
damage ta several communities closer to the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The new estimate largely reflects a refinement of the method of analysis 
rather than the discovery of new damage, said Times computer analyst Richard 
O'Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier toll of $902 million was derived by a computer math of building 
inspection reports with the Los Angeles County Tax rolls. A percentage of the 
properties did not match properly. Recently, the Building and Safety Department 
completed a manual tally of tax assessments for each damaged property. Repair 
cost estimates and damage by ZIP code: 91040 Cost: $636,570 Limited entry: 5 
Unsafe: 1 * 91042 Cost: $368,500 Limited entry: 5 * 91303 Cost: $24,034,002

PROBLEM SOLVING IS FOREMOST IN UCI JOB; PROFILE: AIDE TO ASSISTANT VICE 
CHANCELLOR IS PART OF A SMALLER STAFF DOING MORE. COMPUTER SKILLS HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Doing more with less is the imperative at UC Irvine, which is paring its staff 
to cope with a budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Few are feeling the pressure more than secretarial workers like Ross Goo, 
administrative aide to Assistant Vice Chancellor Davida Hopkins-Parham. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reorganization has meant more work, but we have fewer people," said Goo, 
29. "Tasks were assigned to certain individuals, but they are no longer here. 
So I have to go in and without any assistance figure out how they did it 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges Goo faces might be as simple as answering other people's phones 
or as complicated as doing elaborate data searches. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goo said he thrives on the challenges. One of his biggest assets, he says, 
is computer skills that help him streamline his work. 
</P>
<P>
 When an urgent request for information was sent recently to a person who was 
no longer in the office, Goo said, he was able to find the data in the computer 
system and transmit it electronically on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so much easier to do that," he said. "I like seeing a problem get 
resolved and knowing that I contributed to it. I want to own my own work and 
not just be an automaton doing what someone says." 
</P>
<P>
 Being an employee of UCI has a certain irony for Goo, who graduated from the 
university in 1990 with a degree in film studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a student here, I'd complain and say, 'Oh, UCI gave me nothing.' But now I 
see that they taught me how to solve problems, how to step back and take a look 
at the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Goo is also breaking gender stereotypes. Friends sometimes tease him about 
being a male secretary to a female executive, he said, but that doesn't trouble 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most administrative assistants, male or female, know the answers to things 
people are calling about and can help them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His boss said Goo's good organizational skills and lively sense of humor help 
to ensure his success on the job. She, too, hears comments about the gender of 
her assistant, but takes them in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman wanted to schedule an appointment with me, and I told her to just 
call Ross and set it up," Hopkins-Parham said. "She was surprised . . . and 
said 'Wow, you have a male!' " 
</P>

O.C.'S FIDELITY MOVES IN ON US FACILITIES; ACQUISITIONS: TITLE INSURER COMES ON 
STRONG, OFFERING $15 A SHARE AND SAYING IT WILL FIGHT IF THE COSTA MESA COMPANY 
REFUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fidelity National Financial Inc., the nation's fifth-largest title insurance 
company, said Tuesday it wants to buy a Costa Mesa insurer for $79 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In its proposal to acquire US Facilities Corp. for $15 a share in cash, 
Fidelity National also said it is prepared to launch a proxy fight if its offer 
is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came on pretty strong," said Mark Matheson, an analyst with Crowell, 
Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. "Usually, these things start out a little more 
friendly, with a softer tone." 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities will review the proposal during a special board meeting on 
Friday, spokeswoman Rosemary L. Mulligan said Tuesday. The company would not 
comment further on the unsolicited bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger proposal sent US Facilities' stock soaring $2.56 a share to close 
at $13.56 in Tuesday's Nasdaq trading. Fidelity National shares slipped 37.5 
cents to close at $17.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity National, which used acquisitions and mergers to expand into a major 
force in the title insurance industry, in February signaled its intention to 
make additional acquisitions by completing a note offering that raised $90.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity National President William P. Foley II, in a lengthy letter delivered 
Monday to US Facilities Chairman George Kadonada, said his company wants to 
complete a "friendly, negotiated merger." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fidelity National also filed preliminary proxy materials on Tuesday with 
the federal Securities and Exchange Commission in case US Facilities refuses to 
consider the offer and a proxy fight develops, said Frank P. Willey, Fidelity 
National executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's letter also noted that Fidelity National has accumulated 471,450 
shares, or 8.2%, of US Facilities' common stock in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities on Tuesday took the unusual step of releasing the complete text 
of Foley's letter, which provides considerable detail about Fidelity National's 
proposal. Industry observers said that the letter leaves little doubt that 
Foley intends to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance industry observers said that the proposed combination would make 
sense for Fidelity National. While its title insurance is directly tied to 
interest rate fluctuations, US Facilities' two subsidiaries, which offer 
medical insurance and property and casualty reinsurance, are not driven by such 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Foley needs to diversify out of his primary business," said Jeffrey 
Kilpatrick, president of the brokerage Newport Securities in Newport Beach. "He 
faces falling interest rates and a falling-off in the massive number of home 
refinancings." 
</P>
<P>
 Willey said that the deal would give US Facilities -- which he described as a 
"well-run company" -- access to management skills that helped Irvine-based 
Fidelity National become the nation's fifth-largest title insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Bill Foley is going to try and work his magic in a new niche in 
the insurance industry," Matheson said. "He's done so well in the title 
insurance industry that he thinks he can do things in the niches where US 
Facilities operates." 
</P>
<P>
 One observer who is familiar with US Facilities described the company as 
"noticeably undervalued. . . . It's a gem of a company. Its book value is $11 
(per share), and its medical business is growing by 20% a year. That alone 
makes it a terrific company." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, US Facilities' board members initiated a stock buy-back, 
signaling their belief that the company is worth more than its price per share. 
US Facilities said at the time that it would repurchase as much as $5 million 
worth of additional stock during coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity National is the only other large, publicly traded company in Orange 
County that has recently announced a stock buy-back. The company said March 31 
that it might repurchase as many as 1 million of its shares. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities said Tuesday that any deal would face close scrutiny by a number 
of insurance regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, who is well known in the title insurance industry, gained local 
prominence in late 1993 when he pieced together an investor group that acquired 
a controlling interest in Carl Karcher Enterprises, parent company of the 
Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley's group won the stock by helping founder Carl N. Karcher refinance 
personal debt that was secured with Karcher Enterprises stock. Foley and Willey 
later joined Karcher's board of directors along with fellow investor Daniel D. 
(Ron) Lane, and Foley subsequently was elected chairman of the fast-food 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities reported a $6.8-million profit for 1993 on revenue of $112 
million. Fidelity National reported earnings of $36.3 million on revenue of 
$575.4 million.

MONARCH BANK PLANS STOCK OFFER; FINANCE: IF APPROVED BY REGULATORS, INSTITUTION 
WILL ISSUE $2.5 MILLION TO $7 MILLION IN NEW SHARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Monarch Bank, starting a five-year expansion plan, said Tuesday it hopes to 
issue $2.5 million to $7 million in new stock to its own shareholders and to 
the investing public next week, if state and federal regulators approve the 
offering by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-branch community bank had planned to raise money this year as it 
launched a growth plan, said Lynn Caswell, the bank's president.A $1.1-million 
net loss last year has created more impetus for the offering. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said it would use about $1.1 million of the proceeds to raise its 
level of capital, its final reserve against losses. It moved some existing 
capital into reserve last year to cover possible future loan losses, causing 
the bank to report a net loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Holders of the nearly 800,000 shares outstanding will have a right for 30 days 
to purchase part of the 2.33 million shares being offered. At the same time, 
the public will have 60 days to pick up the rest. Caswell said the offering 
would go public in 12 states across the nation, including New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills institution also said that it erred in filing year-end 
financial figures with federal regulators, leading to a vastly overstated 
amount of problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch said its delinquent loans -- those 60 days or more past due -- were 
actually 8.38% of its total loans at the end of December, not 17.5% as reported 
earlier. Regulators want problem loans to remain below 3%.

TIGHTENED PINK-COLLAR RANKS CALL FOR HIGH-TECH SAVVY; OFFICE: COMPUTER ADVANCES 
ARE CUTTING THE DEMAND FOR O.C. SECRETARIES. THOSE WHO SURVIVE WILL BE 
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If an Orange County secretary were asked to take a letter on Professional 
Secretaries Day today regarding the future of the profession, it might start 
like this: Dr secys, thr r going 2 b ls of u in cming yrs b-cuz yng execs r 
lrning 2 type 2.  
</P>
<P>
 Translation: The pink-collar ranks are beginning to thin because young 
managers are increasingly computer literate and are more inclined to write 
their own letters than dictate them to someone else. Other technological 
advances, like voice mail and electronic messaging, are also cutting down on 
the need for secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, demand for secretaries is expected to increase by 5.4% 
through 1998, less than the 5.7% growth rate projected for all jobs, according 
to the state Employment Development Department. The difference is even more 
dramatic when weighed against the 7.6% growth expected in government and 9.6% 
gain anticipated in the services sector, both of which have historically 
employed large numbers of secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we get into the computer age, people will do their own word processing," 
said Eleanor Jordan, the EDD's labor market analyst for Orange County. "Office 
automation and technical change will bring slow growth in some occupations and 
an actual decline in others." 
</P>
<P>
 What is happening in Orange County reflects a nationwide phenomenon. Harvard 
labor economist James Medoff reports that secretarial ranks nationwide shrank 
8% from 1983 to 1993 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans in the field are feeling the effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secretary's role has changed so much," said Priscilla Nielsen, executive 
secretary to Anaheim Stadium Manager Greg Smith. "The old way of calling you in 
with your note pad and sitting across the desk is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Though their numbers are declining, many secretaries are keeping their jobs 
and becoming more valuable in their organizations. Those who will succeed are 
the ones who upgrade their skills, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Barbara M. Rier, longtime secretary to Orange County Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley, can recite the long list of computer programs she has learned. 
She now has the kind of versatility that would have been uncommon among 
secretaries a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rier said she takes virtually every computer class offered by the county. And 
when Riley retires later this year, she intends to apply for a position as a 
staff analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Linda Doggett of Professional Secretaries International, a 
44,000-member trade group based in Kansas City, Mo., said: "Secretaries are 
having to know more technical skills besides word processing because they are 
doing a wider range of tasks." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider John Wolfson, a partner in the Costa Mesa office of Deloitte & 
Touche, the national accounting firm. Wolfson types his own letters, so by the 
time they go to administrative assistant Tamara Torosian, they are nearly 
letter perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean he is putting Torosian out of a job. Rather, Wolfson 
said, his decision to write his own letters rather than dictate frees Torosian 
for more important tasks, such as setting up billing processes or arranging for 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's secretary, Wolfson said, "is not the 'go-fer.' " Rather, he or she is 
"an integral part of the operation." 
</P>
<P>
 And electronics will never be able to offer the personal touches that a 
secretary adds. That's why Harvard economist Medoff said he recently turned 
down an opportunity to exchange his secretary for a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "No piece of machinery could ever answer all the questions and give comfort to 
undergraduates," he said, adding that he told his department chairman: "My 
secretary is so wonderful with students that I would like to have, if possible, 
a second secretary." 
</P>
<P>
 Esmail Adibi, economist at Chapman University in Fullerton, said that the 
benefits of direct human contact ensure that there will always be secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need a linkage between the executive and the outside world," he said. 
"The secretary serves as that linkage." Endangered Species: Secretary 
</P>
<P>
 With businesses keeping wages down and staffing to a minimum, the traditional 
secretary is on the way out. While they may never be replaced entirely, their 
role is changing and much of the drudgery has been shifted to computers and 
other technological devices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telephone calls: In many offices, automated phone answering systems and 
voice mail have eliminated the need to personally answer phones and jot down 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scheduling: Personal Information Management (PIM) software such as Lotus 
Organizer or Microsoft Office can scan each individual's computerized calendar 
to see when they are available, then notify them via E-mail of the proposed 
meeting time and place. Those invited RSVP electronically, and their response 
is recorded automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 * Letters and memos: Executives can call up an electronic form, type in the 
data, and print it in the proper format within minutes. Or they can send the 
item via fax/modem without ever making a printed copy. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: AST RESEARCH REVENUE UP 60%; SOME LAID-OFF WORKERS 
REHIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Computer maker AST Research Inc. matched Wall Street's expectations by 
announcing a 20% increase in earnings and a 60% increase in revenue for its 
latest fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for desktop computers was so great that AST had to recall some of 
the 450 workers it had laid off earlier at its plant in Fountain Valley, said 
Safi U. Qureshey, chairman and chief executive of AST. The workers will 
continue to produce personal computers in Fountain Valley for the next few 
months as AST expands other manufacturing operations in Texas, Ireland and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Irvine, reported a profit of $13.2 million, or 40 cents 
a share, for its third quarter, which ended March 31. That compared to earnings 
of $11 million, or 35 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. 
Three-month revenue was $591.3 million, up from $370.3 million. That 
performance was in line with what the company had projected in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Analysts changed their estimates after the company said its revenues would 
not grow 70% for the quarter," said Eugene Glazer, analyst at Dean Witter 
Reynolds investment bank in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 During the quarter, AST shipped 332,000 PCs. Sales of notebook computers, 
which weigh less than eight pounds and fit in a briefcase, rose 129% to 88,000 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer said he expects AST's new line of computers with human interface 
programs, which feature the image of a person speaking from the computer 
screen, should do well in the coming quarter. Dubbed AST Works, it uses 
technology that AST picked up when it acquired the computer assets of Tandy 
Corp. last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the company is late with a new line of portable computers known as 
subnotebooks -- machines that weigh several pounds. Competitors such as Toshiba 
America Information Systems in Irvine and Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston 
already have such models on the market. Qureshey said AST is waiting until that 
market becomes better defined and expects to launch a subnotebook line by the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first three quarters of its fiscal year, AST earned $39.4 million, or 
$1.18 a share. That compared to a profit of $33.3 million, or $1.04 a share, 
for the same period a year earlier. Nine-month sales were $1.78 billion, up 
from $1 billion. DEAN TAKAHASHI

the company's third fiscal quarter, which ended March 31, increased 2% to $5.3 
million from $5.2 million. Year-to-date profit totaled $828,200, or 27 cents a

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; HOW ONE MAN CAN BE REMEMBERED IN SUCH DIVERSE WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS, TIMES COLUMNIST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon lets us all play the historian. Given that his public life 
coincided with the emergence of the modern communications industry, we have no 
shortage of pictures and words on which to base our judgment. You'd think our 
task would be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Checkers speech. The kitchen debate with Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Nixon 
debates. The Watergate press conferences. The resignation speech. The David 
Frost interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike with other heroes and villains in America's past, we in the modern age 
feel less reliance on historians for judgments. We can't know for sure what 
George Washington was really like, or what Billy the Kid was really like. But 
when it comes to the major figures of our time, we're under no such handicap: 
We saw what we saw, we heard what we heard. 
</P>
<P>
 So how come we didn't all see and hear the same things when it comes to 
Richard Nixon? 
</P>
<P>
 The instinctive reaction is to say that the reflecting pool of partisan 
politics refracts light and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Though certainly no extremist, Nixon played partisan politics for much of his 
life. That in itself would have been enough to engender mixed feelings about 
him. As much as anyone, he reveled in the knockdown, drag-out nature of the 
skirmishing and preferred bare knuckles to gloves. One is tempted to say this 
physically awkward, lifelong piano player couldn't fight with his fists, so he 
forged his manhood by fighting with brains and guile. 
</P>
<P>
 To anyone who understands that context, it's an easy leap to understand that 
being a man and playing hardball meant being not only able to dish it out, but 
also to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How Nixon loved to dish it out. But he prided himself on taking it, as well. 
He thought the Kennedys may have cheated him in 1960, but he took it and didn't 
challenge the election, although some historians think he may have had a case. 
He decided after the 1972 election that he was going to let his enemies have 
it. Instead of rising above the fray and saying, "No, we won't play the game 
that way," Nixon said, "Oh, so that's the way they want to play it, huh . . . 
?" 
</P>
<P>
 Had he chosen the former, no one would be debating his place in contemporary 
American history. 
</P>
<P>
 And though he no doubt thought the media and other enemies stole the 
presidency from him in 1974, he took it then, too -- in the sense that he 
decided almost immediately that he wouldn't let it destroy him. To have given 
in would have proved others had gotten the best of him. Better to set sights on 
another battle ahead -- the battle to regain credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 And from what we've heard in recent days, much of the outpouring of affection 
toward Nixon stems from the fact that he "took it." He absorbed the most public 
humiliation of any President in history, and he took it. And survived it. For 
large segments of the American population, that amounted to an honorable deed. 
In some quarters, it accords him hero status. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most of the talk since Nixon's death has centered not on politics but 
on personality. The words heard most frequently to describe him seem to be 
"complicated," "enigmatic" and "dark side/bright side" splits. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason we may find that fascinating today is that it's so unlike 
the vogue. With celebrities and public figures surrendering to a manic desire 
to tell us everything about themselves, from repressed memories to their inner 
child, Nixon appeared not to know or care about such things. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should he worry about 15 minutes of fame when he'd had nearly 50 years of 
it? Just eschewing today's pop culture elevated Nixon's status in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The country's central ambivalence toward Nixon's life, of course, centers on 
his presidential years of 1969 to 1974. What came before and what came after 
only served to frame that critical 5 1/2 years in his and our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon reflected much of American folklore in that he often spoke in homilies 
-- never give up, forgive your enemies, do what you think is right. Those 
sentiments make up part of our collective national storehouse of "traditional 
values," and, as such, drew many people to Richard Nixon's side. 
</P>
<P>
 The persistent question was whether you believed him or not. Some accepted 
what he said at face value; others saw it as someone who had memorized the 
catechism but couldn't live its teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 Another crucial factor in public feeling about Nixon is that his presidency 
occurred during the fermenting of intense generational and racial splits in the 
country. To the Silent Majority to which he catered, Nixon represented the 
sentry at the gate -- an Establishment bulwark against the longhairs and civil 
rights activists who seemed intent on turning everything upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 To people worried about the future of the country, the politics of Watergate 
seemed trivial, indeed. As such, many people didn't pay attention. Despite its 
place in modern political drama, we should remember that many people didn't 
bother to immerse themselves in the details at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 If not blissful, ignorance can at least be soothing. While many look back in 
disgust at a President talking in the White House about perjury and paying hush 
money to burglars, many others today talk of a President who, at worst, "made a 
few mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If it's important that average Americans make their judgments about Nixon, we 
probably should note that average Americans are probably more forgiving than 
historians. The academics have to write books with their names on them; average 
citizens only have to live with their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians can't afford to overlook Watergate. The average citizen can if he 
or she wants to. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latter regard, Nixon probably caught a break. As a lover of history, 
maybe he knew better than most that time passes. It gets easier all the time to 
forget how wrenching and dispirited the American political scene was by the 
time Nixon resigned the presidency. Because this is a forgiving society, most 
people have put it behind them. Twenty years is a long time for anyone to hold 
a grudge. Just as we do with relatives with whom we fought while they were 
alive, we tend to remember their better attributes after they're gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein is the question that Richard Nixon makes us confront, and our response 
probably says something about us as a people: 
</P>
<P>
 How much should we forgive? How much should we forget?

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; ORANGE COUNTY REMEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "In 1972, when I was barely 7 years old, I shook Richard Nixon's hand after he 
exited his helicopter and was being taken by a golf cart to his residence at 
Casa Pacifica. I will never forget the energized crowd chanting 'Four More 
Years,' the signs, pomp and pageantry. . . . When they tore down the building 
that housed Nixon's first law office in La Habra (my hometown) I stopped and 
took one of the bricks that was part of the building. I keep it knowing it will 
bring inspiration to be, as enlightened a thinker as was Richard M. Nixon." -- 
Peter J. Sterling, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 5 years old, and Nixon and daddy would get together in the living room. 
We had this big green stuffed rocking chair and as a little girl I'd sit in his 
lap and hear his deep voice and I just idolized him. . . . You know how it is 
when somebody walks into a room and you feel their power? Well, you knew when 
he was in a room." -- Linda Day Baker, Newport Beach, daughter of Nixon's first 
campaign manager 
</P>
<P>
 "My fondest memory of Richard Nixon is the $50 bet I collected from former 
Rep. James B. Utt in 1962. Utt disputed my prediction that Pat Brown would 
easily defeat Nixon and asked me o put my money where my mouth was. Watergate 
and Nixon's criminal role in it came as no surprise to me, because of his 
history of viciously smearing political opponents, starting with Jerry Voorhis 
and Helen Gahagan Douglas. In addition, dirty tricks were a hallmark of every 
campaign he ran." -- Carroll C. Gewin, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1960, immediately following the convention, he returned to Whittier to 
begin a long summer and fall campaign. I was 13 years old, and we were 
recruited to help clean up the Whittier College football stadium where he was 
to deliver a speech following a downtown parade. As our reward for helping 
clean the stadium and help construct the podium area . . . the Secret Service 
gave us a ride around the stadium track aboard the Secret Service car. At 13 
years old, we were delighted and thrilled." -- Todd Nicholson, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 "The Watergate fiasco and its consequent damage to the presidency overshadow 
any of Richard Nixon's accomplishments, not because the debacle occurred under 
his watch, but because he lied to the American people." -- Michael C. Westlund, 
Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon was a great President, the best and greatest statesman in the century. 
He was a wonderful man." -- Michael J. Chu, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my earliest childhood memories goes back to 1962 when Richard Nixon 
ran for governor of California. We lived a few blocks from one of his campaign 
stops, Stonewood Mall in Downey, and my parents took us kids to see the 
spectacle. That day I became a Nixon supporter at the age of 5, much to my 
father's consternation. I would have joined the campaign, but I wasn't allowed 
to cross the street." -- Thomas D. Smith, Downey 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked for him in the '72 campaign, got to shake his hand for the first 
time at Casa Pacifica, met many celebrities and actually had a good time 
working for him. . . . I was one of his chief campus apologists at Fullerton 
High School, his alma mater, back in the 1970s. We were six-year residents of 
Yorba Linda and finally got a chance to meet him and have my picture taken with 
him in 1992 at the Nixon Library. My most vivid memory is a sign in the window 
of a bus carrying U.S. POWs to the airport to take them back to the United 
States at the end of the Vietnam War, which simply read, "God Bless Nixon." 
I'll never forget that image and hopefully nobody else will either." -- Jeff 
Weber, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we eulogize Nixon, let's not forget his vice president and all his 
lieutenants had to resign in disgrace. In fact, Spiro Agnew should have done 
jail time for bribery while in high office. Nixon's accomplishments should be 
tempered with that fact. Corruption was the rule of the day." -- William M. 
Wilson, Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 "Although he was a political and economic conservative, he never tried to 
court the religious right and activate their agenda as the law of the land. . . 
. In a way, that's as good a memory of Nixon as the foreign accomplishments he 
achieved." -- Alan Rosenstein, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about 10 years old (and living) in Beijing, China, when I first saw 
President Nixon on television. I had no idea then that this man would change my 
life. Because he normalized U.S.-China relations during that trip, my family 
and I were able to come to the United States in 1975. Today I have a wonderful 
and happy family. I feel very grateful to him.... I will miss him very much." 
-- Lydia Yu, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt misled by Richard Nixon and tried for years to understand his reasons. 
I never did. But I tried to focus on the good he accomplished. . . . Only a 
fool would say Nixon's many successes were not diminished by Watergate. I will 
remember the Nixon who was admired by his classmates in college, who served his 
country with honor in World War II, and especially for his love and devotion to 
family. I hope Richard Nixon the man will be remembered by history, and not 
Nixon the politician -- but for some this may be very difficult." -- George 
Grupe, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "I met him at his niece Maureen's wedding in the late 1960s. I was struck by 
his willingness to visit the wedding guests in the receiving line, and then 
allow the wedding to take place without any grandstanding or politicking. . . . 
To see him marching down the aisle before the wedding party, hearing the song 
Hail to the Chief, will always be in my memory and his graciousness at the 
party always will too." -- Carolyn Williams, Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 "July 7, 1969, I received a call from a staff member at the White House 
saying, 'President Nixon would like to have you preach at the White House next 
Sunday.' I went to Washington on the Saturday before the 13th day of July . . . 
and visited with the family. But before being escorted to the East Room, (which 
was) filled with invitees from Supreme Court justices to senators and 
representatives, I had the privilege of a private conversation with the 
President for about a half-hour. It was a very great experience in my life, one 
which I will never forget, and I am forever thankful for the opportunity that I 
had." -- Paul Noren, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1969, as editor of the Anti-Defamation League's national publication, I 
reported on President Nixon's warm reception of then-Prime Minister Golda Meir 
on the White House lawn before some 300 guests, including American Jewish 
leaders. . . . In an exchange of toasts at dinner, President Nixon said: 'The 
people of Israel deserve peace -- not the fragile peace that comes with the 
kinds of documents that neither party has an interest in keeping -- but the 
kind of peace that will last.' In her concluding remarks, Golda Meir thanked 
Nixon for 'enabling me to go home and tell my people that we have a great and 
dear friend."' -- Lynne Ianniello, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "My memory is from September of 1979, when my family was vacationing in the 
Fiji Islands. We were dying to know how the Angels were doing in the playoffs. 
One morning, the local Fiji newspaper had a front page photograph of Bobby 
Grich pouring Champagne over Nixon's head. The Angels had won the division, and 
Nixon was in the clubhouse celebrating with the players. It was a terrific 
thing to see." -- Betty Betts, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the naval aide present at a small reception in the White House in 
January, 1969, between the Inaugural Parade and the Inaugural Ball when we 
installed President Nixon. I met his family, and a few select friends such as 
Sen. Everett Dirksen, who played a duet on the piano with his boyhood piano 
teacher. It was quite a time." -- Charles McKenna, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll remember Richard Nixon as being our greatest modern President in the 
arena of international relations -- his recognition of China, and also detente 
with the Soviet Union. The thing I'll remember in particular is the story of 
him . . . in the White House, early in the morning, shaving his face in the 
bathroom and thinking about superpower relations while doing so. I don't think 
we've had a President since then that has those capabilities." -- Ken March, 
Orange 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up in Modesto, Calif., my father was a teacher. He took me as a 
16-year-old high schooler to hear Nixon campaign for President. We went to the 
Modesto courthouse. My father was a Democrat, but he wanted me to be aware 
politically of what was going on. Years later, I was lucky enough to attend the 
dedication of the Nixon Library in 1990." -- Judith Davis, Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he lifted conservative intellectuals, then and now, out of the morass 
of isolationism in a most visionary manner. His successors, Democrat and 
Republican, sought him out regularly for his insightful analyses, especially 
relating to the international arena. As a human being, he was one of those rare 
people who developed a symbiotic relationship with his lifelong spouse. When 
she passed away, it was only a matter of time before he would join her.... I 
think the country and the world have lost someone very special." -- Victor 
Poltrock, La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in my 20s when I remember seeing the President on TV, dodging, sneaking 
and disgracing the greatest office in our land. . . . It broke my faith in 
politicians, and I think a lot of Americans lost faith in the greatness of our 
leaders." -- Emma Emerson, Silverado Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon came to my high school when I was 14 years old. It was San Marino High, 
a very Republican town. He sat with us to have lunch, he and his wife, and he 
impressed me so much. I felt very close to him. After that, I wrote him a 
personal letter and he wrote me a letter back. I still have it and cherish it. 
I was there when he came back (to California), the day he resigned. I took my 
children to see him because I felt he was a phenomenal President." -- Peggie 
McDonald, Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1972, I was a sophomore at Georgetown University. I was active in the 
Young Democrats; opposites attract, however, and I was dating a young 
Republican. He took me to the Inaugural Ball. We were standing near where Nixon 
entered and he came over. And of all the people there, he chose to dance with 
me. He was very pleasant, very polite, and even complimented me on my dress, 
which happened to be a bridesmaid's gown which I had made over for the 
occasion. He signed my Inaugural Ball program and was soon off. I felt like 
Cinderella, and I guess it did have some impact. I married a Republican, though 
not the one that took me to the ball!" -- Jane DellaGrotta, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was in Vietnam when President Eisenhower died, and we were living 
in Salina, Kan., when President Nixon landed in Salina en route to Abilene for 
the funeral. Then I went to Vietnam -- and my citation was signed under his 
direction." -- Bob Baker, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget that final wave and salute as he left office that August 
day -- walking away from something he had worked for all of his life.... I 
never fully agreed with a lot of his political ideologies. But he certainly 
stood by them, and anyone who has that sort of belief in his own convictions is 
a man who merits respect." -- Carol Neal, Orange 
</P>
<P>
 'We raised our family in Yorba Linda and lived there 28 years. In 1968, when I 
had two small children, Richard Nixon was campaigning for the presidency and he 
came to what was then an elementary school on the site of his birthplace and 
talked to the crowd. I had my two children with me in a stroller and it was 
mostly women and children because it was during the workday. He got out of his 
limo (there were no Secret Service I could see), climbed up on the car and 
spoke to the crowd. One of the things I remember him saying was that his father 
had raised lemons on that property, and it looked like people today raised 
children." -- Mary Pat Anderson, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 "President Richard M. Nixon's 1969 Inaugural Ball was to me indeed an affair 
to remember.... Although the delay in appearance of the official party was 
anticipated, the stuffiness of the crowd, together with repeated waltz 
renditions by Meyer Davis' Society Orchestra, little by little permitted 
boredom to cause growing restlessness.... I requested the '12th Street Rag' in 
order to dance to a more suitable tempo, and I was doing a solo buck and wing, 
cane and all, across the uncrowded floor, when suddenly 'Hail to the Chief' 
supplanted the '12th Street Rag' and the Nixon and Eisenhower families made 
their grand entrance.... Much chagrined, I continued to the far end of the 
ballroom where a wall became my saving grace. Years later, I had occasion to 
discuss this with Nixon. His comment: 'So you're the SOB who screwed up my 
entrance!' I found he was comfortable, considerate ... with a finely tuned 
sense of humor." -- Robert A. Foster, Balboa 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Whittier. Richard Nixon was a constant symbolic backdrop that I 
simply accepted as part of the package, with little thought about the man or 
his work. As I grew up in the '60s, his symbolism changed, and I began 
resisting the war, politicians and all the endless rhetoric that went with it. 
Nixon represented a kind of passion about government and my peers dying that 
thankfully I have not felt since.... It wasn't until the years after Watergate 
that I began to admire Nixon as a person who not only could go on, but go on 
with dignity and determination." -- Mary Singleton, Orange 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was the election commissioner at our neighborhood polling place in 
Beverly Hills, and that is where Mr. Nixon voted. Mr. Nixon was running for 
governor at the time, and my dad was a strong supporter of his.... Nixon came 
to the polling place to cast his ballot, and he came without fanfare and at a 
very quiet time. There were no other people casting their ballots. He walked in 
and shook all of the workers' hands, and as he started to leave, my dad started 
to talk to him. He spent some time playing the piano for the workers at the 
poll.... I was fortunate later to be able to vote for him." -- J. Michael 
Lanni, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 1977, the last day of taping of the Nixon-Frost interviews. Our 
19-year-old son had a snow-skiing accident a year before, leaving him a 
paraplegic. He had a friend who lived across the street from where they were 
doing the interviewing. We decided to go there to try to catch a glimpse of 
President Nixon after the taping session.... As he exited the house and was 
standing in the doorway speaking to someone, he spotted our son in his 
wheelchair. He immediately came out to the street to shake hands with him and 
gave him a five-minute pep talk. 'What happened? Football accident? Remember 
FDR? You know he was in a wheelchair.' He then called David Frost over -- 
'Listen to this young man -- he has a great voice -- you should get him on 
television.' And he left shaking his finger at him, encouraging him to keep up 
his spirits.... What we didn't know, until we watched the series on television, 
was that was the day David Frost had come down so very hard on Nixon. Just 
another example of President Nixon's courage and resiliency. He will be greatly 
missed." -- Bill and Larrie Parks, Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 "As I followed his 1960 campaign, I began to feel as if I personally knew him 
and his family. The feeling has stayed with me throughout my career as a 
teacher.... It is our response to failure that matters, not the failure.... We 
can teach our children that you can't experience true success until you have 
faced great obstacles and challenges, often the greatest obstacle being 
ourselves. You made a great difference in my life, Richard, and I, in turn, 
have made a difference in the lives of others as I followed your journey and 
applied it to my life." -- Gloria Alkire, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 1966 or 1967 when I took my young daughters, Pamela and Leslie, to see 
Mr. Nixon when he made an appearance at his birthplace in Yorba Linda. We 
arrived early and stood just behind the red velvet rope that was stretched 
across the grounds.... As he stepped from his car and walked toward us, the 
excitement mounted and the crowd surged forward. Leslie, who was 2 or 3 at the 
time, was pushed ahead of me and knocked down, her glasses fell off and I was 
pushed backward -- unable to get ahold of her. Mr. Nixon reached her first and 
scooped her up, saving her from being stepped on.... Mr. Nixon tried to hand me 
Leslie as the crowd tried to keep us apart. I will never forget the look on his 
face, no words were necessary." -- Shirley L. Hurt, Anaheim Hills

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; REFLECTIONS ON NIXON'S LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Leaders in statecraft and students of international affairs will long look 
for guidance to President Nixon's tremendous accomplishments. He suffered 
defeats that would have ended most political careers, yet he won stunning 
victories that many of the world's most popular leaders failed to attain." -- 
President Bill Clinton 
</P>
<P>
 "To Nancy and I, he was a cherished friend and brilliant counselor. Richard 
Nixon understood the world. He understood politics, power and the fragile yet 
undeniable force of history. There is no question that the legacy of this 
complicated and fascinating man will continue to guide the forces of democracy 
forever." -- Former President Ronald Reagan 
</P>
<P>
 "As President, his foreign policy accomplishments laid important groundwork 
for efforts of the presidents who have succeeded him. . . . President Nixon 
continued to share his insight through his writings and travels throughout the 
20 years since he left office, and each of his successors has benefited from 
his counsel." -- Former President Jimmy Carter 
</P>
<P>
 "History will give Richard Nixon enormous credit for his accomplishments." -- 
Former President George Bush 
</P>
<P>
 "The Watergate tragedy ought to be closed at the present time and I hope it 
will be. It was one of the most unfortunate incidents in the history of the 
American political scene. The book's closed. Let's look forward to the future." 
-- Former President Gerald Ford 
</P>
<P>
 "His work to clean up the environment, change our nation's welfare system, 
improve law enforcement, and reform health care serves as an inspiration to us 
today as we seek to place the 'American dream' within the grasp of all our 
citizens." -- President Bill Clinton 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a fair opportunity to evaluate, he'll be seen as a terribly flawed 
leader, to be pitied because of his loneliness and his insecurity and his 
bellicosity and his vindictiveness." -- Ramsay Clark, attorney general under 
President Lyndon B. Johnson 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Nixon, with his great strategic mind and intelligence, was always in 
the arena, even when he was out of office. And he always rose above his 
defeats. He devoted his energy and mind to issues that were central. He took 
positions, he was not afraid of controversy. He is known for his brilliance in 
foreign policy, but history will recognize his immense contribution to domestic 
policy, most especially in the area of civil rights." -- George P. Shultz, 
labor and treasury secretary during the Nixon administration and secretary of 
state in the Reagan administration 
</P>
<P>
 "Long after Watergate is forgotten, his opening to China, his creation of an 
Environmental Protection Agency, his commitment to a strong America and to 
containing the Soviet empire will be remembered." -- Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
</P>
<P>
 "What history will remember is that Nixon was the only President who could go 
to China without being redbaited by Richard Nixon. People have been talking 
about how hard it was for him to govern when he was elected in 1968, because 
the country was so divided. But history will note it was divided largely 
because Nixon himself deliberately divided it." -- David Halberstam, Pulitzer 
Prize-winning journalist and author who has written extensively about the Nixon 
era 
</P>
<P>
 "There are really two Richard Nixons. There is the paranoid politician, a man 
who picked at every sore he could find on the body politic, and there in the 
same body was this overarching geopolitical thinker. You've got to find a way 
to weigh them together." -- Richard Lamm, former governor of Colorado and 
currently director of the Public Policy Institute at the University of Denver 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult to think of our party and our country's politics without 
him. There will be a hollowness, a vacuum, a void created by his absence that I 
don't know, really, who will be able to fix or replace." -- Tom Fuentes, 
chairman of the Republican Party in Orange County 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point we'll have generations of people who are not bearing the 
baggage of scandal, or Watergate, or whether he was guilty of this, or guilty 
of that. We'll see him in a broader perspective. Eventually, I think he will 
have been seen to have this vision, the ability to project Americans' interest 
into a different time frame." -- Ken Khachigian, a San Clemente political 
consultant  
</P>
<P>
 "I think history will treat him very kindly as they realize how very, very 
right he usually was. All of the Presidents that have come after him have 
recognized this and would seek his counsel." -- Lois Anne Lundberg, chair of 
Orange County GOP 1977-84 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon's life and the media are intertwined. He was made by the press and 
destroyed by the press." -- Cal State Fullerton professor Tony Fellow, who says 
Nixon's presidency helped shape the history of American media 
</P>
<P>
 "He left a great legacy in civil rights. But he hasn't gotten credit for it 
because he was conservative. He created affirmative action programs. In the 
Great Society, (President Lyndon B.) Johnson came up with social programs that 
would train blacks, but then after the money ran out, their jobs ran out, too. 
Under Nixon, affirmative action was created and that gave blacks a real 
opportunity to become employed in jobs with a future." -- J. Owens Smith, 
professor of political science at Cal State Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed after he served as Vice President he came home and tried for the 
governorship, and he didn't succeed, people said that's the end for Richard 
Nixon. But he came back -- and looking down the road from now, Orange County 
will say with pride that one of our own went all the way to the presidency and 
back, and his library will be a testament to that." -- Jim Miller, professor of 
history, English and comparative literature at Chapman University and member of 
committee to establish the Nixon Library in San Clemente in the 1970s 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people will recognize President Nixon was a man who was seeking 
peace for all." -- Walter Annenberg, philanthropist and former ambassador to 
the United Kingdom 
</P>
<P>
 "Though he did some great things in foreign policy, he was still scary in that 
he devoured government and was almost a despot."-Sid Davidoff, an aide to 
former Mayor John Lindsay of New York, a liberal Republican 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the end of an era. The man who made several decisions about Vietnam 
and Vietnamese life has disappeared. Now there are no more American politicians 
who were involved deeply in Vietnam left." -- Yen Do, editor of Nguoi Viet

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; FOR MORE YEARS; FROM '-GATES' TO 'CHECKERS,' HE MADE 
A LASTING IMPACT ON POP CULTURE

 The question posed to the two shoppers was, do you recognize these quotations? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a crook.  
</P>
<P>
 We could do that, but it would be wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 Expletive deleted.  
</P>
<P>
 No, said 28-year-old Kimm Leavitt of Fountain Valley. Dorothy Ziebel, 
Leavitt's mother, rolled her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's incredible," she said. "Those were like guaranteed punch lines back 
then: 'We could have dessert, but it would be wrong.' Everybody was saying it. 
Everybody knew what it meant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody I know my age knows about that," said Leavitt. "It doesn't matter 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Could this be true? Could Richard Nixon's pervasion of popular culture, so 
overwhelming in the late '60s and early '70s, be drawing to a close? 
</P>
<P>
 Next century, will they stop calling every Washington scandal Something-gate? 
Will winners stop using the two-fisted, overhead, V-for-victory salute? Will 
the photo of Elvis and Nixon at the White House fade from view? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was all pretty ephemeral, to tell the truth," said UC Irvine Prof. 
Jon Wiener, a specialist in recent United States history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a time when he represented everything bad about the war in 
Vietnam. There were all the off-Broadway plays, the songs, the cartoons, but 
that seems long ago and far away. . . . For people who grew up with Nixon, he 
was an unforgettable part of their lives. For those who didn't, he's just 
another dead President." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, they won't know what they missed. Richard Nixon shower heads and switch 
plates, Nixon candles and Ping-Pong paddles. Dick Nixon watches (pre-digital, 
pre-quartz). Nixon comeback T-shirts ("He's tan, he's rested, he's ready"). 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy albums, including one that set famous news conferences ("You won't have 
Nixon to kick around anymore") to music and a laugh track. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon on the "Tonight" show, joking with Jack Paar and playing the piano. 
Nixon on "Laugh-In" ("Sock it to me? "). Nixon impersonated by Rich Little and 
Dan Aykroyd ("Let me say this about that."). Nixon mocked by Rowan & Martin, 
even Sonny and Cher. Nixon savaged by the Smothers Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon parties, called to guffaw at Nixon's "Checkers" speech or his Watergate 
tapes. Hate-filled portraits and caricatures by counterculture artists. 
Reverence-filled portraits by Norman Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "In popular culture, he became a metaphor," said Mort Sahl, whose comic social 
commentary spanned the entire Nixon period. 
</P>
<P>
 "People looked at him, and he reminded them of their dark, pragmatic side," he 
said. "The audience I dealt with for years, they could never believe that Nixon 
was innocent or Reagan was guilty. I was on the 'Merv Griffin Show,' and I 
maintained that (Nixon) had been assassinated as much as Kennedy, but not with 
a gun. The audience booed me. That's how strongly they felt about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think of Nixon as the Marx Brothers; you hire them and they set out to 
tear up your house," he said. "Reagan was the Three Stooges; they tear up your 
house, too, but they try to do good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen E. Ambrose, professor of history at the University of New Orleans and 
author of the three-volume biography "Nixon," believes some of Nixon's effects 
on pop culture will be lasting. 
</P>
<P>
 " Smoking gun, that's permanent. Smoking gun wasn't invented then, but its 
meaning (irrefutable proof of guilt) became solidified," he said. "The word - 
gate and its overuse, that's permanent. Every little scandal is going to be a 
'gate.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And one item is sure to survive, he said, because of its overwhelming irony. 
</P>
<P>
 "That famous photo with Elvis (and Nixon in the White House) about which so 
much has been written and can be," Ambrose said. "Elvis, he was undoubtedly 
looped. And he's there with Mr. Stuffed Shirt who was 55 years old before he 
ever smelled marijuana, whose idea of heavy drug use was two martinis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt he ever heard an Elvis song," he said. "His interest in pop culture 
was zero. He hated avant-garde. Any change in social life, he disapproved of. 
I'm now 60 years old, and I think what's happening in the American family is 
just terrible. Old people always think that, but Nixon thought that when he was 
12 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 The only part of pop culture Nixon embraced was baseball and football, Ambrose 
said. "That was the one place where Nixon was Mr. Joe America. He really would 
spend his Sunday afternoons watching football and drinking beer." All other pop 
culture was alien to him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Nixon eschewed pop culture, pop culture embraced him, if only to deride 
him. The nastiest shots came from popular music. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Young in 1970 after National Guardsmen fired on Kent State students: "Tin 
soldiers and Nixon coming / We're finally on our own / This summer I hear the 
drumming / Four dead in Ohio." 
</P>
<P>
 John Lennon in 1971: "All I want is the truth / Just gimme some truth / No 
short-haired, yellow-bellied son of tricky Dicky / Is gonna Mother Hubbard, 
soft-soap me / With just a pocketful of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Country Joe and the Fish in 1972: "It's tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda, hip, 
hip, hooray / He walks, he talks, he smiles, he frowns / Just like a human can 
/ He's tricky Dicky from Yorba Linda / A genuine plastic man, oh yeah / A 
genuine plastic man." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoko Ono in 1972 (with doctored photo of Nixon and Mao Tse-tung dancing nude): 
"There may not be much difference / Between Chairman Mao and Richard Nixon / If 
we strip them naked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon made his way into fine art (although critics were divided on that point) 
when the opera "Nixon in China" premiered in Houston in 1987. He appeared far 
more often in less flattering stage productions off-Broadway, like "The Last 
Testament of Richard Nixon" by Donald Freed and Arnold M. Stone and "An Evening 
With Richard Nixon" by Gore Vidal. 
</P>
<P>
 Television, reflecting the "generation gap" that was resulting in violent 
street and campus confrontations, went after Nixon as an image more than a man, 
said Robert M. Batscha, president of the Museum of Television and Radio in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon was convenient because he was President," he said. "But the point is, 
the majority wanted someone who had that approach to resolving issues, and 
shows like 'Laugh-In' and 'Smothers Brothers' very much reflected the New 
Generation, as we used to call ourselves. The Smothers Brothers were considered 
to be, if not threatening, at least annoying to the social order." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's real effect on the broadcast culture was on the news side, Batscha 
said. "What happened with Watergate and Vietnam caused them to be less trusting 
of politicians and what they said, and that's had a lasting effect. The whole 
press was changed. They became more confrontational, more investigative."

 At least one man will be working to keep Nixon alive in pop culture. 
Impersonator Little says he will continue to impersonate Nixon in performance, 
although he will wait a respectful one month to resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say how long I'll be doing that, but certainly I would think for 
another 10 years," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Nixon is so easy to do, he added. "All you had to do was shake your 
jowls and say, 'I am not a crook.' Even little babies could do Richard Nixon 
because they all have the chubby cheeks."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; THE BOOK ON NIXON: NO BIOGRAPHER HAS HAD THE LAST 
WORD 
</P>

<P>
 When Richard Nixon decided to have a secret recording system installed in the 
White House, he figured the tapes of important meetings would prove invaluable 
in preparing books he might write after leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning," Nixon wrote in his memoirs, "I had decided that my 
Administration would be the best chronicled in history." 
</P>
<P>
 But the now-infamous tapes, which helped lead to his downfall, wound up 
providing more of a presidential chronicle than he bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 The man one historian describes as being "heroic, admiring and inspiring while 
simultaneously being dishonorable, despicable and a horrible example," ranks as 
the third most-written-about American President -- behind Abraham Lincoln and 
Franklin Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 From Theodore H. White's "The Making of the President, 1960" to Roger Morris' 
"The Rise of an American Politician" to Stephen E. Ambrose's three-volume 
biography, "Nixon," the 37th President of the United States has been the 
subject of scores of biographies and historical volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 USC political science professor William Lammers says there are about 120 books 
on Nixon and his political life in the university library alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Nixon's role in opening relations with China, detente with the 
Soviet Union and ending the Vietnam War assured his place in history, it is the 
drama of Watergate and his subsequent resignation to avoid impeachment that 
opened the floodgates on Nixon books.  
</P>
<P>
 Says former CBS diplomatic correspondent Marvin Kalb, who covered Nixon and is 
now director of a press-politics center at the Kennedy School of Government at 
Harvard University: 
</P>
<P>
 "All Presidents generate biographies -- even Herbert Hoover. But Nixon's 
capacity to generate copy . . . relates primarily to Watergate and then . . . 
to a number of diplomatic initiatives toward China and Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambrose, Lammers, Kalb and several other historians and political scientists 
recommend the following books for those who want to learn more about Richard 
Nixon: The Memoirs 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the Nixon memoirs, suggests Ambrose, referring to "RN: The Memoirs 
of Richard Nixon (Grosset & Dunlap, 1978), the 1,120-page opus Nixon wrote 
while in exile in San Clemente. "It absolutely is the place to start . . . and 
he makes the best case for himself that can be made in regard to the Watergate. 
Nixon, of course, basically claims innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 In a book Nixon wrote 12 years later, "In the Arena: A Memoir of Victory, 
Defeat and Renewal" (Simon and Schuster, 1990), Ambrose said Nixon also claimed 
he had nothing to do with any payoffs to the Watergate burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I point out in my third volume that . . . (in) the tape of his meeting with 
(White House counsel) John Dean, Nixon orders Dean to see to it that the money 
-- $160,000 -- would be gotten to the burglars as hush money and it be done by 
the morning, and it was. He (Nixon) just lies. . ." Watergate Titles 
</P>
<P>
 Other Watergate titles include Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's "All the 
President's Men" (Simon and Schuster, 1974) and "The Final Days" (Simon and 
Schuster, 1976), "Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon" by Theodore H. 
White (Atheneum, 1975), and "Silent Coup: The Removal of a President" by Len 
Colodny and Robert Gettlin (St. Martin's Press, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the key Watergate figures also wrote books: H. R. Haldeman's "The Ends 
of Power" (Hall, 1978), John Dean's "Blind Ambition" (Simon and Schuster, 
1976), John Ehrlichman's "Witness to Power" (Simon and Schuster, 1982). 
Recommendations 
</P>
<P>
 Lammers: "One of Us" by Tom Wicker (Random House, 1991): "It represents, to 
some extent, a more favorable view of Nixon than you would have expected, given 
Wicker's long history of supporting generally Democratic causes." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nixon Presidency: Power and Politics in Turbulent Times" (Greenwood 
Press, 1990): "a fairly scholarly book by Michael Genovese. It's substantially 
about (Nixon's) time in power and not so much his early political career." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalb: "Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician" by Roger 
Morris (Holt, 1990): "It's an excellent book -- the richness of detail and of 
scholarship; it's just beautifully written. And in class I still go back to 
'The Final Days.' I think that is about as good a book as you can get written 
in the heat of the moment and (on) a subject like Watergate."  
</P>
<P>
 James Schmidt, professor of political science and sociology at Boston 
University: "Nixon Agonistes: The Crisis of the Self-Made Man" by Garry Wills 
(Houghton Mifflin, 1969): "It's still the one to read, as it were. It's not a 
scholarly biography like Ambrose's volumes, but it attempts to talk about Nixon 
in the context of American liberalism, and he uses Nixon to talk about the 
tensions in America as a liberal society." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Schell's "The Time of Illusion" (Vintage, 1975): "It does the best 
job of tying together the Watergate period with the secret war in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Hoff-Wilson, a professor of history at Indiana University: "Richard Nixon 
and His America" by Herbert Parmet (Little Brown, 1990) and Wicker's "One of 
Us": 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of these books . . . attempt to place his life and career within the 
context of American culture by showing he was a normal American and not the 
aberration that Watergate made many people think he was." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years" by J. Anthony Lukas (Viking 
Press, 1976): "An early good study of Watergate. That's the best account of 
Watergate that exists, contrary to the fact that everybody cites Woodward and 
Bernstein. Lukas is a superb example of investigative reporting done at the 
time."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More books will undoubtedly be written about Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalb, in fact, just turned in the manuscript for his own Nixon book, "The 
Nixon Memo." The book, to be published by the University of Chicago Press in 
October, was prompted by a 1992 "private" memo Nixon circulated in Washington 
criticizing what he termed then-President George Bush's "penny ante" approach 
to sending financial aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalb says Nixon sent the memo, knowing it "would galvanize the press to apply 
pressure on the government" to affect U.S. public policy regarding Russian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Another book is due out from Basic Books in May. "Nixon Reconsidered" by 
Hoff-Wilson, who says that "unlike all the other books about him, and unlike 
these eulogies we're currently hearing, his foreign policy turned out to be 
much weaker than conventional wisdom suggests." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Nixon will have his 10th volume published posthumously next month. In 
"Beyond Peace" (Random House), he analyzes America's "urgent foreign and 
domestic issues" and offers his proposal for "the renewal of our national 
purpose."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; THE WESTERN WHITE HOUSE IN SAN CLEMENTE WAS THE 
SETTING FOR SOME OF NIXON'S DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL SUCCESSES; THEN WATERGATE 
DROVE A HUMILIATED PRESIDENT FROM OFFICE, AND LA CASA PACIFICA BECAME A 
FORTRESS AND A . . . ; HOUSE OF SORROWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the summer of 1973, when the eyes of the nation were glued to the 
Watergate hearings on television. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, thousands of miles away on the West Coast, Richard Nixon and his 
family were honoring a rare guest at La Casa Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev had come to the seaside estate for a stay 
of several days, bringing with him to South County some of the world's most 
powerful Communists. But in this case, none of the neighbors minded. 
</P>
<P>
 Brezhnev came to the Western White House in July, the same month former Nixon 
aide Alexander P. Butterfield revealed that the President had secretly recorded 
all of his Oval Office meetings and phone conversations. Hence, the bombshell 
of the Watergate tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the oceanfront tower of La Casa Pacifica, where former President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt had once played poker, Nixon and Brezhnev engaged in a 
high-stakes game of diplomatic chess deep into the night. What resulted was the 
first of a series of agreements aimed at averting nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other aspect of La Casa Pacifica, or "peaceful house," it was 
the tower, friends say, that came to symbolize the 37th President's greatest 
successes and deepest sorrows. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that he retreated for quiet contemplation and then later for 
refuge, as shelter from the storm that drove him from office as an unindicted 
co-conspirator in August, 1974. And it was from there, in days before and after 
Watergate, that he forged his strongest bonds with the people of Orange County 
as political soul brother and oceanside neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nixon, "it was a great escape in two different ways," said family friend 
Pat Hitt of Corona del Mar, a Nixon appointee to the Department of Health, 
Education and Welfare. "Before his resignation, it was a getaway where he could 
have privacy but still be completely in touch. But after his resignation, it 
was purely a refuge, and for that matter, a place of healing." 
</P>
<P>
 During the time he lived in the sprawling estate -- between 1969 and 1980, 
when he returned to the East Coast -- Nixon welcomed to the 24-acre enclave 
Japanese Premier Eisaku Sato. "First Foreign Leader Ever in San Clemente," the 
city's newspaper proclaimed. Sato would not be the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon later welcomed Soviet dignitaries Anatoly Dobrynin and Andrei Gromyko, 
South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu and former President Lyndon 
Johnson, who celebrated his 61st birthday at La Casa Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sinatra, John Wayne, Red Skelton, Cesar Romero and the Rev. Billy Graham 
also dropped in for overnight stays. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger moved 
in next door, to an estate once owned by the publisher of Surfing magazine. 
Nixon aides H.R. (Bob) Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman moved nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, for a while, San Clemente became the focal point of the ultimate power 
lunch. La Casa Pacifica quietly emerged as not only the high-profile social 
arena in Southern California but also the setting for some of the most 
important foreign-policy decisions of the Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Nixon's so-called final days, in particular, friends say, that the 
Western White House came to symbolize much that was positive and compelling 
about his presidency, while Washington came to depict the stigma of Watergate 
and his ultimate undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for the final five years of his time in San Clemente, La Casa Pacifica 
became a fortress, where sadness was the resident emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he was bitter," Hitt said. "Being a human being, he had to be. But he 
didn't express it, at least not publicly. He didn't go around saying, 'Poor 
me.' But I know he was bleeding inside. He had to be -- he really was had. 
Certainly, everyone close to him was bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon and his wife, Patricia Ryan Nixon, or Nixon by himself, were often seen 
walking along the beach, looking at the sand as the sea gulls circled overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a therapeutic surrounding for them," said Dorothy Fuller, 
president of the San Clemente Historical Society and author of an unpublished 
manuscript on La Casa Pacifica titled "The Western White House Foursome." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so beautiful and peaceful and medicinal," Fuller said. "It would be 
a great place for a sanitarium." 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, however, La Casa Pacifica was a far different place for Nixon. It 
was there that he met with special envoy Huang Chen in what led to a meltdown 
of hostilities between the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
 As author David Halberstam, whose books "The Powers That Be" and "The Fifties" 
contain numerous references to Nixon, said last week in an interview: "There 
were positive things -- his intelligence, the opening up of China. . . . But he 
had to have been the only President ever who could go to China without being 
red-baited by Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at La Casa Pacifica that Nixon welcomed the Skylab astronauts and a 
reunion of former Vietnam POWs. And it was there that Tom Hayden brought a mob 
of protesters angry over the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that former Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev was photographed 
ogling actress Jill St. John in a reception line, and where Brezhnev later 
slept in a decorative bedroom normally occupied by one of Nixon's daughters, 
Tricia. Rather than stay in a luxurious compound reserved for visitors at Camp 
Pendleton, Brezhnev opted for Tricia's frilly bedroom, where he was surrounded 
by fragile wicker furniture and blue- and lavender-flowered wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at La Casa Pacifica that journalists persuaded Nixon to be photographed 
while walking on the beach, and he cooperated -- by strolling along the shore 
while wearing a coat, tie and wing-tipped shoes. Not to mention a stiff smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon had chosen San Clemente as the site of his Western White House for its 
isolation. He especially liked the location, bordered by a rocky beach on the 
west, Interstate 5 on the east, a Coast Guard navigation station on the south 
and private, gated communities on the north, with Camp Pendleton and the San 
Onofre Nuclear Power Plant lying beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 But his ties to the region had predated the Western White House, so named by 
his staff because of the high-level strategy sessions that marked his early 
years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife had begun their courtship here, and according to a biography 
written by their daughter, Julie, Pat had agreed to marry him while sitting in 
a parked Oldsmobile on a Dana Point bluff that afforded a romantic view of San 
Clemente's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in 1969, those who knew him were hardly surprised when Nixon bought his 
new home and its surrounding acreage for $340,000. He purchased the property 
from 90-year-old Victoria Cotton, whose husband, Hamilton Cotton, had built it 
in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton was an oil tycoon and one-time national finance chairman of the 
Democratic Party. He gained national attention for having entertained Franklin 
Roosevelt in all-night poker games by first using pulleys to hoist the disabled 
President up to the gazebo tower overlooking the coastal tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The same tower later served as the focal point of the Nixon-Brezhnev summit, 
and for endless conferences among Nixon, Kissinger, Haldeman and Ehrlichman. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nixon's arrival, the city renamed Via del Fronte, the street leading to 
the Cotton estate, Avenida del Presidente (the President's avenue), and the 
Nixons christened the house La Casa Pacifica. They attended Community 
Presbyterian Church here and patronized the local taco stands and El Adobe 
restaurant in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They also played host to dinner parties that many in attendance won't soon 
forget. Hitt remembers the Christmas party after Nixon became the first 
President in U.S. history to resign from office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were only five or six of us," she said. Longtime Nixon friend "Charles 
(Bebe) Rebozo, Tricia, Pat, John Wayne and myself. After dinner, we went in the 
living room, and (Nixon) surprised everyone by pulling out a John Wayne movie. 
John said, 'Oh, my God, it's one of my worst ever,' and everyone just roared. 
Along about then, we all needed that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hitt said it was "never in the cards" that the Nixons would remain in San 
Clemente. Pat Nixon resented the glare of attention that she was able to escape 
in New York City, "where she could be completely anonymous," Hitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the resignation, the former First Lady found shopping at Fashion Island 
in Newport Beach an excruciating exercise, Hitt said. She was even spat on at a 
South County supermarket and began to venture out in public only after donning 
a jet-black wig and heavy makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon himself complained of La Casa Pacifica being "eerily detached" from the 
world, especially after Watergate, during a period he later called "The 
Wilderness." So, in 1980, he sold the estate to a three-member partnership of 
Gavin Herbert, Donald M. Koll and George Argyros. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll, a prominent developer, and Argyros, former owner of the Seattle Mariners 
baseball team, acquired the surrounding lands. Herbert, a longtime Nixon friend 
and former chairman of Allergan Pharmaceuticals of Irvine, took possession of 
the house and 5.9 acres of land, which, according to county records, were 
valued at $2.3 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of famed nursery Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar, the relentlessly 
private Herbert has maintained the grounds as one of the most elegant, 
well-manicured showplaces in Southern California. A few reminders of the Nixon 
era still linger, such as the flagpole by the front door and a bulletproof 
glass wind screen around the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of all, it is Nixon's spirit that remains. And like the place where 
Nixon knew the highest highs and the lowest lows, he divides opinions just as 
fiercely as La Casa Pacifica played host to a range of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He created an excitement here that will never be duplicated," Hitt said. "But 
I remember him more for who he was. He was formal on the outside, but on the 
inside, he was warm, caring, giving and very understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Halberstam has a different view, saying that to view the late Nixon with only 
rose-colored glasses would be a tragic error in perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was quite excessive," Halberstam said. "He was a real figure of the Cold 
War. He was created by it, and he exploited it. He was quite willing to do some 
of the ugliest stuff on it. The key was always that rage and insecurity within. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than any politician, he marked for better or for worse my generation's 
life span. Sadly, there is a lot of darkness there, and a lot of the darkness 
of this country is connected to him. The problem was never the intelligence. It 
was always the anger -- and that overpowering sense of psychological 
vulnerability."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994

 "We think sometimes when things don't go the right way, when we suffer a 
defeat, that all has ended. Not true.It is only a beginning, always. Greatness 
comes not when things always go good for you, but the greatness comes when you 
are really tested, when you take some knocks, some disappointments, when 
sadness comes. Because only if you have been in the deepest valley can you ever 
know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain.... Always give your 
best. Never get discouraged, never be petty. Always remember, others may hate 
you, but those that hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you 
destroy yourself." -- Aug. 9, 1974, farewell address to the White House staff 
after resigning the presidency.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; IN MEMORIAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Richard Nixon was one of the most intriguing and perplexing public figures of 
the last half of the 20th Century. As President, he pioneered arms control and 
detente with the Soviet Union, steps that led the superpowers out of the Cold 
War.He understood that the real power center in Asia was Beijing, not Taipei, 
and restored diplomatic relations with The People's Republic of China. He was 
the first U.S. President to visit Jerusalem, and to take the Arab world 
seriously. Yet Nixon was also the first chief executive to resign from office 
in a scandal that launched an age of cynicism that dogs government to this day. 
Before Nixon's time, never had so many high-ranking White House officials been 
convicted and sent to prison. Nixon was also legendary for his capacity for 
punishment as well as recovery, even from the worst political setbacks, even 
from Watergate. At the time of his death, his rehabilitation was so complete 
that he enjoyed a close relationship with President Clinton. It was as if Nixon 
had never left the national arena. No doubt, the world is a far different, and 
perhaps safer, place because of him. But his legacy has yet to be set in stone. 
Though he joined the pantheon of elder statesmen in later life, Nixon's place 
in history is as ambiguous, complicated and vexing as he was.
