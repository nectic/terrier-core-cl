'TOON IN, TURN ON, SPIN OUT; KIDS GROOVE TO DISNEY'S NEWEST THRILL, A SILLY 
WABBIT WIDE

 Urban blight has hit Mickey's Toontown. 
</P>
<P>
 When Disneyland's eighth and newest land opened last year, it was a bright and 
colorful place with nary a shadow of threat or danger. That has changed with 
the opening of Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin, which with its grimy back alleys 
and nefariously plotting weasels gives Toontown a dark edge closer to its novel 
and movie roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride has been open and advertised for several weeks, although park 
officials have scheduled the official opening for next week. On a recent 
weekday, the attraction drew a steady stream of visitors despite a small park 
crowd; those interviewed professed to enjoy the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the very youngest park guests came out with tear-stained faces or 
hands over ears, frightened by the noise of the effects-laden ride. Others, 
though, came through bravely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove a funny car . . . I drove silly," said 2-year-old Stephanie Gulaga of 
Edmonton, Canada, speaking through an interpreter (her father, Kelly). Dominic 
Izzo, 3 1/2, of Los Angeles, said it was fun, although "bumpy" and "scary" in 
parts. "It's a Small World" still rates as her favorite ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Older kids enjoyed the new ride, too. "I liked it. I thought it was great," 
said Ashleigh Palinkas, 7, of Manhattan Beach. Eight-year-old Matthew Trevino 
of Saugus said his favorite part of the ride was "when Roger Rabbit got smashed 
by the refrigerator." Shawn Grady of San Pedro, another 8-year-old, admitted a 
preference for roller-coaster-type rides but was ready to rate the Car Toon 
Spin among his Top Three Disneyland attractions (along with Splash Mountain and 
Big Thunder Mountain Railway). 
</P>
<P>
 Parents all said they enjoyed the attraction; even those hard-to-please teens 
seemed to get a kick out of it. Leon Hill, a gregarious 17-year-old from 
Brisbane, Australia (wearing a Napalm Death T-shirt), gave the ride a thumbs-up 
and pronounced it "pretty cool, pretty funky. . . . It's an odyssey." 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of the ride was almost universally praised among those interviewed. 
"I love how the cars spin around," said Kellie West, 10, from the Central 
California town of Hume. The sentiment was echoed by Neal Reiter, 12, of Los 
Altos: "It's really fun. I like that you can drive the cars." 
</P>
<P>
 In the attraction, visitors ride through an explosively vivid cartoon world 
aboard anthropomorphic Toontown taxis like those in the 1989 movie "Who Framed 
Roger Rabbit." The two-person taxis move through the ride on a track, but 
passengers can also make them spin independently, something like the Tea Cups 
in Fantasyland.  
</P>
<P>
 The ride itself is close in spirit to older Fantasyland attractions such as 
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride or Alice in Wonderland, although the technology in Car 
Toon Spin is more sophisticated (and, at about seven minutes, the ride is 
longer than any of the other so-called "dark" rides). 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin was actually completed in August, but the opening 
was held off because the still-new Toontown was already drawing capacity 
crowds. Holding off also gives a park a new ride to promote for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who saw "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" may recall that Toontown is a 
noir-ish, '40s urban neighborhood, where cartoon characters reside when they 
are not at the studio performing. There are dark alleys, barrooms and bad guys, 
most notably the weasels, who plot to "rub out" such 'toon stars as Roger and 
his voluptuous wife, Jessica, with a toxic substance called Dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin is built around elements of that story, but 
mostly the ride designers took it as an opportunity to make guests feel as if 
they are in the middle of a classic Warner Bros.-style cartoon. With some 
three-dimensional elements, but mostly through brightly painted backdrops (lit 
by black light) and lots of crashing through walls, the ride puts guests 
through some time-honored cartoon gags: an electrifying spin through the 
Toontown Power House, a crash through a china shop, an explosion (and the 
resulting head-spinning, birds-chirping world of cartoon unconsciousness) and a 
long fall from the top of a skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
 And, lurking around every corner, those darned weasels. 
</P>
<P>
 A ride attraction was part of the original plan for Toontown, said Joe 
Lanzisero, senior concept designer with Walt Disney Imagineering, but it took 
awhile to come up with the right idea. Winnie the Pooh and Little Mermaid rides 
were among those considered, but "none of them really had the right 
temperament," Lanzisero said. 
</P>
<P>
 He credits the Roger Rabbit idea to Disney president Michael Eisner ("and I'm 
not kissing up," he joked). Up to the opening of the new Car Toon Spin, 
Mickey's Toontown has been "very kiddie-oriented," Lanzisero said. The new ride 
has "a little harder edge to it. . . . It's going to appeal to a much broader 
range of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing ride passengers to spin their vehicles is an idea that's been kicking 
around Imagineering for years, waiting for the right ride, he said. The concept 
signals a new age in ride design, he said. "This is the interactive age we live 
in," Lanzisero said. "The days of sitting in a ride vehicle and passively 
experiencing" an attraction are over, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The design did pose some challenges in the storytelling process, because what 
the visitors see depends on what way they are facing during the ride. "By 
letting our guests spin," Lanzisero said, "we never knew if people were going 
to see Jessica in the trunk with the weasels, for instance." 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't a big obstacle, however. "We can't really tell full stories in 
these rides anyway," he said. "We create moods and feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to set the mood is one of the most elaborate queue systems anywhere in 
the park ("That queue is worth standing in itself," said one park spokesman). 
The line winds inside the building, an elaborate maze of mock backstage 
corridors. Toontown back alleys, past bubbling vats of Dip, and finally the cab 
company's dispatch area, where guests board the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to create a queue line experience that gave kids something to do," 
Lanzisero said. "It is a place where you start to set up the story ideas for 
the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, "the basic story is, Roger is in trouble," he said. More 
importantly, however, "it gives us an excuse to do these big cartoon cliches." 
</P>
<P>
 The next big Disneyland attraction, due to open in 1995 in Adventureland, is 
also based on a film. The Indiana Jones Adventure is a joint venture between 
Disney and George Lucas, producer of the Indiana Jones films, which featured 
Harrison Ford as a swashbuckling, Nazi-battling archeologist. Roger Rabbit's 
Creator Revisits His Imagination 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin could count at least one unabashed fan long 
before it opened to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Wolf, who created the ride's scatterbrained hero in his 1981 novel, "Who 
Censored Roger Rabbit?" (on which the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" was 
based), got a chance to check out the attraction in October, while he was in 
town on other business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole new kind of ride. The way that it's done, it's mind-boggling," 
Wolf said by phone from his home just outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Many writers are deeply disappointed when their works are turned into movies 
or otherwise realized, but Wolf said he has been ecstatic with Disney, both for 
the movie and for the look and feel of Toontown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Toontown. That is as good a job of creating a tangible entity from an 
imaginary place as any I've ever seen in my life. The concept of Toontown from 
the book is realized," he said. His first walk through Toontown was "kind of an 
eerie experience. . . . It's kind of like walking through my own imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for Roger Rabbit, he has said, was worked out over his kitchen table, 
primarily to amuse himself. Now Roger is a cartoon character recognized around 
the world. He lives on in Disney-produced cartoon shorts and in Wolf's own 
books. "Roger's kind of opened a lot of doors for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf's second novel based on the character was published in 1992, "Who 
P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?" He's at work on a third, which incorporates a real 
movie star, the late Gary Cooper, and will be published as a graphic novel 
(sort of a high-rent comic book). Plans for a movie sequel have been long 
delayed, but Wolf said he has heard that the studio has accepted a final script 
and is preparing to proceed with production. Although Disney has optioned his 
second novel, the coming movie is not based on it, and Wolf is not directly 
involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just as soon not get involved in writing screenplays," he said. "I 
get to put in my two cents' worth, and that's enough for me." RICK VANDERKNYFF

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: WE INTERRUPT THIS DISASTER . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Never has the rarefied world of Paris couture seemed as far from reality as 
this week. As Los Angeles dug itself out of earthquake rubble, designers 
presented the most costly and exquisite summer clothing money can buy. But they 
didn't do it blithely. Oh, no. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Lacroix expressed his sensitivity to the world beyond one-of-a-kind 
$30,000 dresses in a program note. "In these violent and desperate times, the 
only salvation lies in sincerity and a total loyalty toward one's passions," 
said the designer most often associated with the conspicuous consumption of the 
'80s. "Couture is my passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, escapism is our passion. And admiring the gorgeous dresses pictured in 
Women's Wear Daily over a Bloody Mary helped us forget that a brick chimney had 
fallen on our car. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Lagerfeld kicked things off for Chanel on Saturday in the renovated 
showrooms beneath the Louvre museum under the appreciative eyes of such fans as 
Marisa Berenson and model Linda Evangelista's heartthrob, Kyle MacLachlan. (One 
British fashion writer, however, was not amused by the peekaboo collection. 
"The Chanel show was an insult to women and Lagerfeld should not get away with 
it," wrote Marion Hume in the Independent. Take that!) 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Gianfranco Ferre was derided for reviving that most attractive of fashion 
constructions -- the bustle -- at Christian Dior. A newly assertive Pierre 
Cardin changed the rules by merging summer and fall collections into one show, 
and newcomer Michel Klein (touted as "only 36") won plaudits for the simplicity 
of his Guy Laroche collection from Christian Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the news was made on the runway. Oh, no. 
</P>
<P>
 The New '90s Values: Actress and Chanel Face Carole Bouquet's new super short, 
boyish haircut . . . socialite Susan Gutfreund's downscale Duffle Coat . . . 
Children (as accessories, being dragged along and displayed prominently) . . . 
fewer hors d'oeuvres and drinks after the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oldest Way to Sum Up the Always-Over-the-Top Couture Collections, Courtesy 
of Associated Press Fashion Writer Suzy Patterson: "You wouldn't go to the 
market in these clothes." Oh, no? 
</P>
<P>
 Against All Odds: Sears, Roebuck & Co. will be Brand Central for pop star Phil 
Collins' upcoming North American tour. The giant retailer announced Wednesday 
it will sell clothing and merchandise related to the singer's 50-city concert 
tour. "I assume it will include T-shirts and tour jackets," company spokeswoman 
Mary Ann O'Rourke said, "but we won't be able to say exactly until after our 
meeting Jan. 26." The tour will begin May 17 in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smell of the Greasepaint: By the time power was to restored to most of Los 
Angeles Monday afternoon, L.A.'s superstar broadcasters had managed to duck 
into their studios' makeup and hair departments. But viewers from outlying 
areas report that seeing a few of these folks without their pancake was scarier 
than the quake. Hmm . . . is that why Colleen Williams never appeared on camera 
during KNBC Channel 4's early afternoon coverage, even though she and Chuck 
Henry anchored for hours? Seasoned broadcaster Tritia Toyota, however, managed 
to look like a dewy intern. How'd she do it? Credit a fabulous haircut, simple 
cashmere turtleneck -- oh, and natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Casting Call: While stumpy Tonya Harding springs into triple axels, badly 
fried ponytail bouncing like cotton candy, her swan-necked nemesis, Nancy 
Kerrigan, glides across the ice in chaste Vera Wang designs. We can't help but 
wonder who will play whom in the TV movie. Forgetting about hair color for a 
moment, can't you just see Tori Spelling as Kerrigan and a slightly force-fed 
Shannen Dougherty as Tonya? Can't you? 
</P>
<P>
 The Hype of Los Angeles: Count the promotional references contained in the 
following 5-inch-by-7-inch invitation: Buzz (the Talk of Los Angeles) and 
Emporio Armani Express invite you to attend a book party with Shirley Lord, who 
will read from her new novel " My Sister's Keeper ". . . . Books can be 
purchased on the premises with the American Express Card . . . . Enjoy private 
shopping downstairs until 9 p.m. Guests will receive an Emporio Armani Passport 
and a 10% discount. The words Frangelico Liquer float in the lower right-hand 
corner, tipping us off, perhaps, to the evening's featured elixir? 
</P>
<P>
 Why Anne Rice Doesn't Write About the Protestant Work Ethic: "That's exactly 
what factory managers wanted people to believe at the turn of the century. The 
whole idea of 'The Wizard of Oz' is don't go to New York and be a dancer, stay 
right there in Kansas with the pigs, that anything that's glossy and sensuous 
and enchanting is going to be a fraud." Uh, like sucking blood? Rice discusses 
her penchant for the road less traveled in the new and improved February issue 
of Vibe. Our favorite feature of all? A tiny pictorial (Page 100) tracing 
actress Kim Fields' remarkable evolution from one of "The Facts of Life" to 
curvy star of "Living Single." "You go, girl," says the caption. She sure does. 
</P>
<P>
 One-Stop Shopping: Come fall, Los Angeles will go the way of New York when the 
California Mart showcases local designers' spring collections under one tent. 
The California Collections Spring '95 Preview will be presented Oct. 7-9, 
announced Denise Cohen Scher, California Mart fashion director, at last week's 
Marty Menswear Awards show Downtown. Centralizing the shows should do more than 
simplify travel for out-of-town buyers and press. If California's design 
community puts its considerable clout and vision behind a singular event, 
perhaps we'll see a return of the kind of glittery attention L.A. last 
experienced in the late '80s. Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing New Meaning to the Phrase "Fashion Victim": There's a reason we don't 
trust Mr. Inside Out when it comes to most advice. "Honey, don't sleep in your 
clothes . . . again," he said in his holier-than-thou tone Sunday night. We'd 
dozed off quite peacefully in our jeans and hiking boots. "Have enough 
self-respect to change into pajamas." 
</P>
<P>
 Little rebukes like that have a way of getting our attention and -- good wife 
that we occasionally are -- our complicity. Guess we were prescient, though, 
because only a few hours later, didn't we have to scramble out of our nightie 
and back into those jeans and boots? Don't think we didn't point out this waste 
of time to Mr. Ouch-I've-Got-Glass-In-My-Foot, who, in his defense, always lets 
us have the last word.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; LESSONS IN FADING LIFE AND THE ART OF DETACHMENT; DIARY OF 
A LOST BOY, BY HARRY KONDOLEON , ALFRED A. KNOPF $20, 183 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue of "detachment' arises frequently in playwright-poet Harry 
Kondoleon's alternately hilarious and disturbing second novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector, its narrator, is a man in his 30s with full-blown AIDS who turns a 
trenchant and unforgiving eye on the people around him. Most especially, he 
devotes his attention to the failing, flailing marriage of Susan, his best 
friend since college, and Bill Ded, her amiable but faithless husband, a man 
with a charter membership in a Philandering Husbands Support Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was it a group to help curtain sexually compulsive behavior," Hector wonders 
to himself, "or was it more of what it said it was, a club for husbands who 
wanted to be supported in their philandering?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a not particularly attractive group of men," he archly continues. "But 
I have to admit the majority of their stories about sneaking around for sex 
were very sexy. I couldn't help admiring the ingenuity and the downright 
Jacobean backdrop of guilt and self-loathing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hector is able to study with hilarious effect many of his heterosexual 
acquaintances with a similar air of clinical equanimity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was an Other," he confides, "and they would tolerate, even welcome, a 
visitor from a foreign planet, provided I did not squirt alien fluid in their 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, however, he seems even more removed from direct involvement in his own 
crises. With his once attractive body wasted away and his active libido all but 
a memory, he often seems more a neutral camera than a player. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this inherent distance that gives Hector's voice its quirky, irresistible 
flatness -- a quality that brings to mind Rachel Ingalls' strange and haunting 
novel, "Mrs. Caliban." In fact, Hector is so perplexed at his own detachment 
that he constantly seeks the opinions of others, both historical and 
contemporary, on the subject. At one point, in a small elevator, he queries 
Susan's mother: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking a lot about the principle of detachment. Do you know? Have 
you any position in particular you hold on detachment?" 
</P>
<P>
 To his surprise, she takes the question seriously. "It's something that comes 
whether you like it or not," she replies. "One learns to pretend. After a 
series of sharp disappointments we can't help but retreat. You make little 
settlements with yourself. You attach yourself to less and less. There's no 
judgment in it -- fair play, actually, really, when you think about it. There 
are so many things I don't give a goddamn about anymore, it would take a week 
to list them." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Hector, in spite of himself, periodically gets pulled back to life, such 
as the time Bill and Susan try to fix him up with a blind date at a dinner 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's where the comedy grows as rich as French pastry," he tells us, "as 
deep as the aroma from a pot-au-feu -- anyway, anything French and superior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pot-au-feu enters, whom we will call Max Drake, because that in fact is 
his real name. It would be too sticky to sit here and describe Drake's beauty: 
It is complete in every visible detail. He even speaks eloquently, yet with no 
pretensions. He's refined, well-mannered, a full, rich laugh informed by 
intelligence and human kindness. Just the kind of person I ordinarily would 
like to set fire to." 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately the promising Max, like so many of Hector's friends, dies, 
leaving him alone and unconnected. "Old people do understand," he decides. "The 
fatigue, the aching, the thinning away, and the nearly visible retreating of 
existence. A scarecrow in the waiting room said to me, 'It's pretty awful when 
you remember you were awfully pretty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Only at the end, at the finish of his tale, does Hector let down his guard 
when addressing hypothetical readers, forgotten friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't mention you, did I? I'm sorry. I meant to, in a way. You helped me, 
but I hated needing help. And then I got very involved thinking about S. and 
B.'s marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who should I have loved? You? Or you? I would have had to let you look at me. 
Like this. You don't know what I look like now. A branch from a burnt tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did you expect of me? What? -- gratitude? I just wanted to forget . . . 
like everyone else. Forget for a little while and have a laugh! Then, as you 
know, it became impossible. It all wasn't much fun then. Not for me and not for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 "You. You. You. You're all mad at me know. I didn't describe the day I craved 
black cherries and you got them. And massaged my feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Irony, that staple of survival humor, has long been Hector's brave defense. 
Like plexiglass, it's strong, but it's also ultimately transparent. As we read 
"Diary of a Lost Boy," we see straight through it, we see Hector, and we don't 
feel a bit detached from him. Not for a minute.

 "Hell is other people," one of the characters in "Intersection" (citywide) 
allows in a philosophical moment, but that isn't quite accurate. Hell is other 
people in movies like this. 
</P>
<P>
 A dithering romantic drama about a self-absorbed dolt of a husband going 
through yet another midlife crisis, unable to choose between two stunning women 
who throw themselves at him and inexplicably put up with his whiny 
indecisiveness, "Intersection" in truth isn't intense enough to be called hell. 
Purgatory would be more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a French novel that director Claude Sautet turned into his 1970 film 
"Les Choses de la Vie," "Intersection" as directed by Mark Rydell is riddled 
with miscalculations. It is miscast, filled with characters who are incapable 
of eliciting sympathy, and relates a story so unsatisfying one can only wonder 
that it got made at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere) is the man with too many women. The architect 
of choice in Vancouver, B.C., prone to peering over half-glasses and muttering 
about fenestration, Eastman designs buildings that cause an admiring associate 
to say, "somewhere Frank Lloyd Wright is eating his heart out." 
</P>
<P>
 What Vincent lacks, to steal a title from a far better film, is a design for 
living. He has been married for 16 years to his high-powered partner Sally 
(Sharon Stone), an ambitious woman who wears her hair in a bun and cares more 
about clients than carnal pleasures. "It's not a family," Vincent grouses, 
"it's a corporation with a kid." That would be 13-year-old Meaghan (Jenny 
Morrison) who is the apple, pear and peach of her dad's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The other woman is the free-spirited Olivia Marshak (Lolita Davidovich), a 
counterculture journalist so bursting with youthful joie d'vivre you want to 
hide under a rock and so understanding of Vincent's inability to truly commit 
she makes Dr. Joyce Brothers look like Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the movie is made up of Vincent equivocating about whom he really 
loves and remembering the good times with both women, trying to balance how 
much Sally has meant to him with how good Olivia makes him feel. Problems, 
problems, problems. 
</P>
<P>
 All the principals certainly look glamorous in Vilmos Zsigmond's glossy 
cinematography, with Gere's windblown hair nicely setting off his Armani 
clothes and Stone looking regal in jewels precious enough to get a screen 
credit. The only thing the three stars can't do is get anyone involved in the 
David Rayfiel and Marshall Brickman script. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, though the story's dynamics and the Eastmans' 16-year marriage 
tell you that this is at least in part an older-woman, younger-woman situation, 
Stone and Davidovich are in reality only a few years apart in age and putting 
Stone's hair up in that bun does not go a long way toward making her look like 
Grandma Moses. 
</P>
<P>
 For another thing, Gere is about the last actor you want to see having a 
crisis of conscience on screen. Handsome and talented though he is, he is also 
too self-absorbed to be empathetic while searching his soul, and his most 
successful roles, from "An Officer and a Gentleman" to "Internal Affairs" and 
"Pretty Woman," have wisely not called on him to be the kind of audience 
surrogate he is supposed to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 Already burdened with distant actors and an artificial script, "Intersection" 
does not need its peculiar central plot contrivance, which starts with the 
film's mysterious opening scene and closes with a leaden finale. Midlife crises 
are invariably a bore on screen, but this one is worst than most.

 QUAKE AFTERMATH 
</P>
<P>
 Recovery Program for Artists: Help may be on the way for artists and arts 
organizations who lost artwork or suffered damages to their spaces or equipment 
in Monday's earthquake. The Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department is 
establishing an Arts/Earthquake Recovery Program, including a fund for 
individual artists; technical aid; equipment replacement and temporary 
rehearsal space for nonprofit arts groups; a program of family arts events to 
ease the mood at shelters, and a citywide survey of damage to arts 
organizations and facilities. Although no specific funds have been identified 
yet, the department is seeking funds from private groups, the city, the 
California Arts Council and the National Endowment for the Arts. In the 
meantime, affected artists and arts groups should call the 24-hour arts hot 
line, (213) 688-ARTS, to register their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dose of Laughter: The Laugh Factory at 8001 Sunset Blvd. is offering free 
comedy shows through the end of the month for Southern California earthquake 
survivors. Dubbed "a complimentary respite of fun and humor amid chaos," the 
shows will be open to all who bring any broken object or a picture of their 
home in disarray. Comedians who have agreed to perform through the free run 
include "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper" star Marc Curry, "The Second Half" star John 
Mendoza, "Good Times" star Jimmie Walker, KLSX deejay Frazier Smith, George 
Lopez and Charlie Fleischer, who supplied the voice for film character Roger 
Rabbit. "This whole thing is about our community coming together," says Laugh 
Factory owner Jamie Masuda. "And laughter is a relief for everybody." Showtimes 
are at 8 and 10 nightly, with additional midnight shows on Fridays and 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Aftershocks Hit New York: Shock waves from Monday's earthquake have reached at 
least one New York theater. The result is a two-day postponement of the New 
York Theatre Workshop's production of "Unfinished Stories" because the 
director, Gordon Davidson, returned to his L.A. base at the Mark Taper Forum 
over the weekend and couldn't get back to New York as scheduled. The lost 
rehearsal time means the Sybille Pearson play will now begin performances Feb. 
6. Davidson is the Taper's artistic director. TELEVISION

 Jury Sides With Vanna: A Los Angeles federal jury has ordered Samsung 
Electronics to pay Vanna White $403,000 in damages for running an ad featuring 
a robot designed to resemble the letter-turning "Wheel of Fortune" hostess. But 
attorneys for Samsung, which earlier rejected a $950,000 settlement offer from 
White (down from her original request of $6.9 million), called the verdicts a 
"win." White testified that the ads -- which depicted a robot in a red sequined 
dress with a blond wig on a "Wheel of Fortune"-like set -- damaged her image, 
her career and her earning potential -- by cutting into potential endorsement 
income.

 What a 'Relief': HBO's five-hour telecast of "Comic Relief VI" on Saturday 
drew more than 12 million viewers, according to the Nielsens, beating network 
prime-time fare and NBC's late-night comedy show "Saturday Night Live" in HBO 
homes. In addition, pledges for the show to benefit the homeless have now 
topped $7.2 million. HBO will air two "Comic Relief VI" highlights specials 
Feb. 8 and 15. And, for die-hard "Comic Relief" fans, another cable channel, 
A&E, will extend the fund-raising efforts with "The Best of Comic Relief," a 
series of 13 one-hour specials culled from the first five "Comic Relief" 
programs, beginning Feb. 12. MOVIES

 Opera Benefit a Losing Proposition: Although it was intended as a benefit for 
Opera Pacific, Placido Domingo's performance in Manuel Penella's "El Gato 
Montes" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center Saturday ended up costing 
the company $50,000. Ticket sales brought in about $322,000 -- not enough to 
cover total costs, which included busing in about 2,000 Latino students for the 
dress rehearsal and a post-performance reception for 200 patrons who purchased 
$500 seats. Opera Pacific's general director, David DiChiera, noted Thursday 
that paid attendance was 98% but that the group had expected to sell 300 
tickets at the benefit price. "From a repertory point of view and educational 
point of view, it was still a very worthwhile project for us," DiChiera said. 
The performance was presented in cooperation with the Los Angeles Music Center 
Opera, which is presenting "El Gato" through Jan. 29.

 A $10-Million Present: New York's Guggenheim Museum has started the New Year 
off with a major gift of $10 million from Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of 
Revlon Inc. and a museum trustee. As part of the gift, the Revlon Foundation 
will commission a major sculpture by noted American artist Roy Lichtenstein, 
for the exterior of the museum's new tower building. The donation launches the 
museum's $100-million "Campaign for the Next Century." SHAUNA SNOW

MOVIE REVIEW; 'TOURNEE OF ANIMATION' A TREAT FOR STOP-MOTION FANS; FESTIVAL 
FEATURES 14 SHORT FILMS FROM EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. IT OPENS TODAY AT 
THE NUART IN WEST L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "The 24th International Tournee of Animation," an uneven program of 14 short 
films from Europe and the United States opening today at the Nuart in West Los 
Angeles, confirms that stop-motion animation, a technique once relegated to 
Speedy Alka-Seltzer commercials and low-budget movie monsters, is enjoying a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prehistoric Beast" (U.S.), by Oscar-winning special-effects artist Phil 
Tippett, which depicts two dinosaurs stalking each other in a Mesozoic forest, 
eclipses the other films. This superbly animated short was a test for "Jurassic 
Park," and it looks like a sequence from a big-budget feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Berry's previously reviewed "The Sandman" (U.K.) is also technically 
polished, if grisly. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one minutes of the 90-minute program are devoted to "A Salute to the 
Dimensional Artistry of Will Vinton Studios" (U.S.), a collage of shorts and 
commercials that showcases the studio's recent forays into conventional 
stop-motion and computer animation, instead of their popular clay films. 
(Vinton coined the term claymation.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's an odd time to be saluting Vinton, as his studio recently lost the 
leadership of clay animation to London's Aardman Animations ("Creature 
Comforts"). The characters made from old trophies and scraps of electrical junk 
in Vinton's "Mr. Resistor" ape the nightmarish work of the brothers Quay, but 
lacks their eerie surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Tournee" is weakest in the field of drawn animation. "The Billy Nayer 
Show" by Cory McAbee and Bobby Lurie and "Le Carre de Lumiere" ("The Square of 
Light," Switzerland) by Claude Luyet rely too heavily on traced live-action 
footage. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers will quickly weary of the crude drawings and rudimentary movements in 
"We Love It" (U.S.) by Vincent Cafarelli and Candy Kugel and "The Man Who 
Yelled" (U.S.) by Mo Willems. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the films in "The 24th International Tournee of Animation" simply 
don't represent the best work being done in world animation. But stop-motion 
fans will enjoy some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 It runs through Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Times guidelines: some graphic and intense sequences.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; DA PASQUALE 2 NOT A MATCH FOR ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm crazy about Da Pasquale in Beverly Hills. I like the waiters, the menu 
with its changing selection of daily pastas, the very '80s look, the clatter 
and clamor, the look of the clientele, and mostly, the food, which tastes as if 
it's fresh from the stove of a talented, natural cook -- which, in fact, it is. 
When the second Da Pasquale, appropriately named Da Pasquale 2, opened in the 
old Grappa (and even older Old World) space on Sunset two months ago, I 
couldn't wait to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovated space looks fabulous. Gone is Grappa's mauve and gray, brass and 
glass corporate lobby decor. In its place is an elegant, industrial dressiness. 
Strong, reassuring steel girders define the entryway. The low ceiling has been 
removed, revealing a floor joist threaded with exposed conduits and dozens of 
utility boxes that each sport a cunning, flame-shaped chandelier bulb. There is 
blessedly little art, only an enormous gilt-framed mirror. Through a sparkling 
wall of windows, a classic view of Sunset Boulevard dominates the western wing 
of the restaurant: There's Spago, Tower Records, Book Soup, a complicated, 
harrowing intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to say, however, that my first two visits to this new Da Pasquale are 
disappointing. The feel of the place is still a little disjunctive. And the 
food lacks the sparkle and luster I've come to expect from other Mora family 
restaurants. (Pasquale Mora and his brothers have cooked at and opened several 
restaurants around town, including two Toto Cafes.) 
</P>
<P>
 For one, the menu was not the Da Pasquale menu I know and love, but 
non-rotating and closer, I believe, to the Toto menu. Cooking in general was 
passable, but uninspired. One night's special, a homemade spinach manicotti , 
was a thick fresh noodle stuffed with pureed spinach and topped with a lively 
tomato sauce. Fine, not great. 
</P>
<P>
 What I always remember from the original Da Pasquale is the fresh fish, often 
served with roasted potatoes and sauteed escarole or spinach. Here at Da 
Pasquale 2, a pretty slab of almost raw swordfish comes with two precooked 
antipasti : pickled string beans and pickled carrots. Not only did I send the 
fish back to be more thoroughly cooked, I missed the freshness of hot, 
just-cooked vegetables. And the antipasti , displayed on plates just inside the 
front door, proved to be tired: Artichoke hearts were sodden, the rapini dry 
and stringy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The service was also mildly distracted, and occasionally confused. One night, 
our entrees came out before our salads arrived, and sailed by again on another 
trial run -- the same bowls of food -- before we were ready for them. When we 
finally received the entrees, the risotto was dry and congealed -- we ate a 
bite and set it aside. Happily, without a word, a fresh bowl of creamy, fresh 
risotto arrived in several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, I thought, maybe I'm making it up about the original Da Pasquale. So I 
went back to the Beverly Hills location to see if I was exaggerating that 
restaurant's virtues. I wasn't. Everything -- lightly battered shrimp and 
calamari on a bed of arugula, a white bean and escarole soup redolent of good 
extra-virgin olive oil, striped bass with sauteed spinach, orecchiette with a 
deep and subtle ragout of beef -- was superb. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, certain traits of Da Pasquale 2 do indicate that it can, in time, grow 
into its name. I've seen the familiar Mora faces watching over the dining room. 
And the menu was drastically rewritten in the last week and looks more 
promising. My most recent meal there included several high points: A Caesar 
salad was terrific. Spaghetti with Italian sausage had a tomato sauce with the 
lightest and most enlivening touch of cream. Filet mignon medallions were 
overcooked and dull, but they came smothered with big succulent chunks of 
porcini mushrooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Desserts were limited to tiramisu , those frozen ice cream truffles and a 
soggy vanilla cream pastry. The espresso seems to be improving. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it's not completely fair to compare the child to the fully matured 
parent -- and Da Pasquale 2 is clearly a mere child. Certainly, the owner here 
faces all the riddles and challenges of cloning a successful restaurant. Still, 
one wonders, why not import the original tried-and-true Da Pasquale menu for 
starters, just to get things rolling, and borrow those fabulous cooks? 
</P>
<P>
 * Da Pasquale 8782 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (310) 659-6464. Lunch and 
dinner seven days. Full bar. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food 
only, $25-$52.

TV REVIEW; AN ILLUMINATING LOOK AT ROBERT ALTMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Kaplan and John Dorr's illuminating and incisive 90-minute "Luck, Trust & 
Ketchup: Robert Altman in Carver Country" (premiering on Bravo tonight at 8) is 
as much about the director as the making of "Short Cuts," the film Altman and 
his co-writer Frank Barhydt wove so effectively from nine of Raymond Carver's 
celebrated short stories centering on lives of ordinary desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder Altman has so little trouble getting top actors to play small 
roles in his films. It isn't merely a question of his mystique as one of the 
great living figures of the American cinema; it's a matter of the warm, low-key 
atmosphere he creates on the set, inviting contributions from one and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Penn puts his finger on it when he says that, although it "sounds 
contradictory," Altman is "very spontaneous -- and he knows exactly what he 
wants." The man is both wise enough and secure enough to encourage input. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust and luck are two words that are uttered repeatedly throughout this 
engaging documentary -- the whole question of the role trust and luck play in 
human relationships that is at the heart of "Short Cuts" in turn mirrors 
Altman's methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Lemmon remarks that the ability to inspire trust is the common quality 
that all the finest directors share. Film editor Geraldine Peroni observes that 
both Altman and Carver, who died at 50, "have a dark vision of the world"; 
interestingly, as large, bearish men, their physical resemblance is so striking 
that they could be brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, if luck plays a key role in the lives of Carver's people, Altman 
allows it to play a similar role in the making of his films -- luck in the 
sense of having rounded up a cast and crew of gifted people and partaking of 
their inspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman's openness to the ideas of others ranges from letting Lemmon work in a 
trick with two shot glasses and an egg and Tim Robbins' suggestion that Anne 
Archer's character should be a professional clown to his production designer's 
urging the use of a wall-size aquarium in an apartment set and his music 
supervisor's idea of commissioning top songwriters to create songs especially 
for Annie Ross' saloon singer. If you have seen "Short Cuts" you will 
understand how such details can be essential to breathing life into a film. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, you probably should see "Short Cuts" before you see this documentary. 
It's not because it gives everything away but rather to have seen the film 
enriches one's understanding of all that went into making it the landmark film 
that it is. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you haven't yet seen "Short Cuts," "Luck, Trust & Ketchup," an 
EZTV/Circle Associates production, surely ought to encourage you to catch up 
with it -- soonest.

HOME TECH: CD CORNER: PICKING THE BEST OF THE HALL OF FAME CLASS OF '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounds easy enough: Pick the eight albums that best reflect the musical 
imagination and spirit of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 1994 induction 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Step into a record store, however, and in most cases you'll find a dizzying 
array of choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you go for one of the artist's numerous studio albums, a greatest-hits 
package or a multi-disc box set? In Elton John's case alone, you can choose 
from some 20 studio albums, two live albums, three greatest-hits packages and 
two box sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't assume a box set or a greatest-hits is the best way to go. In some 
cases, an artist doesn't have enough noteworthy work to justify a multi-disc 
package and in other cases a greatest-hits album fails to capture the character 
of an artist as well as the best of the artist's studio collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Before beginning your search, it's a good idea to consult Schwann Spectrum, a 
comprehensive guide to what's available on record, and frequently at what 
price. The winter 1993-94 edition is available now at most record stores for 
$6.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the albums that best summarize the musical spirit of this year's 
induction crop. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Animals -- "The Best of the Animals" on ABKCO Records brings together 15 
of the recordings, from "The House of the Rising Sun" to the influential "Don't 
Let Me Be Misunderstood," that made the English rock group an early challenger 
to the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Band -- Skip the single-disc "Best of the Band" and the two-disc 
"Kingdom Come" retrospective and choose between "Music From Big Pink" or "The 
Band," the group's first two studio collections. The latter is widely 
considered one of the two dozen best albums of the rock era -- clearly the 
group's crowning achievement. But there is an innocence and soulfulness to "Big 
Pink" that makes it equally endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Duane Eddy -- Your only option, according to Schwann Spectrum, is "Twang 
Thang: The Duane Eddy Anthology." The good news about the two-disc, 40-song 
package from Rhino is that it's well designed and includes everything you'd 
want by Eddy, including "Rebel Rouser" and the remake of "Peter Gunn." The bad 
news is that a single disc at half "Twang's" $28 price tag would be a more 
reasonable alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Grateful Dead -- Lots of choices here, including live and greatest-hits 
packages, but pay special attention to the group's two admired 1970 studio 
collections, "Workingman's Dead" and "American Beauty." Both are available in 
mid-line packages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elton John -- If you want to go for the compilations, "To Be Continued" is 
an excellent four-disc package, while volume one of the Polydor "Greatest Hits" 
packages is superior to volume two from Polydor or MCA's "Greatest Hits 
1976-1986." Of the studio collections, "Elton John," the 1970 debut, still 
offers the most disarming glimpse of the freshness and craft that he brought to 
pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Lennon -- You can't go wrong with the four-disc "Lennon," which 
contains more than 70 tracks, but anyone looking for a more modest introduction 
should stick with "Plastic Ono Band," the landmark 1970 album that set a new 
standard for introspection and raw emotion in rock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bob Marley -- Marley is not only the most important figure ever in reggae, 
but one of the most vital of the entire rock era. You can sample his work 
nicely in his splendid "Live!" from 1976, but serious pop and reggae fans 
shouldn't settle for anything less than "Songs of Freedom," the four-disc box 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rod Stewart -- Stewart has done some delightful work during his uneven 
tenure at Warner Bros. Records, but the British singer defined his art in the 
'70s on Mercury, a period captured nicely in "Rod Stewart: The Mercury 
Anthology." Among the selections in the two-disc package: "Maggie May," "Every 
Picture Tells a Story" and his original "Reason to Believe."

HOME TECH: LASER BIN: STAR TALK ENRICHES 'THE COMANCHEROS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Westerns enjoying something of a renaissance, it's exciting to rediscover 
a classic released on laser with new insights offered on its 
analogue-discussion track. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox/Image, in its special "Wide-screen Collector's Edition" of "The 
Comancheros" ($60), has rounded up four co-stars -- Stuart Whitman, Nehemiah 
Persoff, Michael Ansara and Patrick Wayne -- whose memories serve up an 
analogue track that lets us see some of what the actor's life was like on a 
remote location 30 years ago, where chess and poker games for unusual stakes 
helped fight boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Comancheros" was director Michael Curtiz's last movie after a string of 
hits that included "Casablanca," "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "The Adventures of 
Robin Hood." The 1961 movie based on a Paul Wellman novel, which stars John 
Wayne as a Texas Ranger, includes Lee Marvin in a supporting role and 
wide-screen scenery that won't quit. 
</P>
<P>
 The rich, unspoiled Utah backdrop that doubled for Texas returns unscathed and 
breathtaking in this rich, crisp transfer. The red-dirt bluffs and plains, in 
fact, emerge as some of the strongest memories for the cast, with both Whitman 
and Ansara in particular recalling how the vistas took their breath away, even 
as they were shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the young Whitman, getting the love interest -- and the late, lovely 
Ina Balin at that -- in a John Wayne movie was also enough to take his breath 
away. "I can't get enough of that," he says, watching the scene again. "A 
little smooching and hugging with Ina Balin," he sighs. "And she smelled so 
nice. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 All the actors have only the fondest memories of the Duke himself. Wayne "took 
interest in every aspect of the film," Persoff recalls, with Curtiz, who was 
"old" by then, willing to carry out suggestions from Wayne, who had just 
finished directing "The Alamo." 
</P>
<P>
 Son Patrick Wayne recalls the film as giving him an opportunity to spend time 
with his dad without competition from his siblings, and also to watch his 
father at work as a major presence on screen and on the set. "When you were in 
a John Wayne film, there were always two directors," Wayne and the credited 
director, Patrick Wayne remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ansara, an actor of Lebanese ancestry who often was typecast as a Native 
American (Cochise in the TV series "Broken Arrow"), the chance to play a bad 
guy and to work with Wayne at the same time was an irresistible combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though all four actors have distinctive voices, it is still sometimes 
difficult to know who is talking when on the analogue track. It would have been 
helpful if producers Bret Hampton and Dennis Rood had identified them 
throughout rather than just when they are initially introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one time when the seeing the original film's trailer adds a new 
dimension to the project. A scene shown in the trailer helps explain a hole in 
the film, obviously the result of one cutting-room snip too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bonuses include stills, publicity and marketing material and script 
excerpts. One clever idea instituted by the producers is to move the still 
material forward through the use of repeated dissolves. This takes some of the 
burden off the viewer's finger -- interactivity is not always all it's cracked 
up to be -- and if you want to stay on one picture all you have to do is freeze 
it. This is one method other producers might consider for future laser 
projects.

 Snoop Dogg is creeping up on Mariah Carey. His "Doggystyle," which slipped to 
No. 4 last week, appeared ready to slip down the chart.But he's back up to No. 
2, barking at chart-leader Carey's door. Singer-rapper R. Kelly's steamy "12 
Play" continues its rapid rise, bounding from No. 22 to No. 11. Giant steps up 
the chart: Counting Crows' "August and Everything After" (No. 70 to No. 32) and 
the "Philadelphia" soundtrack, featuring a new Bruce Springsteen song, climbed 
from No. 74 to No. 34. "All for Love," by Bryan Adams, Sting and Rod Stewart, 
is still the No. 1 pop single. 04,38,06,08,08 Rank Rank 2 Weeks Last Weeks on

Vogue, which rocketed from No. 69 to No. 22 on the pop chart, is powering the 
album's ascent.

HOME TECH: VIDEO: NEW PRODUCTS CREATE A BUZZ AT SHOW; MANUFACTURERS HOPE TO 
ATTRACT BUYERS WITH GIZMOS RANGING FROM A COMMERCIAL ELIMINATOR FOR TV TAPING 
TO UNITS THAT HANDLE 8MM AND VHS TAPES AT THE SAME TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, new audio-video products 
were showcased that the industry is still buzzing about. Most were just 
introduced in the past few months or will debut this year: 
</P>
<P>
 * The commercial eliminator: Tired of fast-forwarding through commercials when 
you tape a TV show? Eliminate that headache with this pain reliever. Hook it up 
to your VCR (it's compatible with all brands), tape the show and when you play 
it back . . . presto! -- no commercials. Called the Commercial Brake Model 1000 
-- because it's shaped like a brake -- the demonstration of this machine was 
very impressive. Costing about as much as a basic VCR, $200, it's due in April 
from Arista Technologies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Casio's TV-clock-radio combo: The AV-100, a great gadget for the 
gadget-oriented, features a digital clock and a 2.5-inch LCD (liquid crystal 
display) color TV screen. The most fascinating feature is the full-month 
calender, which shows up on the screen at the push of a button. It's available 
in June for $300. 
</P>
<P>
 * This will be the year that the 8mm/VHS decks finally arrive. These are 
dual-well units that accommodate both 8mm and VHS tapes at the same time, 
allowing you to edit 8mm camcorder tapes onto VHS cassettes for playback on 
standard VCRs. There's a patent squabble going on, but now it looks as if 
Goldstar may introduce a unit in April and Go-Video -- the chief dual-deck 
company -- will launch one in the second half of the year. Prices aren't 
available yet but they'll probably be expensive -- costing at least $700. 
</P>
<P>
 * In portable audio, Sony has a new MiniDisc player/recorder, the MZ-R2, 
that's smaller and lighter (11 ounces) than any on the market. Battery life in 
the playback mode has increased to 2.5 hours. The MiniDisc (small recordable 
CD) format has yet to click with consumers. Since MiniDisc is geared to the 
portables market, Sony hopes this ultra-light unit will be more attractive to 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * More companies are introducing headphone CD units this year equipped with 
anti-shock systems like those in MiniDisc players. With the anti-shock buffers, 
you won't get as many interruptions in the music. Kenwood has three of these 
units and Panasonic is marketing two. This extra feature won't be a huge extra 
expense. The prices of the new units -- in the $200-$300 range -- aren't much 
different from portables already on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake Tapes: Don't go to your video store looking for instructional tapes 
about quake survival and preparedness. In a spot check of 20 stores around the 
Southland, none had any in stock. It's not that they were checked out -- they 
were never stocked in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't blame the retailers. They stock what rents and sells -- which is 
movies, not instructional tapes. Small stores in particular have less room for 
tapes that generate little consumer interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The other problem is that are no new, high-profile, high-quality tapes from 
major companies about quake survival and preparedness. It's time for one of the 
big companies to market such a tape. With Californians anxious about the next 
big one, the tape would be a big hit. What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday" (New Line, no set price). The final 
Jason flick? We should be so lucky. This homicidal maniac is seemingly bumped 
off but keeps coming back to life so he can orchestrate those gross gore-fests 
-- massacring teens at Crystal Lake -- that delight horror fans. Each film 
rates higher on the gore-meter. Can't wait for "Jason 20." 
</P>
<P>
 "Blood In . . . Blood Out: Bound by Honor" (Hollywood, no set price). Unfairly 
downgraded by many as "Boyz in the East L.A. Hood," director Taylor Hackford's 
sprawling movie is a gritty probe of the underbelly of Chicano culture, 
following three cousins raised as brothers from the early '70s to the early 
'80s. Yes, it's too long (three hours) and too obviously borrows from classic 
gangster movies, but it's fairly well-acted (by talented unknowns) and features 
some riveting moments -- particularly the prison scenes. Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced: Hollywood's "The Joy Luck Club" is due March 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Also: "Rookie of the Year," "Hard Target," "The Coneheads" and "Last Action 
Hero" (Wednesday); "Poetic Justice," "Kalifornia" and "Indochine" (Feb. 2); "In 
the Line of Fire," "The Meteor Man," "Amongst Friends" and "That Night" (Feb. 
9); "The Secret Garden" (Feb. 15); "Man Without a Face" and "The Program" (Feb. 
16); "For Love or Money," "Son of the Pink Panther," "Dazed and Confused," 
"Son-in-Law," "Needful Things," "Strictly Ballroom" and "Boxing Helena" (Feb. 
23); "Much Ado About Nothing," "The Good Son" and "Striking Distance" (March 
2); "The Fox and the Hound" (March 4); "Manhattan Murder Mystery," "Judgment 
Night" and "So I Married an Axe Murderer" (March 9); "Gettysburg" (March 16); 
"The Fugitive" (March 22); "Fatal Instinct" (March 23); "Malice" (April 13).

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; 'CLIFFHANGER' FINALLY TAKES A PLUNGE

 After hanging on precariously to the top rental spot, warding off the strong 
challenges of "The Firm" and "Sleepless in Seattle" over the holidays, 
"Cliffhanger" finally toppled--all the way to No. 4. But it sure had an 
impressive run.Few industry observers figured it would outduel "The Firm" and 
"Sleepless in Seattle" for as long as it did. Look out for "Dave," the Kevin 
Kline comedy about the presidential look-alike, which is starting to make a 
move. "Dave" jumped from No. 9 to No. 5 and should climb a few more rungs next 
week. "True Romance," the violent drama starring Christian Slater, debuted at 
No. 13. Though not a big box-office hit ($11.5-million gross), the lure of 
Slater--plus a strong supporting cast--should make "Romance" popular among late 
teens and twentysomething renters. "Hocus Pocus," which grossed nearly $40 
million, entered at No. 14 and has a good shot at making the Top 5. 03,28,06,08 
Rank Weeks Last on the Week Chart 1."The Firm" 4 3 2."Sleepless in Seattle" 3 4

parody, starring Charlie Sheen, opened at No. 12 and will easily shoot into the 
Top 10. This kind of comedy, with its scatter-gun, non-stop humor, is big among 
renters. "Hot Shots" was a box-office hot shot too, raking in $38.6 million.

THEATER BEAT: THEATER REVIEWS; 'LITTLE MIKEY' TRAVELS OVER OLD TERRITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cute tykes in cereal commercials notwithstanding, there aren't many worthwhile 
shows with a hero named Mikey. It's a moniker that tells you all you need to 
know about the swell fella and wholesome tone of "The Ballad of Little Mikey" 
at the Celebration Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 This perky coming-of-age musical tracks the escapades of the titular clean-cut 
UCLA student (vivacious Mark Smith) as he discovers his homosexuality, meets 
guys, becomes an activist, and, along the way, finds a mate. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tale is told in flashback to 1980, with the present-tense scenes 
serving primarily as quick signposts toward the moment when our gallant hero 
chooses (surprise, surprise) to go on fighting the good fight. He even turns 
down a megabucks job offer in order to do this. And whaddaya know, his 
boyfriend doesn't mind. Mikey! Hey, Mikey!  
</P>
<P>
 This overly determined string of events (a.k.a. the coming-out play) has 
become a staple plot line not only in gay theater, but in many dramas of 
recognition and identity. In feminist theater, the story's about a housewife 
who discovers a vocation or her own sexuality. In various ethnicity-specific 
theaters, it's about the mainstreaming, material success or politicization of a 
member of the younger generation. But the point's nearly always the same: to 
show a group to itself, and also to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay theater as a literature has evolved way beyond this stage, though, so it's 
odd to see a new musical traipse over the same ground. But even if the content 
is facile, "The Ballad of Little Mikey" is performed with such exuberance -- by 
a skilled ensemble, under the energetic direction of Celebration artistic 
director Robert Schrock -- that Mark Savage's book, music and lyrics seem more 
substantial than they really are. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Ballad of Little Mikey," Celebration Theatre, 7051-B Santa Monica 
Blvd., West Hollywood. Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 20. $20. (213) 
660-8587. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes.

THEATER BEAT: FAR FROM A FINE 'ROMANCE/ROMANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Romance/Romance" at the International City Theatre is more likely to make you 
gag than swoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A double-header of namby-pamby musicals by Barry Harman and Keith Hermann, the 
two stories are linked only because they're both about attractions.But these 
are both flings that should be flung. Far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Act 1, "The Little Comedy," is based on an Arthur Schnitzler tale of two 
monied turn-of-the-century Vienners (Chuck Rosen, Susan Hoffmann) who go 
slumming in their best bohemian rags, on the lookout for love. They just happen 
to find each other while in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 Act 2 is even more trite and contrived. It's set in the Hamptons in the 1980s, 
where two yuppie couples (Rosen and Laura Akard; Hoffman and John Sovec) have 
taken a time-share condo on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Husband A wants Wife B, of course, and they spend the whole play yammering 
about it. But if this tedious -- not to mention emotionally dishonest -- riff 
doesn't put the kibosh on any and all passions, it's hard to say what would. 
</P>
<P>
 At least there's a standout male lead, rich-voiced Rosen, who gets a few 
decent showcase numbers out of this whole sordid little affair. His 
pitch-perfect musical theater demeanor rises above the material, particularly 
in Act 1. But his fellow cast members aren't so lucky. And director caryn morse 
has done little to fill in the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Romance/Romance," International City Theatre, Long Beach City College, 
Clark and Harvey Way, Long Beach. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 2 and 7 
p.m. Ends Feb. 20. $16. (310) 420-4128 or (213) 480-3232. Running time: 2

THEATER BEAT: SEWING FOR AIDS QUILT 'IN STITCHES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seldom has a putative comedy brought together so many melodramatic cliches as 
Brian Christopher Williams' "In Stitches" at the Hollywood Court Theatre. An 
amateurish ditty about a quilting bee for the AIDS quilt even makes its cast 
look shoddy.And that's no mean feat, given that several of these actors have 
been known to turn in staunch work on other L.A. stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnelle (Lorey Hayes) runs the bee in the basement of a house whose occupant 
is a grouchy older woman (Sandra Kinder) who actually has lines like "I ain't 
afraid of you, Missy." The group's participants include a flighty young mother 
named Mona (Jeanie Hackett) and a husband and wife who've lost their son. When 
the dead son's mate, Max, shows up, things get snarly. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to an actor's illness on press night, playwright Williams went on in the 
role of Max and did a passable job, considering. But apropos of his play, 
someone should advise him, as Johnelle says to Mona, that "There's nothing as 
hard as letting go." After all, "Grievin' is hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 * "In Stitches," Hollywood Court Theatre at the Hollywood United Methodist 
Church, 6817 Franklin Ave., Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 
p.m. Ends Feb. 13. $15. (213) 660-TKTS. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes.

TV REVIEW; 'THE STATE' WILD, CRAZY -- AND NOT FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With "The State" (premiering tonight at 9), MTV has its first new live-action 
half-hour comedy show in quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait -- what does that make "The Grind," then? 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously, folks, "The State" features the wild and crazy antics of the 
titular New York comedy troupe, made up of recent New York University alumni 
between the ages of 22 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently they all watched a lot of "Monty Python's Flying Circus" reruns 
during late-night studying breaks. Like a lot of thus-influenced contemporary 
ensemble comedy, the show's full of absurdity for absurdity's sake, and not 
much else. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance publicity promises a weekly series "that isn't afraid to take a raw 
comedic look at today's pop culture." You never would've guessed from tonight's 
premiere, which comes closest to raw pop culture with a mock-game show sketch 
in which Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen inebriatedly field a grinning host's 
queries about heroin and the like. Boy, there's some raging topicality for you. 
</P>
<P>
 The opener does have one bright spot, an amusing skit with a young couple 
doing the wild thing on a couch, while their respective sets of hormones dance 
around the living room enacting how well the clinch is or isn't going -- 
suggesting that some of the players have a gift for physical comedy that might 
be further tapped later on. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the best moment in the series opener is on the level of an average 
Groundlings or Kids in the Hall sketch, and the feeble others (a recurring bit 
about an overloaded elevator, a faux cereal commercial consisting of 
mush-mouthed nonsense talk) don't even approach that plateau, the state of "The 
State" isn't encouraging. CHRIS WILLMAN

AMAN FOLK JUMPS FOR DAYS OF JOY; DANCE: THE TROUPE WILL INCLUDE A SUITE OF 
CELEBRATORY DANCES FROM PRE-WAR CROATIA ON ITS INTERNATIONAL BILL AT SADDLEBACK 
COLLEGE ON SATURDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Media images of a country torn asunder by war will be replaced with the 
multicolored vision of a joyous land when the Los Angeles-based Aman Folk 
Ensemble arrives in Orange County on Saturday with a new Croatian work. 
</P>
<P>
 That country's villagers once gathered to celebrate through music and dance 
"just about every major turning point in the year and in life," says Aman 
artistic director Barry Glass. "This was where community was built. 
</P>
<P>
 "Posavina," a suite of traditional dances titled after a region in central 
Croatia, had its premiere last week in Los Angeles. Choreographed by Glass, 
it's one of a dozen works from such diverse areas as Northern Mexico, central 
Asia and Appalachia on the well-known troupe's program at Saddleback College in 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a piece I've been wanting to do for a while," Glass said in a recent 
phone interview from the troupe's Los Angeles office. "To me, it conveys in 
music, dance, costume and motif a time or a type of traditional society that 
was much more ordered than the modern world allows." 
</P>
<P>
 Music, not movement style, always provides the inspirational spark for new 
works, said Glass, noting that "Posavina's" accompaniment begins with slow, a 
cappella singing, performed by the dancers, in three-part harmony typical of 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, its mostly quick, upbeat melodies are created by a small string 
ensemble known as a tamburica , with instruments ranging from a string bass to 
a high-pitched bisernica , which looks something like a Ping-Pong paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not Croatian," said Glass, 46, "but I learned some of their dances as a 
child and during the early days of folk dancing in the U.S. Then, as I got more 
interested, I learned more from folklorists in Croatia . . . who were wonderful 
about taking us places and showing us steps." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Croatian dance, represented elsewhere in Aman's repertory, was 
influenced by dances of nearby Hungary, Italy and the Slovenian Alps. Thus, it 
is characterized by its variety of steps, from hops to stamps, and formations, 
from couples to large circles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the country's most popular dance was the drmes , or shaking dance, 
composed of small, precise movements, Glass said. "When you do these little 
steps, there are tight, little bounces, and the body shakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Croatian dance, you're either doing it well, or you feel like a clod," he 
continued, citing another reason for liking it: "I've always been known for 
very precise foot work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Except in a few local professional troupes, today's Croatians rarely perform 
their traditional dances, which, until a couple of decades ago, were key to 
such rites of passage as marriage, Glass said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These dances were part of a traditional society that was quite insular, but 
when people began to get TVs . . . traditional society began to change, and 
thus the dance began to change. If we lose the reasons for dancing, then we 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
 "Posavina's" colorful, handmade costumes, which Aman easily and inexpensively 
obtained in the early '70s, have nearly disappeared too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditional dress leaves even earlier than the dances," Glass said. "They 
wear Western-style ready-mades now." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the troupe, which takes its name from the Eastern European and Middle 
Eastern pronunciation of "amen," will mark its 30th anniversary with 
performances at UCLA, where it was founded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trip has had its ups and downs. The company's U.S. touring schedule is up 
to three months this year, but it's been as low as two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes folk dance is trendy; sometimes it isn't," said Glass, a native 
Angeleno who's been with the troupe for 27 years and still performs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the late '80s, during the high-tech 'me decade,' the values we represent 
were not very much in vogue, and our bookings were way down." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the secret to survival is Aman's touring educational program, which 
has continued to grow, Glass said, as well as the company's performers and 
staffers -- "these wonderfully dedicated people who continue to ride it out." 
</P>
<P>
 As for attracting audiences, Glass somewhat reluctantly used "the A-word," 
which he said often has had a negative connotation in the dance world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're accessible," he said. "When people see us, they might not 
connect with everything, but they'll connect with something." 
</P>
<P>
 * Aman Folk Ensemble performs Saturday at 8 p.m. at the McKinney Theatre , 
Saddleback College, 28000 Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo. $14-$16. (714)

THEATER / MARK CHALON SMITH; TRYING ITS WINGS; UCI CONJURES UP 'M. BUTTERFLY,' 
A TALE OF SEXUAL, POLITICAL ILLUSION -- WITH NUDITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1986, a bizarre story of sexual and political misdirection thrilled Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 A French diplomat was on trial for espionage, but that wasn't the real grabber 
in this gender-twisting shell game. Bernard Boursicot revealed in court that he 
had an affair for nearly 20 years with Shi Pei Pu, a male Chinese Opera star 
whom Boursicot believed to be female. 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing deception went beyond the boudoir drag show, for Pei Pu was also a 
spy who persuaded Boursicot to pass state secrets to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 A few American newspapers picked up the accounts, and soon readers in the 
States were fascinated. David Henry Hwang, the respected playwright of "The 
Dance and the Railroad" and "Family Devotions," was among them. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the tale, changed some names, added a few dramatic refinements and 
came up with "M. Butterfly," one of the biggest hits of the 1988 Broadway 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, UC Irvine takes on the drama, which has been produced in more than 30 
countries and was recently made into a movie starring Jeremy Irons and John 
Lone. UCI's "M. Butterfly," directed by drama professor Keith Fowler, flutters 
into the Irvine Barclay Theatre tonight. It runs for two weekends, through Jan. 
29. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everybody else, Fowler was drawn to the play because it's such a great 
yarn, a "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" for the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The historical aspect is just fascinating; I mean, who could believe (the 
story) if we didn't know it really happened?" he said during a break in 
rehearsals this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "But beyond (the strange facts), it's compelling because it gets us to look at 
how the West perceives the East (and) how men perceive women, as submissive and 
mysterious." 
</P>
<P>
 During a lecture at UCI in 1992, Hwang elaborated on that. He said his goal in 
writing "M. Butterfly" was, in part, to dispel the "fantasy stereotype of the 
Orient." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallimard, Hwang's stand-in for Boursicot, believes that Song (Pei Pu) is a 
woman because he has an image of Asian women as modest and reticent, which 
allows him to be deceived, the author explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler agreed, but pointed out that the relationship also shows just how far 
someone will go to maintain love, or at least a romantic vision of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, 'M. Butterfly' reminds us that we get deeply into the act of 
courting," he said. "We do have our illusions about what our partner is or what 
we want them to be. Even faced with reality, we separate from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, Gallimard says, 'I love and have been loved by the perfect 
woman,' even after he knows (that Song) is a man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said he's admired the play ever since he first saw it in New York a few 
years ago. Describing "M. Butterfly" as "an audience-friendly play that 
combines humor and a powerful narrative with moments of conflict," the director 
noted that he's tried to be faithful to the script. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes a couple of nude scenes Fowler believes are essential to the 
production. The first involves an actress playing a calendar girl in a fantasy 
scene. The second, and more important, finds Song stripping before Gallimard 
and the audience, finally revealing that he's a man. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that some people don't like them; we've had people call the box 
office (during past shows) to find out if there's nudity," he said. "In this 
case, we hope audiences will realize that it's critical to the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scenes aren't lengthy, and they aren't gratuitous . . . but one is in 
your face. When Song says, 'You've always wanted to strip me,' and then he 
takes all his clothes off, it's a crucial moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing Andre Evangelista, the young Filipino-American drama student, for 
that passage, as well as the rest of the play, was also crucial. And not 
without its grinning moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said Evangelista "is going to be a very fine actor," but reaching his 
feminine side wasn't always that easy during rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler recalled asking a female stage assistant to help Evangelista dress and 
walk. "She came in (wearing) spike heels and a tight dress, just to give him an 
idea. Then there was Andre, wearing his two-inch starter heels, stumbling 
around . . . at that point, I wasn't accepting him (as Song), but now I've come 
around; he's getting comfortable with a very demanding role." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to Gallimard, Fowler turned to Alan Schack, a UCI drama graduate 
student in his 40s, who was trained in New York and is a veteran of many 
regional productions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like many critics, Fowler didn't like the movie version. He said it had "a 
'Crying Game' quality," which tended to ignore the drama's more subtle 
reflections on gender and love. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, however, express hope that the publicity generated by the film might 
prompt interest in the UCI production. On the other hand, all the attention may 
make the odd story behind "M. Butterfly" now seem old hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there's still curiosity about this," he said. "Anyway, this play is 
better as a play, not a movie. I hope they come in because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * UC Irvine's production "M. Butterfly" by David Henry Hwang opens tonight at 
8 at the Irvine Barclay Theatre , 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. Performances 
continue Saturday and next Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m., with matinees 
at 2 on Sunday and Jan. 29. $6 to $14. (714) 856-6616 or (714) 854-4646.

MUSIC REVIEW; CROZIER PLAYS WITH ELAN ON CATHEDRAL ORGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As some restaurants should be saved only for special events, some concert 
venues should be used only for musical marathons, anniversaries or other gala 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crystal Cathedral, home of that huge, 12-year-old amalgam of two mammoth 
instruments -- a Ruffatti and a Skinner, an organ standing five stories tall 
and incorporating 13,000 pipes, five manuals and 223 ranks -- is such a venue. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive instrument was utilized appropriately Tuesday night, however, when 
Catharine Crozier, the veteran American organist who turned 80 last Friday, 
shared her birthday recital with a large audience of well-wishers, a few of 
whom no doubt came to see if Crozier still retains her fabled technique and 
probing musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. The beloved organist -- looking slender but not frail, 
approaching the instrument with a purposeful walk and revealing its complex 
resources with unfailing insight -- still offers musical integrity and 
virtuosic elan as the foundation of her recital performances. With Crozier, now 
as always, it seems, satisfaction can be guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her anniversary recital -- she had also given comparable concerts at the 
Garden Grove church noting her 70th and 75th birthdays -- took no easy course. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with three organ chorales of Bach, crested on a suite of excerpts 
from Nicolas de Grigny's "Mass for Organ," revived for our delectation Jehan 
Alain's brief and haunting Second Fantasy and ascended the several breathtaking 
climaxes of contrasting virtuoso pieces by Leo Sowerby: the late Fantasy for 
Flute Stops, "Requiescat in Pace" (1920) and the Toccata (1940). 
</P>
<P>
 All these works Crozier delivered with sense and affection. Having conquered 
their various and pesky demands long since, she could concentrate on 
communicating their messages and structures. The results were, not 
surprisingly, engrossing and instructive.

THEATER REVIEW; CORPORATE EXEC PAYS HIGH PRICE FOR SUCCESS IN 'HOTELS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The price of the American dream is a Faustian nightmare in Jon Robin Baitz's 
"Three Hotels." 
</P>
<P>
 Success at the top of the corporate ladder can come at the cost of losing 
one's soul. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 play's exquisitely realized West Coast premiere staging at San Diego 
Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Space fingers those for whom profits justify the 
means. 
</P>
<P>
 Baitz's simple story, told in three alternating monologues in three hotels by 
a corporate executive and his wife, puts a human face on a very specific crime 
-- the strategy of selling baby formula to mothers in developing countries. The 
women, ignorant of how to use the formula, unwittingly kill their babies by 
mixing it with undrinkable water or diluting the stuff too much. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crime fits many others -- those who defend the sale of guns or who 
glamorize cigarettes, and downtown redevelopers who justify razing low-income 
housing because they can make more bucks building expensive boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, astonishing in its maturity for the 32-year-old Baitz (who has said 
he modeled the couple on his own parents), is a cross between "Death of a 
Salesman" and "Glengarry Glen Ross." Kenneth Hoyle, drawn with intense, 
restless intelligence by Rep artistic director Douglas Jacobs, has Willy 
Loman's desire to please coupled with the cutthroat nature of Mamet's men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoyle is dragged down because he has a burden he can't shake -- a 
conscience -- personified by his love for his wife, played with graceful 
despair by Jacobs' real-life wife, Darla Cash. And when his wife gives up on 
the onetime Peace Corps activist she married, in the form of baring her 
feelings in a speech before the corporate wives, he loses everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Baitz's point of view in this 75-minute play is so crashingly clear, 
the show runs the risk of making its points with big dull thuds. Director Todd 
Salovey wisely keeps it fluid and moving, emphasizing the humanity, the anguish 
and the growing emptiness of the Hoyles at every irresistible turn. It soon 
becomes clear why the piece is told in monologue form -- this couple can no 
longer communicate directly. Violin solos by Myla Wingard (who will alternate 
with Karen Elaine) precede and punctuate the monologues, complementing the 
musical inevitability of the couple's quiet, inexorable tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Patel's spare scenic design sets off the tale elegantly on a black 
marbled thrust stage with sand suggesting a beach in front of it. Under Brenda 
Berry's suggestive lighting, candles flicker through a scrim like the souls of 
the dead. Judy Watson's well-chosen costumes fit to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three Hotels" premiered on PBS in 1991, and was seen Off Broadway last year, 
but this staging deserves to be seen too.

POP NOTES / MIKE BOEHM: TROUBLE DOLLS TOY WITH HARD TIMES; TITANS CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Trouble has found the Trouble Dolls. Bassist Mark Soden and lead guitarist 
Michael Bay left the band in December after it played its first tour, an 
eight-day West Coast trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could have had the commitment to stay together, we could have worked 
things out," said a disappointed John Surge, Trouble Dolls singer and 
songwriter. "Michael wants to go do his own things, write his own songs. With 
Mark, there was a personality conflict. For whatever reason, it wasn't 
harmonious any more. I think it's unfortunate, but you've got to carry on. I'm 
in this for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble Dolls released a strong 1993 debut album, "Cement." Surge said that he 
and drummer Ron Cambra have been rehearsing with former Leonards guitarist 
Lenny Grassa, and are auditioning bassists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael was an integral part of the band, so it will be new, probably a 
little more aggressive," Surge said. "We'll probably be back in action in 
mid-February playing shows, and we're already thinking about a second album." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bay and Soden will resurface in a new band, the Michael Bay Magnet, 
which plays its first show tonight at System M in Long Beach. Other members are 
drummer Nick Zeigler, formerly of the Leonards, and pianist Art Bailey. Soden 
also is working as producer-engineer for the Costa Mesa rock duo Big Enjoyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Soden said that, for him, Trouble Dolls became "a situation that was 
unbelievably uncomfortable. When people are that unhappy, it's just time to 
move on. Michael wanted to play his own songs, and it appeared there was no 
place for them in the other ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CLASH OF THE TITANS: Unhappy with the way Giant Records promoted its 1992 
debut album, "Now I Eat Them," Xtra Large has split with the label. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's manager, Jon St. James, said that Giant set a deadline for demo 
recordings of songs for the next Xtra Large album, then dropped the band when 
it deliberately stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are ecstatic," said St. James, who acknowledges that he himself had 
misgivings about walking away from a deal that would have given the band a 
substantial recording budget for its second album. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Warren Fitzgerald said the members decided they did not want to rush 
into another album, especially since the band has just added a new singer, Dave 
Quackenbush, to replace the fired Darren McNamee. 
</P>
<P>
 With drummer Josh Freese having spent most of 1993 on the road in Paul 
Westerberg's band, and Fitzgerald busy in the studio as a new, adjunct member 
of Oingo Boingo, the band decided to take a go-slow approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Darren out of the group," which also includes bassist Bob Thomson, 
"we're re-evaluating our whole situation," Fitzgerald said. "We didn't want to 
be under the gun" to record a new album immediately. "We wanted to do it right, 
to have it happen more naturally. Now we have an opportunity to start from 
scratch, without any preconceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 The first change will be a new name: Fitzgerald said Xtra Large is now calling 
itself Xtra Medium, although that, too, could be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee's wildly unpredictable, sometimes crude on- and off-stage antics 
apparently became a bit too much, even for band mates who themselves aren't 
beyond wildly unpredictable antics of questionable taste. He has formed a new 
band called Pierre Pants, which will play Jan. 28 at Our House in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald, Freese and Quackenbush also play in the Vandals. They can be heard 
and/or seen on "Sweatin' to the Oldies," a live Vandals album that Triple X is 
releasing on video and compact disc. It's taken from a show last January at the 
Ice House in Fullerton. 
</P>

<P>
 ENCORE: Channel Three is back on the punk rock dial. 
</P>
<P>
 In its initial incarnation, Channel Three was a Cerritos-based hard core punk 
band that first built a following in the early '80s at the storied Costa Mesa 
punk club, the Cuckoo's Nest. 
</P>
<P>
 After switching styles from racing punk to melodic hard rock in the mid-'80s, 
Channel Three lost part of its audience and eventually called it a career in 
1987. The band staged reunions in 1990-91, but had no intention of returning as 
a going concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, encouraged by the boom in punk-inspired alternative rock, founding 
members Kimm Gardener and Mike Magrann have decided to revive the band.  
</P>
<P>
 The initial spark, says Gardener, was an unexpected call last May from the 
promoter of a punk-rock festival in Portland. A fan of Channel Three, he wanted 
to book the band on the festival bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardener, who plays guitar, and vocalist Magrann played the gig and 
subsequently decided that the climate is right for Round Two of Channel Three. 
Joining the two original members are newcomers Alf Silva on drums and Mitch 
McNally on bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing more of the earlier stuff at this point," Gardener said. "We're 
working on new material, and we've met with a couple of record labels that are 
interested." A brief European tour has been booked for next month. "It seems 
full steam ahead," Gardener said. "It's exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Three plays Jan. 28 at the Electric Circus in Buena Park, with Decry 
and Derailed opening. (714) 827-1210.

 HEY, CISCO!: Cisco Poison, a trio led by former T.S.O.L. front man Joe Wood, 
has signed a three-album contract with PMRC, an affiliate of the Orange-based 
Doctor Dream label. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's debut album, due this summer, will be Wood's first release since 
T.S.O.L.'s finale, "Strange Love" in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone back to the focus of the 'Revenge' album," Wood said, referring to 
a T.S.O.L. record from 1986 that had a dark, Doors-influenced punk/blues slant, 
in contrast to the heavy metal cast of the band's final releases. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood says he "went into a commercial thing" in recent years, hoping to land a 
major label deal. Now, "I'm back on an independent label, and I'm happy to be 
there and make another record, and I'm excited to go and tour on the 
grass-roots level." 
</P>
<P>
 PMRC, which stands for Pat McKeon Record Company, debuted in 1992 with "Mosh 
on Fire," a compilation album of punk-metal bands from Southern California. The 
label's roster also includes two Bay Area bands, Fifty Lashes and Assemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Before launching his own label, McKeon sang in the Orange County heavy metal 
band Max Havoc.

<P>
 FROM HONK TO HOLY: Former Honk saxophonist Craig Buhler has branched into 
Christian music. 
</P>
<P>
 Buhler, who played in the popular Laguna Beach band in the 1970s, lives in 
Seattle now and has just released his second solo album, "Clouds of Heaven." He 
will lead a band of Southern California musicians in a free concert Jan. 29 at 
6:30 p.m. at the Vineyard Christian Fellowship, 5340 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stekol, another Honk alumnus, produced the album and will play guitar 
in Buhler's concert lineup. (714) 777-4777.

 PREMIUM SEATING? It will be a tough job to reinstall the 17-ton Sony Jumbotron 
scoreboard on Anaheim Stadium's left-field roof that fell in Monday's quake. 
But maybe even tougher, once that's done: How do you persuade people to buy 
tickets for the seats right below it?. . . . "You hire a bunch of experts who 
determine that it is safe," says stadium General Manager Greg Smith."It's the 
same as driving over the freeway bridges. We won't let anybody sit there until 
it is safe."

 THREE-WAY WIN: Bahia Wilson gave up a year of her time to serve on the 1993-94 
Orange County Grand Jury. While she says "it's the best job I've ever had -- I 
really feel like I made a difference," Wilson has concerns that the grand jury 
doesn't represent the county's growing diversity. But it may next time. . . . 
Thanks to efforts of her special committee, applications for the 1994-95 grand 
jury show a marked increase in diversity in age, gender and race. You can still 
apply, through Jan. 28.

 WHAT ABOUT HILLARY? UC Irvine economist Richard McKenzie, the author of 16 
books, voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. So how's Clinton doing after one year, 
in McKenzie's grade book? Uh, D+. . . . And that's only because McKenzie gives 
the president a B in international trade -- McKenzie gives him F's in tax and 
labor, and D's in just about anything else economy-related. . . . McKenzie 
predicted for 120 local business leaders at an Irvine breakfast Thursday that 
Clinton will not only fail to get reelected in 1996, he won't even win the 
Democratic nomination.

QUAKE VICTIMS LINE UP FOR AID; VENTURA COUNTY STARTS BIG JOB OF REBUILDING; 
DISASTER: GOV. PETE WILSON CONSOLES AREA RESIDENTS. RELIEF OFFICES OPEN IN SIMI 
VALLEY AND FILLMORE. THE OVERALL DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 51. 
</P>

<P>
 Disaster relief offices opened in Simi Valley and Fillmore on Thursday, and 
hundreds of earthquake victims began applying for tens of millions of dollars 
in government aid as Ventura County started to rebuild from its most costly 
disaster in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggering from $1 billion in damage countywide, earthquake victims showed up 
at daybreak for a 1 p.m. opening of the Simi Valley center to apply for loans 
and grants to repair or replace crumpled homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting for this," said Dave Starr, owner of a three-story 
Victorian home near collapse in Fillmore. "We want to start (rebuilding) right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 The two Ventura County disaster aid centers were among 11 opened Thursday 
within 30 miles of the epicenter of Monday's disastrous 6.6-magnitude 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall death toll climbed to 51 Thursday when a helicopter carrying two 
people checking Tejon Pass oil pipelines crashed. The pilot was not identified, 
but the passenger was engineer Michael A. Scully, 33, of Bakersfield, son of 
Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Vin Scully.  
</P>
<P>
 As damage estimates stabilized at perhaps $30 billion across Southern 
California, Gov. Pete Wilson toured hard-hit areas, pledging an array of state 
aid. In Simi Valley, he comforted earthquake victims as they waited to apply 
for state and federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate the grit and courage and resiliency that you folks have shown in 
what is really terrible suffering," Wilson said to quake victim Jim Coyle, 
whose Simi Valley house has cracked walls and a toppled chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 As hundreds of victims watched from a long, slow-moving line at the Simi 
Valley disaster center, Wilson said the state has arranged for private 
financial institutions to make "bridge loans" until federal businesses loans 
come through in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Governor, they seem like they all forgot us in Simi Valley, what about Simi 
Valley?" implored one middle-aged woman near tears. The governor said Simi 
Valley had not been forgotten and its disaster center was the first to be 
opened in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a 1 p.m. opening of the disaster offices and a crush of waiting 
victims in Simi Valley and Fillmore, most of the 1,300 quake victims were given 
future appointments instead of personal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get any questions answered, all we got were a bunch of forms," said 
Jack Starnes of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments to earthquake victims could come within days for emergency housing, 
cleanup and repair, but housing and business loans will take weeks or months to 
process, said Kati Corsaut of the state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Simi Valley-area victims have appointments through next Monday, 
and about 100 more were scheduled for interviews in Fillmore through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 dwellings were damaged countywide, including more than 1,000 
houses and mobile homes that have been declared uninhabitable at least 
temporarily. About 225 businesses, including 200 in Simi Valley, have sustained 
moderate to extensive damage, officials have estimated. But so far only 12 Simi 
Valley businesses have been declared too dangerous to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As building inspectors surveyed the damage Thursday, there were hopeful signs. 
Several major east county buildings were found to be far less damaged than 
first thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The East County Courthouse and county library in Simi Valley are expected to 
reopen next week, the Moorpark College library and gymnasium suffered no 
structural damage, and all 27 Simi Valley schools may be back in session by the 
middle of next week, officials said. The Thousand Oaks library is also 
structurally sound despite a fallen roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "With everything in disarray, everything looks worse than it may be," said 
Wendy Haddock, assistant director of county emergency services in the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley officials continued to struggle to patch two major water lines 
that broke during Wednesday's strong aftershocks and to restore service to 
5,000 east end homes that still cannot count on running water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Public school administrators estimated earthquake damage at $5 million in 
Simi Valley, $400,000 in Thousand Oaks and $175,000 in Fillmore's small 
district. Fillmore schools reopened but fewer than half the students returned 
to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials reported that city suffered more damage than was 
immediately apparent, especially in the exclusive 188-house Chanteclair tract. 
Damage to city property was estimated at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 575 people were still in emergency shelters in Fillmore and Simi 
Valley Wednesday night, up from 485 the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county assessor and tax collector said property owners with damage 
greater than $5,000 could apply for reassessments and delay their April tax 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ridership on the Metrolink train service to Los Angeles fell below pre-quake 
levels, and officials speculated that commuters were taking the week off to 
clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caltech seismologists said Wednesday's two 5-magnitude aftershocks did not 
take place on the same fault as the Northridge quake, but are part of a 
separate, continuing migration of aftershocks toward Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forecasters said the county should brace for weekend rain that promises to 
make a bad situation worse by leaving ruptured properties exposed to water 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of disaster aid Ventura County quake victims may eventually receive 
is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman said the county will get a 
substantial part of the $1-billion federal emergency fund being made available 
for the region's earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're certainly safe in saying that tens of millions will be going to 
Ventura County," said FEMA's Brett Hansard. "At this point, millions don't even 
mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal housing officials, who joined state and federal emergency workers at 
the disaster centers, said $4 million is already available to Ventura County 
residents for emergency housing and the rehabilitation of damaged dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the temporary housing, they have to verify that people are truly victims 
of the disaster," said Corsaut of state emergency services. "But they'll try to 
do that within days." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aid eligibility is determined case by case, officials said. Programs cover 
earthquake losses to homes, personal property and businesses not covered by 
insurance or other aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid crowding in the first days, Hansard suggested use of the agency's 
tele-registration number, 800-462-9029. "At some point they're strongly 
encouraged to go in to the application center in person," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not first come, first served," he said. "Anybody who qualifies for FEMA 
assistance is going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to opening the two aid centers, Thursday brought other signs of 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I have a trickle of water today and I can't tell you how good it 
feels," said county Supervisor Vicky Howard, a resident of Simi Valley's 
hard-hit east end. That water was available because repair crews worked all 
night to patch leaks in main lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials said about 5,000 customers remained without water 
Thursday evening because of new breaks and leaks discovered as water pressure 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents without water included some who were cut off most of the time since 
the quake and others who had not lost service until early Thursday. City 
Manager Lin Koester said workers hope to have water restored throughout the 
city by early today. 
</P>
<P>
 All Simi Valley residents were advised to boil their water because of the 
possibility of impurities entering the system. Hundreds lined up for drinking 
water at distribution points in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to expectations, Metrolink ridership was down on the first day that 
the commuter rail service resumed between Moorpark and Simi Valley and downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials speculated that many residents are staying home to clean up or may 
not realize that service has resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 After saying earlier that they may extend Metrolink as far west as Oxnard, 
county Transportation Commission officials said they will ask FEMA for money to 
extend train service to Ventura for up to a year while Los Angeles County 
freeways are repaired. A decision on the extension is expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the county was looking to the skies and hoping that a weekend storm 
brings only light rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters predicted at least half an inch of rain from Saturday evening 
until Sunday afternoon along coastal areas, and twice as much in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 But Haddock of county emergency services said the cities of Simi Valley and 
Fillmore are preparing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cities are distributing information on how to use sandbags to divert 
runoff and landslides and the availability of plastic sheeting to cover houses 
and businesses, she said.

 A newspaper reporter who witnessed the government's raid on the Branch 
Davidian compound testified in San Antonio that the first shots were fired by 
the cultists.Marc Masferrer, testifying at the murder trial of 11 cult members, 
said his editor at the Waco Tribune-Herald sent him to the compound Feb. 28, 
and that he saw the agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 
arrive. The issue of who shot first is critical to defendants' claim of 
self-defense. The defendants claim they retaliated only after being fired upon 
by agents.

 Nearly 50,000 children and teen-agers were killed by guns from 1979 through 
1991, a total roughly equal to the number of battle casualties in the Vietnam 
War, the Children's Defense Fund said.The children's advocacy group used the 
release of its annual yearbook on the state of America's children to urge 
stronger regulation of the sale, manufacture and possession of non-sporting 
firearms. The report said juveniles now account for both a high and rapidly 
growing share of homicide offenders as well as victims. The number of arrests 
for murder and non-negligent manslaughter for adults rose 11% from 1982 to 
1991, while the number of juveniles arrested for those crimes rose 93%, the 
group said.

 A Scottish businessman shot and killed by a Houston homeowner who apparently 
mistook him for a burglar was not legally drunk at the time of the early 
morning incident, the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office said.Andrew Peter 
De Vries, 28, of Aberdeen, Scotland, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.08% when he 
was killed earlier this month by Jeffrey Agee, who fired three times through a 
back door in his house as De Vries was knocking on the door, a medical 
examiner's office spokeswoman said. A blood-alcohol level of 0.10% is 
considered legally drunk in Texas. The case will be referred to a state grand 
jury without charges against Agee, police said.

 A little theater, from the vast theater of the earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 In an airport hangar, at the panoramic table that seated President Clinton and 
an array of dressed-down officialdom, Gov. Pete Wilson was squeezed between 
Mayor Richard Riordan and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the woman he defeated to get 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan played host with an affable intensity, several times scolding the 
audience, "Can we keep the noise down, please!" He contributed only one line to 
the trove of Riordanisms: that the federal government's action was "an 
unprecedented response that has never happened before." 
</P>
<P>
 That "unprecedented response" twice upstaged the governor this week. On 
Monday, Wilson was at center court at an L.A. news conference when Feinstein 
walked in unexpectedly early and attracted virtually every camera lens. 
</P>
<P>
 And the next day, at the mangled intersection of the 5 and 14 freeways, Wilson 
had just ended an hourlong live television hookup when a sleek federal 
government helicopter kicked up clouds of dust, landed smack on the freeway and 
out stepped Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer finally caught the wave and attended the Wednesday 
conference; she had called a crime summit in Sacramento the day before, when 
just about the only killer on anyone's mind was the killer quake. 
</P>
<P>
 And how soon they forget: The sign in front of the director of the Office of 
Management and Budget -- longtime former California congressman Leon Panetta -- 
identified him as "Director Penetta." Other U.S. Quakes 
</P>
<P>
 California ranked second in the nation, after Alaska, in the greatest number 
of earthquakes from 1980 through 1991. Here are the top five states, ranked by 
the number of quakes measuring 2.5 magnitude and above, as well as the largest 
magnitude quake to hit each of those states in that period. 03,12,13,11 NUMBER

 Time warp: It was big news in the Bear Valley Voice when the business cards 
for the new assistant to the city manager of Big Bear Lake were duly printed up 
and delivered. What made it front page news was that KIDS -- a local 
youth-oriented television facility that investigated the matter -- had found 
that the cards were ordered nearly two weeks before applicants for the job 
opening were interviewed. And the new assistant was . . . the woman who was 
already the city manager's executive secretary. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Under funding: San Francisco's round-the-clock women's shelter, the St. 
Paulus, has sold short -- shorts, in fact, hawking celebrity boxer shorts at a 
fund-raising auction. Grateful Deadster Jerry Garcia's briefly worn pair topped 
the offerings at $280, and ex-Police Chief Richard Hongisto's pair of 
unmentionables were auctioned off for $150 to Mayor Frank Jordan. Hongisto had 
already taken it in the shorts from Jordan before -- Jordan was the one who 
fired him. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 No ifs, ands and especially no butts: For months, Gov. Wilson's oratory has 
teetered toward the B-word -- but he's never quite come out and said it. When a 
Democratic TV spot accused Wilson of flip-flopping on illegal immigration, 
Wilson retorted, "They can kiss my rear end if they can leap that high from the 
low road where they are dwelling habitually." When the issue was crime, Wilson 
said Democratic Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi should "get off his duff 
and persuade some of his friends in the Legislature, if he has any, to -- 
however belatedly -- support the kind of changes he is now espousing for the 
first time in his career." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone should pass the "E-word" -- euphemism -- on to Dean Dunphy, Wilson's 
new transportation, business and housing secretary. This week, Dunphy pledged 
to whip the 5 and 14 freeways into shape, and (gasp) "bust our butts" to do it. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mint condition: Here's hoping travel agents didn't erase it from their 
computer disks too hastily. A week after it was closed, the Old Mint Museum in 
San Francisco was mysteriously reopened. The 120-year-old national landmark, a 
sturdy survivor of the 1906 earthquake and fire, had dodged another bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 The feds who locked its doors said it was losing money. Local officials have 
their doubts about that, but in one way, the feds were right: the mint did lose 
money. Its 10,000 ounces of gold on display were whisked away as a "significant 
security risk" just before the museum was closed. The mint is back -- but the 
gold isn't. EXIT LINE 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . When they came to my door and told me to shut my toilets, it came real 
close to home." -- Michael Timar of Santa Rosa, where townspeople were put on 
"snake alert" and advised to keep toilet-seat lids down after a six-foot-long 
pet python named Tiny escaped into the sewer system.

billboard in a farmer's field in 1925, eventually providing glimpses of mirth 
for an America between wars and immersed in a Depression, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Odell, who developed the roadside rhymes for Burma Shave cream, was 90 when he 
died Monday in Edina, Minn., not far from where the first signs were posted. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard Burma Shave couplet was written on four sequential billboards. A 
fifth sign always read, Burma Shave. At one time, there were 7,000 sets of 
signs in 45 states. One set (above) was presented to the Smithsonian 
Institution in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Odell first penned the standard Burma Shave couplets with his late brother 
Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 The outdoor signs were born shortly after the Odells' father, Clinton, worked 
with a chemist to develop a brushless shaving cream. It was called Burma Shave. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial sales proved slow until Odell saw a gas station sign that told 
travelers there were "Gas, Oil, Restrooms Ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 With $200 from his father and some old boards, he erected a dozen sets of 
signs, the first of them in a nearby field; the rest on two highways near 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within this vale Of toil and sin Your head grows bald But not your chin Burma 
Shave  
</P>
<P>
 His idea was, he said, "to make friends with people." It worked and orders for 
Burma Shave began arriving within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does your husband misbehave Grunt and grumble Rant and rave Shoot the brute 
some Burma Shave"  
</P>
<P>
 At first the Odell brothers wrote all the jingles, but as the signboards 
increased, they hired contributors from across the country. Not all of those 
submitted, however, could be used in those virtuous times: 
</P>
<P>
 "My man won't shave Said Hazel Huz But I should worry Dora's does."  
</P>
<P>
 But radio and then television commercials began to eat away at the 
effectiveness of the always good-humored slogans and they were discontinued in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Both brothers by then were top executives with the $1-million-a-year company 
and retired when it was sold to Philip Morris Inc. in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Odell died in 1991.

ESTHER RALSTON; SILENT ERA 'AMERICAN VENUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Esther Ralston, the beautiful blonde "American Venus" of silent films, has 
died at the age of 91. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ralston, who appeared in about 150 films, died last Friday in her Ventura 
home after a short illness, her brother, Carleton Ralston of Los Angeles, 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Miss Ralston's last public appearances was in September at the Silent 
Movie Theater in Hollywood for a showing of "Old Ironsides," a patriotic film 
set in the early 1800s that she made in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been designated to receive a lifetime achievement award from the 
Southern California Motion Picture Council on April 8, her brother said. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Bar Harbor, Me., Miss Ralston began performing at the age of 2 
with prominent billing in the family theatrical troupe, the Ralston Family 
Metropolitan Entertainers With Baby Esther, America's Youngest Juliet. 
</P>
<P>
 She made her screen debut in 1916 in "Phantom Fortunes" and took several small 
roles until she was picked to play Mrs. Darling in the 1925 version of "Peter 
Pan." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ralston soon became one of the highest-paid actresses in silent films. 
She was publicized as the "American Venus," the title of a film she made in 
1926. She also earned the appellation of "Paramount Clotheshorse," known for 
her extravagant lifestyle, which included riding about in a Rolls-Royce with a 
chauffeur uniformed in whatever color matched her dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Her credits included "Huckleberry Finn," "Oliver Twist," "Beggar on 
Horseback," "A Kiss for Cinderella" and "Children of Divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ralston played the Palace twice, headlining in the top vaudevillian venue 
as the "Golden Girl of the Silver Screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many silent actresses, Miss Ralston moved easily into "talkies" and 
continued her film career until the early 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she acted occasionally in radio soap operas. But after three failed 
marriages and the loss of her film fortune, she also supported herself working 
in a department store, a talent agency and an Upstate New York utility company. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Ralston married and divorced George Webb, a publicist and agent; Will 
Morgan, who was with Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians, and newspaper columnist Ted 
Loyd. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her brother, she is survived by three children, Mary, Judy and 
Ted, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

ENGLISH PROFESSOR JAMES HINES DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Hines, an English professor at Saddleback College for 23 years and a 
major force in designing the school's literature program, has died at age 73 
while vacationing in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Hines, who retired in December, was known by colleagues and students for his 
inspirational teaching style and passion for learning.In 1992 he was honored by 
former student Sue Gross and her husband, Newport Beach investor William Gross, 
who started the James Hines Teachers of the Year Foundation to provide $100,000 
for cash prizes in the annual Orange County Teacher of the Year competition. 
</P>
<P>
 A Shakespeare scholar, Hines traveled to England in 1992 to establish the 
college's Semester at Oxford program, which began last fall. He also taught a 
popular Bible-as-literature class, for which he traveled to the Mideast, Rome 
and Greece to consult with scriptural scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Clemente resident since 1970, Hines previously chaired the English 
department at Fullerton High School for 17 years and received the school's 
Teacher of the Year award in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 His teaching methods also were featured in a 1965 textbook titled "Voices in 
the Classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Hines, who died Monday, is survived by his wife, Joann, sister Muriel Colby, 
brothers John Hines and Tom Hines, and stepsons David Morken and James Morken. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for 3 p.m. Thursday at Saddleback College's 
Doyle McKinney Theatre.

NECESSARY EVIL: A TEMPORARY GAS TAX; ALAS, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FREE 
FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California transportation officials now estimate the damage to highways in the 
Northridge earthquake at $750 million. Given the tight budgets the state faced 
even before the ground started shaking, this sum seems nearly as awesome as the 
power that Monday's temblors released in knocking down parts of the Golden 
State, Santa Monica and other freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is a sum that must be paid, given the importance of those freeways 
and other damaged roads to the economy of a region that literally was built 
around the automobile. California won't be alone in footing the bill, of 
course. Some of our freeways are interstate highways, so federal aid can be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ANTE UP: But in the absence of a federal Marshall Plan dedicated to 
California's infrastructure -- wise but politically unlikely in deficit- 
conscious Washington these days -- somewhere down the line California taxpayers 
are going to have to ante up, at least for rebuilding highways that are not 
interstates, such as the Antelope Valley and San Fernando-Simi Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials already have options on the table. Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown wants a temporary state sales tax increase like that imposed after the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Some Republicans in the Legislature would put a 
bond issue on the June ballot -- but that could delay reconstruction for six 
months. We prefer a proposal by Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) for a 
temporary gasoline tax increase earmarked for highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas taxes are, in effect, user fees, and they historically have been 
designated for construction and maintenance of streets and highways. 
</P>
<P>
 California drivers consume 13 billion to 14 billion gallons of gasoline a 
year. A five-cent-a-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax thus would raise 
about $670 million a year. The Federal Highway Administration calculates that 
each registered vehicle in California on average consumes 638 gallons of 
gasoline yearly. So a nickel-a-gallon tax increase would, on average, cost a 
motorist $32 more a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional argument against the gasoline tax, like that against the sales 
tax, is that it is regressive, falling most heavily on lower-income groups. But 
there is a significant offset to this concern. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PRICES DOWN: Gasoline prices have fallen sharply in recent years, to below 
$1.10 a gallon now for regular from as high as $1.40 a gallon. All projections 
indicate there won't be any big shifts in either the international availability 
or cost of oil in the coming months. Even with the proposed tax increase, 
retail gas prices would be below what they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 We are confident that Angelenos will favor a temporary nickel-a-gallon gas tax 
increase if they know it will help get freeways moving again. To win over 
drivers elsewhere, some of the money should go to retrofit the thousands of 
bridges and freeways throughout California that are still not earthquake-safe. 
Nobody likes taxes, of course -- but Californians will tolerate a tax when they 
know it pays for a vital need.

MAKE IT A REAL GEM; NIXON LIBRARY WILL OPEN A FOREIGN POLICY THINK TANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace opened in 1990, the former 
President urged the faithful gathered in Yorba Linda not to lose sight of 
America's prominence in the world. Thursday, in a ceremony on the 25th 
anniversary of the first Nixon inaugural, that admonition took a more concrete 
shape with the announcement that a public policy think tank will be located at 
the library and in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Peace and Freedom, boosted by a hefty Annenberg Foundation 
challenge grant to fuel fund-raising, is to open in 1997.It will have eight 
endowed chairs -- six in foreign policy and two focusing on domestic issues.  
</P>
<P>
 The foreign policy side will consider timely questions of the post-Cold War 
era: the fate of the former Soviet Union, relations with China, relations with 
Japan, change in Europe, the Mideast, the Muslim world. Domestic chairs will 
study "Representative Governance" and "Morality, Freedom and National Renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there will be critics of Nixon who will catalogue the new institute 
among the efforts of recent years to rehabilitate the reputation of a fallen 
President. But whatever shadows remain from the Watergate era, the Nixon 
presidency is taking on a far more complex character as historians assess new 
international realities. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a world in flux has plenty of room for pragmatism, which is supposed 
to be the operative style of the new center. It will be a welcome addition to 
the region if institute officials make it a resource for public understanding. 
Old grudges have subsided, and the institute's stature can only rise if the 
widest possible access is offered to the scholarly and journalistic 
communities.

THE GRIM NEW HOUSE OF RUSSIA; IT LOOKS AS IF ANTI-REFORMERS ARE IN CONTROL OF 
YELTSIN'S CABINET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin has formed a new Cabinet that swings his government 
unmistakably to the right, raising worrisome questions about the very survival 
of Russia's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 This ominous shift was prompted in good part by the strong showing in last 
month's parliamentary elections by ultranationalists and communists, who 
appealed to a public left anxious and frustrated by policies to redirect Russia 
toward a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet changes, besides putting a brake on reform, could complicate 
Russia's external economic relations, most notably with the International 
Monetary Fund, which has been holding up $1.5 billion in loans until it is 
satisfied that Russia is making economic progress. In addition, with this new 
indication of possible economic regression Russia's ability to attract Western 
lenders and investors may have been deeply compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov is now out of the government. His ideological 
foes, State Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Deputy Prime Minister 
Alexander Zaveryukha, remain. Fyodorov, respected by the IMF and Western 
leaders, favored tight credit policies to combat inflation. His opponents have 
been responsible for granting huge loans to a large number of inefficient and 
money-losing state farms and factories, loans that fueled last year's 
hyperinflation. Fears about a new inflationary surge led to this week's frantic 
public scramble to exchange rubles for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov's departure follows by a few days that of First Deputy Prime Minister 
Yegor Gaidar, the chief draftsman of Yeltsin's economic reforms. Gaidar's 
departure, in turn, came just a few days after Yeltsin assured President 
Clinton at their meeting in Moscow that Russia would continue resolutely along 
the path of reform. With reform's key proponents now banished from government, 
the credibility of that promise begins to look thin indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's of course possible that Yeltsin sees the Cabinet shuffle as only a 
tactical retreat on the road to reform. But the anti-reformers plainly have 
other ideas, and for now it's those ideas that threaten to become ascendant.

NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After the past two years, with urban unrest, massive layoffs, crime, floods, 
fires and now the earthquake, we in Southern California continue to withstand 
an onslaught of troubles, tragedy and sorrows witnessed by few other, if any, 
cities of the country. Yet, there has been an incredible degree of courage, 
resilience and determination among us here to withstand these traumatic and 
testing times. Some have referred to us as mellow or as flakes or castoffs, but 
like the soft clay hardened in the kiln, we, under the California sun, have 
hardened ourselves to not only withstand but continue to thrive under the most 
adverse conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The next weeks will be trying times, indeed, and will probably push us near 
the limits, but the price for the glorious sun, the beaches, the mountains, the 
excitement and diversity will be sweeter as we withstand so much for the 
experience of those enduring qualities which make this place.

the good job that the city's emergency crews are doing during the current 
crisis. If Mayor Riordan has his way we would probably still be negotiating 
with the contractors to provide response to the current crisis. Events such as 
the current earthquake underscore the need for a work force made up of city 
employees, not contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now would be a good time for the mayor to revaluate his position and realize 
that in the event of natural disaster or major disturbance a work force 
controlled by city leaders is of the utmost importance! Not by a contractor.

 * In the aftermath of a disaster such as the earthquake, why do the media 
daily emphasize the negative about utilities -- 60,000 people still without 
electricity, 100,000 without safe water, 30,000 without gas? 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere do we see reports such as "DWP and Edison re-established electricity 
to 120,000 homes in the past 24 hours," or similar stories about water and gas. 
Legions of dedicated people go into action to make that happen, often working 
to exhaustion and at great risk. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't see or read about the extraordinary human interest stories in all 
that. Why don't we hear of these quiet doers, their heroism and their

earthquake jolted Los Angeles on Jan. 17, as it did during the civil unrest of 
April, 1992. It seems to me that the spirit of warmth, kindness and brotherhood 
ends when the tragedy passes. It's back to business as usual, and we'll go back 
to fighting, killing and hating each other. Why is it so difficult for us to 
maintain this spirit? 
</P>
<P>
 It's also pretty ironic that the earthquake came on Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr.'s birthday. A day where people are supposed to honor a man who believed in 
peace, love and equality for all. I have a feeling the quake was his way of 
telling us that we better get our act together. For in the final analysis, we 
are all human beings. We all share the same blood and have desires and 
aspirations. We all hope that our children will live a better life than we did. 
So why should one group feel superior to another? And if we could all "just get 
along," I think this world would be a better place to live.

suggestion and seriously consider it. 
</P>
<P>
 Please let us rebuild these bridges as steel bridges and not as reinforced 
concrete. With the frequency of earthquakes here in California, why continue to 
rebuild bridges over and over again? The safety and longevity of steel bridges 
will make it cheaper in the long-term future of California.

 Sam Hall Kaplan admits that BART rescued the Bay Area during the quake, but he 
doesn't seem to care for our "pricey Metro Rail." He criticizes the structural 
engineers who worked on the Red Line, but forgets to mention that our rail 
lines fared much better than our freeways. It was the engineers who worked on 
our freeways who failed to calculate loads and stresses. History shows that in 
disaster, war and peace, subways are safer than freeways.

 * Kaplan's article and your editorial of Jan. 18 stopped short of specific 
solutions that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority must consider in its 
service to the public. Rail service would answer many problems faced by 
commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed now is an immediate rail passenger operation over what was 
called "the Santa Monica airline" of the old Pacific Electric. This line 
travels westerly out Exposition Boulevard and cuts over Sepulveda at Venice 
Boulevard. Some right of way is still available beyond this point and would 
service commuters in the Santa Monica area. 
</P>
<P>
 Another consideration is to examine the Santa Fe Line to Redondo Beach, a 
route that passes by LAX and could alleviate problems motor commuters will 
endure until the freeways are rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 I am also in favor of Metrolink service between Montclair and Pasadena. 
Ridership would remove much traffic on the 210 Freeway.

 * Tears came to my eyes as I watched the huge, red mechanical bird pecking 
away at the freeway. Huge chunks of concrete were poked out as easily as a hole 
puncher going through a stack of paper. And the long metal neck chewed away at 
the busiest freeway in the world, the lifeline of Los Angeles, a landmark for 
those of us who've lived here all of our lives.  
</P>
<P>
 The tears were not for the stretch of freeway brought to its knees, but for 
those of us who think about earthquakes, for just a split second, as we sit in 
a crowded movie theater built over concrete parking structures, and in 
live-performance theaters, when we sit in the center of the room and look at 
the 10 people sitting to our left and the 10 to our right, impeding our easy 
access to an aisle that could lead us to safety. The tears were for we who try 
to pull as forward as possible in our car when we're at a red light and are 
sitting under a freeway overpass, we who calm ourselves down by calling 
ourselves silly and needlessly worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends actually lost all their breakable belongings. Family went without 
water and power. My sister was slightly injured this time. And we will have 
those reminders and the freeway construction to get through before we start to 
forget again. Maybe that's what my tears were for. There's a sadness after an 
earthquake, a strong desire in some of us to leave the city. Maybe it even 
chips away at our pride in our city, and that's what the tears are for.

 * As the story of our latest earthquake unfolded I couldn't help but wonder 
how long it would take Assembly Speaker Willie Brown to suggest a new increase 
in the sales tax. What a surprise -- with all that media covering the 
earthquake, he gets on the news with the proposal in less than 12 hours! 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm a little puzzled. Do we just keep adding a half percent here, a full 
percent there every time we have an earthquake? Should we get a committee to 
study how much tax increase we need to cover the various magnitude quakes? 
Since it's clear the taxes will never be rescinded, do we just keep forking 
over income until ultimately Brown gets it all?

 * After the initial shaking had stopped and I had managed to get my clothes 
on, I went outside into the darkness to see what was going on. There were a lot 
of car alarms going off but what I was most struck by was the absolute 
blackness of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked up, and I was stunned: For the first time in more than 20 years I 
have lived in Los Angeles, I beheld a sky filled to bursting with stars -- like 
the skies I grew up with in Lake Tahoe. There was absolutely no light 
pollution! 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder people here in L.A. are so myopic in their behavior patterns: We 
don't really live within the context of a night sky full of stars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was awe-inspiring.

 * A day of terror, a night of fear. No power, no water, no food. Sirens blare, 
explosions blast. Somewhere a child calls for help while you wait for your home 
to collapse. An earthquake in Los Angeles, to be sure, but every day in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it time we helped those people?

COLUMN LEFT/ PETER DREIER, RICHARD ROTHSTEIN: MAN-MADE DISASTERS' DOUBLE PUNCH; 
WHY IS IT SOUND PUBLIC POLICY TO ASSIST QUAKE VICTIMS BUT NOT THOSE HURT BY 
DEFENSE CUTBACKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER DREIER and RICHARD ROTHSTEIN, Peter Dreier is professor of public 
policy at Occidental College. Richard Rothstein is a research associate of the 
Economic Policy Institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last April, Congress killed President Clinton's "stimulus" program to create a 
million public-works jobs restoring highways, bridges, sewer systems, schools 
and parks. Opponents shouted "pork barrel" politics, "tax-and-spend liberalism" 
and "budget buster." Unable to overcome a filibuster, Clinton withdrew his 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the Northridge earthquake, Clinton pledged $1 billion to 
rebuild and provide emergency assistance, along with low-interest loan 
guarantees for homeowners and small businesses. He promised to ask Congress for 
more as damage estimates increased. Los Angeles will receive more federal tax 
dollars for investment in infrastructure than we would have obtained from our 
share of the stimulus package. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hurricane Andrew, Midwest floods or California earthquakes, officials 
recognize government's responsibility. Congress will exempt these 
appropriations from requirements for offsetting budget cuts without a peep of 
protest from Sen. Bob Dole or fellow filibusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does it take natural disaster to justify public works? We aid the homeless 
or jobless in natural disasters but hear endless objections to expenditures 
when many more suffer man-made disasters of cyclical downturns or changing 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Why isn't 6.5% unemployment -- 9 million jobless, 8 million more too 
discouraged for active job-hunting or forced to work part time -- considered a 
sufficient emergency to warrant federal action? Why is it sound policy to 
assist earthquake victims but not families devastated by defense cutbacks? 
Aren't 150,000 California aerospace layoffs ample reason to invest in civilian 
projects to employ idle engineers, technicians and production workers? Why do 
we expect Washington to help people made homeless by a flood but not those made 
homeless when employers relocate to Third World countries? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite lagging productivity, America now spends less than half of what we 
spent 30 years ago on public infrastructure. By 2005, road deterioration will 
cost 3.9 billion hours of vehicle delay annually, even without earthquakes. Why 
can we rebuild bridges collapsed in earthquakes, but not invest in 
transportation so people can get to work in normal times? Santa Monica Freeway 
reinforcement had been delayed from lack of funds. If Congress had enacted 
Clinton's stimulus package, Caltrans might have completed the project before 
Monday's calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1.5 million unemployed Californians, it's a bitter irony that only natural 
disaster provokes government-sponsored stimulus. Jobs created by earthquake 
relief will be in private firms. Reemployed construction workers will purchase 
food, clothing, haircuts and furniture, putting others back to work. Ripple 
effects of $1 billion in federal spending could create at least 65,000 new jobs 
and generate new tax revenues to offset costs of emergency aid -- as a stimulus 
program could have done months ago.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE; SHAKING UP THE WORKPLACE; INNOVATION, 
COMPASSION, EMPLOYEE EMPOWERMENT WILL HELP BUSINESSES SURVIVE AN EMOTIONALLY 
FRAUGHT DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY J. GIBBONS, Barry J. Gibbons left Burger King last year; he now has a 
private business consulting firm in Miami. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a bit of fraternal advice to share with all the business owners and 
managers, big or small, who were devastated by the earthquake. I was chief 
executive for Burger King Corp. when Hurricane Andrew followed a 17-foot flood 
tide and ripped apart our world headquarters in south Florida in August, 1992. 
It then proceeded to devastate several zip codes, leaving half of our employees 
homeless and everybody facing a period of personal, community and business 
trauma that still isn't behind us 18 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 We had to virtually start over, and so will many of you. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we had prepared crisis plans, the extent of the disaster meant that 
we had to invent most of our solutions as we went along.  
</P>
<P>
 I haven't written this stuff down before because the scar tissue is still pink 
and sensitive for a lot of us, but it occurred to me that it may help you avoid 
having to reinvent everything we had to. I'll keep it short; here are just 10 
things to think about: 
</P>
<P>
 You're facing a million decisions -- including some real chunky ones. If you 
can make those big ones fast -- today -- it's a real help. A lot of your people 
will have had some of their fundamental support structures shattered, and if 
you can say that you are going to stay and rebuild, and that they will have 
jobs, say it fast. And say it loud. At about the same decibel level as in a 
Guns 'N Roses concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Make professional counseling available for your affected employees. Fast. Tell 
the macho guys who say they don't need it that it's not for them, it's for 
their families. We had an astonishing take-up and an astonishing level of 
people who did not then need sustained counseling, compared with other 
disasters of this magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 You will have to give concessions and help your people, and some people will 
seem to take too much, just as others take too little. It's like a breakfast 
buffet in a restaurant -- some people heap their plates, some take virtually 
nothing. The important thing is that what you offer works in total. That's all 
that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Understand from the start that the recovery is a marathon, not a sprint. For 
the first month or so, when the actual problems seem to be at their worst, a 
kind of bizarre adrenalin mix keeps everybody going (rather like the first, 
fast, lap of a marathon), but then the long, slow, grind sets in. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that idea that innovators have been yelling about for some years now? 
That thing called empowerment? That idea that makes you tense? Relax. Right now 
you've got no choice. Let people manage their own issues -- how to manage more 
flexible working hours, the dress policy for the office, working from home, 
etc. You will be amazed by how good they are at finding solutions. You will 
also find that not everybody you thought would be good actually is -- and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
 It's OK to hug an employee. Just this once. Trust me. 
</P>
<P>
 Events like this create a huge information vacuum that needs filling and 
managing. Which doesn't just mean you constantly giving out information. God 
gave you two eyes, two ears and only one mouth -- that's four organs to receive 
information, one to give it out. We found that a pretty good ratio to help us 
manage our vacuum effectively, so much so that we tried to keep it as a way of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't lose your humor, however depressing and frustrating the days get. We 
threw some cheap and cheerful things in the calendar regularly -- like a visit 
from a masseur who took over our meeting room for a day and massaged some 
tensions away. As a byproduct, a lot of laughter was created. 
</P>
<P>
 You employ adults. But many of them have children, and children emerge as the 
biggest cause of domestic tension and stress in the whole mix. Just recognizing 
that helps in itself, but if you can throw in the odd day trip for the affected 
kids it does wonders for the climate. Have you ever lived with a family in a 
trailer while your home was being rebuilt? Precisely. 
</P>
<P>
 Last -- the most ironic of all. Don't lose the benefits of the experience. You 
will go about business very differently for a while. The status quo is smashed. 
People begin to do things differently and to challenge you with the obvious 
("You know, I really could do this from home"). We adopted a motto: Let's get 
back to normal, but not back to being the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you have to do all of the above to make it through? Absolutely not. Do you 
have to do any of it? Just as absolutely not. I'm not even sure of the 
relevance of a post-hurricane experience to that of an earthquake (and it's now 
one of my life's ambitions not to find out), but in dark days when we found it 
hard to believe that we'd make it back, these helped us believe again.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JAMES P. PINKERTON: SOCIETY'S RIDE FROM BABBITTRY TO BOBBITTRY; 
TO DETER MISCREANTS, SHUN THEM. WE NEED TO RESTORE A COLLECTIVE SENSE OF SHAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES P. PINKERTON, James P. Pinkerton, based in Washington, is a senior 
fellow at the Manhattan Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1922, Sinclair Lewis wrote the novel "Babbitt," in which he satirized the 
life and times of one George F. Babbitt. Lewis so brilliantly captured the smug 
narrow-mindedness of pre-Depression America that "Babbittry" entered the 
lexicon as a noun to describe bourgeois conformity. This eponym is still used, 
but not often, because narrow conformity is not a big problem any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more common today is "Bobbittry," the phenomenon in which people such as 
John and Lorena Bobbitt are accused of crimes but plead their case to the media 
before they even see a jury. In shamelessly seeking sympathy for their sins, 
they often strike it rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bobbitt was acquitted of raping his wife, but subsequent revelations do 
not show him in a flattering light. No sense of abashedness, however, kept him 
from appearing on Howard Stern's New Year's Eve show to hawk T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Bobbitt's future is less clear, pending the outcome of her trial. But 
whether she is convicted of assaulting her husband or not, her star turn in the 
pages of Vanity Fair suggests that she realizes that her story also has 
salability. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans will undoubtedly second-guess both Bobbitt juries for years. But 
more important than the legal questions is a larger one: what we do about 
Bobbittry? That is, how do we satisfy our natural fascination with the lurid 
and the bizarre without letting that interest spill over into the 
encouragement, even the subsidization, of destructive behavior? 
</P>
<P>
 It's doubtful that the celebrity treatment afforded the Long Island Lolita, 
Amy Fisher, and her Lothario, Joey Buttafuoco, did anything to inspire either 
of the Bobbitts. But after getting way more than her 15 minutes of fame, the 
mild sentence meted out to Fisher for shooting another woman in the head is not 
exactly the maximum deterrent imaginable. And Buttafuoco, who surely was an 
accessory to something, has done well since his wife was shot; he too has been 
lionized by Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in a country where Oliver North is running for the U.S. Senate, where 
G. Gordon Liddy has a highly rated radio talk show, where the Mayflower Madam 
has been transformed into a maven of manners, and where even the satanic 
Charles Manson gets royalties from his own line of apparel. One can only 
speculate about the career prospects for Heidi Fleiss and the Menendez 
brothers, and wonder what would happen if fugitive Nazi Martin Bormann were to 
emerge from the hinterlands of Argentina. Would his first stop be Nuremberg or 
"Nightline"? 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody wants to be a killjoy and prohibit adulation for criminals and 
crackpots. And it wouldn't work anyway, just as the highway patrol never 
dissuades anyone from slowing down to rubberneck as we pass a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 What can we as a society do? Let's bring back shunning. People have long known 
that not every problem has a legislative or judicial solution, so they 
developed the idea of excluding miscreants from their company. Way back when, 
this was effective: Socrates chose death over separation from his beloved 
Athens. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostracism -- expulsion from the group -- can be cruel, but it works. If 
conscience doesn't stop the individual from doing the wrong thing, there's 
still the hope that peer pressure will. Half a century ago, the great 
sociologist Ruth Benedict made the distinction between "guilt cultures" and 
"shame cultures." Benedict argued that Americans are driven by a personal sense 
of right and wrong, of repentance and salvation. The Japanese, she said, are 
more concerned with "face," honor and obligation to the collective. Both 
systems can restrain bad impulses, although lately it seems that the Japanese 
are doing better. Too many Americans feel neither guilt nor shame, leaving the 
law as our last, cumbersome, line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't need to force adulterers to wear a scarlet letter, but it wouldn't 
hurt to send a stronger signal that unacceptable behavior is . . . 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bobbitts will test our resolve. But if we want to deter harmful conduct, 
we'll have to shun the paperback and the made-for-TV movie. And when John 
Bobbitt starts selling armor-plated jock straps, we'll have to just say no. 
When Lorena Bobbitt pitches her new line of cutlery on the Home Shopping 
Network, we must change the channel. It's a small price to pay for restoring a 
much needed sense of shame.

LAKERS TAKE A BREAK FROM DIFFICULT TIMES; PRO BASKETBALL: FOURTH-QUARTER RALLY 
BEATS PHOENIX, 107-102, AND ENDS FOUR-GAME LOSING STREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Beaten up and most days just plain beaten, the Lakers bagged big game Thursday 
night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Phoenix Suns are struggling, with a 3-4 record since Charles Barkley 
was injured? 
</P>
<P>
 Try telling the Lakers this wasn't a huge victory, 107-102, before 14,741 at 
the Forum as James Worthy scored 22 points and Sedale Threatt scored 13 of his 
19 points in the fourth quarter to end a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feisty basketball," Laker Coach Randy Pfund said. "I'd like to see us play 
like that every night." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers trailed, 73-70, entering the fourth quarter, then scored on their 
first three possessions to tie the score and took the lead on Tony Smith's 
driving layup with 9:34 remaining. That made it 81-79, an advantage that would 
grow to as many as 12 points, 95-83, with 5:20 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns responded with a 7-0 rally. It became a four-point game, 101-97, when 
Frank Johnson hit a three-pointer for Phoenix with 48 seconds to play. The 
margin became three points when, after Vlade Divac made two free throws, Oliver 
Miller connected for the Suns from behind the three-point arc with 34 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers called a timeout, then another when Worthy couldn't find an open 
man for the entry pass at halfcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Nick Van Exel ended up with the ball, trapped in the corner by A.C. 
Green and Cedric Ceballos until stepping on the baseline. But Green was called 
for tugging on Van Exel's jersey, sending the rookie point guard to the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could shoot the first, Phoenix Coach Paul Westphal was ejected for 
arguing the call. Threatt made the technical free throw with 21.2 seconds left, 
but Van Exel missed both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns went for a three-pointer and the tie, but Joe Kleine missed. George 
Lynch got the rebound for the Lakers, then traveled. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. Lynch made up for that moments later when he knocked the ball away 
from Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns quickly fouled Threatt. He made both free throws for an 
insurmountable 107-100 lead with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Well separated in the standings, the teams were close in the injury 
department, the Suns without Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson and the Lakers 
without Anthony Peeler and Doug Christie. The difference, besides that two are 
stars and two are second-year players, was that Phoenix still had several other 
dependable weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers? Their highest-scoring player able to accelerate to a jog is Van 
Exel, who began the night averaging 12.7 points. Their backcourt was down to a 
three people in the truest sense -- Van Exel, Tony Smith and Threatt. Their 
hopes for stepping up the pace to reach, say, 28 or 30 victories, appear slim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like excuses," General Manager Jerry West said. "Every player has to 
look himself in the mirror and examine his own performance every day. . . . One 
thing, when people put the name 'professional' in front of you, it means being 
able to handle adversity. That might be tough for some of the young guys, but 
they can't find excuses in injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pfund: "We keep talking that the way out of this is to work hard and play 
hard, that we are going to get our crack and get a win and then get another 
win. The guys know we are in a tough spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Are Elden Campbell's days as a Laker numbered? While he continues to frustrate 
with stretches of lethargic play, league sources said his name has started to 
come up in trade rumors with several teams, some of whom apparently called the 
Lakers. General Manager Jerry West refused to confirm or deny the trade talks.

UCLA AT HEAD OF THE CLASS WITH VICTORY OVER ARIZONA; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: EDNEY 
LEADS THE WAY AS BRUINS STAKE CLAIM TO NO. 1, 74-66. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before a sold-out crowd at Pauley Pavilion, second-ranked UCLA remained 
undefeated and won its showdown with No. 9 Arizona, 74-66. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Bruins can make it to No. 1 by the end of the weekend if they can 
sweep the state of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 For UCLA (12-0, 5-0), it was their first victory of the season over a ranked 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 It was billed as a game to be decided in the backcourt, and it was. Tyus 
Edney's driving layup with 3:40 to go gave UCLA a 64-55 lead, which was enough 
to stand up. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney had 26 points for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats made their first mini-run at the midway point of the second half, 
but the Bruins called upon an old friend -- the ever-popular running game -- to 
sprint out to force Arizona Coach Lute Olson to call time out with UCLA holding 
a 55-47 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Five consecutive points got the Wildcats within 49-47, but Cameron Dollar 
wriggled loose inside for a layup and Ed O'Bannon and Edney scored on a pair of 
breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats are now 14-8 against UCLA in the Olson regime, while the Bruins 
improved to 4-8 against Arizona under Jim Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the game, there was a big-game atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Shon Tarver walked past ESPN announcer Dick Vitale, eyes wide, then was 
escorted away by assistant coach Lorenzo Romar. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him before the game if he was ready and he said 'Look at my eyes,' " 
Vitale said. "I guess he wanted me to see his eyes again." 
</P>
<P>
 As UCLA players went through their stretching exercises on the court, Vitale 
grabbed a ball and took a few shots, soon to be joined by Marques Johnson, who 
pretended to defend Vitale. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitale, who gets worked up by the mere sight of a dribbled basketball, 
studiously handicapped the game for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an advanced class for the Bruins," Vitale said. "This is trigonometry, 
calculus. The easy courses are over." 
</P>
<P>
 He was correct, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening moments, there was a flash of what was to come. Ed O'Bannon got 
a quick shove when he stuck his head in an impromptu on-court huddle by the 
Wildcats before a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Order was restored quickly. The game did not go as orderly, at least for a 
while. Between turnovers, UCLA took its first lead at 13-11 on a short jumper 
by Charles O'Bannon, who made a three-pointer three minutes later for a 20-14 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Tarver might have been having trouble with his offense, but 
his defense against Khalid Reeves was smooth as Vitale's bald head. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves missed all six of his shots and had one point in the half, while at the 
other end of the court, Tarver started slowly and finished fast. Tarver banked

COMMENTARY; BASEBALL STILL IN NO HURRY TO CHOOSE A COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In time Rockies' attendance may tumble, the Blue Jays may stumble and baseball 
owners may get around to selecting their next commissioner. Regarding the 
matter of this last development, they needn't bother. The office has been 
vacant so long it exists only as a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 16 months without an authority figure, the proprietors of the 
game Tuesday night decided they had been in too much of a hurry to fill the 
chair most recently occupied by Fay Vincent and declined to conduct a vote at a 
special meeting in Ft. Lauderdale. They will continue their government by 
committee until further notice, most likely until they achieve a new 
collective-bargaining agreement with the players. If they insist on a salary 
cap as a condition of a new basic contract, the sport may be headless for the 
rest of the millenium. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, baseball has staged two World Series, one All-Star Game and one Hall 
of Fame induction ceremony in the absence of a commissioner. Actually, there 
was a commissioner present for both the midsummer classic at Baltimore and 
Reggie Jackson's enshrinement at Cooperstown but, in both cases, it was Bowie 
Kuhn, who was removed a decade ago. The once starchy attorney, now sporting 
open-necked golf shirts, had been away so long he was applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant than any symbolic appearance, no commissioner was consulted 
on baseball's decision to finance its own national television programing, to 
split each major league into three divisions (with an additional round of 
playoffs that may include a team with a losing record) and to adopt a 
revenue-sharing plan contingent on the aforementioned salary cap. Clearly, the 
intention of owners was to place the cart before the horse and order the latter 
to push. This represents a distinct departure from the system at work in other 
professional sports that don't claim to be on the verge of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the NBA can trace its robust health and image as America's 
highest-flying sport directly to the actions of Commissioner David Stern, who 
promoted the salary cap as a way out of financial problems and relentlessly 
marketed the game and its athletes not only in the United States but throughout 
the world. Relations between the NFL and its players were contentious until 
incoming Commissioner Paul Tagliabue made a new bargaining agreement his first 
priority. Not only did he succeed against formidable odds in assuring labor 
peace for the rest of the century but he got the Players Assn. to accept a 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented with such examples of effective leadership, NHL governors reached 
into Stern's administrative staff and anointed Gary Bettman their first 
commissioner. They gave him greater powers than that enjoyed by the previous 
administrator, the elusive John Ziegler. The immediate result has been 
successful franchises in Miami and Anaheim and greater television exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, baseball denies the necessity of such a position. Despite pressure 
from Congress and criticism from the media, the proprietors continue to rely 
upon a ruling executive council chaired by Bud Selig, a car salesman whose 
Milwaukee franchise is among the weakest in the major leagues. Many owners hope 
by delaying the selection process they may finally be able to persuade Selig to 
accept the job. He maintains he has no interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, why should anyone desire it if the individual is rendered 
powerless or his counsel is not sought on significant issues? By restructuring 
the sport, owners have emasculated the office to the point that whoever 
occupies the seat does not deserve to be called commissioner. According to the 
Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition, a commissioner 
is "an official chosen by an athletic association to exercise broad 
adminstrative or judicial authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how broad do you think those powers will be when the new parameters 
finally are established? Certainly, they won't be as broad as those exercised 
by Kuhn when he cracked down on George Steinbrenner, Ted Turner and Charlie 
Finley "in the best interests of baseball." Nor will they be as broad as those 
used by Bart Giamatti to banish Pete Rose. Or those by which Vincent intervened 
in the 1990 lockout and attempted unilaterally to realign the National League 
in the wake of expansion after the owners failed to reach a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter, of course, was the last straw for special interest groups, who 
drafted a letter of resignation for Vincent. Baseball's last commissioner left 
office on Labor Day, Sept. 7, 1992. Anyone succeeding him two years later or 
longer, in a far different climate, should be offered a new title. Chief of 
protocol, perhaps. Maybe ambassador or field marshal or grand umpire. 
Considering that his primary duty will consist of attending World Series games, 
he might be known as baseball's designated sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 My own favorite, borrowed from one of Monty Python's more inspired skits, is 
Minister of Intentional Walks. He might even be encouraged to wear a derby. We 
could all stand the laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, if beanball wars break out again, the league presidents will have 
to deal with them. If a disciple of Vince Coleman attempts to blow up a section 
of bleachers at the new ballpark in Cleveland or Texas, his employer will have 
to take exception. If a Steinbrenner pays a sleaze for information discrediting 
one of his players, then it will be up to the owner's peers to decide on 
suitable punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Rose, he is advised to stay tuned before addressing any request for 
reinstatement. The inmates think they're perfectly capable of running the 
asylum.

another Grand Slam collapse. 
</P>
<P>

Natalia Medvedeva on Thursday in the second round of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some difficult moments," the fourth-seeded Argentine said. "It felt 
like I couldn't finish the match. For a moment at 5-5, I was thinking I could 
lose this match. I had match point and I couldn't win, and finally I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Steffi Graf had little trouble advancing with a 6-2, 6-4 victory 
over German compatriot Barbara Rittner, but No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: SECOND SHOCK HIT CLOSER TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Stenner's life was sailing along. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a great job. As the lead football producer for CBS, he gets to travel 
to a big NFL game every week. Pat Summerall and John Madden are his buddies. So 
are a lot of current and former football players. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenner, a bachelor, lives in a picturesque area of Southern California. His 
New York colleagues, enduring freezing temperatures, were envious of the warm 
winter he was enjoying. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were looking particularly good in early December, when Stenner signed a 
four-year contract with his network. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Stenner learned on Dec. 17 that CBS had lost its portion of the NFL 
television package to Fox. His great job suddenly didn't look so great. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly a month later, on his 53rd birthday, he got an even bigger jolt. His 
home in the Mulholland-Beverly Glen area of Sherman Oaks was severely damaged 
in Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 His power and telephone were out all day Monday. A reporter got through on 
Tuesday. "You're my first call," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many others, though, Stenner was glad to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 A young couple on his street wasn't as lucky. Entertainment executive Mark 
Yupp, 31, and his fiance, Kerry, 32, were killed when their home went crashing 
down a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 Another home in the area was knocked off its stilts and down the side of a 
canyon, killing a 4-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, the first thing Stenner did was jump into his truck and speed 
to the aid of a neighbor. He knew Janet Gretzky's husband, Wayne, was not at 
home because the Kings had played the night before in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Gretzky home has a Beverly Hills address, it is only "a good 
nine-iron" up a hill from Stenner's home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their home was in worse shape than mine, and Janet was really shaken. I was 
glad I was there to help out." 
</P>
<P>
 When Stenner returned home, another neighbor and close friend, Fred Dryer, 
came over to help him clean up. They were still at it on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Stenner: On Wednesday he left for Dallas, where he will produce the 
coverage of Sunday's NFC championship game between the Cowboys and San 
Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenner still has a job with CBS. He will work the Winter Olympics, the NCAA 
basketball tournament and the Daytona 500, but he's not sure what the future 
holds. When CBS lost football, he became a free agent because of an escape 
clause in his new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the uncertainty that gets to you," he said. "I imagine I will be 
producing football for someone. But I could be working in a restaurant or 
driving a truck." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenner, who grew up in New York, started with CBS as a mail clerk in 1959 and 
began producing football in 1967. He worked with Summerall and Tom Brookshier 
from 1975-80. 
</P>
<P>
 For four games at the start of the 1981 season, Madden, who had joined CBS in 
1979, was paired with Vin Scully. Summerall worked with Hank Stram. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they flip-flopped, and after four more weeks it was determined that 
Summerall and Madden would be the A team, with Stenner the producer and Sandy 
Grossman the director. Those four have been together ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will probably be broken up after Sunday. Although it wouldn't be a 
bad move for Fox to hire this team intact, that's not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Madden's Memories: In a conference call with reporters, Madden at first said 
he hadn't even thought about Sunday's game being the last one for this crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game is the thing, not the people there to cover it," he said. "And this 
one is as good as it gets." 
</P>
<P>
 But then he started reminiscing about the good times, the laughs, the poker 
games, the camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked about when the 49ers played the Cowboys in Dallas last October and 
how Summerall, who had moved to the Dallas area from Florida in 1992, invited 
the crew to his house. 
</P>
<P>
 All 13 of them jumped in the back of Summerall's pickup truck and went to a 
Mexican restaurant for a night of frivolity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start talking about this stuff and you start getting that feeling," he 
said. "I haven't had it before right now. Until now, all I've been thinking 
about is football. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know I'm going to really miss working with these guys. This is not 
going to be that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I'll be doing football somewhere next season. The sad part is you 
won't be working with the same people you've worked with so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Summerall: "What I wish more than anything else is that John and I can 
continue to work together. I think what a lot of people don't realize is just 
how hard he works, how hard he prepares. He doesn't just show up and do his 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Madden on Summerall: "He is so professional. He's always under control. He 
always brings it back and puts a period on things. He can say in three, four or 
five words what it takes me to say in three, four or five paragraphs. Or three, 
four or five days." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor Department: Two weeks ago, it was reported that it was all but a done 
deal that Madden was headed for ABC's "Monday Night Football." Thursday, there 
were reports that Madden is headed for NBC, to replace Bob Trumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Trumpy: "If I were Dick Ebersol (president of NBC Sports), I would hire 
him, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Madden, meanwhile, says no decision has been made. But after Sunday, things 
might happen pretty fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to do it quickly and quietly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 NBC would be wise to persuade Mike Ditka to stay in broadcasting and forget 
about pursuing that Jacksonville coaching job. Exhibit A should be Dallas 
Maverick Coach Quinn Buckner. No doubt he was much happier as a broadcaster. 
Ditka showed last weekend that he has the makings of a broadcasting superstar. 
"I've learned I have a lot of learn," he said in analyzing his first season. . 
. . Ditka, asked last Saturday for a quick synopsis of Buffalo's victory over 
the the Raiders, said, "Boring." On Thursday, he said, "What I meant by that 
was, 'Ho hum, the Bills did what they were supposed to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Enberg and Bob Trumpy will announce NBC's coverage of Sunday's AFC 
championship game between the Bills and Kansas City Chiefs. Kickoff is at 9:30 
a.m., with "NFL Live" on at 9 a.m. Joe Gibbs will be back as the studio 
analyst, and O.J. Simpson and Will McDonough will serve as sideline reporters. 
. . . Matt Millen will be the studio analyst on CBS' "NFL Today" Sunday at 
12:30 p.m. Jim Gray will cover the 49ers, Lesley Visser the Cowboys. . . . John 
Madden cautions those hoping for a Joe Montana-Steve Young Super Bowl. 
"Remember, Dallas and Buffalo earned the right to play at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will televise the NHL All-Star game Saturday at noon. La Cadena Deportiva 
will offer a Spanish-language simulcast, and XTRA will broadcast the game. ESPN 
will televise the NHL legends game and the skills competition today at 4:30 
p.m. . . . La Cadena, the Spanish-language arm of Prime Ticket, this week 
announced it has reached an agreement with Continental Cablevision. Systems in 
Los Angeles, Downey, Compton, Carson and Pomona will be picking up the service 
at various times, and by April 1 it should be available to all of Continental's 
270 customers. With the Continental agreement, La Cadena now has distribution 
commitments from 14 systems representing 600,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA's studio in the Fallbrook Mall in Woodland Hills was severely damaged by 
the earthquake, but KFI came to the rescue. The station loaned XTRA space so 
that midday host Jim Rome and nighttime host Rick Schwartz could do their shows 
there. XTRA program director Howard Freedman said the station hopes to find a 
new facility by the middle of next week. He said it will be quite a while 
before they can move back to the Woodland Hills studio. . . . XTRA's 670 
frequency (formerly KWNK) was off the air for 36 hours before the transmitter 
could be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were on the East Coast Monday, and players, coaches and others on 
the trip who live in the San Fernando Valley couldn't get through on the phone. 
But they were able to reach XTRA in San Diego, and Lee Hamilton in turn called 
the families. Announcers Bob Miller, who lives in Woodland Hills, and Nick 
Nickson, who lives in Saugus, were among those whose homes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether CBS admits it or not, the network's acquisition of the 1998 Winter 
Olympics this week sent an important message: CBS is still in the sports 
business. . . . TNT will televise the Festival on Ice Sunday at 5 p.m. Despite 
what some ads say, Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding did not compete in the 
event taped Jan. 13 at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. . . . TNT offers 
the first in a series of three "Road to Lillehammer" previews Saturday at 1 
p.m. Ernie Johnson is the host. . . . Attention tennis fans: Although the 
Australian Open won't be on television this weekend, ESPN begins fairly 
extensive coverage Monday.

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; SABATINI STRUGGLES TO VICTORY 
</P>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 She blew a huge lead at the French Open and failed to wrap up a Wimbledon 
final. This time, Gabriela Sabatini promised herself, she was not going to have 
another Grand Slam collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabatini, who led 5-1 in the final set before losing four straight games, 
wasted five match points before struggling to a 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 victory over 
Natalia Medvedeva in the second round of the Australian Open Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some difficult moments," the fourth-seeded Argentine said. "It felt 
like I couldn't finish the match. For a moment at 5-all, I was thinking I could 
lose this match. I had match point and I couldn't win, and finally I did it. I 
felt like I broke that wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabatini has struggled in the past to finish off matches in Grand Slam events. 
She twice served for the match against Steffi Graf in the 1991 Wimbledon final, 
but failed both times and lost, 6-4, 3-6, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, seeded second, needed eight match points to down 
Taiwan's Shi-ting Wang, 6-2, 6-4 ,in another second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Jana Novotna, No. 8 Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere and No. 9 Mary Pierce also 
reached the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-seeded Stefan Edberg won, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-1, against Jan Siemerink, 
and No. 9 Todd Martin dropped only seven games in a straight-set win over Jonas 
Bjorkman. 
</P>
<P>
 Also advancing were No. 6 Thomas Muster, No. 12 Alexander Volkov and No. 14 
Karel Novacek. Arnaud Boetsch, seeded 16th, withdrew with sinusitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players attempting comebacks had mixed results. Mats Wilander, a 
three-time Australian Open champion, won 6-1, 2-6, 7-5, 6-4 over Frenchman 
Olivier Delaitre. Tracy Austin, playing in the Australian Open for the first 
time in 13 years, lost, 6-1, 5-7, 6-2, to Sabine Hack of Germany.

EMPIRE LEAGUE GIRLS' ROUNDUP; EGGLESTON LEADS CYPRESS TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Dorado may have made Jessica Eggleston a non-factor -- for a half -- but it 
came with a price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hawks' pushing, shoving and slapping around limited the county's 
leading scorer to six first-half points, but the resulting foul trouble opened 
the door for Eggleston to dominate the third and fourth quarters as 
third-ranked Cypress scored a 59-37 victory over El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (19-2, 5-0) remained unbeaten in the first half of Empire League play, 
and will play its primary threats to the title -- last year's co-champions, 
Katella (4-1 in league) and El Dorado (13-6, 3-2) -- at home in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggleston finished with typical numbers, 28 points and 14 rebounds. She was 
averaging 29.9 and 11.3. At the half, she had three rebounds to go with her six 
points -- all scored in the second quarter -- as the Centurions took advantage 
of 11 turnovers in the quarter to take a 25-22 lead. El Dorado had held a 14-8 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But three El Dorado players had three fouls -- Michelle de Bruijn, Shanna 
Renken and Sarah Hinkle. Despite Eggleston's two-for-eight first-half shooting, 
Cypress continued to pound the ball inside to Eggleston, their 6-foot senior 
captain, and she responded with nine consecutive points as the Centurions 
stretched their 29-27 lead. Twice Eggleston scored on Cypress' third shot of 
the possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their foul trouble had something to do with it," said Eggleston, 
whose lowest output this season was 14 points in a five-minute appearance 
before being hurt. "I just knew I had to play hard and box out; my teammates 
did a good job of getting me the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Adams had 18 points and 10 rebounds, and Anna Bozarelos had nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado trailed by nine after three quarters, but Eggleston scored Cypress' 
first eight points of the fourth -- part of a 10-point run -- to put the game 
on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Jamie Nebeker had 10 points and 11 rebounds for El Dorado, and Renken 
had 11 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody played well," Cypress Coach John Selbe said. "We made some 
mistakes, but we played some good defense as well." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Katella 53, Esperanza 42 -- Katella (9-7, 4-1) remained in second place as 
Chris Carrillo paced the Knights with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara 61, Los Alamitos 58 -- Loara (2-10, 1-4) won its first league game in 
two years as the Saxons overcame a one-point halftime deficit.

CENTURY LEAGUE GIRLS' ROUNDUP; VILLA PARK NOW ALONE IN FIRST PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The smile on the face of Villa Park Coach Len Whitacre was understandable, 
considering his girls' basketball team had just beaten visiting Canyon, 51-43, 
Thursday to gain sole possession of first place in the Century League. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the tie around his neck was another story. 
</P>
<P>
 "See this tie?" Whitacre said. "See the pigs on this tie? I'm wearing this tie 
because we want to be pigs. I know (Canyon) doesn't want to share the league 
title, and neither do we." 
</P>
<P>
 By beating Canyon (11-7, 4-1 in league) in the teams' first meeting of the 
season, the Spartans are hoping to avoid a repeat of last season, when it took 
a victory by Villa Park in the last league game to keep Canyon from a share of 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very intense game," Whitacre said. "They matched up real well with 
us, and plus they've improved a lot in the past couple weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches took a 9-2 lead, but Villa Park (17-2, 5-0) battled back, 
outscoring Canyon, 15-4, in the second quarter, and taking a 25-17 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out very tentative," Whitacre said. "Every game we seem to come out 
like this and I don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the efforts of Canyon's Robyn Kuhlman, the Comanches were unable to 
gain any ground in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuhlman scored 12 points in the half, and finished with a game-high 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Committing 24 turnovers and shooting only one free throw turned out to be 
Canyon's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real important for us to stay between Kuhlman and the basket, and 
that's why we stayed out of foul trouble," Whitacre said. "Sooner or later our 
pressure will get to people, and it did tonight in the second and third 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Skehan led the Spartans with 16 points, and Michelle Miyake finished 
with 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena 57, Foothill 25 -- Jamie Shine had 14 points and Nora Mariner had 11 
rebounds for visiting El Modena (7-9, 3-2). Karen Herco added 10 points for El 
Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 45, Santa Ana Valley 43 (OT) -- Velina Gibson of Santa Ana Valley made 
a three-pointer in the last 40 seconds of overtime, but Orange was able to hold 
on for the victory. Shannon Strini, who had nine points and 12 rebounds for 
Orange (4-12, 1-4), made a three-pointer with seconds left to send the game 
into overtime.

'HEDAKE' IS A REAL PAIN FOR THE TROJANS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC LEADS BY AS 
MANY AS 14 POINTS, BUT SMITH SPARKS SUN DEVILS TO 87-62 VICTORY AT LYON CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If USC was curious why Arizona State guard Stevin Smith is called "Hedake" by 
his teammates, the Trojans discovered the answer Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching USC score the first nine points of the game and take an early 
14-point lead before a capacity crowd of 2,621 at the Lyon Center, Smith scored 
a career-high 35 points and dished out six assists to lead the Sun Devils to an 
87-62 victory and sent the Trojans and their fans looking for headache relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 6-foot-2 senior from Dallas, missed five of his first seven shots as 
USC rode the support of a rare home sellout crowd to lead, 25-11, with nine 
minutes to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith then made 10 of his next 15 shots, including seven three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to credit my teammates because I was taking some shots and they didn't 
complain early in the game," said Smith, whose last-second shot lifted the Sun 
Devils over California last Saturday. "After I hit a few, it felt like I was in 
a zone when I can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Lorenzo Orr's 15 points and Mark Boyd's 10 points and six rebounds, USC 
shot 66.7% and led, 41-31, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought in the first half, we played excellent basketball," USC Coach 
George Raveling said. "But, I reminded them it's a 40-minute game." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arizona State Coach Bill Frieder told reporters after the game that 
he was glad to trail by only 10 points going into the second half, his halftime 
antics helped spark the Sun Devils' second-half comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frieder was all over us at halftime, jumping up and down yelling and hitting 
blackboards," Smith said. "We knew we had to come out and just play like we 
forgot all about the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 After missing all four shots in the first half, Arizona State forward Ron 
Riley made four of six three-pointers to help the Sun Devils outscore USC, 
36-8, over the final 11 minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riley knocked a couple down for us when we needed it," said Frieder, whose 
team improved to 8-5 overall and 3-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 To go along with their accurate outside shooting, the Sun Devils got more 
aggressive with their inside defense against Orr and Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they got the momentum on their side, they fed on that as a team," said 
Orr, who scored 20 points. "I noticed in the second half, they doubled down on 
me a lot harder and I made some mistakes in getting the ball back outside." 
</P>
<P>
 What also hurt the Trojans in the second half was the loss of point guard Burt 
Harris, who ignited the Trojans with seven points and three assists. Harris, 
who did the best job defensively against Smith, did not play the final 10 
minutes because of severe leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's outside shooting did not come to the rescue once Arizona State started 
to collapse inside. The Trojans made only one of 10 three-point attempts, with 
their top three-point shooter, Brandon Martin, being held without an attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no offense to respond to their three-point shots," Raveling said. "In 
the critical spots when we could make a run, we turned the ball over. We didn't 
show a lot of offensive poise and patience down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans (10-4, 3-2) shot only 29% in the second half and had 22 turnovers 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 USC will have to regroup fast because the Trojans play host to Arizona 
Saturday at the Forum at 1 p.m.

the game or not. We shot 43%, they shot 39%. We had only 10 turnovers. We just 
didn't rebound."

out and Pacific held on for a 73-71 Big West victory in front of 1,731 in the 
Bren Center.  
</P>

2.3 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I was fouled," Boyer said, "but they didn't blow the whistle, so 
it's over now." 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of got him on the arm," Pacific guard Charles Terrell said, "but, hey, 
you have to play aggressive and the refs aren't going to see everything."

 Pacific (10-7, 4-2) shot 70% in the second half after making 38% in the first

<P>
 The Pepperdine basketball team hasn't had much luck in close games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Waves withstood a late rally by the University of San Diego before 
pulling away for an 85-75 West Coast Conference win Thursday night before 2,071 
at the USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a welcome relief for Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury, who had watched his 
team lose five games by a combined 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game really was closer than the score indicates, and we haven't won many 
close games this year," Asbury said. "But tonight we were resilient. We finally 
played like an experienced team." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine, 10-5 overall and 2-1 in the conference, led most of the way, but 
couldn't shake the Toreros (9-5, 1-2) until late. MITCH POLIN

CRESPI COACH MUFF DIES AT 46 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Muff, basketball coach and athletic director at Crespi High for most of 
the past 18 years, died Thursday morning. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Muff died of "an overwhelming infection," according to Terri Starkman, a 
spokesperson from Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Muff had undergone treatments, including chemotherapy, for a form of skin 
cancer for more than a year, friends said. He suffered from fevers and a sore 
throat for about three weeks and also had swelling in his right knee, according 
to friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed the Celts' game last Friday against Chaminade, telling the team he 
had a sore throat, junior swingman Gianadrea Marcaccini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muff was admitted to the emergency room at Little Company of Mary Hospital at 
about 7 p.m. Monday. He was declared dead at 6:10 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi's games scheduled for tonight at Bishop Montgomery and Saturday night 
at Loyola have been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi assistant Paul Yerina is expected to take over the Celts (7-9, 3-3 in 
the Mission League) for at least the remainder of the season, said Fr. Fred 
Tillotson, Crespi principal. He said a decision on the athletic director's 
position will be made in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Muff was hired as basketball coach and athletic director in 1976. He compiled 
a 204-124 record in 13 1/2 seasons, including four Del Rey League 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 He had relinquished his position as basketball coach before the 1989-90 
season, but returned to coaching last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Muff is survived by his mother, Marjorie Ann Muff; his sister, Mary Ann 
Geierman; brother-in-law, Raymond Geierman; and nephews Todd and Erik Geierman. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Our Lady of Grace 
Church in Encino.

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE GIRLS' SOCCER; MATER DEI KNOCKS OFF NO. 3 CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>

<P>
 The Mater Dei girls' soccer team earned some respect when the unranked 
Monarchs defeated No. 3 Capistrano Valley, 1-0, in a South Coast League game 
Thursday at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 A goal by Trisha Steiner late in the game put Mater Dei on top of the league 
standings and might help the Monarchs (13-4-1, 4-0-1) earn a spot among the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the game, the Cougars (15-3-3, 4-1) employed seven attackers 
inside the penalty box, leaving only three defenders at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mater Dei sophomores Julie Peck and Sarah McEachen quickly cleared 
the ball each time the Cougars threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 With four minutes remaining, Chrissy Whalen lofted a pass from the endline 
toward the corner of the goal, where Steiner was waiting. Steiner trapped the 
ball and put it in the goal, prompting a cry of foul from Cougar Coach Harry 
Hutcheson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way that girl (Steiner) was on sides," he said. "This was the 
worst job of refing I've seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't a soccer game, it was a football game. I've got a bunch of 
walking wounded on my side." DAN ARRITT

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: SLOW-STARTING EAGLES GET BOOST FROM 
MEJER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be difficult to overstate Gitte Mejer's importance to the Concordia 
women's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering this season, Mejer, a 6-foot-2 senior from Aarhus, Denmark, was the 
school's career leader in scoring (1,482 points) and rebounding (701). She also 
had the top three single-game scoring performances in school history -- 38, 36 
and 33 points -- and helped the Eagles to consecutive berths in the NAIA 
Division I national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But until recently, this season had been a struggle for Mejer and the Eagles. 
Coach Sharon Campbell replaced Kent Schlichtemeier, who resigned to attend 
graduate school, and the team had problems adjusting to the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles lost their first four games of the season, including three to teams 
from the Golden State Athletic Conference, the conference they breezed through 
undefeated last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely been frustrating," Mejer said. "I knew it was going to be a 
struggle and it would take a lot of adjusting. We had some problems in the 
beginning getting to know Coach Campbell and learning her system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't play very well together. I think everybody was trying to find 
their role on the team. Usually, you have returners who know what to expect and 
can help other players. But we were all like freshmen. We had to learn 
everything from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said she tinkered with her system some, returning to a motion offense 
similar to the one the Eagles used last year. The team has responded by winning 
six of its last eight and four of its last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidently, Mejer has been putting up amazing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, she scored 53 points in a 98-78 victory over Biola, breaking her own 
school record for the second time in two games. Saturday, she had 47 points, 
making 17 of 19 shots from the field and all 13 of her free throws in an 88-82 
victory over Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
 In her last five games, Mejer has averaged 37.6 points to increase her 
conference-leading scoring average to 24.1. This week she was named conference 
player of the week for the second consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer, who made 24 of 36 shots and had 13 rebounds against Biola, said her 
increased output is helped by the fact that she is getting more playing time 
because she isn't getting into foul trouble as often. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wendy Johnson, the Eagles' only other 6-footer, has missed the last eight 
games with serious shin splits, leaving Mejer as the only inside threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go into any games thinking I'm going to have such-and-such amount of 
points," Mejer said. "It just happens that in the last few games the points 
have been coming from inside. If that's the way it's going to be, that's the 
way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going for any records." 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer and the Eagles (9-7, 1-1 in conference) play host to Cal Baptist (3-13, 
0-2) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California College women's basketball team continues to roll up 
some impressive scores. The Vanguards (15-3, 2-0), who won their 13th 
consecutive game Tuesday by beating UC San Diego, 79-54, are leading the 
conference in points scored (73) and fewest points allowed (49). 
</P>
<P>
 However, Coach Dean Cooper is worried that the Vanguards won't be at full 
strength for Saturday's game at Fresno Pacific (11-5, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Nicole Kelley injured her back in practice Monday, sat out of 
Tuesday's game and is doubtful for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper went with a larger lineup Tuesday, starting 6-3 Carrie Elsaesser, 6-2 
Sanja Simidzija, 6-0 Dana DeVaney and 6-0 Jamie Zitterkopf, but he is worried 
how the team will fare against Fresno Pacific's full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC is shallow at guard because reserve point guard Ruth Gulfan and starting 
shooting guard Emily Wedel didn't return to the team after the holiday break. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team was bolstered when Erin Hartigan, an all-Utah state shooting 
guard, transferred from Loyola Marymount at the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The inside game was helped by the addition of Simidzija, a junior from 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia. She transferred from Peru State, an NAIA Division II 
school in Nebraska where Cooper said she averaged about 18 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Poor scouting: Before the season, Jack Bauerle, Chapman's athletic trainer, 
made a bet with some members of the men's basketball team. He'd let them shave 
his head if the Panthers beat a certain team on their schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauerle and the players looked at the schedule and figured the game last 
Friday against UC Santa Cruz would give the Panthers a good test. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Banana Slugs, also an NCAA Division III team, entered the game with 
a 3-11 record and Chapman won easily, 95-68. 
</P>
<P>
 "At halftime, I asked someone, 'How about if they have to beat them by 20?' 
And they still got that accomplished," Bauerle said. 
</P>
<P>
 So after the players hit the showers, they returned to the gym floor, grabbed 
the electric razor and each took a few swipes while several dozen watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman football Coach Ken Visser has filled his staff. Here is the tentative 
lineup: Offensive coordinator Greg Shammel, a former Servite player who was an 
assistant coach at Fullerton High, Colorado and Whittier College; running backs 
coach Dave Hill, an assistant at La Verne who is a Chapman official; receivers 
coach Terry Boesel, Chapman assistant men's basketball coach; quarterbacks 
coach Tom Tereschuk, Servite's head baseball coach; defensive backs and 
recruiting coordinator Dave Bishop, a former Westminster High player who 
coached at Whittier College; linebackers and special teams coach Kirk 
Jellerson, an assistant at Cerritos, Fullerton and Whittier colleges, and 
defensive line Bill Yurak, a teacher at Bellflower St. John Bosco High.

BOWLING; HROMEK TAKES LEAD AT LAKEWOOD

 Justin Hromek of Andover, Kan. led comfortably after 26 games of the $220,000 
AC/Delco PBA Tournament Thursday night at Cal Bowl in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 But popular sentiment seemed to be with Robert Smith, who graduated two years 
ago from Royal High School in Simi Valley and was in third place -- 65 pins 
behind the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Hromek, seeking his second PBA title, won six of eight matches with a high 
game of 268 for a 5,913 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Bohn III of Freehold, N.J., at 5,849, was second. Smith's total was 
5,848. Floridian Joe Firpo, at 5,828, was fourth and Mike Aulby of Indianapolis 
fifth at 5,815. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the only amateur in the competition, is a budding international star 
for the United States. He will be among members of Team USA at Colorado Springs 
later this month for Olympic training. 
</P>
<P>
 The field of 183 was cut to 24 earlier in the day after 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Aulby, Del Ballard Jr., Wayne Webb and David Ozio survived the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Several favorites, however, didn't, including Walter Ray Williams Jr., Pete 
Weber, Brian Voss, Gary Dickinson and Marshal Holman.

 Reggie Williams and Brian Williams made baskets in the final minute of the 
second overtime, helping the Denver Nuggets end a four-game losing streak with 
a 111-106 victory over the Houston Rockets on Thursday night at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets, who have lost their last four games, rebounded from an 18-point 
first-quarter deficit to draw into a 92-92 tie at the end of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston scored seven consecutive points early in the first overtime, but 
Denver countered with a 7-0 run of its own. A tip-in by Dikembe Mutombo with 
11.6 seconds to play made the score 103-103, forcing a second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Williams finished with 25 points, and Mutombo had 19 points and 14 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Thorpe led Houston with 24 points and 20 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 93, San Antonio 83 -- Doug West scored 23 points at Minneapolis to 
help the Timberwolves defeat the Spurs for only the third time in 23 games 
since Minnesota joined the NBA at the start of the 1989-90 season.

GARCIA EARNS VICTORY -- AND FANS' WRATH

 Alex Garcia, the third-ranked heavyweight in the world only six months ago, 
looked like a mediocre club fighter Thursday night at the Irvine Marriott as he 
struggled to defeat journeyman George O'Mara in a 10-round unanimous decision 
that was heartily booed by the crowd of 1,108. 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggled," Garcia said."I know I should have punched. I was missing some 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia (34-3-1) of San Fernando, who was in line to fight former world 
champion Riddick Bowe less than a year ago, was timid and careless against 
O'Mara's awkward style. 
</P>
<P>
 He carried most of the early rounds in unimpressive fashion, but by the fifth 
round, the crowd had turned against Garcia and began cheering for O'Mara, a 
38-year-old who fought former top-ranked heavyweight Ron Lyle 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Mara (13-11-3) carried the middle rounds and survived a big eighth round by 
Garcia before dominating the ninth and 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 "He caught me with a few punches, but I wasn't seriously hurt," Garcia said." 
</P>
<P>
 After the decision was announced, Garcia was greeted by a chorus of boos. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, O'Mara was greeted by $5 and $10 bills that were thrown in the ring 
by fans. DAVE McKIBBEN

 Mike Aulby of Cincinnati took command of the $220,000 AC/Delco pro bowling 
tournament at Cal Bowl in Lakewood on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In quest of his 23rd title in 16 years on the national tour, the president of 
the Pro Bowlers Assn. highlighted his third round with a 299 game. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 180-bowler field was cut to 24 for the match-play semifinals, Aulby, 
33, found himself 50 pins ahead of one of the PBA's budding stars, 20-year-old 
Robert Smith of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Aulby's total for 18 games was 4,022 and Smith's 3,972. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a member of the national team, is in his second year of adult bowling 
after having won the Chuck Hall Star of Tomorrow Award, emblematic of the 
nation's top junior in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Aulby left the No. 10 pin on what appeared to be a perfect hit for his 299 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of my biggest thrill in bowling," he said, referring to his 
300-279 match victory over David Ozio at Wichita last year. That triumph, on 
national television, earned him one of bowling's biggest paydays -- $133,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Duke, Del Ballard Jr., Wayne Webb and Parker Bohn III were among those 
reaching the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walter Ray Williams Jr., Marshall Holman, Brian Voss, George Branham III 
and Ron Williams failed to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cogswell of Canyon Country bowled a 300 Thursday, but finished 47th. 
</P>
<P>
 The semifinalists are competing for five spots in the final playoffs at noon 
Saturday.

 Cal State Fullerton basketball Coach Brad Holland frowned as he looked at the 
stat sheet after the Titans' 69-63 Big West Conference loss to San Jose State 
Thursday night at Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't looking at the score but the rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State, the worst rebounding team in the conference, outrebounded 
Fullerton, 42-27, including 15-6 on the offensive boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that," Holland said. "You tell me if rebounding was the difference in 
the game or not. We shot 43%, they shot 39%. We had only 10 turnovers. We just 
didn't rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State crashed the boards, and the Titans' hopes for a second 
consecutive victory came crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a career rebounding night for any Spartan who could reach over his 
head. Terry Cannon, a 5-11 guard and San Jose State's leading scorer, had a 
career-high eight rebounds to go with his team-high 16 points. Guard Lossie 
Mitchel and forward Darren Greene each had seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Center David Frigout led Fullerton with six rebounds, but no other Titan had 
more than four. 
</P>
<P>
 "A blind person would know we were outrebounded tonight," said Titan guard 
Greg Vernon, who finished with 11 points and three rebounds. "We were just 
killed on the boards. That's basically it." 
</P>
<P>
 That was it for the Titans, who dropped to 3-11 overall and even deeper in the 
conference cellar at 1-5. San Jose State (7-7, 3-3) matched its victory total 
of last year, when it went 7-20, and won at Titan Gym for the first time since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans got off to an awful start, missing their first 12 shots and 
failing to score until Andrew Gardiner hit a free throw with 14 minutes 59 
seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton didn't fare any better, turning over the ball three times early and 
failing to reach double figures in points until Fred Amos' dunk with 8:48 left 
gave the Titans an 11-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite San Jose State's poor shooting, Fullerton still couldn't pull away. 
The Titans led, 13-10, with 6:24 left in the half, but Cannon hit three 
three-point shots to spark a 15-5 Spartan run to close the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Fullerton's first-half troubles was because of the absence of leading 
scorer Winston Peterson, who picked up his third foul less than 7:30 into the 
game and scored only five points in 10 minutes of play by the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton trailed, 25-18, at the half, narrowly missing their season-low of 17 
points in the first half of last week's loss to Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose State built its lead to 11 points, 34-23, with 15:39 left in the 
second half. But Peterson, who stayed out of foul trouble in the second half 
and finished with a game-high 23 points brought the Titans back with some help 
from freshman guard Chris St. Clair. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Clair scored five points and Peterson eight to pull the Titans to within 
one, 39-38, with nine minutes left. And forward Darren Little scored seven of 
his 16 points in the next five minutes to keep the Titans close. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-pointer by Little with 4:05 left cut San Jose State's lead to three, 
51-48, but the Spartans' Jason Allen answered with a three-pointer to spark an 
8-1 San Jose run in the next 2:40 to pull away.

UC IRVINE'S RALLY CRASHES AGAINST PACIFIC; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ANTEATERS HAVE 
CHANCE TO TIE IN LAST SECONDS, BUT BOYER'S SHOT GOES AWRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 UC Irvine, the team that can't deal with success, really ran its fans through 
the ringer Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters led the University of the Pacific by 16 early in the first half, 
were outscored, 23-0, midway through the game to fall 15 behind, fought back 
from a 10-point deficit with 3 minutes 42 seconds to go and had the ball in the 
hands of their center, underneath the basket, trailing by two with 2.3 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Overtime? Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 DeForrest Boyer ended up taking a falling-down, six-foot, baseball throw at 
the basket as time ran out and the Tigers held on for a 73-71 Big West victory 
in front 1,731 in the Bren Center. As a result, Pacific improved to 10-7 and 
4-2 in conference and Irvine fell to 5-8, 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I was fouled," Boyer said, "but they didn't blow the whistle so 
it's over now." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific guard Charles Terrell also believes Boyer was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of got him on the arm," he said, smiling, "but, hey, you have to play 
aggressive and the refs aren't going to see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Lloyd Mumford, whose frenetic play in the closing seconds gave the 
Anteaters the chance to send the game into overtime, believes basic physical 
science proves Boyer was fouled. He figures it had to take an irresistible 
force to budge this immovable object. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 280-pound guy doesn't just turn around and fall down like that," Mumford 
said. "You just don't see that happen. But it was like the refs were waiting 
for the other one to blow the whistle. They all just looked at each other and 
then ran off the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Coach Rod Baker maintains that all losses hurt the same. He had a look 
on his face after this one, however, that would seem to belie that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be out there playing right now," he said, softly. "I'm not sure if 
he was pulled or pushed or what, but once he found himself falling down, he had 
to put it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a microcosm of the Irvine-Pacific series, during which the Tigers 
won the first six, Irvine won the next 20 and Pacific has won the last 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific missed 16 of its first 21 shots as the Anteaters sprinted out to a 
28-12 advantage. And even though the Tigers scored four points in the final 14 
seconds of the first half, Irvine led at the intermission, 36-28. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worm turned in the second half and, for the first 5:45 of the half, it 
was the Anteaters who couldn't get the ball through the hoop. By the time they 
had "stopped the bleeding," as Baker put it, Pacific was leading, 47-36. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Mumford, who injured his left thumb in the first minute of the game, 
the Anteaters were not rolling over, however. Pacific led, 69-62, with 3:17 
remaining when Mumford drove for a layup, was fouled and made the free throw. A 
minute later, he dribbled into the key, spun 360-degrees and banked in a 
six-foot jumper. Thirty seconds later, he swished home a 15-foot jumper. And, 
with 34 seconds left, he stole the ball from Terrell on a trap and made a layup 
to cut the Pacific lead to one, 72-71. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Rishwain made one of two free throws with 29 seconds left and then Mumford 
got the ball into Boyer, who tried to dribble and lost the ball. Mumford 
quickly fouled Rishwain, who missed the front end of a one-and-one situation. 
Irvine rebounded and Mumford drove down the key and pulled up for a 12-footer. 
This one he missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jackson and Mumford ended up clinging to the rebound, though, and 
Irvine got possession on the jump-ball call, setting up the inbound play and 
Boyer's ill-fated shot. 
</P>
<P>
 After their quick start, it was a play the Anteaters -- who were outscored, 
21-0, at one point in their loss to Reno Saturday night -- shouldn't have had 
to make. Pacific, which shot 38% from the floor in the first half, had more 
than a little to do with the Anteaters' downfall. The Tigers burned the nets to 
the tune of 70% in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great teams don't have letdowns," Baker said. "Good teams have letdowns and 
then get back in the game, which we did. Bad teams have letdowns and keep going 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine went down all right, but at least it went kicking and scratching. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Boyer's case, with a crash.

ANOTHER DOW RECORD; BOND YIELDS DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * The stock market finished ahead in a busy session Thursday 
after late buying boosted the Dow industrial average to another new high. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields fell, pushing prices broadly higher as traders reacted to 
indications that the economic recovery may be losing momentum. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Positive economic news and a series of good corporate financial reports put 
stocks on firm footing. The bond market's respectable showing -- despite 
government data depicting significant vigor in the home building business -- 
also provided a favorable backdrop for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow advanced 7.59 past the previous high reached Wednesday to 3,891.96, on 
Big Board volume totaling a brisk 310.20 million shares. Several other 
indicators also set new marks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, rising issues narrowly outnumbered those that fell -- 
by about 8 to 7 -- on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors concentrated on companies reporting quarterly results as well as 
those that stand to benefit from improving economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investments du jour were once again the economically sensitive stocks," 
said Alfred E. Goldman of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer Associates tumbled 3 1/2 to 41 and was the second-most heavily 
traded NYSE issue after the company posted sharply higher fourth-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft reported earnings slightly above Wall Street expectations, and its 
stock rose 3 to 86 1/4. Other software stocks were mostly firmer, with Lotus up 
3/4 to 54 5/8 and Oracle Systems adding 1 to 33 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer maker AST Research shot up 4 3/8 to 29 1/8 after reporting strong 
quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Altera reported earnings and said it did not expect its first-quarter sales 
growth to reach the double-digit levels of the past five quarters. It fell 5 
5/8 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time Warner rose 1 1/8 to 40 1/4. The company said it adopted a defensive 
rights plan after institutional investors and partners had voiced concerns. It 
said the plan will not block Seagram from buying a 15% stake in Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Economically sensitive stocks and oil company shares led the blue chips' 
rise. Allied Signal rose 7/8 to 79 1/4, while Chevron advanced 5/8 to 90 5/8 
and Exxon gained 7/8 to 66 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks rose moderately while the Frankfurt and London markets retreated. 
However, Mexico City's Bolsa index gained 54.57 points to finish at 2,656.07. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices initially fell following the release of a Commerce Department 
report that showed a larger than expected rise in housing starts during 
December. The government said housing starts shot up 6.2% last month and were 
up 7.1% on the year to the highest level in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market turned around after the Labor Department said the number of 
Americans filing initial jobless claims surged 23,000 to the highest level in 
six months during the week ended Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond slipped to 6.26% from 6.29%. Its 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, was up 13/32 point, or $4.06 per 
$1,000 in face value.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar fell against most currencies as the German central bank 
said it would not ease monetary policy and U.S. authorities issued a mixed 
batch of reports on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, gold plummeted $4.80 an ounce to $387.50 an ounce on the New York 
Comex. Silver fell 7.2 cents to $5.254 an ounce.

O.C. JURY FAULTS DMV FOR BLIND MAN'S ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ and E.J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Department of Motor Vehicles was negligent when it gave a driver's 
license to a legally blind Brea man who later plowed his sports car into three 
people walking to church, an Orange County jury decided Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors took only four hours to determine that DMV officials knew that George 
Edgar Lizarralde, 31, could not drive safely when they gave him a license in 
1985 -- and then renewed it five years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Lizarralde was denied a license three times, but the DMV granted his request 
when he applied for a fourth time, even though he failed the vision test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," said Deborah Ann Mohr, one of the injured pedestrians, when 
the jury's verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr, a 32-year-old former waitress from Whittier, her former fiance and his 
4-year-old son sued the DMV and Lizarralde. She said the accident left her with 
brain damage and a limp, and it ruined her marriage plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts described Thursday's verdict as unusual because state 
agencies often are able to claim immunity when they are blamed for an 
individual's actions. A state appellate court, however, previously held the DMV 
liable for an accident involving a 87-year-old driver who was unfit to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A second phase of the civil trial continues in Orange County Superior Court 
today to determine how much compensation the state should pay to the three 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan Nossoff, a DMV spokesman in Sacramento, declined to discuss the case but 
said the agency was "constantly re-evaluating and attempting to weigh public 
safety as a major factor in issuing licenses to those with physical 
impairments." 
</P>
<P>
 "We handle 20 million licenses a year, and we do the best we can to protect 
the community," Nossoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lizarralde, who receives federal disability payments for a debilitating eye 
disease, did not want to talk about the case, his father said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred Aug. 4, 1990, when Lizarralde drove his Mazda sports 
coupe through a marked pedestrian crosswalk in Norwalk, striking Mohr, her 
former fiance, Brian Barber, and his son Dane. The father and son also suffered 
multiple injuries, and both walk with limps as a result of the accident, 
according to court papers filed by their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, Lizarralde told Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies that 
he had reached to pick up a cassette player that had fallen from a seat. He 
said he looked up moments later, but he was unable to avoid hitting the 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher J. Day, a lawyer for the pedestrians, said he later discovered 
that Lizarralde had received disability payments since 1979 because of his eye 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 During the weeklong trial, Lizarralde's attorney, Roberta Coughlin, 
successfully petitioned Superior Court Judge Logan Moore to drop her client as 
a defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin and Day blamed the DMV for the accident, contending that Lizarralde 
never should have been allowed on the road. Lizarralde has told attorneys in 
the case that his vision is so poor that if he sat across a table from someone, 
he could see only the person's nose clearly and not the entire face. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Barbara Annette Noble, who represents the DMV, argued during 
the trial that the state agency could not be held liable for the injuries 
because Lizarralde struck the pedestrians as a result of taking his eyes off 
the road to pick up the cassette player and not because of his poor vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble declined to say whether the DMV would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Three legal experts said state agencies often are able to claim broad immunity 
from liability in cases in which government employees failed to make a 
determination that someone with a disability would threaten the safety of 
himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a difficult case to prove because it raised the question of the 
state's liability to people who have been injured as a result of licenses the 
DMV gave to someone else," said John Hill, a law professor at Western State 
University College of Law in Irvine. "The jury apparently believes that in this 
case the state is liable, so the hard part has been won." 
</P>
<P>
 State courts have already determined that the DMV can be held liable when 
officials had prior knowledge that a person's physical disability has rendered 
him or her unfit to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 In one such case, two people sued the DMV, alleging that officials issued a 
driver's license to an 87-year-old Northern California man, even though they 
knew he was unable to operate a motor vehicle safely. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Trewin vs. State of California, there was evidence that the DMV 
drive test examiner observed that the elderly man had "general debilities" but 
still gave him a license, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A state appeals court ruled that the DMV has "a mandatory duty to refuse to 
issue or renew a license if it has determined beforehand that the person is 
unable to safely operate a motor vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Trewin case, the attorney general's office argued in court papers 
the state had no prior knowledge that it was unsafe for Lizarralde to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Orange County jury disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, jurors voted 11 to 1 that the DMV determined that Lizarralde was 
unable to safely drive a car when it gave him the original driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Clark, also a law professor at Western State, said he believes the case 
would probably cause the DMV "to become more stringent, and they would have to 
tighten the reins on the testing of individuals with disabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Lizarralde's attorney said her client has not driven since the 1990 accident. 
A check of DMV records Thursday showed that his license is still valid.

INAUGURATION DAY FOR NEW NIXON LEGACY; POLICY: FORMER PRESIDENT AND TOP 
DEPUTIES LAUNCH O.C. THINK TANK TO CONTINUE WORK STARTED 25 YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Richard M. Nixon joined a team of national leaders from a 
previous generation Thursday to recall the achievements of their White House 
tenure and to launch a new policy research center that they hope will continue 
the work they started 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a garden ceremony held between the presidential library and the tiny white 
clapboard house where Nixon was born, Cabinet members and officers who served 
in the White House described the former President as a skillful tactician who 
shepherded the nation through difficult times and now holds a place as a 
revered statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeches, including three from former secretaries of state and another by 
ex-President Gerald R. Ford, portrayed the rehabilitation of the only President 
to resign from office as all but complete and promised a legacy that will be 
shaped more by achievements than by his role in Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the Center for Peace and Freedom, a new think tank to be 
headquartered at the library, will preserve Nixon's place in history as a key 
player in shaping world events as well as add another voice to the debate over 
contemporary political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, appearing healthy and relaxed during a speech he sprinkled with humor, 
also reflected on the highs and lows of a public career he began in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was it worth it?" he said. "Politics is never going to be heaven, and 
sometimes it's hell. But it was worth the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the presence of a small but loud group of protesters, another part of the 
Nixon legacy, was turned into a joke. "I hope you haven't been distressed by 
some of that background noise that we've had here," he said. "I remind our 
young people out there that I've been heckled by experts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, who celebrated his 81st birthday earlier this month, told the audience 
of about 1,000 invited guests that he "is not a fan of think tanks." But he 
promised that the Center for Peace and Freedom would have a unique mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25-million center is scheduled to open later this year with an office in 
Washington. Organizers hope to move into a permanent headquarters in a new 
building at the library by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 George L. Argyros, a Newport Beach developer and chairman of the fund-raising 
effort dubbed "Legacy of Peace," said, "The center's goal is to ensure not only 
that President Nixon's legacy is remembered . . . but that his uniquely 
practical approach to the vast complexities of foreign and domestic policy 
continues to be applied in the uncertain new world we face in the wake of the 
Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
 While officials stressed that the center will be innovative, activist and 
fundamentally different from other think tanks, the specifics of how those 
goals would be accomplished remained hazy Thursday. Also unclear was how active 
a role the former President is likely to play in guiding its programs and 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's president and its board chair are expected to be named by June, 
with announcements about its staffing, funding and building design to follow, 
officials said. A former Nixon secretary of state, Henry A. Kissinger, said he 
would serve as an unsalaried member of the center's board.  
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference after the ceremony, Kissinger said the center will be 
distinct because of its focus on "middle-term problems" -- as opposed to short- 
or long-range issues. He said only government can respond quickly enough for 
short-term problems and traditional think tanks usually address long-term 
political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to create a place where men of ideas and men of action can 
interact on middle-term problems," Kissinger said. "How exactly that is going 
to be done, I cannot pretend we know exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger said examples of middle-term problems include the evolving 
relationships in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and South Africa as well as 
the emerging roles of Japan and China. Literature for the center said its 
priority "will be to have an impact on the policy-making process rather than to 
establish long-term niches for experts or scholars." 
</P>
<P>
 The center plans to establish eight endowed chairs, six focusing on foreign 
affairs in the Middle East, Europe, Japan and Russia. Two others would research 
domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was also the 25th anniversary of Nixon's first inaugural as 
President. As a result, much of the commentary was nostalgic. At times it 
almost seemed like a celebrity roast as former Cabinet members looked at Nixon 
seated in the front row and recalled some of the most important and difficult 
decisions they shared in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Nixon gave a detailed and optimistic speech about the world's 
future. He shed the podium used for written text that other speakers had used 
and talked without notes while he clasped his hands behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 He made several bold predictions, suggesting that the threat of global nuclear 
war is over and that television's saturation of the planet has made it 
impossible for dictators to retain power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had enormous technological progress," he said. In the next century, 
"freedom, political freedom, will be the rule rather than the exception because 
the communications revolution has had the effect of making dictatorships 
unviable. They cannot stand having their closed societies open up." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was enthusiastic about the rapidly changing new world, cautioning that 
there are still difficult challenges ahead, but also offering a promising 
outlook for opportunities that politics made unthinkable during his era. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon almost scolded young people who say this is a hard period in which to 
grow up. On the contrary, he said, it is the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we approach a day, the day of a new millennium, I would say you could not 
possibly think of a day in which one would be more fortunate than to live in 
the United States of America and on this day, at this time," he said. "The 
reason for that is . . . what can be achieved in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he resigned from office nearly 20 years ago, Nixon has been one of the 
country's most active ex-Presidents. He has authored nine books and is nearly 
finished with a 10th. He still travels the globe, talking to foreign leaders, 
and he writes periodic newspaper columns. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of the Watergate scandal that forced Nixon from office and still 
deprives his library of the presidential papers provided to other former chief 
executives will be diminished, if not forgotten, his supporters said. They 
point to the attention given to his commentary as proof that he will be 
remembered as a capable and vital national leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said publicly, and I have written it, that President Nixon was 
punished beyond the cause," Kissinger said. "There were big mistakes made, 
which he himself has admitted. I believe Watergate will be an insignificant 
aspect of the Nixon legacy. I believe that President Nixon will go down as one 
of our eminent Presidents." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the invited guests, including many elected leaders and contributors to 
the library, there were some mixed feelings about the Nixon legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an excellent diplomat; he ended the Vietnam War. That's what he'll 
always be remembered for -- right after Watergate," said Steve Drasil, an 
associate member of the Nixon library. "That's something, unfortunately, that 
will always be in the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
 P Among those who worked in his White House, however, the memories were fond 
and powerful. They took credit for shaping major national policy and 
establishing the conditions that led to the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "America did not win by default, as some misguided revisionist historians of 
the Cold War are already claiming," Ford said. "We resolved to win in this 
country with sound military and diplomatic policies over a period of four 
decades. Throughout that era . . . Americans were inspired and led by Richard 
Nixon. . . . His resolve was to win and the net result was America succeeded."

OFFICIALS TRY TO COAX VICTIMS OUT OF PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Amid rising concerns over public health, the potential for crime and violence 
and even forecasts of rain, Los Angeles officials mobilized on numerous fronts 
Thursday to cope with one of the earthquake's most intractable problems -- 
coaxing nearly 14,000 people to leave makeshift camps in public parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort became a top priority as the city began assembling teams of 
psychologists, social workers and priests to help evacuate the parks before 
inadequate living conditions and frayed nerves could trigger serious social 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said their goal was to return the campers to their homes, if they 
are declared safe, or to move them to indoor shelters before the onset of rain, 
which is expected this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although crowds remained generally peaceful at 70 public parks throughout Los 
Angeles, ominous logistic difficulties heightened the cause for worry. Portable 
toilets were filling nearly as fast as work crews could empty them -- sometimes 
faster. Most families were grooming themselves from buckets or by taking sponge 
baths. 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking water was plentiful at most locations, but only because the Red Cross 
and other relief organizations were providing it in bottles; public fountains 
were considered a health risk because of possible contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 At many parks, trucks delivering care packages of food and supplies were being 
engulfed by eager throngs. There were reports of unexpected cooperation, but 
also of pushing and animosity as a few campers tried to take more than their 
allotted share of bread, meat, diapers and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the camps were shrinking -- overall populations had dropped 
by more than 4,000 since Wednesday, according to city estimates. But those who 
remain pose an especially difficult problem. A vast majority are Latinos, 
Asians or other ethnic groups who associate earthquakes with the terrifying 
collapse of homes and buildings in nations with far less stringent building 
codes. Many campers are also illegal immigrants, reluctant to register at 
shelters for fear of being deported. 
</P>
<P>
 In numbers large and small, the evacuees are scattered in parks and empty lots 
in nearly every corner of town. Like so many mushrooms after a cloudburst, 
tents and tarpaulins have sprung up in the Valley, South-Central, Hollywood and 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of those camps, at Valley Plaza Park in North Hollywood, contained 4,000 
people Thursday morning, although that total dropped to about 1,000 by 
nightfall, officials estimated. Woodley Park in Van Nuys was a temporary home 
to 2,000 people. The Sepulveda Recreation Center in Panorama City contained 
1,700 to 2,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Each outpost is a bustling, eclectic potpourri of cars, camp tents, boxes, 
baby carriages, blankets, litter, children, family dogs, parakeets, soft drink 
cans and sheets tethered to chain-link fences. Weary residents exhibit all the 
fears and frustrations that come with upheaval. News and rumors circulate 
through the encampments on an informal grapevine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, that is a cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, according to relief workers, a Red Cross truck showed up at 
the Sepulveda Recreation Center loaded with blankets and cots for those who 
would spend the chilly night outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scene nearly grew ugly as word spread that the truck was filled with 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody rushed it," one observer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials were forced to call in National Guard troops, who were 
already on duty throughout the region to quash looting and violence. "It was 
calmed down very quickly once the National Guard came," Red Cross spokesman 
Howard Cutter said. 
</P>
<P>
 But two squads totaling 10 National Guard troops have remained on duty there, 
toting rifles and wearing helmets and camouflage combat fatigues. Their 
presence underscores the continuing concern of public officials as families try 
to make do under conditions of diminishing food, money and patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people here," National Guardsman Paul Tapia, 25, said. "You 
could have a fight. Someone might have a weapon. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the potential problems, 25 high-ranking officials from many city 
departments convened Thursday to devise ways of sending the campers on their 
way. Shortly after sundown, the five- and six-member "reassurance teams" began 
fanning out at the most crowded sites, offering counseling and information 
about available shelters while collecting the addresses of park dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Using those address lists, city building inspectors were planning to give top 
priority to those homes and apartment houses, enabling those with safe 
buildings to return, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sepulveda Recreation Center, the team strategy fizzled Thursday night. 
Only three of the six team members showed up. Without the two city building 
inspectors, other team members decided to abandon that park and go instead to 
Valley Plaza to assist another team. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort there seemed to provide needed reassurance to many. Sergio 
Acajabon, who lives with his wife and two young daughters in an apartment house 
near Valley Plaza, believes the structure is safe. But his daughters -- ages 11 
and 13 -- are afraid to return home. During a visit to clean up the place, one 
daughter wore a bicycle helmet, and both spent much of the time hiding under 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids don't want to stay there," Acajabon said, happy that city inspectors 
might vouch for its safety. "We're here only because of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet others were not ready to be persuaded. A young man who identified himself 
only as Roberto said there is no way he is returning home -- not yet, with 
aftershocks still rumbling. "If we go back, we don't know if, in an hour, there 
will be another earthquake," he said. "I don't feel it is safe to go back . . . 
. I prefer to be outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as those teams resume their work today, other city and county crews will 
be struggling with the burden of keeping the camps operating. Not only are 
portable toilets filling or overflowing, but so are trash cans. Los Angeles 
County health officials, scrambling to provide medical services, concede that 
health problems were mounting. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal team of nurses and a doctor who showed up Wednesday night at crowded 
Lanark Park in the West Valley spent several hours there, but was able to give 
only limited comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Several campers said that when they asked for medications, they were turned 
away. Some evacuees complained of headaches, dysentery, fevers, cold and 
nausea. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilia Diaz, a mother of five, was doubled over Thursday afternoon with 
stomach pain, sick after drinking a small container of milk that had been 
sitting in the sun. Her daughter Emily was also ill. The 10-year-old, a student 
at Canoga Park Elementary School, said she has had dysentery since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither had medicine, and both were obviously ill as they tried to find a 
shady spot near their camper. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the cloak of tents and tarpaulins, some worries festered with urgency. 
Claudia Luciano, a 15-year-old mother, feared for her 5-month-old daughter, 
Amy. The infant was vomiting and suffering from diarrhea. Claudia had been 
given some medicine for the girl, but it had run out and she didn't know where 
to find more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you give me some medicine?" she asked a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughs and fevers were becoming commonplace, especially among children 
sleeping in the chill night air. At the Sepulveda Recreation Center, Maria 
Francisca Vasquez seemed helpless in trying to assist her five children, two of 
whom had come down with colds since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez, widowed two years ago, did not have any food for any of her children 
Thursday, except for a banana that someone had given her to share with the 
children. Although her sister was camping with her, Vasquez appeared forlorn 
and anxious, rubbing her hands together while she complained, "There's no one 
to talk to . . . no one to get help from." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many campers complained, Dr. Caswell Evans, assistant department 
director for county public health programs, denied that the county has 
responded too slowly to their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first concerns were for the immediate needs of the badly injured," he 
said. "We have a massive problem, and it seems to me gearing up in the few days 
that we have is a substantial accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall Thursday, the county had lined up two federal medical disaster 
response vans -- the same ones used to aid victims of Hurricane Andrew -- and 
at least one van from a private health agency, the Watts Health Foundation. 
Those vans will be staffed by doctors and nurses and will help deal more 
effectively with the overall demand for medical services, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other public health officials said they had not detected a serious 
public health problem yet. Problems such as colds and dysentery were to be 
expected when large numbers of people accustomed to indoor living are suddenly 
forced to live outdoors, cooking on makeshift stoves, without refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, campers were getting assistance from the Red Cross or from 
those in neighboring tents. Arturo Vasquez, who moved his family into Sepulveda 
Recreation Center on Monday, was caring for his 10-year-old son, Ruben, who 
suffers from cerebral palsy. Ruben is in a wheelchair and must be fed baby 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Vasquez was handling his son's feeding and care himself inside the 
Red Cross center established in one of the park's buildings. Meanwhile, other 
campers were assisting by collecting wood so that all five members of the 
Vasquez family -- including Arturo's wife and two other sons -- could cook and 
keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we are here together, and we are safe," said Arturo, an unemployed 
painter. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of such campers became an escalating concern as forecasters began 
predicting rain by Sunday. If that rain does come -- and especially if it is 
heavy -- health problems could dramatically worsen and it could become even 
more difficult to care for the displaced thousands, officials feared. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, rain might prompt some stubborn campers to finally seek 
indoor shelter, one park official noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't have covering, they're going to get drenched, and (we might 
have) mud problems," said spokesman Al Goldfarb of the city's Recreation and 
Parks Department. "We don't want people in the parks if it should become a 
heavy rain." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling past disasters, he said, "We get floods so quickly in the Sepulveda 
basin." 
</P>
<P>
 Many campers seemed acutely aware of the foreboding weather reports. With a 
tiny black and white television propped on a log, a worried Pablo Martinez was 
looking for the latest forecast at the Sepulveda Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the rains come, and the soil gets soaked, then another earthquake will 
really bring problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early afternoon, a Los Angeles Police Department squad car moved among 
the campers, broadcasting the news that housing vouchers were being given away 
by an agency in Sylmar. Buses were being lined up to transport about 50 campers 
at a time to a center where they could fill out the necessary applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying families could receive up to a year of rent-free housing, a 
policewoman repeated to the throngs. 
</P>
<P>
 But many were skeptical. "We're going to end up in the street, and then we're 
going to be at the mercy of the gangs," Augustine Estevez, 42, said after the 
announcement. "So why bother?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many were staying put in camp -- or going far from the trembling metropolis. 
That was what Estevez planned to do. He would avoid the streets, the gangs and 
the earthquakes by packing up and leaving for Puebla, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Maria, had been in the United States five years, living in 
Panorama City. But they were loading boxes, about a dozen of them, into their 
white Ford van. Along with another family, they were heading for the airport 
and their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors circulated that campers would be forcibly removed from the parks. Mario 
Godoy, 30, a Guatemalan who had been camping out since Monday night, was 
troubled for the future, saying his house was wrecked and he had nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're going to let us stay here long," he said, as if 
determined to resist until there was no other choice. "They have to get rid of 
us sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials acknowledged that such camps are not easily removed. 
After the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake, similar encampments lasted three weeks 
or longer, said Raymond Allen, assistant general manager of the city's 
personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
 "A whole lot of people in the parks aren't aware of nearby shelters," Allen 
said, conceding that fear of building collapses and other worries contribute to 
the camp problem. In many cases, displaced residents want to remain near their 
homes and belongings rather than go to faraway shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, officials were pleasantly surprised by the civilized behavior 
at most of the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how well everybody is getting along," said Jackie Tatum, Los 
Angeles' director of Recreation and Parks. "This has been very hard on all 
these people, but they're pulling together." 
</P>

SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAY TOLL IS WORSE THAN FEARED; EDUCATION: WIDESPREAD DAMAGE IS 
FOUND. DISTRICT LEADERS WORRY ABOUT GETTING FAIR SHARE OF REBUILDING AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 At Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, five-foot-wide holes have been 
punched in the Administration Building, and debris and glass coat the floors. 
At nearby Danube Avenue Elementary, gas lines have snapped, the boiler is 
broken and four bungalows have been knocked off their foundations. At 
Northridge's Nobel Middle School, the student bus shelter could topple at any 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now seeing losses we weren't even aware of on Monday or Tuesday," said 
a frazzled Danube Principal Rosemary Enzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary Los Angeles Unified School District officials face an increasingly 
daunting task of rebuilding after the devastating 6.6 magnitude Northridge 
earthquake. Each day it has become clearer that the district lacks the cash and 
the work force to tackle the enormous repairs, which officials estimate could 
cost up to $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't even go out and bid for repairs because we don't have the money," 
school board President Leticia Quezada said as all campuses remained closed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada and others are fearful that school reconstruction may get short shrift 
when it comes to distributing emergency federal and state aid. Los Angeles 
school officials could not even get on the agenda to speak during President 
Clinton's two-hour meeting with local elected officials Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a general concern that there will be a competition between the cities, 
county, state and school districts," said school board member Jeff Horton, who 
represents parts of the San Fernando Valley and the Westside. "Everyone is 
saying their needs are greater." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Caltrans -- which can dispatch an army of engineers and workers to 
immediately begin shoring up roadways -- the nation's second-largest school 
district has dismally few workers to clean up and repair up to 300 
quake-battered schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson will announce today the plans for next week. Officials said 
they are leaning toward opening safe schools to teachers and staff on Monday 
and bringing students back on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a system with thousands of buildings scattered over 700 square miles, only 
six staff engineers are available to conduct inspections, a force that was 
bolstered by mid-week with another 20 from state and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A maintenance staff of less than 1,000 has been working virtually around the 
clock at the district's 640 campuses doing light repairs -- rewiring, cleanup, 
tearing down damaged ceiling tiles, boarding windows. But despite their work 
inside creaking buildings, officials said maintenance workers are stretched 
thin and not equipped to carry out reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're basically doing triage," said school board member Mark Slavkin, who 
toured hard-hit campuses Thursday. "When there's an immediate threat, they're 
dealing with it. But they're not able to stick around and do the other repairs 
that are needed. Every school I've seen needs major repair work." 
</P>
<P>
 The fates of about 124 schools in the Valley and a few on the Westside were 
still being decided late Thursday, and detailed, classroom-by-classroom 
assessments were being assembled. Doug Brown, chief of district facilities, 
estimates that it could take up to two years to complete reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 But some school board members say the schools -- particularly in the Valley -- 
will not be ready to open Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even begin to imagine that we will have schools ready -- certainly at 
the west end of the Valley -- by Monday," said board member Julie Korenstein, 
who represents most of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein said she has proposed that district staff examine closed school 
sites in the Valley that might be able to house some students. About a dozen 
schools were closed due to declining enrollments in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the district is to keep as many students as possible at their 
regular schools to avoid disrupting their schedules.  
</P>
<P>
 With a myriad of health and safety laws that regulate schools, reopening even 
a portion of a lightly damaged campus involves a tangle of logistics and 
community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an onion. You keep pulling back the layers and you find another 
humongous problem," Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 61-year-old Canoga Park Elementary -- one of the oldest in the district -- 
wide cracks riddle the walls of the main building, and classrooms have been 
flooded by broken pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Lawrence Middle School, the cafeteria is unusable because a large vent 
near the boiler has fallen. With scores of children dependent on schools as 
their primary source of food, the cafeteria woes at Lawrence and other schools 
have the district's massive staff of food service workers scrambling to find 
other facilities for producing cold meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the textbooks and other materials that have been lost, mainly 
because of water damage. Many books and materials were already in short supply 
because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 While district officials attempted to keep pace with the problems, some 
criticized school authorities for not moving fast enough and grumbled that safe 
schools should have opened this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're able to inspect freeways and the (Los Angeles Roman Catholic) 
Archdiocese can inspect churches, why does the entire school system need to be 
shut down for so long?" said Eli Brent, the president of the Associated 
Administrators of Los Angeles, which represents most of the district's middle 
managers and principals.  
</P>
<P>
 But Brown and other top administrators staunchly defend their decision to keep 
all campuses closed, saying it is far better to err on the side of safety when 
it comes to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most complex planning operation is taking place in a sprawling 
warehouse-like structure on Soto Street in East Los Angeles, home to the 
largest school bus operation in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Every school day 80,000 students board 1,000 buses to travel to school along 
2,200 different routes throughout the region. About 30,000 children are bused 
into, out of and around the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams of transportation workers have been huddled around maps and routes all 
week, determining the safest roads for children. 
</P>
<P>
 When Valley schools do begin to open, thousands of inner-city children whose 
neighborhood campuses are overcrowded will have to endure longer commutes to 
safe classrooms. Pickup times will remain the same.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, district officials said, parents of bused students will not be 
able to transfer their children to schools close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wish we could have that option, but it's a question of lack of space in 
the inner city, which is why those kids are being transported to begin with -- 
with or without earthquakes," said Deputy Supt. Ruben Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials cautioned that the web of plans being spun is delicate, 
imperfect and prone to unravel with the jolt of an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a chance we'll get these schools ready and in perfect shape by 
Monday," said United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein. "Everyone 
will be needed. I think students are going to be put into operation." Making a 
School Safe Again 
</P>
<P>
 Three Los Angeles school district safety inspectors examined Robert Frost 
Middle School in Granada Hills for earthquake damage. They looked for hazards 
to school personnel and students. One inspector expects the school to open 
Monday after initial repairs. The school got off relatively easy, as other 
schools may be closed for at least a month. This inspection is typical of what 
is happening at other area schools. 
</P>
<P>
 SCRUTINIZING THE FACILITIES 
</P>
<P>
 1. Exterior of building is checked for major cracks, signs of instability. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Interiors are inspected for cracks and loose or exposed wiring. The boiler 
room is checked for breakage is smoke ducts and gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Beams are examined to determine roof stability. 
</P>
<P>
 REPAIRING THE DAMAGE 
</P>
<P>
 Columns: Some have slipped, creating danger of roof collapse over entrance 
into classroom. The fix: Take roof off over entrance and replace in 5-8 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Pipes: In one classroom, overhead sprinkler system pipes have burst, causing 
water damage. The fix: Replace leaking pipes, clean up water and replace 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracks: They have formed in middle of floor and outside of one building near 
base. Indicates that building has sunk half an inch. Doors: As a result of 
sinking, frame is warped, so door does not open easily. The fix: Patch cracks 
and shore up sunken end as necessary, to be determined by structural engineer. 
Wiring and plumbing could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Lights: Fluorescent fixtures have fallen down, exposing broken wires, causing 
electrocution danger. The fix: Replace broken lights and reconnect wires. 
</P>
<P>
 Beams: Thick bolts holding beams supporting walkway roofs were strained. The 
fix: Replace bolts with longer ones to add stability.

<P>
 Thousands of desperate earthquake victims overwhelmed 11 newly opened federal 
disaster relief centers Thursday and, as harried officials tried unsuccessfully 
to cope with the crush, the scope of damage broadened and the death toll hit 
51. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds started lining up 15 hours early, and chaos reigned as people angrily 
jockeyed for position when the doors opened. Gov. Pete Wilson and two federal 
Cabinet officials, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, and Housing and 
Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, found themselves in the middle 
of a surging crowd at the Winnetka Community Center, near the epicenter of 
Monday's devastating 6.6 magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who waited illustrated the indiscriminate nature of the quake's fury: 
Young and old, rich and poor, people of all races stood together looking for 
hope. "This is not the last resort. This is the only resort," said Katriena 
McCord of Chatsworth, among the first in line when the center opened. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Federal Emergency Management Agency center in Southwest Los Angeles, 
where 1,000 people sought aid, a man grabbed appointment slips from a police 
officer and walked down the line, trying to sell them for $5 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilson, in Los Angeles for the fourth straight day, offered an array of 
state help, including enough National Guard tents to house 6,000 of the newly 
homeless. One disheveled woman grabbed the governor at the Winnetka center and 
began to weep. 
</P>
<P>
 * City officials reported progress in their efforts to find shelter for the 
displaced. The number of people sleeping in parks dropped to about 14,000, from 
a high of about 20,000, while the number sleeping in 29 American Red Cross 
shelters from the Santa Clarita Valley to the Westside grew to more than 6,000. 
Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Wilks said more shelters could be opened to meet 
the demand. "If it rains, we will have to open more shelters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bilingual and multi-agency teams organized by the city of Los Angeles, using 
lessons learned six years ago after the Whittier quake, fanned out Thursday 
evening to try to persuade those still living under the stars to move inside as 
the weather turned cold and the prospect of rain loomed for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two people, including the son of Dodgers announcer Vin Scully, died in the 
crash of a helicopter doing a post-quake pipeline inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 * The injury toll also mounted: In a bizarre accident, an apparently confused 
motorist was hurt when he drove his van off the end of a quake-abbreviated 
overpass on the Golden State Freeway and plunged 30 feet onto a bulldozer. In 
Aftermath, Fresh Tragedy 
</P>
<P>
 Michael A. Scully, 33, of Bakersfield, and a 52-year-old helicopter pilot died 
about 9:25 a.m. after their craft apparently hit power lines during an 
inspection of an oil pipeline in the Tejon Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the cause of the 
crash, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Carol Long said. The 
pipeline was operated by an Arco subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco spokesman Albert Greenstein said the line had been shut down after the 
quake as a precautionary measure after a nearby line ruptured. That line 
spilled about 3,000 barrels of crude oil into the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 Scully was an employee of Four Corners Pipe Line Co., a subsidiary of Arco. 
The pilot, whose name was not available, worked for Kern Helicopters  
</P>
<P>
 "It's terribly tragic," Greenstein said. "It was just the routine process of 
the start-up of a pipeline. Mike was somebody a lot of us knew. He was a very 
popular guy here." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, as 30 demolition workers watched, a van drove off the end of 
the quake-damaged ramp that once connected the Antelope Valley and Golden State 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the jaws of life, Los Angeles County firefighters managed to extricate 
Antoine Moufarrege, 43, of Sun Valley, from the wreckage. He said, almost 
disbelieving, "I'm alive, I'm alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria E. Castro, who was working at a catering truck nearby, said Moufarrege 
had dropped her off under the sheared ramp to provide lunch for the workers. 
"He must've gotten lost," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moufarrege was reported to be in fair condition with minor injuries at Henry 
Mayo Newhall Hospital in Santa Clarita. Anger Among Help-Seekers 
</P>
<P>
 In a disaster center in the Crenshaw district, an area where quake damage had 
generated little attention, 1,000 people showed up looking for help, catching 
relief workers unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hurting here too," said Lula Washington, whose West Adams Boulevard 
contemporary dance theater is located in a building where bricks fell and the 
roof shifted.  
</P>
<P>
 Among those trying to calm residents was City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas 
who, despite a police bullhorn, had his comments drowned out by angry talk from 
those who had little patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, they (FEMA officials) were not adequately prepared for the crush," 
Ridley-Thomas said. "They underestimated the extent of the crisis in this part 
of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Andrews, head of the state Office of Emergency Services, said up to 
six more centers would be set up by Saturday. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama 
City) said federal officials have promised to fly 100 more FEMA workers here by 
today. Berman said that, despite warnings by area lawmakers to President 
Clinton and other top aides, the federal officials had seriously underestimated 
how many people would come forward seeking assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the centers, aid applicants could get housing vouchers, state 
grants of up to $12,800 to help defray expenses and assistance in dealing with 
private insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a few hundred were able to get appointments with aid agencies. Even 
the lucky ones will have to wait as long as a week for vouchers and checks to 
arrive in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands more were given appointments for another day or told to call a 
toll-free information number -- (800) 462-9029.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's so much easier to call that number than to spend your whole day standing 
in lines," said Francis Alvarez, manager of the disaster assistance center at 
the Sylmar Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman said 600 operators are handling 3,000 calls an hour to the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoving and shouting marked the opening of the Santa Monica Disaster 
Application Center as 400 applicants vied for position. Several people rushed 
the doors, cutting ahead of others who had waited up to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go to the back of the line!" yelled Jody Johnson, who was fifth in line. 
Police tried to restore order but the crush continued. Two men shouted at one 
another and almost came to blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had come to the center for financial help. She had been displaced from 
a third-floor apartment in the Sea Castle building that rented for $450 a 
month, utilities included, and had been staying in a hotel, spending credit 
card cash advances. But money was running out fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the clothes on my back," she said. "I have my cat. My boyfriend and I 
have a community toothbrush. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been calling about apartments," she said, "but they want a $3,000 
finders fee. Who has that kind of money?" 
</P>
<P>
 The wait continued late into the evening for many. At 9 p.m., people were 
still standing in line at the Winnetka center -- not for service but for 
appointments to come back later to begin the paperwork process. Even by 
mid-afternoon, appointments had been booked into the first week in February. 
Aftershocks Continue  
</P>
<P>
 More than three days after the quake, aftershocks continued to rock the area 
and officials worried about the danger posed by seriously damaged structures. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Clarita Valley sewage treatment plant suffered $1 million in damage in 
Monday's quake and, as a result, is releasing waste that does not meet 
standards into the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 County sanitation officials, however, say they are surprised and relieved that 
the damage is not far worse. No major sewage spills occurred and inspections so 
far have turned up no broken pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The treatment plant is operating at 70% of where we want it to be. It's 
limping along," said Joe Haworth, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts.  
</P>
<P>
 Police and National Guard troops barricaded a six-story building in Reseda 
that lost a concrete wall during the quake, while St. Johns Hospital and Health 
Center in Santa Monica and UCLA's Royce Hall were evacuated because of 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The office building in the 18000 block of Sherman Way was barricaded because 
of fears that the structure would collapse. Traffic was blocked on the 
westbound side of Sherman Way and all along Lindley Avenue adjacent to the 
precarious structure. Although authorities believe it to be salvageable, they 
said it posed a danger to passing motorists.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they expect traffic snarls to continue on nearby streets as 
motorists try to get a glimpse of the damaged buildings across the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's plenty of looky-loos trying to see buildings all over, and as 
building inspectors continue to inspect and condemn some buildings, there will 
be a lot of that," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Gene Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it is up to the owner of a quake-damaged building to decide 
what to do about repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he just walks away, we'll cite him. It's an imminent hazard to the 
street," said Bob Harder, manager of the Van Nuys office of Los Angeles' 
Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Los Angeles, tenants of a collapsing office building at Olympic 
Boulevard and Barrington Avenue tried to get in to remove their files, but 
police and National Guard troops turned them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be major devastation," said Kathleen Stambaugh, a periodontist 
who operates a dental practice in the building with her husband, Roger. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of evacuations accelerated Thursday in Santa Monica, where fire 
officials estimated damage at $88 million; with 400 buildings yet to be 
inspected, the damage toll could rise to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Johns, the biggest hospital in Santa Monica, was closed and all 191 
patients were moved out Thursday afternoon as a state inspection found it to be 
unsafe. Hospital spokesman Gary Miereanu said the facility might be closed for 
as long as three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene at the 501-bed hospital was harried but under control during the 
evacuation. Some staffers stacked surgical equipment, furniture and files in 
the grassy courtyard as others called taxis for patients being sent home early. 
A line of ambulances whisked sicker patients to hospitals as far away as Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Still in hospital pajamas, Norman Jonas, 68, waited in a wheelchair, clutching 
a foam pad he will sleep on at home. Jonas had expected to be in the hospital 
for four or five more days for treatment of blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're making a wise decision," Jonas said. "Obviously if the 
building isn't safe, I'm happy to be going home." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica officials said 500 to 600 people have been removed from city 
hospitals and nursing homes since Monday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center evacuated a damaged wing Monday, turning 
an auditorium into a makeshift emergency room and temporarily halting 
non-emergency admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, residents were forced to evacuate one of the city's largest 
apartment buildings, a 16-story tower overlooking Palisades Park. The 117-unit 
Champagne Towers was judged unsafe Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, students scheduled for classes at Royce Hall were relocated to other 
buildings. Royce Hall is one of the four original buildings on the Westwood 
campus and a structure that has been featured as a college backdrop in dozens 
of movies.  
</P>
<P>
 Allen Solomon, UCLA's assistant vice chancellor for facilities management, 
said the quake and its aftershocks had taken a toll on the building's 
distinctive twin towers, prompting officials to cordon off the structure to 
keep students and others away in case the spires tumbled. The Breaking Point 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of community that had been gallantly displayed since catastrophe 
struck began to deteriorate as nerves frayed and tempers gave way.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the bonding, sense of purpose and the need to do things together 
evaporates" a few days after such major disasters, said Bruce Steinberg, a 
Tarzana psychiatrist whose office was deluged with requests by patients seeking 
to reschedule missed appointments.  
</P>
<P>
 People longed for the routine: safe homes, mail delivery, stores that are open 
and nearby, regular garbage pickup and intact freeways. And in much of the 
quake-damaged area, residents got at least some of that back. Most electricity 
and gas has been restored, regular mail deliveries are to resume today and 
garbage collection is only a day or so behind. 
</P>
<P>
 But at some crowded emergency shelters, people chafed under the irritations of 
rambunctious kids, fitful sleep and, in at least one case, a brief scare about 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more people come, the more frustrating it gets," said musician Derek 
Brown, hunkered down in the Hollywood High School gym among 400 disaster 
refugees. Rows of cots covered most of the gym floor, and sound carried easily. 
Brown's wife, Kathy, said with young children "crying all night, people are not 
getting much sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Castillo, a mother of four driven from a damaged apartment, said tensions 
have been escalating over small things -- name calling, people taking too much 
bottled water, middle-of-the-night arguments that wake up neighbors. "You 
cannot get too close to some people or they get mad," she said, adding that an 
undercurrent of stress has settled in between some Latinos and African 
Americans. "We are divided." 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Santilla, 23, whose apartment ceiling collapsed in the quake, was 
scolded by others when he asked a boy who had been "running all day" to please 
play outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding troubles, an 11-year-old boy broke out with chicken pox, and a Red 
Cross volunteer nurse discovered that one man who spent a day at the shelter 
was being treated for tuberculosis. The nurses at the shelter said they did not 
think either illness was at a stage that posed a risk of infection for others. 
And both the child and the man had been isolated from the general shelter 
population, they said.  
</P>
<P>
 But anxiety ruled the day at that shelter and elsewhere as people tried to get 
on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita resident John Demos, who works in Burbank, spent two hours 
(instead of 45 minutes) driving to work Thursday morning via the car-jammed 
Sierra Highway. In the afternoon, when he decided to go by the FEMA disaster 
relief center in Sylmar to ask about a loan to repair his quake-damaged home, 
he got lost. The address the agency had publicized, he said, turned out to be 
"in the middle of the Tujunga Wash." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when he did arrive, "there's 10,000 people out there waiting in line." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said, "it just all got to me today." Government Steps In 
</P>
<P>
 In an all-out drive to get quake victims to seek shelter before this weekend's 
expected rains, city officials assembled eight "reassurance teams," which 
fanned out into eight Valley parks Thursday night. The six-person teams -- 
consisting of building inspectors, psychologists and housing department 
officials, among others -- began to collect the addresses of park dwellers so 
their buildings will get priority for inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a 30% to 40% chance of light showers in the Los Angeles area late 
Saturday and early Sunday, said Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData 
Inc. He said skies are expected to clear by late Sunday, with no additional 
threat of rain until the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams will also refer park residents to Red Cross shelters, federal 
assistance centers and help them find new apartments if their homes are no 
longer habitable. Teams used lists compiled by the Building and Safety 
Department of inspected locations to check if an individual's home had been 
inspected and was considered safe. If it was, they urged them to return home.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't get them back into their homes, we have to get them into the 
shelters before the rains begin," said Raymond Allen, assistant general manager 
of the city's Personnel Department. He conceded that it might take three weeks 
or more to persuade people to leave the parks for shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Wilson hinted that he might favor a proposal for a $2-billion bond issue 
to raise money for rebuilding. He said it is still too soon to decide whether 
the state will need more money, or will be able to get by on aid from the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he prefers a bond issue to a tax increase if more money is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when Californians are attempting to recover from a recession, we 
don't need additional tax burdens," Wilson told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also unveiled two programs to help businesses rebuild more 
quickly and issued an emergency order easing labor laws to make it easier for 
companies to place workers on flexible work schedules.

AIDE TO ASPIN REPORTEDLY TOPS LIST FOR PENTAGON JOB; CABINET: WILLIAM PERRY HAS 
STRONG DEFENSE CREDENTIALS. HE IS SEEN AS HIGHLY REGARDED BY CLINTON AND 
CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Defense Secretary William J. Perry, a former Stanford University 
engineering professor who is highly regarded at the Pentagon, has emerged as 
the leading candidate to succeed Les Aspin as defense secretary, White House 
sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although President Clinton probably won't disclose his choice for the 
nomination until next week, sources said that he appears to be settling on 
Perry because of his background in defense affairs, his popularity in the 
Administration and in Congress and the likelihood that he would win quick 
Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five other possible candidates have been under consideration, but a 
senior White House official familiar with the selection process singled out 
Perry and said: "He is almost universally well-regarded, especially within the 
Administration, and the President knows him and thinks highly of him. He knows 
of Perry's reputation on the Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination of Perry, the official said, also is supported by Aspin -- who 
is highly respected in defense circles despite the fact that he resigned under 
pressure last month after being widely criticized for not guiding the Pentagon 
with a steady hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a strong candidate who would easily win confirmation as Clinton begins 
the second year of his presidency has been a top White House priority since 
Bobby Ray Inman secretly signaled two weeks ago that he would withdraw as the 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman first told the White House of his intentions Jan. 6, but the 
Administration -- not wanting the news to detract from a trip Clinton was 
embarking on two days later to Europe and Russia -- kept it a secret until 
after the President returned. Clinton accepted Inman's withdrawal Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 His withdrawal baffled top White House officials and sent them scrambling to 
find another popular choice. While the President traveled overseas, White House 
Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty and Anthony Lake, the national security 
adviser, began considering possible candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, was sounded out 
for the post but declined it, sources said. He is believed to be backing Perry, 
whom he strongly supported for deputy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, White House officials have considered Perry a strong 
contender. The other possible candidates either lack his solid defense 
credentials or for other reasons are not considered as well-positioned for the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates include two top Administration officials -- Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and CIA Director R. James Woolsey. But a White House 
official said both probably are considered to be too valuable in their current 
posts for either to take over the defense job. 
</P>
<P>
 Two chief executives of defense firms -- Norman Augustine of the Martin 
Marietta Corp. and Bernard Schwartz of Loral Corp. -- also have been under 
consideration. But neither has a military background. Still another possible 
candidate whom the White House considered was former Sen. Warren B. Rudman 
(R-N. H.), a Washington lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, 66, was undersecretary of defense for research and engineering during 
the Jimmy Carter Administration and was known for his ability to overcome 
bureaucratic resistance and cut through red tape. He was a key figure in 
promoting an obscure technology labeled "Stealth," which developed into the 
now-celebrated Stealth bomber and Stealth fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to the Pentagon, he has had a strong hand in running the 
department and has been in charge of a determined effort to reform the way the 
Pentagon spends its $45.5-billion procurement budget. 
</P>
<P>
 After assuming the deputy defense secretary's post, he said: "When I leave 
this job in four years, I'd like to look back and say I've left some legacy. 
Acquisition reform is high on the list of things I'm trying to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Associates describe Perry as having enormous drive and discipline, but say he 
is soft-spoken and courteous and gets his way as an executive through 
persuasion, not confrontation. Vitalij Garber, a Perry deputy in the Carter 
era, was once quoted by Business Week as saying that Perry "has a knack for 
putting himself psychologically in the place of government and industry people 
and synthesizing an approach both can accept." 
</P>
<P>
 A mathematical scientist, Perry first served the Defense Department as a 
technical consultant in Washington during 1966-67. Before becoming 
undersecretary of defense in 1977, he co-founded ESL Inc., a Silicon Valley 
defense electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the Pentagon, he served as managing director of Hambrecht & 
Quist Inc., a San Francisco venture-capital firm. He later chaired a consulting 
firm whose clients included big military contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1985-93, he was chairman of Technology Strategies & Alliances of Menlo 
Park, Calif. From 1989 to 1993, he was professor and co-director of the 
prestigious Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford, 
where he worked with former Soviet defense officials on defense conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 He served two years in the Army, beginning in 1946.

FEAR OF SEPARATION GRIPS PARENTS, CHILDREN ALIKE; EMOTIONS: SOME WON'T GO TO 
WORK; OTHERS SLEEP TOGETHER. BUT SUCH ANXIETY IS HEALTHY, A THERAPIST SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Elizabeth Park stands so close to her youngest daughter, Candice, that their 
slight shadows mingle in the flickering light of a campfire at the tent 
community in Petit Park. Across the street, her quake-damaged Granada Hills 
apartment is laced with cracks, perhaps to be condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 Park and her two daughters sleep in their car, a Pontiac 6000 that for many 
would be too close for comfort. But when they are together in that small steel 
bedroom, at least Elizabeth Park can hear her girls breathe, feel them toss and 
turn, and know they are all right. 
</P>
<P>
 She will not leave the girls to go to work and risks losing her job as a 
liquor store clerk by week's end -- a sacrifice to her new fear of separation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Southern California trembles slowly back to normal, one aftershock at a 
time, separation anxiety is an unexpected obstacle. Fearful parents bring their 
children to their jobs. Teen-agers ask to sleep with mom and dad again. 
Families camp near their ravaged homes -- just to be close by, just to keep 
them safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Others won't leave their pets or their damaged possessions. It's a temporary 
paralysis with a simple mantra: I cannot leave my family, my house, my pets, my 
things. Not now. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried so much," Park said. "But what can I do? I worry about my 
children. I need to go to my job. I need living-life money. But I cannot leave 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 At Granada Hills High School, where the Red Cross has set up a shelter, 
Marietta Sova puffs on her cigarette and cries. She has just dropped her cat, 
10-year-old Cricket, off at the West Valley Animal Shelter. Both are homeless 
since Monday's 6.6 earthquake smashed Sova's Northridge apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The vet, Sova says with a sniffle, said her cat would die if it continued to 
live in a cage in her car -- close enough for reassurance on these long, 
sleepless nights, but hot and cramped during the days. Cricket, Sova said, "is 
like a child to me." When she dropped the animal off at the shelter, "I felt 
like I was taking a child to an adoptive home." 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being irrational, flashes of fear at even the thought of separation 
are very realistic and often healthy, said Margaret Taylor, a licensed clinical 
social worker who has been counseling the quake-rattled at the Pasadena Mental 
Health Center this week.

 Although separation anxiety blossoms differently in everyone, what it amounts 
to is a belief that a loved one or cherished object is not safe alone, Taylor 
said. The reverse is true, too: "If (my loved ones) are not with me, I am not 
safe either. . . . Some people get a little overexcited about these things, but 
they're not crazy. They're realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman Taylor counseled after the quake insisted on sleeping in her car 
with her dog in her driveway, where she could be warm yet keep an eye on her 
damaged Pasadena home. "They were safe, and so was her house," Taylor said. 
"The bottom line is that it's not OK to be separated." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Gates, a Palmdale elementary school teacher, knows this firsthand. 
She was spending the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend with her mother and 
stepfather in Northridge when the quake hit Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 She finally went home Wednesday evening after scooping up piles of broken 
glass, making runs for groceries and water, walking two frightened Dobermans, 
and answering phone call after phone call from concerned friends and family 
members. She stayed, she said, for all three of them: herself, her mother and 
her stepfather, who spent much of the week searching for a lifesaving kidney 
dialysis center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to leave," she said of her family and the ravaged ranch-style 
house where she grew up. "I wanted to stay another day. I would rather be there 
and suffer than not know if something happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, you want to be out of there, be where it's safer and you 
have water and heat. I almost feel guilty leaving. What if they need me?" 
</P>
<P>
 And what if she needed them? After all, she had not visited her apartment 
since the quake and had no inkling of its condition. She feared the crippled 
freeways, the long, slow drive and the threatening overpasses. And the return 
to work Thursday was rough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid to turn the news off for fear something happens," Gates said. "I'm 
still emotionally drained." 
</P>
<P>
 The more vulnerable the loved one, the greater -- and more reasonable -- the 
fear of separation, Taylor said. That fit Andrea Thompson Adam and her 
firstborn, Andrew, a 4-month-old child she left with a sitter for the first 
time just 10 days ago to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 She has not left the baby's side since 4:31 a.m. Monday and hates to even 
leave the boy alone with his father. Thompson Adam works at the Hollywood-based 
Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, an office damaged badly 
enough to keep the staff away this week. Working from home "is like a prayer 
answered," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, however, the commission has a retreat for its staff and board of 
directors, an event that Thompson Adam cannot miss -- and dreads. To get 
through that daylong separation, she plans to position her husband and son at a 
co-worker's house across the street from USC, where the retreat is taking 
place. It's not a perfect solution, but it's the closest she can be to Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not been out of my sight since the quake," Thompson Adam said. "We're 
camped out in the living room because of the mirrors in the bedroom. John and I 
are on the sofa, and Drew's in his basket next to me. He's laying here on my 
shoulder right now, snoring his little heart out." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Lilli Friedland, a psychologist with the Los Angeles County Psychological 
Assn.'s Disaster Response Team, calls separation anxiety "the bottom line fear 
that people have, simply because your fear is that the ground is going to open 
up and swallow you or your parents or your family." 
</P>
<P>
 In Noeline Spaulding-Brown's case, the family is large and sprawling, if 
unconventional, and the concern is warranted. Spaulding-Brown spent her 73rd 
birthday Wednesday evacuating the residents of four apartment buildings she 
manages at the hard-hit corner of Devonshire Street and Hayvenhurst Avenue in 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 As darkness fell and her family of tenants hustled belongings out of the 
crumbling buildings, she grabbed each person, demanding a hug and a forwarding 
address. Embraces were the simple part, addresses more complicated because many 
were living outside or in carports. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her tenants, for example, were staying under the carport in some 
apartments behind the International House of Pancakes a few blocks away. 
Spaulding-Brown knew the location of each improvised situation. It was her way 
of holding on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't change what happened, but I can make it less painful," she said. 
"When home is refurbished, they want to come home. For now, no one leaves here 
without a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Westside Jewish Community Center's nursery school, parents are the 
clingy ones, not the children, said Frankie Meppen, director of early childhood 
education. They stay a little longer when dropping off their children, they 
call a lot, they want to know that the center is well supplied. 
</P>
<P>
 Although attendance was more or less back to normal Thursday, on Wednesday, 
its first day open after the quake, only about 75% of the children showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Meppen deals with separation fears at home, too, where her fiercely 
independent 13-year-old son insists on sleeping on her bedroom floor. He is 
"very, very frightened," she said, and "doesn't want to be in a room without 
us."

BUILDING SURVEY WIDENS SCOPE OF DAMAGE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the tally of earthquake destruction mounted, officials on Thursday 
released preliminary reports showing that thousands of residences were left 
uninhabitable and the scope of major damage had spread far beyond the 
Northridge epicenter to South-Central Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds of the unsafe buildings in Los Angeles were homes, and the 
rest of the damage was spread among an array of structures, from churches and 
schools to auto repair shops and nightclubs, according to a report by the Los 
Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 No type of building seemed to be spared. Brick apartments constructed in the 
1920s on Hollywood Boulevard were battered. So was a 10-year-old Ventura 
Boulevard high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, based on inspections of only 1,239 buildings, found that 526 
residential and commercial buildings in Los Angeles are uninhabitable and that 
damage totaled $213 million. Nearly 2,500 housing units were declared unsafe 
for occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the numbers will surely grow because they had tallied only the 
first third of more than 3,500 inspection reports and were continuing to assess 
damage across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are finding much more damage then we thought there was," said city 
building and safety official Karl Deppe, from his office Downtown. "We just 
didn't think there would be this much damage on this side of the mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread and capricious nature of the destruction was coming into 
sharper focus in reports from a variety of communities. Inspectors in Santa 
Monica found that more than half of the 800 buildings they checked had to be 
vacated at least temporarily, while officials in nearby Malibu inspected just 
eight buildings and declared all "safe and sound." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city survey broke the uninhabitable buildings into two 
categories. Nearly 300 were marked with yellow tags, meaning owners and tenants 
were allowed to re-enter to retrieve possessions. Another 228 structures were 
marked with red tags indicating that they were too dangerous for even brief 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood-frame structures accounted for more than half of those declared unsafe, 
according to a review by Richard O'Reilly, Times director of computer analysis, 
and analyst Sandra Poindexter. But no type of structure appeared to be immune 
from problems, including the most modern concrete-and-steel buildings, which 
accounted for 7% of the buildings declared unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartments and single-family dwellings of all types of construction 
represented 63% of the unsafe buildings in the initial survey. Restaurants and 
retail stores accounted for 15%. Warehouses, parking garages and offices each 
accounted for roughly 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials said the initial assessment provided a measure of good 
news -- indications that a 13-year-old program to strengthen masonry buildings 
is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 8,100 unreinforced masonry buildings in which the city ordered 
improvements in 1981, all but about 400 have been retrofitted. The work usually 
consists of attaching floors to foundations and ceilings to outer walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the attachments are designed merely to save lives, not to to 
prevent damage, by preventing floors from pancaking on top of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 89 brick buildings initially inspected by the city, the survey showed 
that 54 were ordered vacated by building officials -- a high ratio. But 
retrofitting prevented the buildings from collapsing and causing deaths, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any that collapsed in the entire city. It worked," said 
Deppe, assistant chief of the Building and Safety Department's emergency 
operations. "My feeling is that we could have lost quite a few people. (The 
retrofitting) saved a lot of lives." 
</P>
<P>
 A second wave of more detailed surveys will be required for inspectors to 
determine which buildings must be demolished and which can be repaired. The 
required improvements will range from buttressing with steel beams to the 
reinstallation of staircases to provide safe exits. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the first round of statistics came mostly from inspections in 
the San Fernando Valley and from the most obviously damaged structures in the 
rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 With residents and business people still flooding hot lines with requests for 
inspections, the officials hoped to beef up their crew of 540 inspectors with 
another 100 today.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those inspectors are expected to be sent to neighborhoods outside the 
San Fernando Valley, to areas where some City Council members were complaining 
that their constituents are not receiving enough attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden said his mid-Los Angeles district suffered tremendous 
damage that is not reflected in the report, which shows that 22 structures have 
been vacated, out of about 70 inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that single-family dwellings, duplexes, apartment buildings, churches 
and commercial structures were hit hard and that people are begging him to send 
more inspectors. "There are a lot of problems in this area that people don't 
even begin to know about yet," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters concurred. "The extent of the problem is far greater 
in the Valley, but we do have serious problems in all of South-Central," said 
Walters, whose district extends south from Downtown Los Angeles. "It needs to 
be recognized this is a problem for the total city."  
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that Councilman Hal Bernson's district, which includes 
Northridge, had more buildings declared unsafe, 40, than any other ward in the 
city. There were 32 in Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg's Hollywood-centered 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty buildings were declared unsafe in City Councilman John Ferraro's 
district, which extends from Hancock Park to North Hollywood, and 34 were 
declared unsafe in Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's district, which extends from 
the Westside to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said the damage in her district is much more severe than reflected by 
the building department's report. Most buildings that were not vacated are 
nevertheless uninhabitable, she said, because of plumbing or electrical 
failures or fallen debris.  
</P>
<P>
 "These places may not be in imminent danger of collapsing during another 
jolt," she said, "but people have moved out because they are unlivable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rawn Nelson, president-elect of the Structural Engineers Assn. of 
California: "It's not just one type of building that was damaged. They're 
finding damage in all types of buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "I've seen less serious damage in buildings engineered and 
built per newer codes." 
</P>
<P>
 As building inspectors in the Valley continued their assessments Thursday, new 
pockets of damage continued to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Brizi, a building inspector in the Valley, said he and a partner posted 
red "do not enter" stickers on an entire block of apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had in excess of 300 units," Brizi said. "That's 300 families. That's 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, one apartment complex after another was devastated by what 
appeared to be common problems. In at least five buildings along Victory 
Boulevard near Reseda Boulevard, the front units appeared damaged, with sagging 
patios, weakened walls and cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 But units behind the swimming pools were decimated. The apartments were built 
above carports, and when the thin concrete stilts collapsed, so did the 
apartments. Many residents, even though they could not retrieve their 
belongings, said they were glad just to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the supports for the garage fell, everything went over," said Rae 
Talenfeld, 77, who lived in a front unit on Victory Boulevard with her sisters 
Sara and Netta, ages 88 and 83. "The building just separated." 
</P>
<P>
 On West Adams Boulevard, miles from the epicenter, more red tags could be seen 
every few blocks on buildings stretching from Fairfax Avenue to Crenshaw 
Boulevard. Among the churches declared unsafe were Messiah Baptist Church and 
Southern Missionary Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to tear it down and rebuild," said Pastor Joe Gates of Southern 
Missionary. "It's a total loss." 
</P>
<P>
 An apartment building at Figueroa Street near Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard 
also had been deemed uninhabitable. It was cracked along its walls and 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents had strung sheets from a fence to make a crude tent in the 
parking lot. Underneath, a bed lay on the asphalt, and a mother fed her baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was all we had," said a 44-year-old woman, motioning to the two-story 
brick apartment. "Maybe we should go to a park." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Boulevard was hard hit, especially between Western and Normandie 
avenues. Along that stretch, about 15 sites were deemed unsafe. All were brick 
and two to four stories tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessments of damage around the rest of the Southland were beginning to come 
into sharper focus Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Santa Monica, a little more than half of the 800 buildings inspected were 
ordered vacated at least for the time being, with limited entry to some to 
permit recovery of possessions. "The majority of the damaged buildings have had 
unreinforced masonry, and we've had lots of problems with chimneys," said Fred 
Harris, a spokesman for Santa Monica's Emergency Operations Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owners must initiate their own engineering reports and repairs before 
their buildings can be approved for habitation. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Culver City, about 30 buildings were closed, almost all of them 
unreinforced brick structures. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Ventura County, 6,000 residences were reported damaged and 1,000 of those 
were homes declared at least temporarily unsafe. About 250 businesses were at 
least temporarily closed by moderate to extensive damage. Eighty percent of 
those were in the Simi Valley area. Three schools, including Simi Valley High 
School, may not be reopened. And the roof of the Thousand Oaks main library 
fell in. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the city of San Fernando, 22% of the housing stock for 23,500 residents 
was deemed uninhabitable. The northeast Valley city reported 63 buildings 
destroyed and 835 damaged, a loss exceeding $31 million, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county courthouse in the city may be closed for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Burbank, city officials had declared 16 buildings uninhabitable. They 
allowed residents of 21 buildings limited entry to obtain possessions. More 
than half of the 1,000 requests for inspections had been completed by Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Calabasas, inspectors declared 12 units uninhabitable after checking 
about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Pasadena, 40 businesses were damaged and two apartment buildings on 
Marengo Avenue were shut down. Total damage was placed at $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Redondo Beach, officials reported that the King Harbor Marina suffered 
about $4 million in damage. Buildings Declared Unsafe 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city officials have inspected more than 3,500 buildings since 
Monday's earthquake. The results of more than 1,200 inspections have been 
tabulated and they show that nearly two-thirds of the buildings declared unsafe 
are residential structures. 03,16,08,09 Type Number Percent Houses 58 22% 
Apartment 86 33% Duplex 7 3% Condo 14 5% School 1 0.4% Church 1 0.4% 
Manufacturing 3 1% Office 17 7% Retail Store 36 14% Restaurant 3 1% Parking 
Garage 13 5% Warehouse 13 5% Other 4 3%

COLUMN ONE; A SWEET AND NUTTY CRAZE HITS RUSSIA; THE SNICKERS BAR HAS INSPIRED 
CHILDREN, PUNDITS, EVEN THIEVES. OTHERS DECRY IT AS A WESTERN INVADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Heard the latest knee-slapper making the rounds of Russian elementary schools? 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What happened to Snickers when it came to Russia? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It lost weight. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the joke, you have to know the advertising slogan that has saturated 
the Russian airwaves -- that Snickers is covered with "a fat, fat layer of 
chocolate." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids know the commercial. So do adults. They know the jingle so well that 
quips about fat, fat layers of chocolate have started to turn up in would-be 
witty headlines and even in speeches in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snickers is becoming a kind of a symbol," said Dmitri Ivliyev, consumer 
affairs reporter for the daily Izvestia. "Not only of Western life -- I'd call 
it a symbol of our new times." 
</P>
<P>
 In the new Russia that President Clinton visited last week, some of the 
Western firms that slavered over potential Soviet sales as the Iron Curtain 
came down are beginning to make major inroads across the Russian expanse -- and 
into the Russian consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Snickers and its Mars Inc. cousins -- Bounty, Mars bars, Twix and Milky Way -- 
appear to have penetrated the Russian market far beyond any other American 
consumer product. Hawked by the most extensive advertising campaign here since 
the demise of Communist propaganda, they are turning up across the heartland, 
from the Altai region in the southeast to Bryansk in the west. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freezer wagons selling ice-cream versions of the Mars treats stand on corner 
after corner along St. Petersburg's central Nevsky Prospekt. Moscow schools in 
wealthier districts are strewn with the wrappers on days the cafeteria stocks 
the candies. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand is so high that chocolate thieves recently hijacked a Mars truck in 
central Moscow, grabbing tons of Mars and Snickers bars worth about $39,000. 
Teen-agers have been overheard computing prices in Snickers -- "That would cost 
three Snickers!" -- and Russians near the Chinese border reportedly consider 
the ability to buy two Snickers bars per week a sign that a person has solidly 
reached the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 The candy bars have become so widespread that cultural critic Artemy Troitsky 
named them in his 1993 list of the top 10 Russian "objects of the year" for the 
daily Moscow Times, among other booming new trendy objects including handguns, 
currency exchange booths, casinos and telephones equipped so callers can be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old Soviet Union, Russians could buy a taste of America mainly through 
Marlboro cigarettes, which were sold only for dollars and so highly valued that 
a pack could be used as virtual currency with cabbies and officials. Marlboro 
remains strong, as do Levi's jeans and Wrigley's gum. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the humble Snickers bar, selling at 50 cents each or so, that has 
conquered the new Russians, who cast off communism in hopes of living like 
Americans. They may not be able yet to afford the big cars and houses, but the 
junk food, at least, is already within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Snickers success story is even more surprising here, considering that 
Russians already have plenty to tempt their notorious sweet tooth. They consume 
all kinds of more traditional cakes, ice cream and candies, including their own 
snack bars, which tend to feature darker, more bitter chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Mars has found a distinctly American way to create a voracious appetite 
for its products through the kind of powerful, mercilessly repetitive 
advertising that has been pervasive in the United States for decades and is 
only now beginning here. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in 1992 with billboards that irritated many consumers by advertising 
Mars products even before they were available in most stores, the campaign 
moved on last year to a television blitz the likes of which Russians had never 
seen. One Russian retail trade specialist said it seemed to him that not one 
television hour went by without a Mars commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Svetlana Bubnova, saleswoman at a kiosk on Moscow's central Garden Ring Road, 
said she recently watched her 4-year-old daughter recite the lines of a Mars 
bars ad in sync with the television and thought with despair: "This is 
incredible! If this continues, children will soon know Mars and Snickers better 
than the multiplication table." 
</P>
<P>
 With its near-universal name recognition, Snickers is also becoming a 
lightning rod for Russian sentiment focused against the West, against the 
difficulties of the new era. The hard-line Moskovskaya Pravda recently ran an 
editorial lambasting President Boris N. Yeltsin's reformers for claiming to 
care about the country while in fact, it said, they were more concerned about 
taking foreign trips and building themselves luxurious houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They flooded the country with chocolate bars," it said as an example of 
ill-considered ideas, "and now when you ask schoolchildren to name the planets, 
they quickly answer, 'Mars. Snickers. . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another newspaper ran a cartoon that depicted a poster proclaiming Snickers 
the best antidote to hunger -- with an emaciated man clearly dead of starvation 
lying beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
 This anti-Western sentiment may contribute to Mars officials' total refusal to 
talk about the company's Russian success and controversy. Masterfoods, the Mars 
arm in Russia, refused to comment even briefly on how it has managed to spread 
its distribution network across Russia's breadth where many others have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said it was too "commercially sensitive" and he would be 
"disappointed" if Masterfoods were even mentioned in this story. The Mars 
headquarters in McLean, Va., was equally closemouthed, in keeping with its 
reputation for extreme secrecy. Industry sources have long joked that the 
nearby Langley, Va.-based CIA houses only the second-most secretive bunch in 
northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian expert on retail trade said that Mars might be especially reluctant 
to talk, in part, because it was badly burned by a phony story in the Russian 
media about a poisoned Snickers bar that allegedly killed a little girl in 
Voronezh, about 300 miles south of Moscow. The story ran in a local newspaper 
and was picked up by national television, he said, in what he believed to be a 
sign that the battle for the Russian chocolate market was growing so nasty that 
a competitor tried to sabotage Snickers to cut its early lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Mars products' distribution was indeed impressive, he said, the 
company was apparently plagued by difficulties in getting candy bars out of 
Moscow, where they are warehoused. He said dealers who are supposed to truck 
the candy to the provinces often fail to fulfill their agreements and try to 
sell the bars in the city instead, at higher profit, keeping the Moscow market 
glutted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, he added, the Mars dealer network is strong -- but the real key to 
the candy's success has been the nonstop advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at the Moscow branch of the New York-based firm of D'Arcy Masius 
Benton & Bowles said they are convinced their Mars campaign is the stuff of 
advertising legend. "It will be an interesting case history, what happened 
here," said Sergey Koptev, DMB&B's managing director in Moscow. "In 1990, it 
happened that one country, relatively developed, was a clean sheet of paper 
(for advertisers). What to do? How to approach it?" 
</P>
<P>
 DMB&B developed a theory that Russian consumers, who had lived so long among 
widespread shortages that they had no experience choosing among products, could 
not be approached like their Western counterparts. Koptev said DMB&B decided it 
would seek to make its brands "a golden standard" and virtually create a market 
where only the potential existed before. 
</P>
<P>
 It helped, Koptev said, that Mars made a serious commitment to the Russian 
market and was willing to invest heavily to help advertising reach "critical 
mass." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He would not disclose how much Mars spent on advertising but did say that 
DMB&B, which has two major clients in Moscow, Mars and Procter & Gamble, did 
$18 million in billing for its services in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Snickers' success has been helped along by general economic changes in Russia. 
The dollar exchange rate held stable for months before rising sharply in recent 
days, while ruble inflation continued to climb, so imported goods bought for 
dollars have become much cheaper in comparison to Russian goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the average Russian salary is less than $100 a month, Koptev insisted 
that candy bars are not out-of-reach luxuries for the average family. "People 
can afford it -- even if they don't have a median income but an average income. 
Maybe not every day but twice a week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Snickers will remain affordable depends in large part on whether the 
Russian government decides to heed the calls from domestic industry to impose 
tariffs on imported consumer goods. The government has been considering such 
tariffs, particularly on cars, but not out of the anti-Western sentiment that 
Snickers and its ilk sometimes provoke. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the tariffs would stem from what Russian economic guru Yegor T. 
Gaidar sees as a great success -- that imported goods have become so cheap they 
are creating competition for monopolistic Russian producers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tariff hike looked likely in December, the Rossiyskaya Gazeta 
newspaper reported on it with a headline reading, "Goodby Snickers and Your 
Fat, Fat Layer of Chocolate." Word was that food, which was duty-free, would be 
subject to a 20% tariff. 
</P>
<P>
 The tariff increase now appears unlikely. The newspaper Commersant noted that 
"despite the strong pressure of factory lobbyists, it seems the government 
decided to consider the interests of all consumers . . . more important." 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of tariffs may have receded, but Snickers faces a bigger menace -- 
from competitors, including Cadbury and Nestle. They are already hustling their 
own sweets on the airwaves and in the stores, taking advantage of the market 
Mars created. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, no Cadbury or Nestle jokes yet, while the Mars repertoire 
is turning into a rich collection. 
</P>
<P>
 There is even an off-color joke, hinging on the slogan that the coconut-filled 
Bounty bar offers "heavenly enjoyment." 
</P>
<P>
 In a locker-room mood, the macho Snickers bar asks the Mars bar whether it has 
sampled the lovely Bounty's favors. When Mars says no, Snickers shakes its head 
and, using the oft-repeated catch phrase, says: "Too bad. She's heavenly 
enjoyment."

SEARING IMAGES DEPICT PIECES OF A DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 These are the sights and sounds of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 A father begging rescue workers, please, not to leave his son's body under the 
rubble of his hillside house in Sherman Oaks overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3-year-old girl sitting in a rusty wagon in her pajamas, surveying the 
still-smoking ruin of her family's mobile home in Sylmar. "I don't have a bed 
anymore, mom," she said over the dull roar of an open gas main flaming up like 
a Roman candle just yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Samaritans rescuing neighbors trapped in apartment buildings that had 
folded in on themselves like popup books. "I'm not going down," said a woman, 
terrified of heights, as she surveyed her precarious escape from her balcony 
down a flimsy ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes you are," ordered a man she had never seen before. And she did. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very human to try to distill cataclysmic events into a single, searing, 
defining image. But this earthquake was so fickle in its choice of victims, and 
so erratic in its effects, that no image could possibly hold all the tragedy 
and death and generosity and goodness and greed and cravenness. 
</P>
<P>
 Each event tells its own story, on its own terms. All you can do is let the 
images parade through the mind, one after another, reciting their tales like 
characters in some medieval play. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing you think as you drive around is that when the world is over 
they will probably board it up with plywood and drape the whole thing in police 
tape. At least judging by the prevalence of the stuff after the quake. Plywood 
is the great equalizer. It covers the shattered tinted windows of upscale 
athletic clubs in Chatsworth as well as little carnicerias in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was so much tape strewn across intersections that the Valley looked 
like a Christo exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting it from everyone we can," said Officer Chris Mandala of the 
Devonshire Police Division, outside the Northridge Fashion Center, where a 
parking lot and part of the Bullock's store had collapsed. So far, unlike 
bottled water in some areas, supplies were holding up. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall itself was completely closed off by tape. Peering into the Bullock's 
store, which now reads "BULLO" because the last letters have broken away, 
reminds one of Illustrated Man models. The veins and nerves and lymph nodes of 
the building were exposed. Racks of women's clothes were perched perilously 
over an open canyon of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the mall itself, closed off and empty, you find the marquees of many of 
the stores still lighted. There is the loud hum of electricity in the air, 
futilely pumping life into the place, like a heart that continues to beat even 
after the head has been severed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Gary's Tux Shop, one of the well-dressed mannequins lies on its back while 
the others stand alertly and oblivious, resembling party-goers determined to 
ignore the bad manners of a guest passed out on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Another common sight was toppled brick walls, lying in little heaps as if a 
child playing with his Legos had suddenly lost patience and knocked them over. 
Secrets were exposed to the passing world. An untrimmed bush, a dirty pool 
behind a $400,000 house. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people seemed to need to give this quake a personality. A man in a bar on 
Ventura Boulevard said it was like having someone come in and rearrange your 
furniture. "I want it over here," the man said, gesturing. "No, I think it 
would be better over on this side of the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man said it was odd the way the quake unearthed portions of his past 
life, like an urban archeologist. After the shaking stopped, he found the stub 
of a 1986 opening day Dodgers game ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did I save this?" he asked himself absently. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying the damage, you are left with the feeling that the quake had done 
far more than was visible to the eye. Also left in the ruins was our shared 
belief in the complexity and well-ordered nature of modern cities. 
Environmental impact reports, City Council meetings, seismic studies -- all the 
fine bureaucratic machinery that was supposed to tame the natural world was 
ground into dust. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at once a scary thing, like a child hearing its parents fight for the 
first time, and a liberating thing. That's why some people crept along the 
roads at 10 miles an hour, not because the ground would open up and swallow 
them, but because the natural world had swallowed all this accumulated human 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, suddenly freed of the constraints of society, drove like maniacs 
weaving in and out of traffic, celebrating the Apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
 You can drive for blocks past neatly laid out neighborhoods under spreading 
ash trees, and the lulling sense of the familiar and safe begins to creep in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you come upon an entire block of apartment buildings that look like some 
large animal had raked their facades. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Owens, the manager of the Woodman Apartments, leaned against her car and 
tried to warn people against going inside the building, the front of which was 
cracked in scores of places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying it's not a good idea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get our stuff," a man with blond hair persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, similar scenes were being acted out at the Jeri Manor, 
where the lobby appeared to have collapsed, and the Oakwood Apartments, where a 
long line of residents were being ushered into the building one at a time to 
retrieve whatever they could carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Many events that would have topped the news on any other day went unremarked 
in this disaster. Roundly ignored, three wood-frame houses and a four-unit 
apartment building in the 200 block of Hager Street in San Fernando went up in 
smoke. The fire made homeless 11 members, and several generations, of the 
Garcia family. Things would have been worse but for the efforts of a volunteer 
fire crew led by Joseph Ortiz, who wore his fire hat at a cocky angle and tried 
to protect his broken arm by hiding his hand inside his long-sleeved shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming upon the rare open store, you are tempted to wander in, even if it's 
just a Tae Kwon Do studio where a woman is screaming in the dark on the phone. 
Shops are, in some ways, the most comforting places we have, because they are 
where we go to conduct the business of life. So we wander in, buying nothing, 
just to feel the sense of purpose that comes with shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the hours passed, there were the slowly returning sounds and smells 
of normalcy. The smell of baked goods as a Coco's restaurant prepares to 
reopen. And the surest sound of recovery, when the radio news begins to sound 
repetitive and your fingers twitch to turn the station for the first time in 24 
hours. Field reporters begin doing stories about the outdoor barbecues in the 
parks, where thousands gathered to wait out the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you having?" one reporter asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ribs and carne asada ," replies a man with a Spanish accent. 
</P>
<P>
 " Carne asada ?" the reporter replies, making sure he got this critical 
information down right. 
</P>
<P>
 The camps begin to take on the look of permanency. Portable toilets are 
brought in and stacks of firewood appear near the makeshift home sites. This 
disaster will not be over soon. At a park on Winnetka Avenue, young men in 
sleeveless T-shirts chose up teams for a soccer game, using a Lakers cap and an 
old jacket to mark off the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Gonzalez, 33, the manager of the heavily damaged Keswick Apartments, had 
brought most of her tenants with her to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything left," she said. She and some of the other women washed 
up after lunch Tuesday while a handful of children wandered around. Everybody 
was pitching in, but that wasn't enough for Barbara Cowart, 47, sprawled on a 
blanket under the afternoon sun. She had moved to Los Angeles three months ago 
from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between the shaking and the desert, I'll take the desert," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was thinking of going back, but she was already adapting to the West Coast 
lifestyle. "If I stay here I'm going to buy plastic plates and cups. If they 
fall out at least they bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the Valley at night was to rediscover dark. On Monday night, much of 
the Valley was Mojave Desert dark, hall closet dark, the river Styx dark. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday night, many street lights and traffic lights were on and Ventura 
Boulevard began to return to life. The Insomnia Cafe in Sherman Oaks was open 
for business, serving double cappuccinos at $2.50 each out on the sidewalk, 
while a generator roared in the background. They had already served 14 National 
Guardsmen and several firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the oasis in the middle of the desert," said Scott Gatewood, who was 
serving up the drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Hyun, a photographer on the television show "Sea Quest," wandered in with 
a flashlight strapped to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city should keep the electricity off all the time," he said. "The 
city became a village." 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Walker, a guitarist in an outfit called Girl Jesus, which she described 
as a Middle Eastern, industrial, gothic, thrash band, struck up her guitar on 
the sidewalk and did a pained version of "Knockin' On Heaven's Door," doing her 
best to out-sing the noise of the generator. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing that lust hardly ever takes a holiday, just about the only other 
businesses braving the night were those catering to sexual tastes. At Le Sex 
Shoppe in Studio City, Gerardo Cuevas, 21, sat watching television alone. 
"Usually by this time I have five videos sold," he said. It was about 10 p.m. 
"I haven't sold one." 
</P>
<P>
 As the 11 p.m. curfew approached, upscale quake refugees straggled into 
Residuals, a bar in Studio City that attracts film industry people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Phil down there," said Mark Robertson, a man in a billed cap who tended 
bar, "he just couldn't take any more tremors. He was feeling tremors that 
weren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 So Phil was throwing darts, focusing as intently on the small cork board as on 
a law school exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Residuals was running out of supplies, but nobody was ready to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good seeing you," said a man, walking in. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, it's good seeing anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew came and went, but nobody left. Mark kept serving drinks, Phil kept 
throwing darts. From time to time, Robertson announced it was last call. Nobody 
paid him the slightest attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're making it hard on me," he sighed. "I can understand them not wanting 
to go home tonight."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; MANY FIND COMFORT AND HELP ON-LINE; AFTERMATH: 
FOR SOME, COMPUTER SERVICES HAVE BEEN AN ESSENTIAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. 
FORAYS INTO CYBERSPACE PROVIDE SOLACE AND EVEN ELICIT ASSISTANCE IN TRACKING 
DOWN RELATIVES.

<P>
 In the grim aftermath of the earthquake, computer-linked bulletin boards 
hummed furiously as people searched for lost relatives ("Can't reach Mom and 
Dad -- Please help!!") or just solace ("Does anybody there feel as frightened 
as me?") 
</P>
<P>
 Using their home computers, many of those who still had electric power sought 
ways to negotiate quake-damaged roads. ("Need suggestions for the best way to 
get from Santa Monica to L.A. County Hospital.") They swapped pet stories. 
("The night before the earthquake my cat began to tear around the house in a 
mad frenzy.") And they shared feelings of isolation. ("This is the only link I 
have to civilization right now.") 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the ground stopped shaking, residents began sending electronic 
notes, trying to determine the hardest-hit areas. Later, people who live 
outside Southern California sent desperate pleas for help in contacting 
relatives. As the week progressed, bulletin-board users continued to flood the 
system with messages. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic communication still has not abated. 
</P>
<P>
 Many now inquire about the best shortcuts through the San Fernando Valley. 
Others sign on following aftershocks and guess the magnitude. And some just 
while away the tense hours at home until a repairman from the building 
department or gas company arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer services provided assistance during the Malibu fire and other recent 
disasters. But the electronic response to the Northridge earthquake, computer 
experts say, was unprecedented for its speed, scope and sustained interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After freeways buckled, buildings collapsed and phones were cut off, personal 
computers linked to on-line message centers often were the only means of 
obtaining critical information. Prodigy and CompuServe, the nation's largest 
computer-linked systems, set up earthquake bulletin boards and immediately were 
deluged with messages. Prodigy's users logged on more than 800,000 times during 
the 24 hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, many Los Angeles residents have grown weary of swapping earthquake 
yarns. But not the techno-junkies. All week, the earthquake has been the No. 1 
topic of discussion. Several dozen people who signed on to America Online 
recently engaged in an electronic discussion group: 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you just feel an aftershock?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Just felt it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aftershocks are the worst. Even trucks on the street make my nerves rattle." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know it's a good one when the car alarms go off!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to feel depressed. My own emotional aftershock. Anybody else?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Take care of yourself. The emotional stuff is treacherous." 
</P>
<P>
 "How is the 405?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Slow on the northbound side approaching the Devonshire closure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clear through the Sepulveda Pass." 
</P>
<P>
 "I live in Santa Cruz and went through this in '89. I feel for you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in San Jose. This brings back lots of memories. . . . Hang in there!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Gary Bogumil awoke in Atlanta Monday morning and learned about the 
severity of the earthquake, he immediately tried to contact a close friend, 
Richard Mann, who had recently moved to the West San Fernando Valley. He tried 
Mann's home telephone. He tried Mann's work phone. He tried his fax machine. He 
tried his beeper. He tried his cellular phone. With each call that would not go 
through, he grew more concerned. He talked to Mann's mother in Atlanta, who was 
frantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Bogumil recalled that a friend had access to the Prodigy bulletin 
board. They sent out this message, and Mann's name and phone number: "Have 
friend in West Hills. Have not heard a word from him. . . . Mother would like 
to know if OK. Help!"  
</P>
<P>
 While long-distance phone calls into the area were blocked, a neighbor of Mann 
who saw the message was able to reach him. She messaged back on the bulletin 
board that Mann had "lost some china and crystal, but he is OK." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all so worried," said Bogumil, "because all we could see on TV were 
burning buildings, flooding and injured people. We didn't know if he was hurt, 
if he was homeless. . . . We didn't know anything. And the not knowing is 
what's so worrisome." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who share their fears and their secrets over the computer know 
little about the people who respond to them. Scattered throughout the country, 
they are connected only by the need to talk -- electronically. They hunker down 
over their computer screens and study the disembodied messages from people 
known only by handles such as "I Play Chess" and "Tea Pot Dome." 
</P>
<P>
 All day and night Monday and Tuesday frantic people around the country sent 
messages asking for help in locating family members. And all day and night, 
good Samaritans who live near the quake area signed on to the earthquake 
bulletin boards and went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for a person by the name of Danie. . . . I'm very worried about 
her," one man inquired Monday afternoon via Prodigy. "I can't call." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight minutes later this message, from some unidentified corner of cyberspace, 
flashed: "I called Danie for you. She answered the phone. She says thanks for 
being concerned. She is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone out here who is willing to check on my aunt, who lives in Northridge 
and is 80 years old and has heart trouble?" inquired one woman from Whittier on 
Wednesday afternoon. "Please contact me." 
</P>
<P>
 One minute later a woman messaged the niece: "She has a lot of damage to her 
home and furnishings. But she is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bulletin boards have proven to be sturdy electronic communicators. While 
long-distance phone lines were tied up in the aftermath of the quake, the 
bulletin boards -- connected by private lines leased by the computer networks 
-- stayed open. Prodigy, which has 2 million subscribers in the United States, 
offered free use of the earthquake message board for the week.  
</P>
<P>
 The state Office of Emergency Services used Internet, a huge network of 
computer systems, to distribute information about power outages, fires, road 
closures and fatalities. Internet was developed by the Department of Defense 
during the 1970s, state officials say, and an earthquake will not interrupt its 
service. The system was designed to withstand a nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
 While many logged on to computer networks to get earthquake information, a 
number of people, afraid to leave their damaged houses, just wanted some human 
contact -- even if it was only through a computer screen. Headings people 
listed above their messages included: "A Sleepless Night," "Abandon California" 
and "Help Me!!!" 
</P>
<P>
 The latter wrote: "All my uncle's collectibles broke. He's been crying all 
day." Within a few hours she had received 29 replies ranging from cheery words 
of encouragement to religious proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
 One person compiled a list of earthquake jokes ("What did one earthquake say 
to the other? It's not my fault.") and another placed the heading "Sex" above 
his earthquake musings.  
</P>
<P>
 For others, the earthquake sparked philosophical debates and precipitated 
epiphanies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am from Ohio and I would like to say that after seeing all the trouble in 
California, I have re-evaluated what is important to me," one man messaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say that again," a woman responded. "My husband and I have been 
working hard to . . . 'compete' with other members of our family. But after all 
of this I think we will just be happy for what we have and the love we can 
share with our families." Electronic Dialogue 
</P>
<P>
 Right after the quake, residents sent notes by computer trying to find out 
where the hardest-hit areas were. Later, relatives outside Southern California 
sent desperate pleas for help in contacting relatives. Even after phone service 
and power were restored, quake-related messages continued to flood the system. 
</P>
<P>
 TUESDAY 
</P>
<P>
 * "If anyone in the quake area needs to get a message to friends or relatives 
in Germany, please E-mail and I will pass along. I was from Arleta in the 
Valley; I feel with you. I still remember the 1971 earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Anyone out there who is willing to check on someone, my aunt lives in 
Northridge and is 80 years old with heart trouble; please contact me. . . . 
Just mention Julieann to her. Thanks!" 
</P>
<P>
 WEDNESDAY 
</P>
<P>
 * "Well, I'm going to attempt it, tomorrow, so what I'd like to know is: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the 101 the only (best) route in from the north? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the traffic terrible? Should I travel at night? 
</P>
<P>
 Feel free to E-mail me or post."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; AREA NEWSPAPERS IMPROVISING TO TO REACH 
READERS; MEDIA: POWER OUTAGES AND DAMAGED BUILDINGS LEAD TO MAKESHIFT 
ARRANGEMENTS. LOSS OF PHONE SERVICE AFFECTS ADVERTISING REVENUES. 
</P>

<P>
 Rocked along with the region that depends on them for information, Los 
Angeles-area newspapers made sometimes herculean efforts this week to reach 
their readers. 
</P>
<P>
 And although media outlets lost revenue when the temblors cut off their phone 
lines and temporarily shut down advertising offices, none expects much 
long-term financial harm from the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit was the Daily News, headquartered in Woodland Hills. Spokeswoman 
Lynne T. Jewell said operations were basically back to normal Thursday, but the 
paper's news and advertising staffs were forced earlier in the week to set up a 
succession of temporary offices at other newspapers around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tumbling ceiling tiles, lighting fixtures and file cabinets -- as well as a 
prolonged power outage at the newspaper's Valencia printing plant -- shunted 
some workers into a trailer next to the main office. Newsroom and advertising 
employees moved back into the building Thursday, Jewell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess when you first looked at it, it was in pretty bad shape," Jewell 
said. But a structural inspection found that "it just wasn't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, the Tuesday edition of the Daily News was printed at the 
Daily Breeze plant in Torrance. On Tuesday night, the newspaper printed at the 
San Gabriel Valley Tribune in West Covina.

 Initially, the paper -- published by Tower Media Inc., a company owned by 
sports and media tycoon Jack Kent Cooke -- was given temporary newsroom space 
at the Outlook in Santa Monica. For two days, editorial and advertising 
personnel were given desks and phones at the Pasadena Star-News. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's edition, editor Bob Burdick described the difficulties of 
getting the paper out, saying he wept when Tuesday's edition arrived at his 
Glendale home.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether it was in relief, or in sorrow for those who suffered in 
the earthquake, or simply exhaustion," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 North of the epicenter, officials of the Signal in Santa Clarita said the 
paper lost "many thousands of dollars" in advertising because of power outages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a very traumatic time for us here, but we've come through," 
General Manager William Fleet said Thursday. Though the paper's plant was 
relatively unharmed, he said, damage to computers and other equipment forced it 
to print Monday night at the Antelope Valley Press in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Laura Morgan said the only structural damage at Los Angeles Times 
facilities may be at the offices and printing plant in Chatsworth. "But there's 
no safety hazard there," Morgan said. Workers began returning to the buildings 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While power and phones were out in the Times' Downtown offices until early 
afternoon Monday, editorial staffers communicated by two-way radio part of the 
day. Helicopters were used to ferry editorial materials to The Times' Orange 
County facilities, where the computers never shut down, and to the Los Angeles 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times printed an extra 100,000 copies of Tuesday's editions, which 
included a special section of emergency information. Free copies were available 
at Red Cross centers. 
</P>
<P>
 La Opinion -- a Spanish-language newspaper owned in part by Times Mirror, 
publisher of The Times -- offered free copies containing emergency information 
at Red Cross and Salvation Army centers. The paper's truck drivers distributed 
papers in parks where quake victims -- many of them Spanish-speaking -- have 
been camping out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our interest was to get information to the people who needed it, so that our 
community was taken care of," said Editor Monica Lozano, whose family's company 
publishes the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Other newspapers had to make special efforts to reach their readers in 
hard-hit parts of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korea Times, a six-day-a-week Korean-language newspaper with 60,000 
subscribers, set up an emergency relief center at a branch office in Van Nuys. 
Beginning Tuesday morning, the newspaper, headquartered in Koreatown, offered 
residents free drinking water, food and copies of the newspaper, which 
contained emergency information. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Diau, editor of the Chinese Daily News in Monterey Park, said a 
leaking roof water tank damaged classified advertising offices and a stock 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Most advertisers in the newspaper -- which publishes 100,000 copies daily -- 
are in Orange County, which was largely unharmed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the San Fernando Valley, which has a growing Chinese-speaking 
population, many groceries and bookstores that normally sell the paper were 
closed. On Wednesday, the paper sent a special circulation team into the area 
to find new outlets in convenience stores and ethnic-oriented shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to convince these stores to put our newspapers in there for 
the convenience of the Chinese reader," Diau said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the black-oriented Los Angeles Sentinel, based in the Crenshaw district, 
Publisher Kenneth R. Thomas said the newspaper had been "very fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday's power outages shut the weekly's advertising offices on what 
normally is their busiest day. Though the newspaper made its Tuesday deadline, 
classified advertising was especially hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "That caused us a lot of grief," Thomas said, estimating the losses at $5,000 
to $10,000.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; AFTERSHOCK DATA POINTS TO THRUST FAULT; 
SEISMOLOGY: OAK RIDGE AND FREW SYSTEMS ARE NOT TO BLAME, SCIENTISTS SAY. A RIFT 
AT A SHALLOW ANGLE IS NEW CULPRIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Based on new data about the alignment and depth of the aftershocks, Caltech 
seismologists have changed their view about what fault was responsible for the 
deadly Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Ridge fault system and the steeply dipping Frew Fault were not 
involved, the scientists said Thursday. They now believe they have traced the 
source of the magnitude 6.6 temblor to a thrust fault dipping southerly at a 
more shallow angle, which they hope to name soon, when the analysis is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists said the significance of precisely identifying the culprit fault is 
that it may help them to calculate future seismic hazards as they continue to 
digest the mountains of information that have accumulated at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologist Egill Hauksson said it became evident that the Frew Fault could 
not have been involved after the depth and position of hundreds of aftershocks 
was determined through study of the seismographic evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershocks simply have been occurring at too shallow an angle, he said. 
"The Frew Fault dips at 60 degrees, and the angle (of the aftershocks) was only 
30 degrees," he explained. "No aftershocks have been following the path of the 
Frew Fault." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Oak Ridge system, Hauksson said flatly, "It is way off in Ventura 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson said a number of his colleagues had agreed with him, and it turned 
out that this included Kerry Sieh, the Caltech seismologist who on Monday and 
Tuesday had been the most outspoken exponent of the Oak Ridge system and the 
Frew Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Sieh said the aftershock data had made it clear that those two faults probably 
were not involved, especially considering that the Frew had not been active for 
500,000 years. The newly suspected fault, he added, appears to have been 
recently active. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists, including Hauksson, at least partially attributed the change 
of mind about the faults involved to the considerable pressure on the experts 
to provide the public with fast answers. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and 
Caltech give as frequent as hourly briefings at the Caltech earthquake media 
center.  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mori, director of the Geological Survey's Pasadena field office, said 
Thursday night: "There's pressure, but on the other hand I think we should say 
what we want to say and not be intimidated or controlled by the question. To 
say that we don't know is fine, and I say that often. It's part of our 
responsibility when we do give out information to give the right information." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most frequent briefers, Caltech's Kate Hutton, often says plainly 
that she doesn't know. Another, Lucile M. Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey, 
sometimes gives a tentative answer, usually with an emphasis that it is "very 
preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Sieh had cautioned Tuesday that the early hypothesis, which has now been 
abandoned, had to be confirmed later. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson said Thursday that the aftershock pattern indicates the primary 
underground rupture zone of the Northridge earthquake trends about 10 degrees 
east of due north from the epicenter near the intersection of Roscoe and Reseda 
boulevards in Northridge. The fault runs under Granada Hills, the Santa Susana 
Mountains and very likely extends into the Newhall Pass and the Santa Clarita 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists flying over the region have noticed signs of surface disturbance, 
such as ground cracking, in the Newhall Pass and the southern edge of the Santa 
Clarita Valley, he said. Such deformations -- like the half-mile surface 
disturbance discovered Tuesday by Caltech seismologist James Dolan near Balboa 
Avenue and the Simi Valley Freeway -- is a strong indication of the likely path 
of the main rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is a series of pipeline ruptures in the north San Fernando Valley, 
Hauksson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, some scientists have reported seeing surface evidence of 
a secondary rupture zone in the Simi Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The existence of a secondary rupture demonstrates that the main quake caused 
movement on a nearby fault, scientists said. Often, zones of heavy quake damage 
follow the alignment of such secondary ruptures, as seemed to occur in this 
case. This was also the case in the 1992 Landers quake south and east of Yucca 
Valley, a few miles from the primary rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson said there may be more than one such zone in the Northridge quake, 
but he listed no further specific examples. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's magnitude 5 aftershocks, the intensity of aftershocks tailed 
off Thursday, but Hauksson reported there was a minor continuing migration of 
aftershocks toward Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 He had reported five miles of migration toward the northwest on Wednesday. 
Thursday, he said the migration was "six or seven miles." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a concern," he said, "but as time progresses you expect the aftershock 
zone to expand. We will have to follow this some more to assess its 
significance." 
</P>
<P>
 Migration of Joshua Tree aftershocks two years ago may have triggered the 
larger Landers quake. But that phenomenon, and the abnormally large number of 
aftershocks following the Joshua Tree quake took several weeks to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson said the probability of another magnitude 5 aftershock of the 
Northridge quake was 1 in 3 for the coming week and there may be seven in the 
next 12 months.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; A TRIAL BY FIRE; ESCAPING FROM TRUCK ENGULFED 
BY GAS BLAST, BURNED MAN FINISHES JOURNEY 
</P>

<P>
 Jimmy Menzi's pickup truck stalled at Balboa Boulevard and Rinaldi Street in 
Granada Hills Monday morning, shortly after the earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi did what anyone would do -- he turned the ignition key. He did not know 
that under the street a gas line had ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
 The now infamous intersection exploded into a fireball, engulfing the truck 
and starting fires that burned several nearby residences to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, Menzi not only escaped the truck, he managed to walk for miles 
before receiving medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering from second-degree burns over much of his body and speaking from his 
hospital bed, Menzi, 30, recounted a tale that is extraordinary even by the 
standards of earthquake country. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with Menzi loading his dogs, Shep and Bimbo, into his truck at his 
Simi Valley home, just after the earthquake struck. He wanted to check on his 
mother, who lives in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my dogs because they were scared," he said, lying in his hospital bed 
with burn cream covering much of his face and bandages on his chest. Hospital 
officials asked that the interview be no more than 10 minutes because his 
doctor had ordered him to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi drove east on the Simi Valley Freeway, exiting at Balboa in hopes of 
reaching the Golden State Freeway. Chaos reigned on the street, with several 
cars stalled by the water that was spouting up from two broken water mains and 
rushing down Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 Directly behind Menzi, also in a pickup truck, was Ryan Paskwietz of 
Northridge was trying to get to his mother's house in Tujunga. Paskwietz, who 
witnessed the fireball, said that just north of Rinaldi, Menzi's truck was 
making its way around the second water spout when it stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started it," Paskwietz said in a telephone interview, "and it made the 
kind of grind you get when you start a car that already started. I guess that 
sparked the flame." 
</P>
<P>
 Paskwietz said that Menzi's truck immediately turned orange as it was bathed 
in flames. Menzi remembers little of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there was a big explosion," Menzi said. "The windshield was engulfed in 
flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi's flannel shirt caught fire and he bolted out the door. He ran to the 
water spout, dousing the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there hadn't been water in the street," Menzi said, "I don't know what I 
would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Paskwietz said he put his head down on the passenger seat and blindly drove in 
reverse to get away. Later he saw that his windshield wipers, plastic grill, 
turn signals and other parts on his truck had melted. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he looked up, Menzi was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi said the fire was too hot for him to go back to his truck and he figured 
his dogs were dead. He remembers thinking that he still had to complete his 
original plan: He had to get to his mother in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked up Balboa and turned onto San Fernando Road. A man who saw him from 
a house gave him a new shirt to wear. Menzi tried to pay him for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't take any money," Menzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting back toward Santa Clarita, Menzi headed onto Sierra Highway. A police 
officer stopped him, asking him if he needed an ambulance. "I said I didn't 
think I needed one," Menzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He started hitchhiking, and a man in a van agreed to take him to his mother's. 
Menzi figures he had walked about 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 When they reached the intersection of San Fernando Road and Lyons Avenue, 
Menzi spotted his mother, Mary Menzi, driving a car and hailed her. She said 
she was shocked by her son's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was beet red," said Mary Menzi during a visit to the hospital to see her 
son. "It looked like he had to fight to get through." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother and sister persuaded Menzi to get examined by paramedics at a 
nearby fire station, who sent him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns covered at least 25% of his body, doctors told Menzi, and they placed 
him in intensive care. On Thursday, his condition was listed as serious. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister, Cheryl Menzi, said her brother has been dealt a severe blow by the 
loss of his truck and all his tools. She said a fund for him has been created 
at Valencia National Bank in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi did get a bit of good news on Thursday. Passersby had found Bimbo, and 
the dog was being treated in a pet hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians at the Blue Cross Pet Hospital in North Hollywood contacted 
Menzi by calling the beeper number printed on a tag on the dog's collar. They 
told him Bimbo had suffered serious burns on her muzzle but will probably 
survive.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE FACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some facts and figures on Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: 51 
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: A magnitude 3.6 aftershock was the hardest to hit the Southland 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: Earthquake damage costs could range from $15 billion to $30 billion, 
Gov. Pete Wilson estimated, making it the most expensive natural disaster in 
California history. Losses suffered in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in the 
San Francisco Bay Area totaled about $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 2,300 people were treated and released at hospitals; 
about 530 were admitted for care. 
</P>
<P>
 * CURFEW: The 11 p.m.-to-dawn curfew for Los Angeles was canceled on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARRESTS: The Los Angeles Police Department has taken 178 people into custody 
in a three-day period. Most were general arrests and not for curfew violations 
or looting. On a typical day, there would be about 550 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOMELESS: About 6,000 people spent Wednesday in Red Cross shelters in 
Southern California, while another 700 bedded down at Salvation Army 
facilities. Since the quake, the Salvation Army reportedly has fed about 18,700 
people and supplied about 15,000 gallons of water to victims. The Red Cross has 
served about 35,000 meals.  
</P>
<P>
 * NATIONAL GUARD: A total of 2,579 National Guard troops have been mobilized. 
The National Guard has committed more than 1,000 soldiers -- in day and night 
shifts of 500 -- to conducting security patrols at shopping malls and selected 
sites in quake-damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * UTILITIES: Electricity was restored to all parts of Los Angeles except for 
7,500 customers in the San Fernando Valley. About 36,000 DWP customers, mostly 
in the northwest Valley, still did not have water as of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRANSIT: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority set up a line dubbed the 
Westside Special to help commuters cope with the shutdown of the Santa Monica 
Freeway (I-10). Buses on Line 634 leave every 20 minutes during weekday morning 
and evening rush hours, or as demand warrants. The one-way fare is $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * SCHOOLS: More than 200 school buildings have been seriously damaged or 
destroyed. All Los Angeles school district campuses will remain closed through 
Friday. Some San Fernando Valley schools could remain closed for several weeks. 
For information on specific school sites, call (213) 625-4000, or (213) 
625-4643 for information in Spanish. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles reports that 93% of its schools will be open. L.A. Mission College will 
be closed through Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 * MAIL: Residents whose homes have been declared uninhabitable can claim their 
mail at the local post office. For information, call (818) 757-2100 from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; LONG LINES AND SHORT TEMPERS; ASSISTANCE: 
THOUSANDS OVERWHELM FEDERAL DISASTER CENTERS. MANY APPLICANTS COME AWAY WITH 
ONLY A HANDFUL OF PROMISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For Shontoi Edwards, her home and hope crumbled by the heaving earth, dawn 
Thursday brought the promise of help. After waiting 15 hours, Edwards walked 
away from a federal disaster assistance center with a handful of promises -- 
but empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards spent an hour filling out piles of forms at the Winnetka Recreation 
Center, but the money she needs to move from the park that has been home for 
the last four days may take 96 hours or more to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why tell people they were going to help you and we have nothing?" said 
Edwards, 35, still wearing the T-shirt and black pants she slipped on just 
before her Van Nuys apartment complex collapsed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As 11 assistance centers opened across Southern California, thousands of tense 
and tired earthquake victims such as Edwards overwhelmed state and federal aid 
agencies in search of money to move, to rebuild and to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 From Santa Monica to Santa Clarita, aid applicants -- wearied by four days 
without the things they once took for granted -- grew restless in long lines, 
some nearly coming to blows and one trying to sell appointments with federal 
officials for $5 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of families, the centers offered grants of up to $12,800 to help 
defray expenses, assistance in dealing with private insurance companies and 
information on deducting damage expenses from income taxes. Businesses were 
offered small-business loans. Those whose homes were destroyed qualified for 
housing vouchers to help them move into new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the doors opened at 1 p.m., it became painfully apparent to those 
who had waited hours in line that what took seconds to destroy will require 
much longer to replace. Many of the makeshift centers, especially in the 
devastated northern San Fernando Valley, appeared woefully unprepared to handle 
a crush of quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Some applicants were unable to receive assistance. As officials shut down the 
Winnetka center, one woman shouted from the edge of the crowd, "Don't you know 
you can start a riot here?" A crying man said, "You don't know how important 
this is to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials assured quake victims that they would keep working over the next 
several weeks until they had taken claims from everyone who suffered losses in 
Monday's magnitude 6.6 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make appointments for everyone because obviously the number 
of people out there today is beyond our capacity," FEMA spokesman Kevin Healey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, Thursday was only the beginning of a paperwork labyrinth that may 
take weeks or months to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And what a beginning it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds spent the night in chilly weather -- some arriving as early as 10 
p.m. Wednesday -- and took turns with friends and neighbors to hold places in 
line. Many, like Katriena McCord of West Hills, had no place else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything I can get would help. I've lost everything," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Santa Monica center, several people rushed the doors when they opened, 
cutting ahead of people who had been in line for up to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go to the back of the line!" one person yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men shouted at one another and almost came to blows. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the applicants, Greg Green, stepped forward and helped to restore order 
by appointing himself line monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Winnetka center, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros 
and Transportation Secretary Federico Pena were mobbed by impatient crowds. 
Edwards, the Van Nuys woman frustrated by delays, shouted at Cisneros as he 
toured the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "My apartment is knocked down completely," she said. "What should I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros responded: "We're trying to help you, but there is no such thing as 
an instantaneous" fix. Later, talking about the coveted housing vouchers, 
Cisneros said: "Some people are disappointed because they thought they would 
leave with one. But this is a one-, two- or three-day process." 
</P>
<P>
 As lines in some locations snaked for hundreds of yards, FEMA officials urged 
aid applicants to call for appointments on the agency's toll-free hot line -- 
(800) 462-9029. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so much easier to call that number than to spend your whole day standing 
in lines," said Francis Alvarez, manager of the facility at the Sylmar 
Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynn Solky, whose Sherman Oaks condominium was ravaged by the quake, said 
she tried to call the number 200 times before she gave up in frustration and 
joined the lines in Van Nuys. "It's a zoo," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a FEMA emergency office in Southwest Los Angeles, the frustration of the 
last few days boiled over when more than 1,000 people arrived, some of them as 
early as 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, mindful of the crowd, began handing out appointment times at 11 
a.m. But that gesture, meant to defuse tensions, only added to them.  
</P>
<P>
 By 1:45 p.m., some in the crowd refused to wait any longer. As Los Angeles 
Police Officer Reginald Paige attempted to hand out a stack of appointment 
times, about 50 people in the crowd moved toward him and one -- a big man no 
one attempted to stop -- grabbed the applications from Paige's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The man walked down the street and began selling the appointment slips for $5 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Armstead bought one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that I had to get it this way," said Armstead, whose Leimert 
Park apartment lost a chimney. "But everything is so disorganized. I had no 
choice."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE REFUGEE SHELTER OPENS IN LAS VEGAS

 A shelter for earthquake refugees from Southern California has opened in a Las 
Vegas recreation center, with one family already moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I feel a lot safer," said 14-year-old Jason Barnett, whose family 
lost their Canoga Park apartment in Monday's quake."I hear there's just mainly 
floods here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason, his mother, and a brother and sister caught a ride to Las Vegas with a 
friend Tuesday morning. They stayed with a relative until learning of the 
shelter at Sunrise Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on phone calls from fleeing Southern Californians, the Red Cross has 
prepared to handle 40 to 60 people at Sunrise and another recreation center, 
said Steve Hailey, disaster chairman for the American Red Cross in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, it's just the Barnetts, but Hailey said Thursday: "We're expecting a 
lot more people . . . when word of the shelters in Las Vegas spreads."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; COLLEGE PLACEMENT TESTS POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 College placement exams scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at Los Angeles-area 
sites have been postponed until February because of disruptions caused by 
Monday's quake, the Educational Testing Service announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The locations affected are: El Camino, Garfield, Hamilton, Los Angeles, 
Roosevelt, San Fernando, University and Van Nuys high schools in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District; Harvard-Westlake School in Studio City; Cal 
State Northridge, and Canyon High School in Santa Clarita.

SHOWDOWN VOTE WILL DECIDE POLITICAL REFORMS IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite threats of a rebellion among its own supporters, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition Thursday decided to put to a final vote today 
four political reform bills that would overturn Japan's post-World War II 
political structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejection of the bills, on which Hosokawa has staked his political future, in 
the upper house of Parliament would undermine Hosokawa's power to act on a host 
of other issues, including conclusion of yearlong negotiations with the United 
States to establish a framework for U.S.-Japan economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, who said last August that he would "assume political responsibility" 
if the reforms failed to pass, is scheduled to visit Washington Feb. 11-13 to 
wind up the "framework talks" with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 With party discipline cracking on both sides in the upper house, the historic 
vote will mark the first time that representatives cast ballots without the 
outcome being known in advance. Hosokawa described the showdown as dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the Speaker of the 252-member upper house, who does not vote, 126 
votes are needed for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the coalition counts 131 members in its ranks, leaders fear that as 
many as 16 Socialists will vote against the bills or boycott the balloting. A 
rebellion is also expected within the Liberal Democratic Party, which opposes 
the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liberal Democrats' 38-year grasp on power ended last July. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms would wipe out a lower house election system in which an average 
of four representatives are chosen by voters casting only one ballot in 
multi-seat districts. Candidates are sometimes elected with 20% or fewer of the 
votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed reforms, voters would cast one ballot for a representative 
in single-seat districts, filling 274 seats, and a second ballot for the party 
of their choice to fill 226 proportional representation seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of rural votes, which is often three times that of urban votes, 
would also be reduced to a ratio of 2 to 1, on average. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate and union donations, which have been blamed as the root of 
widespread corruption, would be forbidden to individual politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the system now, battles in multi-seat districts among politicians of the 
same party reduce lower house campaigns to personality contests. National 
issues and foreign policy are seldom mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's struggle to win approval of the reforms came to a head Thursday as 
a Liberal Democrat defied his party and cast a vote in committee to send the 
package to the floor of the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 With the move by Tomoichi Hoshino, who said he will resign from the party 
today, the bills passed by a vote of 18-16.

CHINA OPENS PRISONS TO U.S. INSPECTION TO HELP RESOLVE TRADE CONFLICT; 
COMMERCE: EXAMINERS WILL SEEK EVIDENCE OF INMATE-MADE PRODUCTS SHIPPED TO U.S. 
RIGHTS ACTIVISTS SAY AGREEMENT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China agreed Thursday to U.S. demands that it open five prisons and their 
record books to U.S. inspectors searching for evidence that products made by 
inmates are being shipped to the United States, Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the agreement was being announced, agents from the U.S. Customs 
Service visited the prison-run Red Star Tea Farm in Guangdong province, 120 
miles north of Guangzhou in southern China. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got good cooperation," U.S. Ambassador Stapleton Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a leading human rights activist and expert on the Chinese prison 
system described the Bentsen announcement as "window dressing" that recycled an 
earlier agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Red Star Tea Farm is a familiar Customs target. Its products were 
banned from the United States after a 1992 inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It frankly doesn't amount to much," said Robin Munro, Hong Kong director of 
Asia Watch, a human rights monitoring organization. "It is progress of a sort, 
but it ranks fairly far down the list of human rights issues compared with 
massive imprisonment of political dissidents and torture." 
</P>
<P>
 The willingness of Chinese officials to allow such inspections -- especially 
of documents indicating the destination of the prison-made products -- has 
become a central issue in the debate leading up to a decision by President 
Clinton on whether to renew by July 3 the preferential trade treatment granted 
to China. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear just how far the inspections can go in determining whether, for 
example, sneakers, wrenches or tea purchased in U.S. stores actually come from 
Chinese prisons, which house political dissidents, common criminals and people 
jailed for their religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents can be forged or hidden from inspectors, and paperwork indicating 
destinations can be rewritten after inspections are made. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he issued a one-year renewal of China's trade status last year, Clinton 
made adherence to certain human rights standards, including a halt in shipments 
of prison-labor products to the United States, a condition for continuing the 
trade benefits in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. law, it is illegal to import prison-made goods. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official here said Thursday's agreement is intended to speed up 
the inspection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Two facilities were visited last spring, but the process of examining the 
delayed paperwork was only recently completed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the two sides agreed that there will be "more timely access" to the 
prisons, "more timely reports from the Chinese" providing requested information 
and "more timely responses" by the United States on the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the tea farm, other sites to be visited are the Shanghai 
Laodong Heavy Machinery Factory, the Shanghai Laodong Steel Pipe Factory, the 
Shandong Laoyang Heavy-Duty Machinery Factory near Beijing and the Yunnan Jinma 
Diesel Engine Works near Kunming in southwest China, a U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 With questions still unanswered about allegations of other human rights 
violations, the accord was portrayed by Bentsen as "significant" but far from 
the final step leading to renewal of the trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased where we stand, but the crux of the matter is whether we can 
continue this level of compliance up to the time when the President makes his 
decision in June," Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the "most favored nation" trade benefits that Beijing wants to have 
continued, Chinese products can be imported into the United States at the 
lowest tariff levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury secretary announced the agreement during a speech to about 200 
Chinese officials, including representatives of the Foreign and Finance 
ministries, the State Planning Commission and the People's Bank of China. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a drafty assembly hall of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 
Bentsen said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made some progress on the prison labor front. Our governments have 
agreed on measures to ensure more effective prevention of the export of goods 
made with prison labor. China has also agreed to permit inspections of five 
prisons alleged to be producing goods for export. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trust that this pattern of cooperation will continue," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen is on a three-day visit to Beijing, during which he has focused 
primarily on efforts to enhance U.S.-Chinese economic cooperation and make the 
growing Chinese market more accessible to U.S. manufacturers and financial 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison farm inspected Thursday was established in 1956 and produces a 
black tea shipped to 30 countries, said Munro, the human rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Munro said Bentsen's announcement fell far short of satisfying Clinton's order 
last May that called for "overall significant progress" in stemming human 
rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is complicated because nearly all countries force some prisoners 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, including the United States, export their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Some human rights organizations argue that focusing on prison labor diverts 
attention from the more compelling political and religious persecution and 
prison torture in China. 
</P>
<P>
 On the long list of human rights grievances, the issue of prison labor exports 
is considered one of the easiest for China to manipulate. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1992, the United States and China signed a memorandum of 
understanding granting each country the right to investigate the other's 
allegations that exports were produced by prison laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from the U.S. Congress, particularly Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), 
the U.S. Department of Commerce asked to visit five prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 After a delay, U.S. Embassy officials in Beijing were allowed to visit the 
diesel factory on the new list. The results were inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. officials accepted an offer to inspect Beijing Prison No. 1, 
which was not on their list. 
</P>
<P>
 Munro described the prison as a "model unit often shown to foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
 According to several reports, including some in the Chinese press, the Beijing 
prison once made tennis shoes and clothing sold abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 article in a Chinese newspaper boasted of the high-level export quality 
of the stockings made there. But by the time U.S. Embassy officials were 
allowed in, they found no evidence of products produced for export. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays built into the inspection procedure, which U.S. officials hope the 
new agreement will circumvent, were criticized as a major failing because they 
gave Chinese authorities time to tamper with evidence of export violations. 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. government, adhering to the rules of the 1992 agreement, printed 
a report in the Federal Register, the Chinese press seized on the published 
results, saying the prison system here had been "cleared" of false charges made 
by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Chinese government-backed publications, including one in Hong Kong 
called Window, published long articles detailing prison products exported from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The articles meant to show the hypocrisy of the American position on prison 
labor.

OUSTER OF BALKAN MEDIATOR SOUGHT; DIPLOMACY: EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT CRITICIZES 
BRITAIN'S LORD OWEN FOR HIS ATTEMPT TO CARVE BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA INTO ETHNIC 
MINISTATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The European Parliament appealed Thursday for dismissal of Britain's Lord Owen 
as mediator in the paralyzed Balkan peace talks and criticized his attempt to 
carve Bosnia-Herzegovina into ethnic ministates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 160-90 vote taken at Parliament headquarters in Strasbourg, France, was 
purely advisory, but it reflected a growing sentiment among some governments in 
the 12-nation European Union (formerly the European Community) that ethnic 
partitioning could set a dangerous precedent in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government officials have repeatedly appealed for Owen's resignation 
or dismissal, accusing him and the Western states he represents of having 
capitulated to border changes that Serbian rebels have accomplished by force. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament urged the EU to designate another mediator and change both its 
strategy and the mandate it has conferred on the fruitless peace forum in 
Geneva that Owen has overseen for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen and his U.N. counterpart, Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway, "have arrived 
at no result and . . . persist in wanting to cut Bosnia-Herzegovina along 
ethnic lines," the Parliament said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediators have allowed the Geneva talks to focus on a division of Bosnia 
among its three main ethnic groups, largely because the international community 
has rejected the use of force to roll back Serbian territorial seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking any mandate from either the EU or the United Nations to threaten the 
combatants with military deterrence, Owen and Stoltenberg last fall left it to 
the warring factions to come up with their own plans for a peace settlement. 
That spurred a joint Serbian-Croatian proposal for ethnic partitioning, which 
the Bosnian government rejected in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Several EU states have recently complained that the Geneva talks were exerting 
pressure on the chief victims of the war, the Bosnian Muslims, to accept defeat 
and settle for whatever territory their tormentors left them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NATO leaders earlier this month renewed threats of air strikes against Serbian 
rebels if they continued to strangle Sarajevo and other civilian communities. 
But U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has ruled against that 
proposed use of force, saying it would endanger U.N. troops already deployed in 
Bosnia on an often-thwarted humanitarian mission and that air strikes alone 
would not be sufficient to relieve the sieges. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the EU leaders, officials in the Balkans are fearful of the precedent an 
ethnic carve-up would set. They point to multiethnic Macedonia as another 
former Yugoslav republic ripe for nationalist warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't like to see Bosnia divided and are all the more opposed to the 
principles by which this is being done," said Bulgaria's deputy foreign 
minister, Dimitar Ikonomov. "There really are no principles, but rather the 
dictatorship of arms and force." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the Parliament vote, EU foreign affairs chief Hans van den Broek of the 
Netherlands contended that it was unfair to criticize Owen for simply carrying 
out the limited instructions of the EU governments. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mills, a spokesman for Owen, told reporters in Geneva that the British 
peer intends to stay on. "Lord Owen remains committed to mediating between the 
parties and ending the war in Bosnia," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parliamentary swipe at Owen followed the collapse Thursday of another 
round of talks in Geneva, where the three parties departed after a two-day 
session further from an agreement than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting has escalated in Bosnia since the Muslim-led government refused to 
capitulate to the Serbian-Croatian terms for peace. Those terms would have 
allowed annexation of conquered Bosnian territory to Serbia and Croatia, 
leaving a landlocked and devastated Bosnia made up of less than 30% of its 
original territory.

NEW U.S. SEAFOOD SAFETY RULES EXPECTED TO BE UNVEILED; HEALTH: PROPOSAL WOULD 
SUBJECT INDUSTRY TO OVERSIGHT BY REGULATORS. SYSTEM NOW RESPONDS ONLY WHEN 
ILLNESSES ATTRIBUTED TO POISONING ARE REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal health officials are expected to announce major new regulations today 
designed to ensure the safety of the nation's seafood supply, according to 
sources familiar with the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The new initiative -- scheduled to be announced at a press conference by 
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Food and Drug 
Administration Commissioner David A. Kessler -- will require the seafood 
industry to establish new controls that will be subject to oversight by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 33,000 food-borne illnesses reported annually attributed to 
seafood poisoning, according to public health experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the federal regulatory system is set up to respond only after 
problems occur -- not before. Federal health officials hope that the new system 
will head off potential problems and make the industry more accountable for the 
safety of its products, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulations will be subject to public comment for the next 90 
days before a final rule is published. They will take effect one year after 
publication of the final regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations are modeled after an existing system known as the Hazard 
Analysis Critical Control Point, which was originally designed some years ago 
by private food companies and NASA to safeguard the food prepared for 
astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is modeled on a science-based analysis of potential dangers and 
where they can occur during food processing. The theory is that once these 
critical control points are identified, measures can be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if a seafood company were to purchase swordfish, it would be 
required to check to see whether the fish had been caught in harvest areas 
known to be contaminated with methyl mercury, a known hazardous substance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event that information about the harvest area was unavailable or 
insufficient, companies would be required to sample and test for the chemical, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 All seafood processors, packers and warehouses will be required to adopt their 
own systems for monitoring their products and to maintain detailed records of 
those systems that will regularly be inspected by FDA and state inspectors, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Epstein, executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a 
public interest group involved in this issue since 1986, applauded the federal 
effort but said it did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FDA has taken a good first step, but by itself this program does not 
adequately protect consumers," he said. "FDA is going to need increased 
authority and funding if it is truly going to reduce needless seafood illnesses 
and deaths." 
</P>
<P>
 And without more frequent inspections of processing plants, the new plan "will 
be nothing more than an industry honor system," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, companies also would have to prove that ready-to-eat seafood 
has been cooked to a safe temperature, that safeguards were taken against 
cross-contamination between cooked and raw seafood and that finished products 
are held at the proper temperature, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules will apply equally to domestic and imported seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the FDA also is weighing if such preventive measures can be 
tailor-made for other segments of the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA plans to hold a series of public meetings in nine cities, including 
Los Angeles, during the next two months to discuss the proposals.

 More black Americans are beginning to step forward in the fight against 
poverty, crime and unemployment among their own people, the National Urban 
League reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In its annual report, "The State of Black America," the league asked President 
Clinton to create an "environment of opportunity," featuring business 
development, jobs and anti-discrimination laws, to push the self-help effort 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 But "we also know that we cannot afford to wait for that environment to be 
created," the league's president, John E. Jacob, said. "Our challenge is to 
continue the mobilization of the African American community around the concept 
of self-development to produce healthy, smart, productive, 21st-Century 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Urban League is one of the nation's oldest social service and 
civil rights organizations. It focuses on creating social, educational and 
economic opportunities for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Its report echoes a growing cry among blacks to rely on themselves, and not 
government, to end an atmosphere of hopelessness and lawlessness that has 
gripped many communities in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Among self-help efforts noted in the last year: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gun buy-back programs, offering cash, goods or services to those who turn in 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meetings among street gang leaders to negotiate a national truce. 
</P>
<P>
 * A campaign by professional athletes to promote sexual abstinence among 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 * A growing number of anti-drug patrols by residents of crime-plagued 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mentoring programs launched by churches or black professional groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The league cited a potpourri of indicators that showed black Americans made 
slight gains financially during the 1980s, only to have those gains clipped by 
losses in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Black unemployment remained high in 1992, at 12.4%, although it was down from 
19.5% in 1983, the report said.

QUAKE MAY SHAKE LOOSE FEDERAL ECONOMIC AID; RECOVERY: DISASTER GIVES CLINTON 
CHANCE TO BYPASS POLITICAL OBJECTIONS TO FUNDS FOR SOUTHLAND. SOME AIDES FEAR 
THE HELP WILL COME TOO LATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the Clinton Administration, the Los Angeles earthquake has provided a 
politically salable reason for doing what it has sought to do for most of its 
first year in power: pump billions of dollars into Southern California's ailing 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the damage, however, at least some Administration officials say 
they now fear that the help will come too late. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of 1993, as the national economy pulled into a fairly solid recovery, 
California -- and particularly Southern California -- was the lone holdout. 
That solitary status is even more true now that Northern California is 
beginning to show signs of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have held many meetings over how to respond to the 
economic distress. While they have offered help in the form of small-scale 
federal projects, defense-conversion grants and other efforts, requests from 
California officials for more aid have run up against an unyielding political 
reality: persistent, large federal budget deficits and strong resentment 
elsewhere in the country of California's wealth and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we supposed to tell the other 49 states?" one senior Clinton aide 
demanded when the subject of large-scale aid to California came up in an 
interview only a few weeks before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the political dynamics have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nation is beginning to really now empathize with California, where that 
was not the case before because of the long run of prosperity there," said 
White House Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, after the Los Angeles riots, neither the George Bush 
Administration nor Congress showed much desire to spend large amounts of money 
for rebuilding -- in part because of resentment of California and in part 
because of the overall lack of support for spending on urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Congress has been far more willing to appropriate funds for 
highways than for community development in poor neighborhoods. Americans have 
also generally supported disaster relief costs. Administration officials are 
counting on that empathy to help them win approval later this year of what is 
expected to be a multibillion-dollar supplemental budget request to cover 
earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the changed climate, the aid request could still encounter 
difficulty in Congress -- as the bill to provide money for Midwest flood relief 
did for a brief time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As Administration officials begin planning for the aid request, they say they 
must balance the need to prepare a package that is broad enough to truly help 
the region against the necessity of avoiding proposals that might provide 
ammunition to members of Congress who seek to derail the package. 
</P>
<P>
 In their public statements, the officials have carefully tried to steer away 
from describing the aid as an economic stimulus, stressing that what California 
will be offered are resources for rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can really talk about repairing highways as being a 
stimulus," said John Emerson, the White House aide overseeing relief efforts. 
"You're really just talking about putting things back the way they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those disclaimers, however, the rebuilding effort clearly will have a 
stimulative effect on the economy. Last year, Clinton unsuccessfully proposed 
spending just over $12 billion nationwide in an effort to speed the national 
recovery. Now, he is likely to propose spending a significant fraction of that 
amount in just one region of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're talking about is basically a $2-billion economic stimulus package 
for Los Angeles," said one White House official who has been working on 
disaster relief plans. "You're going to generate a lot of jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on projects such as rebuilding freeways could generate tens of 
thousands of construction-related jobs, economists predict. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort is of obvious political importance for Clinton -- a point 
underscored when Clinton named Emerson, who ran his California campaign in 
1992, as the White House coordinator for the earthquake relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 California and its 54 electoral votes are critical for Clinton's hopes for 
reelection in 1996, and Clinton aides have long believed that a key to winning 
California once again is to show the state's voters that the President has done 
his best to help with the state's economic woes.  
</P>
<P>
 That desire underlays Clinton's decision to travel to California so quickly 
after Monday's earthquake, his pledges of aid and his crowd-pleasing statements 
about the need to consider round-the clock, seven-day-a-week construction 
efforts to fix the region's freeways as rapidly as possible, White House 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 New federal money, along with payments by private insurers, will clearly have 
a stimulating effect on the economy, said Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 "This money is coming in from the outside that would not have come to the area 
under other circumstances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains less clear is whether the new spending will be enough to offset 
the quake's depressing effects on the economy, let alone help the region pull 
out of its slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from his own experience representing parts of Northern California hit 
by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, former U.S. representative and current 
Administration Budget Director Leon A. Panetta, says he doubts the overall 
effect will be positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "While you do get some immediate jobs, over the long term it just has a 
negative impact overall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People and businesses move out of the area because they are afraid of more 
earthquakes," he said, and jobs are lost because of the huge disruptions quakes 
cause.

CLINTON OFFERS SPECULATION ON INMAN PULLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton speculated Thursday that retired Adm. Bobby Ray Inman 
withdrew as the nominee for secretary of defense because "down deep inside I 
think maybe he wasn't sure he wanted to go back" to government service. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in his first public comment on Inman's decision, said Americans 
"shouldn't lose sight" of Inman's 30 years of military service in which he rose 
to the rank of four-star admiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks came in an interview on Cable News Network's "Larry King 
Live" program, held on the anniversary of his inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman announced Tuesday that he was giving up plans to take the top defense 
job because of criticism from the press and political foes. He also conceded 
that he had been reluctant to accept the post but agreed to do so only because 
the request came from the President. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Clinton acknowledged the pressures on government officials 
from public scrutiny. He said a Cabinet secretary told him recently that "if he 
had it to do over, he wouldn't go into public service. . . . It's just too 
brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton added that he didn't feel that way himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also said he plans to find a replacement for Inman "in a fairly 
quick way," adding that the Administration has assembled a short list of 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said he was relying on Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to find a candidate 
for the yet-unfilled post of assistant attorney general for civil rights. "I'll 
be strongly inclined to go with her judgment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidacies of two lawyers, C. Lani Guinier and John Payton, have already 
been abandoned because of outside criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 On another topic, Clinton said the federal government needs to assist Southern 
California's earthquake cleanup in a way that ensures that the damage -- 
including destruction of portions of freeways -- doesn't impede the state's 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are finally beginning to see the economy turn around out there," Clinton 
said. "Finally. And then this happens. So we've got to do this in a way that 
doesn't upset the economy."

21 JEWISH SCHOOLS CUT OFF FROM U.S. STUDENT AID FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government is barring 21 Orthodox Jewish schools from federal student aid 
programs on grounds they provide only "avocational" training. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible for student aid money, schools must provide education that 
leads to a degree or certificate and "prepares students for gainful employment 
in a recognized occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 The schools, all but one in New York City, were first told they might not be 
eligible for continued aid last October and were allowed a chance to appeal. 
Letters sent last week to most of the schools informed them that their 
arguments had not been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the schools were cited at Senate hearings last year as examples of 
abuse of the federal Pell grant program, which provides some $6.7 billion a 
year to the nation's neediest students. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury in New York is investigating several dozen Hasidic Jewish 
academies over alleged abuses of student aid.

WINTER'S GRIP TIGHTENS ALONG EAST COAST; WEATHER: WASHINGTON GRINDS TO A 
VIRTUAL HALT. EMERGENCIES ARE DECLARED IN D.C., NEW JERSEY AND PENNSYLVANIA. 
THE DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 130. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The nation's capital came to a virtual halt Thursday as the East Coast 
remained in the grip of frigid temperatures and snow and ice storms that so far 
have been blamed for 130 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 States of emergency were declared in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the District 
of Columbia, and winter freezes hurt some areas in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said temperatures should rise in the next few days and be above 
freezing by the weekend or early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the death toll has been climbing daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have died in accidents on ice-slick roads. Some have suffered heart 
attacks while shoveling snow. A few have been killed by their efforts to keep 
warm, such as a North Carolina man who died in a fire that began when he tried 
to thaw his water pipes with a blowtorch. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims include a Minnesota woman who fell when she went outside to feed 
birds, a Pittsburgh woman who collapsed while getting the mail; and a New York 
motorist, caught in a snowstorm, who knocked at a house for help and was turned 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, all except essential federal workers were told to stay home 
Thursday. Even President Clinton canceled scheduled events, choosing to stay 
warm in the White House. He did keep an appointment to appear on CNN's "Larry 
King Live," but asked for the interview to be conducted in his residential 
quarters instead of the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the government shutdown was felt in Los Angeles, where top 
federal officials providing earthquake relief found their efforts hampered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's complicating this, but not stopping us," said Phil Cogan, a spokesman 
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A repeat of Wednesday's rolling electrical blackouts was avoided as 
manufacturing plants obeyed local government orders and closed from New Jersey 
to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that had deals with power companies under which they get cheaper 
rates in exchange for being the first to lose power during an emergency found 
it was time to "pay the piper," one engineer at a Philadelphia-area 
manufacturing plant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Days of freezing temperatures burst pipes in homes, hotels and other 
facilities throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 One hospital in a working-class neighborhood in Philadelphia had to transfer 
its 125 patients to neighboring hospitals during the pre-dawn hours Thursday. A 
pipe burst in the middle of the night, flooding the basement of the Parkview 
Hospital where the transformer and generators were located. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main power source for the hospital went out," spokesman Ed Leszczynski 
said. "We did not have heat, electricity or telephones." 
</P>
<P>
 New York City temperatures hovered about 13 degrees Thursday. On Wednesday, 
temperatures in New York hit a low of minus 2 degrees, breaking a 119-year 
record in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 3 degrees above zero in Chicago, but schools, businesses and 
commodities markets were open. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania officials ordered state offices closed and urged businesses to 
open late or stay closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Atlanta, residents were asked to skip baths and showers after some water 
pipes froze and burst. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky was crippled by a snowstorm that hit earlier this week. All schools 
were closed, more than 1,000 National Guard troops were on duty to provide 
emergency services and most interstate highways were still closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration reported no major air travel problems 
except at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, where icy runways delayed 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak said some passenger trains were delayed or canceled in the East and 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly threatened to fine any nonessential 
businesses up to $1,000 if they defied her order to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Most businesses complied. One liquor store that stayed open was fined $1,000, 
according to Zachary D. Smith, a spokesman for the city's Office of Emergency 
Preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 The order marked the first of its kind since the 1968 riots after the 
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members at Washington area homeless shelters said that some people who 
normally opt to stay on the streets were taking refuge. "We had to open up our 
basement to handle the overflow," said Willis Partington, who works at the 
Community for Creative Nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter normally has a capacity of more than 1,400 and added beds for 
another 50. Throughout the day Thursday, staff members were riding around the 
street in a van searching for homeless people and trying to encourage them to 
come in out of the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The approximately 362,000 nonessential federal government workers who were 
asked to stay home Thursday were expected to report to work at 10 a.m. today. 
Congress planned to open at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephones at federal agencies and other offices went unanswered for the most 
part. The State Department canceled all briefings, including an invitation-only 
affair with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
moved a news conference to the Willard Hotel because the Justice Department 
building was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some government officials found out how easy it is to work from home. Dr. 
David A. Kessler, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, ran the 
agency from his suburban Maryland house with two telephones, a fax machine, a 
photocopying machine and two computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's very little in this electronic age you can't get done from home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Area residents who hail from colder climates were skeptical about the need for 
such drastic measures and scoffed at Washingtonians for overreacting. But city 
officials defended the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly have an obligation to act responsibly and decisively to protect 
the public safety interests of the D.C. residents," Smith said. Utility 
officials stressed that there was a chance of a catastrophic loss of power 
unless such measures were taken, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in the District of Columbia and suburban Virginia and Maryland areas 
were closed for a fourth day, and were likely to remain closed today.

THE CITADEL'S FIRST WOMAN BEGINS TAKING CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shannon Faulkner walked into a biology class at The Citadel on Thursday, 
becoming the first woman in the school's 151-year history to take a class with 
the corps of cadets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like walking into any other class, when there are 30 guys in the 
class and you're the only woman," said Faulkner, who also celebrated her 19th 
birthday Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first day of class went well," she said. "The cadets have spoken to me. I 
don't think I'll be having any problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner did have one problem, however. She got a $10 ticket for parking in 
the faculty lot. She said she thought school officials told her she could park 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, who had all gender references removed from her high school 
transcript, first was accepted by the school, then was rejected when Citadel 
officials found out she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 She sued the state-supported military college last year, saying its all-male 
policy was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled that she could attend day classes, although not as a 
cadet, while her lawsuit proceeded. The Citadel went to the Supreme Court to 
try to keep her out, but Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on Tuesday said she 
could attend classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute are the nation's only 
state-supported, all-male military colleges. VMI's admissions policy is also 
being challenged in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner walked through a horde of reporters to Duckett Hall for her 8 a.m. 
biology class, a 75-minute lecture on plant reproduction. Cadets watched from 
the courtyard and the windows of Stevens Barracks across the street, yelling as 
she passed by. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real upsetting for a lot of the guys, but they have enough humor, enough 
spunk, to see it through," said John Johnson, a junior cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult. It's going to be a change. But what happens is what happens," 
senior Jay Hart said. Hart said he came to The Citadel for a single-sex 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Several women shouted "Go Shannon" as Faulkner arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Fort, a high school student, said she came just to show her support. 
"She's doing what is right. I think she's very brave," she said.

GOP LAWYER PICKED TO PROBE WHITEWATER; PRESIDENCY: EX-N.Y. PROSECUTOR FISKE IS 
CHOSEN AS SPECIAL COUNSEL BY RENO. HE SAYS HE PLANS TO QUESTION THE CLINTONS 
ABOUT TANGLED S&L AFFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fulfilling a White House promise made in response to GOP demands, Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno on Thursday appointed former U.S. Atty. Robert B. Fiske Jr., a 
Republican, as special counsel to look into the tangled Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske immediately pledged "a complete, thorough and impartial" inquiry into 
the matter, which involves investments by President Clinton and his wife, 
Hillary, in an Ozark Mountain resort and loans to the Clintons by a failed 
savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske also indicated that he is likely to take the unprecedented step of 
taking sworn statements from a sitting President. Asked if he planned to 
question the Clintons, Fiske replied: "I would certainly expect before this 
investigation is over, I would question both the President and the First Lady, 
and it would be under oath." 
</P>
<P>
 A President has never been put under oath in an independent counsel 
investigation, although former President Ronald Reagan agreed to give a 
videotaped deposition in the trial of an Iran-Contra defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton indicated later that he was willing to be questioned by Fiske. 
"Whatever he wants to do . . . I didn't do anything wrong," Clinton said during 
an appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live." 
</P>
<P>
 The President also said that he is eager to have the issue settled. "The main 
thing I want to do is to just have that turned over to him so we can go back to 
work," Clinton said. "I just want to do my job." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing Fiske's appointment, Reno praised him for his reputation of 
"fairness and impartiality" and said that the ex-prosecutor from New York 
fulfilled her pledge last week to appoint someone "ruggedly independent." 
</P>
<P>
 The new appointee, with Reno standing at his side, said he would recruit 
additional "experienced former prosecutors from across the country" to take 
over total control of the investigation from the Justice Department. 
Investigators will look into possible criminal wrongdoing in the cases of 
Whitewater Development Corp. and Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who has led demands by his party for 
appointment of a special counsel, said he did not know Fiske personally but 
felt he was "extremely well-qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, 63, was appointed in 1976 as Manhattan's federal prosecutor during the 
Gerald R. Ford Administration and was known as a hard-driving, hands-on U.S. 
attorney who focused on white-collar and organized crime prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 He was so well regarded in law enforcement circles that Democrat Jimmy Carter 
kept him in place after assuming the presidency in 1977. He has become a Wall 
Street lawyer prominent in white-collar defense work since leaving government 
service in 1980. He is a past president of the American College of Trial 
Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske told reporters Thursday that he demanded and received "very broad 
authority" from Reno as a condition of accepting the appointment. He said he 
would take a leave of absence Monday from his Manhattan law firm and would open 
an office in Little Rock, Ark., where a federal grand jury has been hearing 
witnesses in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 His first steps will include obtaining a full briefing from Justice Department 
investigators who have been working on the Whitewater case, along with 
subpoenaed documents they have obtained. But he stressed that he would hire "a 
totally new staff of lawyers . . . so that we may conduct a truly independent 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have people working for me who are not at the same time reporting to 
the attorney general," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske will have assistance from a cadre of FBI agents, as is customary for 
independent counsels. FBI Director Louis J. Freeh "has assured me the FBI will 
be at my complete disposal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the suicide last July of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster 
"would be one of the things" encompassed by his probe. Among papers found in 
Foster's office after his death was a file on the Clintons' Whitewater 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Central questions to be answered in the Whitewater affair include whether the 
Clintons, as half-owners of the land-development venture, were aware that their 
partner and longtime friend, James B. McDougal, may have been co-mingling funds 
from his savings and loan in the land business' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at issue is whether Clinton's political influence as governor helped keep 
the high-rolling S & L open longer than it otherwise would have been, 
increasing the cost to the federal government of its eventual federal bailout. 
Bank examiners say the cost to taxpayers was $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the investigation is McDougal's notoriously sloppy 
record-keeping, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske said that he would complete his investigation "as quickly as I can 
consistent with doing the job right." Asked if that might take several months, 
he said "probably more than months." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno originally opposed demands from Congress that she appoint a special 
counsel, saying anyone she selected would be subject to charges of not being 
truly independent. The government had had a mechanism in place under which a 
panel of federal judges would appoint such independent counsels, but Congress 
allowed the statute to lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reno capitulated, however, when Clinton, reacting to congressional and public 
pressure, asked her to make an appointment. She said Thursday that she had 
taken every precaution to guarantee Fiske's "complete independence." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted him to define the scope of his investigation and his staff," Reno 
said. "I wanted him to be as independent as possible. I don't expect him to 
report to me, I expect him to report to the American people. And I don't expect 
to monitor this investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Fiske's legal mandate, he has full authority to seek criminal 
indictments from a federal grand jury without Justice Department approval. At 
the end of his inquiry, he is required to make a full public report of his 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 As to calls for a parallel congressional investigation of Whitewater, Fiske 
said, "I'm not concerned about that at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that given the propensity of Congress to grant limited 
immunity from prosecution to important witnesses, "history shows it is 
difficult to conduct criminal investigations at the same time as congressional 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske was a law partner and early adviser to Lawrence E. Walsh, the 
independent counsel who just completed a seven-year probe of the Iran-Contra 
scandal. Walsh found that congressional grants of immunity caused two 
convictions to be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, however, said the two investigations are "totally different." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, meeting reporters in Topeka, Kan., greeted the appointment with cautious 
optimism. "I don't know Robert Fiske," he said. "But my reaction is to wait and 
see what happens. They've chosen someone. That's what we asked them to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, people who know him think he is extremely well-qualified, 
is independent," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "He has some Republican leanings . . . but some of the conservative 
Republicans have not been happy with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole was referring to opposition from conservatives when former Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh once proposed Fiske as his top deputy during the George Bush 
Administration. Conservatives, including Republican senators on the Judiciary 
Committee, raised such strong objections that Fiske's appointment was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske had incurred their ire when he chaired the American Bar Assn.'s 
committee that evaluated potential court nominees. Conservatives blamed him for 
the ABA's tepid endorsement of the 1987 Supreme Court nomination of Robert H. 
Bork, who ultimately was blocked by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Yale University and the University of Michigan law school, Fiske 
tried several important cases during his government career, obtaining the 
convictions of narcotics kingpin Leroy (Nicky) Barnes and Mafia-connected labor 
racketeers Anthony Scotto and Anthony Anastasio. 
</P>
<P>
 In both public and private life, Fiske has been known for his passion for 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular among former colleagues at the Justice Department and in his Manhattan 
law firm, he has a talent for breaking down a case to its essence and then 
arguing persuasively in court, associates said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Fiske was among defense attorneys who represented legendary 
Washington lawyer and power broker Clark M. Clifford in his successful battle 
against bank fraud charges in the BCCI banking scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R -- N.Y.), who knows Fiske personally, calls him 
"one of the most honorable and most skilled lawyers anywhere." During his four 
years in public office, Fiske supervised the drafting of thousands of 
indictments and obtained convictions of at least one defendant in 95% of his 
cases. Profile: Robert B. Fiske Jr.

BOBBITT CASE GOES TO JURY; PROSECUTORS CONCEDE ABUSE; JUSTICE: THE COMMONWEALTH 
SAYS MAIMING WAS 'AN EXPLICIT ACT OF REVENGE.' AS JURORS LEAVE COURTROOM, 
DEFENDANT BURSTS INTO TEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a week of explicit testimony that captivated the nation's attention even 
as it shocked its sensibilities, the unusual case of the Commonwealth vs. 
Lorena Bobbitt went to the jury Thursday with the prosecution conceding that 
Mrs. Bobbitt had been abused by her husband but insisting that she should still 
be punished for severing his penis in "a calculated and explicit act of 
revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial drew to a close and the jury of seven women and five men filed 
out of the chamber to begin their deliberations, Mrs. Bobbitt, who had been 
sitting impassively at the defense table throughout the summations, burst into 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
 She had maintained her composure during two days of mostly damaging testimony 
by prosecution rebuttal witnesses, but in the end the strain evidently proved 
too much for the 24-year-old Ecuadorean-born manicurist as she slumped over the 
defense table and began to sob violently. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Mrs. Bobbitt herself returned to the stand briefly to deny the 
potentially devastating testimony of a surprise prosecution witness, who told 
the court on Wednesday that the defendant had once threatened to castrate her 
husband in retaliation for his infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final day of testimony, the jury also heard from another psychologist 
who said that, contrary to the defense claim of temporary insanity, Mrs. 
Bobbitt was in control of her actions and knew what she was doing on the night 
of June 23, when she cut off her husband's penis after he had allegedly raped 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on a charge of "maliciously wounding" John Wayne Bobbitt, a 
26-year-old ex-Marine, Lorena Bobbitt could face up to 20 years imprisonment as 
well as deportation to Venezuela, where she grew up. However, Judge Herman 
Whisenant also told the jury it could consider a lesser felony charge of 
"unlawful" wounding, which carries a sentence of between one and five years 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the jury received the case only moments before court was scheduled to 
adjourn for the day, a verdict will not come until today, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lorena Bobbitt left the snow-shrouded brick courthouse in Manassas, Va., 30 
miles west of Washington, scores of Latino supporters waiting outside in the 
frigid courtyard waved Ecuadorean and Venezuelan flags and chanted expressions 
of support in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Her weeklong trial, which lasted twice as long as originally expected, 
attracted wide attention and turned both Bobbitts into household names -- not 
only in the United States but in Latin America and much of Europe as well. 
</P>
<P>
 While most women's rights groups shied away from turning Mrs. Bobbitt's 
unusual case into a legal cause celebre, the defense team's portrait of her as 
a terrified victim of her husband's constant physical and sexual abuse clearly 
aroused a lot of support, not only among women but among Latin-American 
immigrant communities. Many of the supporters who have waited outside the 
courthouse to cheer her over the last several days said they came at the urging 
of Latino radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with even the prosecution's medical witnesses testifying that they 
believed Mrs. Bobbitt had been repeatedly raped and abused by her husband, it 
often appeared throughout the weeklong trial that it was John Bobbitt -- not 
his wife -- who was once again facing the jury in the same courthouse where he 
had been acquitted of marital assault only two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although John Bobbitt continued to deny that he mistreated his wife, the 
prosecution in the end conceded the abuse, with Assistant Commonwealth Atty. 
Mary Grace O'Brien telling the jury in her summation that even she believed 
that defense witnesses who testified to John Bobbitt's brutality "were telling 
the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 But she disputed the defense team's "ridiculous" contention that their 
four-year-long marriage had been a "reign of terror" for Lorena Bobbitt, who 
she argued had had "ample opportunities" to leave her husband. She also noted 
that Bobbitt was sleeping at the time his wife mutilated him and therefore had 
posed no imminent threat that could cause her deed to be construed as an act of 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense team does not want you to think about the crime. They want to 
talk about the marriage" which "was in a shambles," O'Brien conceded. But, she 
said, "this is not a divorce case . . . but a criminal affair" involving a 
"calculated and explicit act of revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 John Bobbitt, she added pointedly, "is not on trial here . . . Lorena Bobbitt 
is on trial and if you believe she caused bodily injury with the intent to 
maim, injure or kill, as the Commonwealth contends, then you have to find her 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Blair Howard, in his summation, sought to cast Mrs. Bobbitt's 
actions on the night of June 23 in the context of her fear of her husband, the 
trauma of rape and the diagnosis of both prosecution and defense psychiatrists 
who said she suffered from severe depressive disorders as a result of what they 
all agreed had been John Bobbitt's abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is overwhelming. This girl was crumbling. She was falling to 
pieces" and finally "she snapped," Howard said, adding that even "if you have 
the healthiest mind in the world, you get hysterical when you're raped." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution's case, he added, was "in hopeless conflict" because even its 
own psychiatric experts contradicted the testimony given by members of John 
Bobbitt's family, who said that it was Lorena Bobbitt who was the abusive 
partner in the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lady is ill and every doctor has told you that," concluded Howard as he 
argued for a verdict of not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument, however, received another blow earlier Thursday when clinical 
psychologist Evan Nelson testified that, while Lorena Bobbitt was mentally ill, 
she was nevertheless aware of her actions and did not succumb to an 
"irresistible impulse" to maim her husband as the defense contends. Jurors' 
Options in Bobbitt Trial 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in Lorena Bobbitt's malicious wounding trial has three options in its 
deliberations: 
</P>
<P>
 * Guilty of malicious wounding: Jury decides she injured John Wayne Bobbitt 
with intent to maim, disfigure, disable or kill and the act was done with 
malice. Penalty: five to 20 years in prison and a fine up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guilty of unlawful wounding: Jury decides she injured Bobbitt with the same 
intent, but without malice. Penalty: one to five years in prison or up to 12 
months in jail, and-or a fine up to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not guilty: Jury decides she acted in self-defense if she believed she was 
in danger of great bodily harm by her husband and was in peril of attack. Or 
jury decides her mind was so impaired that she couldn't resist the impulse to 
commit the crime.

ANALYSIS; THE QUINTESSENTIAL FIGHTER BATTLES BACK TO STATESMAN STATUS; IMAGE: 
TWENTY YEARS AFTER LEAVING WHITE HOUSE IN DISGRACE, WATERGATE STAIN FADES. 
NIXON ENJOYS NEW RESPECT AT HOME, ABROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Richard M. Nixon mounted the stage at his presidential library Thursday, 
he wrapped one arm around the man who had been his second vice president, and 
waved to the gathering of friends and former colleagues who had come to pay him 
tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 One almost expected his waving hand to make the "V" for victory sign that 
became his trademark during a long political career, flashed for the cameras 
even on the day he left the White House after resigning under threat of 
impeachment from the Watergate scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nixon didn't do it on this 25th anniversary of his first presidential 
inauguration. He didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
 Because in the eyes of his assembled friends and colleagues, Nixon, 81, has 
transcended his time as a mere politician to become a world statesman, with the 
shame of Watergate receding into the past. 
</P>
<P>
 His legacy should not be that he was the only American President who resigned 
from office, Nixon stalwarts argue, but that he was the American leader who 
re-established relations with China, opened the first period of detente with 
the Soviet Union, and knew precisely what America's Cold War role should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost 20 years after leaving the White House, the image of Nixon the 
ruthless politician may be fading into what one historian describes as "not 
just our elder statesman, he's our beloved elder statesman." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's back, and he's respected, and he is welcome in the White House, and 
people do turn to him for advice, and his books are bestsellers," said Stephen 
E. Ambrose, a Nixon biographer and a history professor at the University of New 
Orleans. "It's almost a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A new policy center at the Nixon Library & Birthplace that was formally 
announced Thursday is expected to add historical focus to Nixon's achievements, 
particularly in the area of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But never, political observers say, will revisionists be able to separate 
Nixon from the Watergate scandal that brought down his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be impossible in our lifetime not to think of Watergate when 
we think of President Nixon," said Suzanne Garment, a resident scholar of the 
American Enterprise Institute who has written about the mistrust and cynicism 
that has marked the American political system in recent times, and whose 
husband, attorney Leonard Garment, was an insider in the Nixon White House. 
"What happens . . . is that we are coming to think of him in a much more 
complex way. . . . That complexity grows and makes him a much more fascinating 
figure." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some respects in which he is a more mellow man, with more 
interesting judgment than ever before," Garment added. "On the other hand, 
Watergate will not disappear. So you take the good with the bad." 
</P>
<P>
 A former staffer, Dewey Clower, recently recounted a conversation he had with 
Nixon shortly after the resignation in which the former President said that 
"Watergate was like a gnat flying around my face until it got so big it 
swallowed me." 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately, Nixon would not be swallowed by political defeat, Clower 
added. "I think he has probably made the greatest recovery that's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His staying power -- his ability to bounce back long after foes have 
proclaimed him politically dead -- was touched on during the reunion by those 
who served in his Administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "When thinking about President Nixon and how he helped to meet and to win some 
of our greatest public challenges of all time, and how he met and prevailed in 
a myriad of personal challenges as well, it comes down to two words in my 
opinion: resolve and resilience," former President Gerald R. Ford said in a 
speech at Thursday's ceremonies. "The resolve to stay the course against 
communism, against all odds . . . the resilience to outlast, sometimes even 
outlive his critics in one personal crisis after another." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, few national politicians in American history suffered the harsh 
treatment that Nixon endured. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon jokingly called attention to the criticism he has received as he stood 
before about 1,000 friends and former Cabinet officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to a small but noisy group of protesters stationed on the perimeter 
of the museum grounds, Nixon said, "I hope you haven't been distressed by some 
of that background noise that we've had here. I remind our young people out 
there that I've been heckled by experts." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nixon was not always so mellow in reacting to demonstrators, particularly 
Vietnam protesters, some of whom ended up on his political "enemies list." 
</P>
<P>
 In his lengthy public career, Nixon's political misfortunes took on hyperbolic 
proportions. Comedians hunched their shoulders, stuck out their chins and shook 
their heads in imitations of "Tricky Dick," repeating his famous phrases: 
"You're not going to have Dick Nixon to kick around anymore," and "I am not a 
crook." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While his present-day promoters tend to focus on his achievements, little is 
said about his secret decision to invade Cambodia, which set the stage for a 
Communist takeover of that country, or the decision to send in the National 
Guard to break up anti-war demonstrations at Kent State University in Ohio, 
which resulted in four deaths and gave the anti-war movement one of its most 
enduring images. 
</P>
<P>
 After resigning the presidency and suffering a lengthy self-imposed exile from 
the public light, Nixon has worked to restore his tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
 He has written his memoirs and other books about global politics -- his 10th 
is scheduled to be published in June -- and he has continued his involvement in 
foreign affairs. Nixon also has advised every President who has succeeded him, 
according to his staff, and has held policy discussions with leaders of other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than any policy center or book Nixon authors, the former President 
himself is the best reminder of his greatness, said Ambrose, the Nixon 
biographer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitting at a table with Nixon is to sit with history as you can do with no 
other person," Ambrose said, noting that Nixon's national political involvement 
-- which began with his election to Congress in 1946 -- spanned the Cold War. 
"You want to talk about Khrushchev? Nixon can talk about Khrushchev. He was 
there. He knew him." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon demonstrated the depth of his expertise during the ceremony at which he 
spoke for almost half an hour without relying on notes. 
</P>
<P>
 As he reminisced about the past and shared his views on how to maintain peace 
beyond the Cold War, he recited anecdotes about world leaders such as Mao Tse 
Tung, and quoted the likes of Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ceremonies, those who were invited to watch Nixon's reunion with his 
former Cabinet officers said he still had much to offer American policy 
planners. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has served his country through World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam 
War and the Cold War, and if you don't put him in that perspective -- a leader 
who has guided this nation through many crises -- you won't see the great man," 
said 32-year-old John Carvelli of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stahter, 43, also of Orange, said "Richard Nixon has an uncanny ability 
to sense the importance of events and he knows how to influence them. In some 
ways, his ability to influence world events is greater now than it has ever 
been because there is hardly anyone left of his generation." 
</P>
<P>
 While Nixon has tended to focus his attention in recent years almost 
exclusively on foreign policy matters, he also revealed Thursday that he is 
still mindful of the pressures of domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarking on Adm. Bobby Inman's decision to withdraw his name from 
consideration for defense secretary because of public attacks he expected -- a 
statement that Nixon called "strange and sad" -- the former President posed the 
question: "Was it worth it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, my answer, very briefly, is this. Politics is never going to be heaven, 
and sometimes it's hell. But it was worth the trip."

FOND MEMORIES SERVED FOR LUNCH; REUNION: 250 FRIENDS AND ADMIRERS GATHER TO 
SWAP STORIES AND OFFER TOASTS TO NIXON, WHO TOASTS THEM BACK.

 Some old friends got together for lunch Thursday. They included two former 
Presidents, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, former First Lady Betty Ford 
and past Secretaries of State George P. Schultz, Henry A. Kissinger and William 
P. Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 guests gathered for a luncheon that turned into a one-of-a-kind 
White House reunion at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace, following a 
ceremony commemorating the 25th anniversary of Nixon's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 The guest list read like a who's who in late 20th-Century American politics: 
James Schlesinger, Patrick Buchanan, Bebe Rebozo, William Simon, Donald 
Rumsfeld, Terrel Bell and George Romney, to name just a few. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House alums assembled in the lobby of the library, sitting at tables 
covered in red and blue cloths and decorated with purple irises and red tulips. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Regency Irvine prepared some of Nixon's favorite food for the lunch: 
California mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette and wild mushroom ragout in a 
filo pastry basket; salmon with a couscous crust and tomato leek sauce, and for 
dessert, poached pear with hazelnut mousse and raspberry coulis . 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the luncheon, guests stood to offer toasts that recalled their 
historic past. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, sporting a dark gray suit and burgundy tie, started things off by 
saluting Ford, his second vice president and successor to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm such a sports fanatic -- probably because I've never been good at it," 
Nixon said. "It's nice to have another chance to be near a real star." In a 
speech that morning, Nixon had made reference to Ford's football days at the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger arose to share "one or two lessons I learned from professor Nixon." 
He recalled how, when he first joined Nixon's staff, he tried to impress people 
with the "Harvard words I learned." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I got beyond one syllable, (Nixon) said, 'Remember, Henry, the 
American people will think this is a soft drink.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger also recalled his historic trip to China. "Everyone thought it was a 
great adventure -- terrific fun. But the fact is, when (Nixon) sent me off, we 
didn't really know if they'd put me in a cage and drive me through the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rebozo, Nixon's longtime friend, had a simple toast: "To history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the toasts, Nixon stood to thank his former staff, likening a President 
to a quarterback dependent on his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider all of those in my Administration the best offensive linemen a 
President ever had," he said. "I, as quarterback, pay tribute to those who made 
it all possible." 
</P>
<P>
 He also lauded his late wife, Pat, and the contributions she made to his 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of Pat listening to the same speech over and over, as if hearing it 
for the first time," he said. "I think of her suffering in silence while her 
man was attacked." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the former Cabinet members, ambassadors and other guests attending were: 
John Taylor, director of the library; George Argyros, Robert Abplanalp, Walter 
Annenberg, John Argue, Roy Ash, Arnold Beckman, Paul Bender and Virginia Knott 
Bender, Winton Blount, Peter Brennan, Claude Brinegar, Jack Drown, Robert 
Finch, Leonard Firestone, Barbara Franklin, Walter Hickel, James Hodgson, Earle 
Jorgensen, Carl Karcher, Katherine Loker, Paul McCracken, Ann Dore McLaughlin, 
Richard Moore, Peter and Mary Muth, Robert Nesen, John and Maureen Nunn, Peter 
Peterson, Samuel Pierce, Frank Shakespeare and Maurice Stans.

NIXON OPENS POLICY RESEARCH CENTER; POLITICS: THINK TANK HEADQUARTERED AT 
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY WILL FOCUS ON CONTEMPORARY WORLD ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon joined his onetime White House colleagues 
Thursday to recall the achievements of the Nixon Administration and to launch a 
new policy research center that they hope will continue the work they started 
25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a garden ceremony held between the presidential library and the tiny white 
clapboard house where the 37th President was born, Nixon's colleagues described 
him as a skillful tactician who shepherded the nation through difficult times 
and now holds a place as a revered statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeches, including three by former secretaries of state and another by 
ex-President Gerald R. Ford, portrayed the rehabilitation of the only U.S. 
President to resign from office as all but complete, promising a legacy that 
will be shaped more by his achievements than by his role in the Watergate 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Peace and Freedom, a new think tank to be headquartered at the 
library, will preserve Nixon's place in history as a key player in shaping 
world events and add a voice to the debate over contemporary political issues, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, appearing healthy and relaxed during a speech he sprinkled with humor, 
also reflected on the highs and lows of a public career he began in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was it worth it?" he said. "Politics is never going to be heaven, and 
sometimes it's hell. But it was worth the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the presence of a small but loud group of protesters, another part of his 
legacy, was turned into a joke. "I hope you haven't been distressed by some of 
that background noise that we've had here," he said. "I remind our young people 
out there that I've been heckled by experts." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, who celebrated his 81st birthday earlier this month, told the audience 
of about 1,000 invited guests that he is "not a fan of think tanks." But he 
promised that the Center for Peace and Freedom would have a unique mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The $25-million center is scheduled to open later this year with an office in 
Washington. Organizers hope to move into a permanent headquarters in a new 
building at the library by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 George L. Argyros, chairman of the fund-raising effort dubbed Legacy of Peace, 
said, "The center's goal is to ensure not only that President Nixon's legacy is 
remembered . . . but that his uniquely practical approach to the vast 
complexities of foreign and domestic policy continues to be applied in the 
uncertain new world we face in the wake of the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
 But details about the project remained murky, making it difficult to determine 
how much influence or attention the institute will command. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's secretary of state, Henry A. Kissinger, said he would serve as an 
unsalaried member of the center's board. But no other officers of the institute 
were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference after the ceremony, Kissinger said the center will be 
distinct because of its focus on "middle-term problems" -- as opposed to short- 
or long-range issues. He said that only government can respond quickly enough 
for short-term problems, and traditional think tanks usually address long-term 
political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of another institute that does this at the moment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger said examples of middle-term problems include the evolving 
relationships in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and South Africa as well as 
the emerging roles of Japan and China. Literature for the center said its 
priority "will be to have an impact on the policy-making process rather than to 
establish long-term niches for experts or scholars." 
</P>
<P>
 The center plans to establish eight endowed chairs, six focusing on foreign 
affairs in the Middle East, Europe, Japan and Russia. Two others will research 
domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was also the 25th anniversary of Nixon's first inauguration as 
President. As a result, much of the commentary was nostalgic. At times it 
resembled a celebrity roast, with former Cabinet members recalling some of the 
most important and difficult decisions they shared in the Nixon White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Nixon gave a detailed and optimistic speech about the world's 
future. Forsaking the podium that the other speakers used, he talked without 
notes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our legacy, which we have inherited from our forebears, is that we stand for 
something that is unique -- the idea of freedom," he said. "It is that heritage 
that we have that we must pass on to others. And therefore, everything that we 
can do . . . to make that great idea a unifying idea we must contribute to the 
cause of peace and freedom in the world."

UC REGENTS PANEL OKS STUDENT FEE INCREASES; EDUCATION: A $620 HIKE FOR 
UNDERGRADUATES WOULD MAKE YEARLY COSTS ALMOST THREE TIMES THE 1989 AMOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a double dose of bad news for students, a committee of the University of 
California regents on Thursday sharply increased fees for next year while 
approving a new policy that adds instruction and faculty salaries to the list 
of services those fees can be used to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recommendation of UC President Jack W. Peltason, the regent's Finance 
Committee approved a $620 per year increase in fees for undergraduates and 
instituted a new $2,000 "differential" charge for graduate students enrolled in 
the professional schools of medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, law and 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the regents' panel approved a $6,000 "duplicate diploma" fee for 
any college graduate with a bachelor's degree or higher who returns to UC for a 
second bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee increases are scheduled for consideration today by the full Board of 
Regents, which typically goes along with committee recommendations.  
</P>
<P>
 The $620 increase for undergraduates, if approved, would be the latest in a 
series of steep hikes that UC officials have imposed. It would bring the 
average undergraduate fee to $4,737 a year -- up sharply from the $1,634 they 
paid in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2,000 differential charge for professional school students would be added 
to the undergraduate amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Regents rejected such a differential pricing scheme last year, but 
undergraduates complained that it was unfair to spread fee increases evenly 
when the state provides a greater subsidy to the professional students, who are 
more expensive to teach and can be expected to earn more once they graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 UC spokesman Michael Alva said the system would net about $60 million from the 
fee increases -- money that would come on top of a $58 million, or 3.2% 
increase, that Gov. Pete Wilson has proposed in his 1994-1995 state budget. But 
that still is about $100 million short of what administrators say is needed to 
stabilize the university system.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to specific increases, regents approved a policy that allows UC 
administrators to use student fees to pay for instruction. The 1960 Master Plan 
for Higher Education called for student fees to be used strictly for support 
services, such as libraries. To emphasize the idea that the state was paying 
for an education, college officials and lawmakers have insisted on using the 
term "fees" instead of "tuition" to describe what is charged to the students. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent state budget cuts have led UC and Cal State administrators to begin 
discussing the potential of charging students for a portion of their 
instructional costs.

JURY FINDS DMV NEGLIGENT IN GIVING BLIND MAN A LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The state Department of Motor Vehicles was negligent when it gave a driver's 
license to a legally blind Brea man who later plowed his sports car into three 
people walking to church, an Orange County jury decided Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors took only four hours to determine that DMV officials knew that George 
Edgar Lizarralde, 31, could not drive safely when they gave him a license in 
1985 -- and renewed it five years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Lizarralde had been denied a license three times, but the DMV granted his 
request when he applied a fourth time, even though he failed the vision test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," Deborah Ann Mohr, one of the injured pedestrians, said when 
the jury's verdict was announced.  
</P>
<P>
 Mohr, a 32-year-old former waitress from Whittier -- along with her former 
fiance and his son -- sued the DMV. She said the accident left her with brain 
damage and a limp, and ended her marriage plans. 
</P>
<P>
 A second phase of the civil trial will continue in Orange County Superior 
Court today with the jury determining how much compensation the state agency 
should pay to the three pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan Nossoff, a spokesman for the DMV in Sacramento, declined to discuss the 
case, but said the agency was "constantly re-evaluating and attempting to weigh 
public safety as a major factor in issuing licenses to those with physical 
impairments." 
</P>
<P>
 "We handle 20 million licenses a year and we do the best we can to protect the 
community," Nossoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lizarralde, who receives federal disability payments for a debilitating eye 
disease, did not want to discuss the case, his father said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred Aug. 4, 1990, when Lizarralde drove his sports car 
through a marked pedestrian crosswalk, striking Mohr, her former fiance, Brian 
Barber, and his son, Dane. The father and son also suffered multiple injuries, 
and both walk with limps as a result of the accident, according to court papers 
filed by their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, Lizarralde told Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies that 
he had stopped to pick up a cassette player that had fallen from a seat. He 
said he looked up moments later, but he was unable to avoid hitting the 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher J. Day, a lawyer for the pedestrians, later discovered that 
Lizarralde had received disability payments since 1979 because of his eye 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 During the weeklong trial, Lizarralde's attorney, Roberta Coughlin, 
successfully petitioned Superior Court Judge Logan Moore to drop her client as 
a defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Day blamed the DMV for the accident, contending that Lizarralde never should 
have been allowed to have a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury agreed the DMV was liable, finding that Lizarralde's "vision 
deficiencies were a legal cause" of the pedestrians' injuries.

DANA PARSONS: ORANGE COUNTY NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT THE SCORE WITHOUT ITS JUMBOTRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS, Dana Parsons writes a column for the Orange County edition of 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I tried laughing. That didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did crying. 
</P>
<P>
 All I'm left with is to pound my fist into my mitt and mutter, "Say it ain't 
so, say it ain't so." 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me they didn't really say that. Tell me that nobody can be that out of 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me ask you, when you think of federal disaster relief, what comes to mind? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you think of Midwestern floods and the possessions of a lifetime 
floating downriver? Don't you think of Hurricane Andrew pummeling the 
Southeast? Don't you think of tornadoes ripping the heart out of a small town? 
</P>
<P>
 And most passionately this week, don't you think of a Los Angeles earthquake 
and 20,000 people living in tents? Of food shortages? Of emergency health 
problems? Of unsafe houses? Of schools shut down? Of psyches shattered? Of 
nearly 50 people killed, for Godsakes? 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, we think of the Sony Jumbotron. We think of an 
instant-replay scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother, can you lend a dime? 
</P>
<P>
 How about a few mil? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, thousands of our neighbors in Los Angeles are homeless, but, hey, what 
about us? We got a dead scoreboard down here, for Pete's sake! You try and live 
without instant replay and see how you like it! 
</P>
<P>
 I wish I were kidding, but that is the message sent out by Orange County 
public officials. The Board of Supervisors declared our county a state of 
emergency this week, a first step toward going after some federal disaster 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors noted, apparently without any hint of sheepishness, that the 
city of Anaheim is most eager for some federal assistance, partly because the 
city-owned stadium was damaged. That damage occurred when the giant Jumbotron 
scoreboard collapsed into the left field stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the overwhelming devastation in Los Angeles, the reaction of most people 
to the scoreboard collapse likely was a big "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not Orange County. We didn't develop the stereotype out of thin air that we're 
an isolated, unfeeling, materialistic bastion of self-aggrandizement. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked flat-out whether stadium damage should qualify for assistance, 
Supervisor Tom Riley should have spotted that as a fastball down the middle. 
You prayed he'd have said something like, "Given the massive destruction in Los 
Angeles, I doubt any of us would feel too comfortable asking for money that 
could go to people in need." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the board chairman, he of the good life down here, replied: "If the 
criteria makes it eligible under the law, I think you should get your share." 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Antoinette would have loved this place. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if the county writes a real spiffy application grant, it can ace out a 
school or an orphanage for the last few thousand bucks of federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next, Newport Beach asking for funds to replace the giant guitar atop 
the Hard Rock Cafe? (Hey, I'm just kidding; it wasn't damaged).  
</P>
<P>
 I presume this is all handled through paperwork. I almost wish it weren't; I 
wish someone had to go in person and ask for the relief money. 
</P>
<P>
 Call me a softie, but I'd hate to be the guy standing in line asking for money 
for Jumbotron when the person next to me was asking for food and water. "Well, 
you see, sir, we have this real cool scoreboard and it fell down and made a 
helluva mess." 
</P>
<P>
 In applying for state-of-emergency status, the supervisors noted that part of 
the justification is because the county helped Los Angeles during the emergency 
and, therefore, should get some money back. Whatever sense that made was 
obliterated by the open declaration that Anaheim also wanted money for the 
scoreboard repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, someone needs to pay for Jumbotron, although my initial question 
would be why the quake caused the thing to collapse in the first place, given 
that not much else was damaged in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure the government works in mysterious ways, but it's hard to imagine any 
federal relief official approving the Anaheim request. The underpinning of 
American public support for disaster relief is that any of us can picture 
ourselves in the place of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 We can picture working into the night with sandbags against the floodwaters, 
only to lose everything. We can imagine carrying heirlooms from the house 
before disaster strikes. We can empathize with people huddled in the basement 
as the twister strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But an electronic blinking scoreboard that happens to topple into the cheap 
seats? 
</P>
<P>
 Go to the end of the line, buddy. We're trying to help people whose lives have 
unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably, our local officials won't understand why people will be outraged 
when they hear that Orange County wants to elbow its way up to the trough to 
repair ol' Jumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they don't, that's exactly the point.

WILSON GETS SMOG BILL DEFYING EPA; POLLUTION: SENATE APPROVES PROGRAM OVERHAUL 
THAT FAILS TO MEET REQUIREMENT THAT CAR TESTING AND REPAIR OPERATIONS BE 
SEPARATED. BUT THREAT OF PENALTIES HAS BEEN EASED TEMPORARILY BECAUSE OF QUAKE 
DEVASTATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Risking a court fight with the Clinton Administration, the state Senate on 
Thursday sent Gov. Pete Wilson a major overhaul of California's vehicle Smog 
Check program. 
</P>
<P>
 A bipartisan 26-5 vote sent the bill to Wilson, who has said he will sign it 
even though federal environmental officials say it falls short of bringing the 
smoggiest regions of California into compliance with federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Protection Agency announced Jan. 7 that it intends to impose 
discretionary penalties in the form of highway funds withheld from California 
for failure to meet federal clean air laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Nichols, the EPA's assistant administrator for smog issues, said 
Monday that devastation caused by the Northridge earthquake is likely to ease 
that threat for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters and opponents of the bill agreed that the issue will probably move 
to the courthouse for a potentially long fight as the six-month confrontation 
between the state and federal governments escalates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the proposed program would provide for high-tech roadside 
sensors that would identify heavily polluting vehicles. So-called gross 
emitters, the heaviest polluters, would be banned from the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would require Smog Check technicians to undergo more stringent 
training, mandate testing of vehicles with the wheels spinning instead of the 
engine idling, create a statewide computer system to monitor the performance of 
Smog Check stations, and substantially toughen penalties for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson favors the plan because it protects the jobs of mechanics at 9,000 Smog 
Check garages and service stations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Legislature on Thursday, veteran clean air advocate Sen. Robert B. 
Presley (D-Riverside) unsuccessfully pleaded for additional time to try to 
reach an accord with the EPA. "It makes no sense to jam this thing through," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill's author, Sen. Newton R. Russell (R-Glendale), countered that the 
measure would satisfy the federal law. "We've got a program that has been 
beefed up, improved and will do the job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who led opposition to the Russell proposal, 
warned that the EPA has shown no signs of backing away from demands for tougher 
smog checks. He noted that the federal arsenal of sanctions also includes more 
stringent controls on industrial sources of pollution, if smog checks of 
vehicles are inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Glenn, an EPA spokesman in San Francisco, said that the bill "doesn't 
take us any closer to a solution of the Smog Check issue. We still want to sit 
down with the state and work this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that the current program, under which California cars are 
inspected once every two years, contains a built-in conflict of interest for 
Smog Check operators to deliberately flunk vehicles to get the repair business. 
Industry officials deny these charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA and such organizations as the Sierra Club and American Lung Assn. 
favor separating testing from repairs. Under the EPA-favored plan, cars and 
trucks would be tested in a centralized network of inspection stations that 
would be prohibited from doing repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental advocates argue that such a system would do a better job of 
cleaning the air and be faster, cheaper and more effective for motorists.  
</P>

 Russell, who seldom votes in favor of smog-control legislation, accused the 
federal government of bullying California and prohibiting the state from 
designing its own smog-fighting strategies.

<P>
 "The federal EPA has said they know what is best for the states and, by golly, 
the state of California better not blunder through what (EPA) wants," he said. 
He said the California bill proposed a better way.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; MTA CLOSES DOWNTOWN SUBWAY TO EXAMINE STRENGTH 
OF TUNNELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Downtown Los Angeles subway, although it sustained no visible earthquake 
damage, will be shut down this weekend to allow technicians evaluating the 
tunnels' structural integrity to complete their work, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing is not related to any safety hazard, but the closure of the tracks 
will help a special investigative panel to complete its work within the next 
few weeks, according to Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Line was closed Monday because of quake-related electrical problems 
and reopened Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the weekend closure came as transit officials provided 
television camera crews and reporters a tour Thursday of a tunnel under 
construction near MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The durability and structural soundness of the 1.8 miles of twin tunnels now 
in service between Union Station and Pershing Square are subjects of an ongoing 
inquiry by a panel of three specialists appointed by the MTA. The panel is also 
examining the remaining tunnels on the Red Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluation of the structures has been under way since fall, after a Times 
report that tunnel segments were built with concrete thinner than the 12 inches 
specified by designers. The panel, whose work has been described as wholly 
independent of the MTA staff, is expected to issue its findings sometime next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, MTA rail construction President Edward McSpedon told 
reporters that instrumentation data gathered by the tunnel panel showed that 
Monday's quake caused no changes in any of the pre-existing cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the (instrumentation) equipment was down there, we did ask whether 
there was any noticeable change in those cracks. And the answer was, 'No, the 
cracks have not changed, related to the earthquake,' " McSpedon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, MTA officials said that only visual inspections, and not measurements, 
had been performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other MTA officials, along with Federal Transportation Administration head 
Gordon J. Linton, said that the tunnels, by surviving in apparently good 
condition, have passed an important test. 
</P>
<P>
 "The riding public can be assured of the safety of the Metro Red Line," said 
Chairman Richard Alatorre, a Los Angeles City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Alatorre and Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White also said that 
final judgments about the tunnel should be withheld until the special panel 
issues its report. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Gonzalez, an aide to White, said that in addition to evaluating the 
concrete thickness, the testing this weekend will seek to verify the proper 
placement of rods of reinforcing steel. Called rebar, the rods are crucial to 
helping the tunnels withstand the bending forces of an earthquake, according to 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech professor emeritus George W. Housner, an authority on earthquake 
design engineering, said the MTA's panel, having already identified the cracks 
that existed in the structures before the quake, should check for any changes. 
Noting that seismic measurements of ground-shaking intensity in the Central 
City showed up to two times less impact than nearer the San Fernando Valley 
epicenter, Housner said Downtown structures still received motion that was 
moderate to strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Housner chaired a state government commission that studied the disastrous 1989 
Loma Prieta quake and made recommendations regarding the design of structures 
and transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Cording, a soils engineering specialist who is the chairman of the 
MTA's tunnel panel, declined to discuss the group's work before its findings 
are made public. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Richard P. Kennedy, an engineer employed by the tunnel panel as a 
seismic expert, said in an interview before the earthquake that the cracks in 
the tunnels between Union Station and Pershing Square are out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are cracks in the concrete that are bigger than desirable," Kennedy 
said. "Clearly, the tunnel isn't built in accordance with the design in certain 
locations. It's too thin; there may not be the rebar."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; WHEELS OF JUSTICE TURN -- SLOWLY IF NOT 
SMOOTHLY -- AS COURTS IMPROVISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Instead of the harsh white lights that usually glare down on the master 
calendar court for misdemeanors at the Downtown Los Angeles Criminal Courts 
Building, that mini-arena of justice was bathed in soft rays more befitting a 
mood-drenched fern bar. 
</P>
<P>
 An ornate brass lamp with a tall, tilted shade sat near Municipal Judge Peter 
D. Lichtman as he issued bench warrants and took pleas Thursday. Four other 
lamps, shaded and unshaded, lit tables where a small army of defense lawyers 
and prosecutors shuffled through court files. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is weird, a little eerie and a little neat," said Virgil Reevis, who was 
in court with his sister for her appearance in a theft case. 
</P>
<P>
 It was disaster adjustment -- criminal justice style -- as the massive 
courthouse on Temple Street reopened to the public for the first time since 
Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the Downtown facility reopened, others remained closed -- 
including the Van Nuys courthouse, causing deliberations in the Menendez murder 
trial to be postponed again, at least until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials were assessing several other outlying courthouses, 
including one in San Fernando that sustained major structural damage in the 
quake. Robert M. Mallano, presiding judge of the Los Angeles County Superior 
Court, said the building was so badly damaged that court personnel have not 
been allowed inside to retrieve files and computer data. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallano said no decision will be made about the fate of the building until 
detailed engineers' reports are completed, probably by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando and Van Nuys courthouses -- both in the San Fernando Valley, 
where the earthquake was centered -- handle a quarter of the cases heard in Los 
Angeles County, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Courthouses also were closed in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Newhall and 
Calabasas, for the most part because of asbestos in the air, Mallano said. 
Juvenile Courts in Eastlake and Sylmar were also closed but are expected to 
reopen next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallano and Alban I. Niles, presiding judge of the county Municipal Court, 
said the earthquake had challenged but not halted the wheels of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 What could have been a crisis in the courts was also tempered, they said, by 
the extraordinary low number of arrests since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases that have to be heard -- and had been assigned to courts that are now 
closed -- are being moved to other courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm proud of most of the judges, who have done everything they could 
to help out," Niles said. 
</P>
<P>
 To further relieve pressure on the court system, the state Legislature 
approved an emergency bill Thursday that allows jurists to delay arraignments 
up to seven days, bypassing a law that requires suspects to hear the formal 
charges against them within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Malcolm Lucas, chief judge of the California Supreme 
Court, declared a judicial emergency in Los Angeles County, allowing judges to 
postpone trials for up to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downtown Criminal Courts Building was closed after the 6.6 temblor 
loosened ceiling tiles and caused flooding on some floors, requiring a cutoff 
of water and much of the power. 
</P>
<P>
 In places where electricity had not been restored in the 19-story building 
Thursday, some judges -- including Lichtman -- made do with lamps that looked 
like they had been commandeered from someone's house.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SANTA MONICA'S LOW RENT MAY BE A QUAKE 
CASUALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mother Nature has done for Santa Monica landlords what 15 years of lawsuits 
could not: evict more than 1,000 low-rent tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a classic Pyrrhic victory because their apartment buildings may have 
been lost as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Early estimates indicate that about 100 rent-controlled apartment buildings 
are uninhabitable in a city that probably has the toughest rent control law in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 That means tenants in the estimated 1,000 units in those buildings, who paid 
as little as $300 a month, are now facing rents many times that. And many 
$500-a-month, ocean-view apartments may go the way of the 5-cent stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that guards each rent-controlled unit as if it were the Hope 
Diamond, rent control long has been close to the hottest local issue, rivaled 
only by what to do about the homeless. Opposing rent control dooms a candidate 
in local elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The destruction caused by the temblor thus is expected to set off a legal and 
political tremor that will reverberate long after the Santa Monica Freeway is 
in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake has created a lot of economic havoc in Santa Monica," said 
Mary Ann Yurkonis, administrator of the Santa Monica Rent Board. "This is 
clearly going to have the long-term effect of decreasing the number of 
affordable units." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, even if most of the units are rebuilt, Santa Monica renters who are 
used to paying wholesale for housing are in for sticker shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be rent increases," Rent Board member Lisa Monk Borrino said. 
"It's naive to think there won't be." 
</P>
<P>
 Still to be determined is whether landlords who rebuild will be free to charge 
full market value for their units -- a development that would send rents 
skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced tenants in line seeking financial assistance at a local FEMA 
disaster center Thursday were already talking about high prices, brokers fees 
and coming up with first and last months rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Johnson had lived for nine years on the third floor of the historic Sea 
Castle, located at the beach near Pico Boulevard. Her rent, utilities included, 
was $450. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been calling about apartments," she said, "but they want a $3,000 
finders' fee. Who has that kind of money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under current controls, the Rent Board each year sets a tight cap on rent 
increases for the city's 30,000 apartment units. Recently, the allowable 
increase has been 3% to 4%. As a result, people hold on to their apartments for 
years or decades. Landlords, in turn, constantly clamor for relief, turning to 
the courts and state Legislature in a bid to charge market levels -- at least 
after tenants move out. 
</P>
<P>
 In wake of the earthquake, many displaced tenants were suspicious that their 
landlords would use the catastrophe to get rid of them and perhaps get higher 
rents, or even convert to condos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council has already passed one law this week to 
facilitate the repair process, waiving permit fees. Council members will 
discuss what to do about buildings needing major or total reconstruction at a 
special session Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick for them is to balance their strict low-rent thinking with the need 
to give apartment owners incentive to repair or rebuild by allowing them to 
recoup the cost through increased rents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to preserve every single housing unit we can," Mayor Judy Abdo said. 
"We want people living in them to get them back." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, the pro-rent control forces almost certainly will have to 
accommodate landlords to encourage them to rebuild, an unusual situation in 
light of a 15-year relationship of strife and distrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdo said this will not be a problem because of a shared goal with landlords: 
"Their desire to have tenants in their building paying rent is the same desire 
that we have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The question left to decide is how high the rents can go. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Sullivan, owner of one of the largest Santa Monica property management 
companies, said owners are of a mind to rebuild if possible. "If the Rent Board 
is reasonable . . . most landlords will repair their buildings. If they are not 
reasonable, they won't because they won't be able to afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although tenants might suppose that landlords are gleeful at the prospect of 
higher rents -- or getting out from rent control altogether, as is possible in 
some cases -- that is not true, according to landlords and their 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has not helped landlords at all," attorney Chris Harding said. The 
property owners still have their mortgage payments to make, he noted, but they 
have no tenants paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica officials are working to attract state preservation money to 
assist in rehabilitating those buildings of historic significance, Abdo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are the Sovereign, the El Cortez and the Charmont, all apartment 
buildings in the hardest-hit section in the north end of Santa Monica. The 
historic 150-unit Sea Castle seems beyond repair, however, despite promises by 
city officials to fight to get it rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Borrino predicted that the city will be able to save many of the buildings 
that are currently tagged as unsafe. Rent Board officials worry that some 
panicked tenants will act rashly and give up hope -- or their units -- before 
inspectors and engineers take a more thorough look at the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 They even recommend, if at all possible, paying the rent.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SANTA MONICA ROLLS WITH THE PUNCHES; 
RESILIENCE: THE CITY SUFFERED SEVERE DAMAGE; HOMES AND BUSINESSES WERE 
DESTROYED. BUT LIFE GOES ON AND THE CIVIC SPIRIT ENDURES.

 Santa Monica never was eager to relinquish its claim to paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever adversity tampered with its image as a progressive haven of hipness 
-- when its bay grew poisoned or sympathy for the homeless wore thin -- 
residents did not flee for more pristine sands. They debated, they reflected, 
then got back to life at the edge of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Monday's temblor delivered a surprisingly fierce blow to this 
rent-controlled enclave, claiming three heart attack victims, seriously 
damaging more than 400 structures and snapping its namesake freeway, there was 
plenty of soul-searching and grief. But by Thursday, after work crews had 
steam-cleaned the trendy Third Street Promenade, many beachfront denizens 
already were displaying their resilience -- smartly dressed professionals 
sipping cafe au lait, senior citizens on Ocean Avenue relishing the fresh air, 
even panhandlers exulting over a generous spurt of donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about the spirit of the people here that creates a real 
conviviality," said Denny Zane, an environmental activist and former mayor, 
whose kitchen floor was turned into a stew of olive oil, maple syrup, vinegar 
and broken glass. "The quake may stay in our minds for a long time to come . . 
. but I don't think it will change Santa Monica's sense of connectedness, of 
being a real welcoming place." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the earthquake has upended life for hundreds of residents, many of 
whom have been on edge since a string of smaller temblors began rattling Santa 
Monica more than a week ago. As of Thursday, 139 structures had been condemned 
and 272 were deemed to have major damage. Several buildings collapsed, while at 
least a dozen burst into flames. The Sea Castle apartments -- a local landmark 
whose tenants have included folk singer Joan Baez -- suffered a partially 
caved-in roof. At the city's Woodlawn Cemetery, life-size statues of the Virgin 
Mary toppled to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside her 4th Street apartment, Kimberly Rogers was stuffing what was left 
of her belongings into plastic bags. The quake's violent shaking had peeled 
away the facade of the building like a doll house, revealing the interiors of 
four debris-strewn rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake struck Monday, Rogers already had been awake for half an hour 
curling her hair, a chore for which she now feels grateful. "I would have been 
killed if I had stayed in bed," she said, looking at the pile of red bricks not 
far from her pillow. "Vanity saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Gawkers and amateur photographers also have been streaming through the city, 
tying up traffic while they pass along word of the most sensational 
destruction. "Have you seen the Pep Boys?" asks one. Demolished. "Have you been 
to St. Monica's Church?" asks another. A precariously cracked tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the untold story," Robin Hutton, a 35-year-old writer from Brentwood, 
said as she aimed her video camera at a Mazda showroom on Santa Monica 
Boulevard, where the roof had caved in on a dozen high-priced sports cars. "The 
devastation is unbelievable, just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given a brief audience Wednesday with President Clinton, Santa Monica Mayor 
Judy Abdo reiterated that point. "Los Angeles is the generic term for where the 
problem is," she told the President in an airplane hangar at Burbank Airport. 
"But Santa Monica has an enormous amount of damage that is not being talked 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is something about Santa Monica that not even a magnitude 6.6 
earthquake is going to change. Maybe it's the buoyant spirit that so many 
communities dig down to discover after a disaster. Or maybe it's something 
unique to a town that was known for a time as the People's Republic of Santa 
Monica, where choice rent-controlled apartments go for less than $500 and the 
City Council fired the city attorney after he resisted efforts to crack down on 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake is tragic, but not something that transforms life," said Steve 
Cancian, assistant coordinator of the city's weekly farmer's market, which was 
canceled Wednesday because of damage at several nearby parking structures. "The 
uncertainty of it all is actually part of the mystique, part of the slightly 
unreal nature of this place." 
</P>
<P>
 While nearby cleanup crews hauled off bricks and boarded up windows, Johnny 
Rockets reopened its doors, even though its normal burger and fries menu was 
reduced to tuna salad, egg salad and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Valentino, the haute Italian restaurant, also was back in business, albeit 
minus about 30,000 shattered bottles from owner Piero Selvaggio's prized wine 
cellar. At the Reel Inn, a seafood restaurant on the Promenade, a plywood board 
covering the front window had been converted into an idyllic seaside scene with 
painted palms, waves and a sweltering sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be snowing," the sign reminded. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, people in Santa Monica live almost on an island," said Michael 
Bolger, 31, manager of Big Dogs sportswear shop a few doors away. "Ultimately, 
their problems just go poof and they go back to living the great California 
Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 For Capucine Castets, however, the problems have just begun. Along with her 
husband and infant child, she has been living on 5th Street all week in an old 
Ford camper, forced outside by two chimneys that collapsed into her rented 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who haven't had the damage think that you're overreacting," the 
39-year-old modeling agent said as she watched workers shovel debris into a 
giant dumpster on her front lawn. "My boss basically told me to call a doctor 
and get some Valium." 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't bad enough that her residence of 14 years may soon be condemned, 
Castets was facing the grim prospect of being squeezed out of town altogether. 
As a renter in vacancy-scarce Santa Monica -- a community people wait to join, 
not flee -- she feared it would be impossible to find another place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seriously considering just leaving California," she said. "I'm 
certainly not going to live in Hollywood or Burbank or something. Santa Monica 
is the whole reason you can endure L.A."

RAPE CHARGES SHAKE HOMELESS VILLAGE; CRIME: TWO LEADERS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL 
DOMED ENCAMPMENT ARE ACCUSED OF ATTACKING A TV HOST WHO BEFRIENDED THEM. ONE IS 
ALSO WANTED IN THE MURDER OF HIS WIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 They were the First Couple of Genesis I, Los Angeles' celebrated domed village 
for the homeless. Eri Burns, 38, was the office manager, and her roommate, Bill 
Matthews, 48, was in charge of maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting news media became interested in the couple. Burns, perhaps the most 
articulate resident of the village, told an elaborate story of how she had once 
been a success in the real estate business, only to wind up on the streets 
because of an abusive, drug-addict husband. 
</P>
<P>
 She told about then meeting Matthews on a blind date -- arranged by homeless 
friends. Matthews, in turn, told a reporter: "The minute I laid eyes on her, I 
fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
 Now both are under arrest for allegedly kidnaping and raping a cable TV host 
who had befriended them. And Matthews, it turns out, is a fugitive sought under 
another name in the New Jersey slaying of his wife with a crossbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Both pleaded not guilty this week to a number of counts and were ordered 
jailed until their arraignment Feb. 1. Bail for Matthews was set at $1 million 
and for Burns at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Genesis I leaders vowed to continue their project but the arrests further 
tarnish the image of the much-touted Downtown village that was supposed to 
demonstrate that the homeless could govern themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by Ted Hayes, a flamboyant advocate for the homeless, under a $250,000 
grant from Arco, Genesis I was different from the start. In contrast to the 
formal structure and rigid discipline found at most local missions, individual 
choice and self-rule became the hallmarks of the encampment of 18 fiberglass 
domes at Golden Avenue and 9th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "No rules and regulations," Hayes said. "You're free to be who you are." 
</P>
<P>
 While few of the approximately two dozen original residents showed much talent 
for leadership, there were a couple of exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Burns, a former resident of Daytona Beach, Fla., who had ended up on 
the streets of Los Angeles as a panhandler. The other was Matthews, who said he 
had left his job as a plumber in New York City and traveled around the country 
until his money ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 While Burns and Matthews were still out on Downtown streets, some people who 
knew both of them fixed them up on a blind date. When the domes went up in 
November, the couple moved into one of them, sharing a living room, kitchen, 
bedroom and storage area. 
</P>
<P>
 They also took over the camp's cleanup patrol, determined that Genesis would 
not look like nearby Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lived like pigs . . . down there," Matthews, who generally avoided 
interviews, told a reporter in September. "I wasn't raised to live like that, 
and I won't." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I felt like a leper," Burns said. "Now there's all this attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, a month into the experiment, crises started to overwhelm the 
little village. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bags of donated clothing and food began disappearing. Simple chores -- 
security watches and dining-room cleanup -- went undone. Some residents left 
the village by choice and others were forced out for drug use and stealing. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Genesis I was different, the news media kept stoping by. One of 
the visitors was the cable television host, who helped many residents of the 
village, including the couple, after interviewing them for a story. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was our friend," Hayes said of the woman. "She brought Eri clothes."  
</P>

 Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Habeeb said the woman, whose name is being withheld 
because of the nature of the crime, even lent the couple her car last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They picked her up Downtown, and they were supposed to take her back to Dome 
City," Habeeb said. "Instead, they drove her around in Downtown Los Angeles 
while she was repeatedly attacked in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Habeeb said the couple, armed with a knife, forced the woman to participate in 
a variety of sexual acts. At some point, Burns got out of the car and Matthews 
continued the attacks alone, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Matthews got out of the car and walked away, investigators said. The 
victim drove home and called police, and the couple were arrested at Genesis I 
a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews was charged Wednesday with three counts of rape, four counts of 
forcible oral copulation, penetration by a foreign object, robbery, kidnaping 
for the purpose of rape and kidnaping for the purpose of robbery. Burns was 
charged with aiding and abetting rape, forced oral copulation and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fingerprint checks show that Matthews is wanted in New Jersey under the name 
of Arthur Wesley Smith in the 1992 murder of his wife, the district attorney's 
office said. The story of the crossbow murder, with Smith as the prime suspect, 
was featured in an "America's Most Wanted" television broadcast later that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Fox Broadcasting Co. said Smith had met his wife, Martha, 
through a personal ad while serving time in New Jersey for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Genesis I would not comment on the arrests Thursday. But Katy 
Haber, an outside public relations director for the village, said they felt 
betrayed by the crimes of which Matthews and Burns are accused. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, the village's leader, said Genesis I will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the 15 residents here, most of these people are all right. They have 
their problems, but they're all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one person, a thug, who tried to escape the law from living here 
among the homeless," Hayes said. "This happens in all segments of our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dear, a USC professor who is working on a six-month assessment of 
Genesis, said the incident may cause setbacks but will not seriously damage the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to see a long-term effect there," Dear said. "Nobody 
expected a rose garden."

 We don't like the beat: Someone scrawled this rock 'n' roll-out-of-bed lyric 
on a wall along Pico Boulevard in West L.A.:

 Shaky public relations? In case you were wondering, Rancho Cucamonga's 
baseball team has no intention of changing its nickname -- the Quakes. Just 
look at Scott Dewees' picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't take that name because we take quakes lightheartedly," explained 
Greg Scharlach, a spokesman for the year-old club. "We did a lot of research 
beforehand and found that there had been thousands of quakes in this area. 
Locals even call it quake country." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, Scharlach said, but the quakes had "caused some fault lines to 
trap underground water in this area," which enabled potato and wine growers to 
prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the quakes," he concluded, "we wouldn't have Cucamonga." 
</P>
<P>
 The team, whose stadium suffered no damage, is also retaining its mascot: 
Tremor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironies, ironies . . . A customer in line at a Cal Fed bank in Los Feliz 
noticed an ad for mortgage loans that said, "You find the house, we'll provide 
the foundation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, to think, people say L.A.'s the plastic city: The 1933 Long Beach 
earthquake 
</P>
<P>
 heavily damaged the parapet gracing the entrance to the Newberry Building in 
Torrance, but the landmark suffered no such problem in the 1994 Northridge 
quake. Not that anyone was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 The building -- now a supermarket -- was restored last year, and the parapet 
was constructed so that "it's not going to fall at all," boasted city planning 
assistant Terence Yoo. And even if it did. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's made out of plastic foam. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A list that may make you lose some sleep: Old-timers have their own theories 
about what constitutes "earthquake weather." But what about "earthquake hour"?  
</P>
<P>
 This might be merely a statistical quirk, but it's nevertheless true that 
almost all of Southern California's major shakers over the last 150 years have 
occurred relatively close to dusk or dawn, including, of course, the 4:31 a.m. 
Northridge quake. The others: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Tejon (7.7+ magnitude), 1857, about 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Northwest L.A. (6.0+), 1893, 11:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Santa Barbara (6.3), 1925, 6:42 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Long Beach (6.3), 1933, 5:54 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Tehachapi (7.7), 1952, 4:52 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- Sylmar (6.6), 1971, 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Whittier (5.9) 1987, 7:42 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Sierra Madre (5.8), 1991, 7:43 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Landers (7.4), 1992, 4:58 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Big Bear (6.5), 1992, 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laugh relief: For the rest of the month, any quake victim who shows up at the 
Laugh Factory on Sunset Boulevard with evidence -- be it the remainder of a 
vase, picture frame or door -- will be admitted free to a show. That seems 
quite generous to us -- we'd have thought they would have had a two-broken-item 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s still on the go . . . KNX radio reporter Jim Thornton came up with this 
line after one aftershock: "The traffic is stopped, but the freeways are 
moving."

 St. John's hospital in Santa Monica, sometimes called Hospital to the Stars

RON HARRIS: EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE GIVES THE HOMELESS TEMPORARY 
COMPANY IN THEIR DAILY MISERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil and his rag-tag compatriots sat squat on a two-foot-high wall bordering 
the Lucky supermarket parking lot at Lennox Avenue and Vanowen Street. They 
stared blank-faced across the street at their new neighbors, scores of Van Nuys 
residents pushed out into the street by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't talk much. Occasionally one of them would make a comment or take a 
sip, but mostly they just watched the newly homeless across the street in an 
athletic field, camped out in their cars and vans, spread out on bedspreads, 
huddled under blankets and makeshift tents. 
</P>
<P>
 They watched as the adults gathered to swap stories, trade information or just 
commiserate with their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 They could see children hustling up and down the basketball court or riding 
their bicycles around the field. 
</P>
<P>
 They could smell aromas wafting up from the barbecue pits that burned all day 
as families prepared meals. And they could see the concern on the faces of 
those who now found themselves dreading the night and wondering what the next 
day would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a new joke on the street," said Phil, 51, whose only asset is an old 
white Chevy. "The new joke is that they've been calling us bums, they call us 
dirt, they say to us, 'Go get a job,' and now because of this earthquake, they 
are just like us. Now we say to them, 'Go get a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of his friends smiled slightly in amusement. But quiet quickly 
returned to the gathering because deep down they all knew that the people over 
there scattered across the field of the Van Nuys Rec Center weren't just like 
them. Phil knew it. So did Jack and Bogie and Jana and Victor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fence bordering the athletic field and recreation center served as a 
reminder. It provided comfort and a sense of safety for the new homeless 
neighbors. It was a barrier to Phil and his friends. Keep out. Stay away. This 
is not for you.  
</P>
<P>
 While the people across the street sleep under blankets and sleeping bags, 
Phil and his crew hunker down in cardboard boxes on the hard asphalt parking 
lot behind Lucky or down by the Los Angeles River or in abandoned houses or in 
the local armory or near the police substation over on Tyrone. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, various agencies, volunteers and individual good Samaritans come 
laden with food and gifts for the newly homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the care packages are not intended for Phil and his friends, they 
have become inadvertent recipients of this outpouring of concern, standing in 
line in a nearby parking lot for the earthquake rations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I haven't eaten this good in a while," said Bogie, 38, patting his 
stomach. "I ate three times today. It's the first hot meals I've had in three 
days. I tell you, when these people get their power back on, we'll be missing 
those meals." 
</P>
<P>
 But misery loves company, and for a moment, Phil would like to think that he 
has some kinship, some connection, with those people who are down on their 
luck, and maybe they have some kinship to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend asked me to take him over to check on his grandfather because he 
kept calling him and he didn't answer the telephone," he began. "So, I said if 
you put some gas in my car, OK. We went over there, and everything was 
destroyed. Everything! Wasn't nothing left but some orange trees and some 
grapefruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never did find him, but he must be OK because he wasn't there. That guy 
worked for Water and Power all of his life and now ain't nothing left but those 
orange bushes. Everything is gone. Just like me.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a beautiful life once, but just like that earthquake, everything went 
down one day," said Phil, who has been on the streets for six years. "I rode 
racehorses, I sold cars, I worked in the brewery for 28 years. But then I lost 
my family, I lost my kids, I lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked at Budweiser over on Roscoe. Worked seven days a week. I worked 
there for 23 years. I would get cars and fix them up and sell them. It was too 
much work. My wife complained that I was never home. But I didn't know. I 
thought I was getting ahead, because I didn't have no education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I worked at Miller for five years. That was just five days a week. But I 
had burned myself out. My wife left me. My kids were 20 years old and they 
didn't even know me. I lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Phil fell silent, and gradually reality crept in. He sniffed the aroma of 
chicken and beef and corn that drifted toward him on clouds of smoke from 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 He ogled the tents and bright blue tarps dotting the field. He listened to the 
laughter of the children playing freely among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like an adventure to them," he said. "Those people got money." And he 
admitted to himself that they weren't really the same. Eventually, most all of 
the people in that park, he knew, would leave. But Phil and his friends would 
still be there on the streets of Van Nuys.

JUDGE APPROVES DRUG REHAB FOR RICK JAMES; COURTS: MUSICIAN CONVICTED OF ASSAULT 
COULD BE FREED BY SEPTEMBER. PROBE CONTINUES INTO THE CONDUCT OF HIS CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deal allowing funk singer Rick James, convicted of assaulting women and 
other offenses, to go into a drug rehabilitation center instead of prison 
received court approval Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement, which could lead James' freedom as early as September, was 
made after the Los Angeles County district attorney's office revealed that the 
conduct of his case is the subject of an internal investigation.Sources close 
to the case said the investigation focuses on allegations that a district 
attorney's investigator provided heroin to a key witness at James' trial. 
</P>
<P>
 At a brief hearing in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, Superior Court Referee 
Laura Heimowitz accepted a psychiatric evaluation prescribing that James be 
sent to the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco, under a deal struck 
between the musician's attorney and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, James pleaded no contest to an assault charge against a 
woman at his Hollywood Hills home and was sentenced to five years and four 
months in prison. Coupled with earlier convictions for assault, false 
imprisonment and furnishing drugs, the self-proclaimed "King of Funk" could 
have been given 14 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff set aside a four-year 
prison sentence for James' girlfriend, Tanya Anne Hijazi, 23, convicted of 
taking part in some of the crimes. The judge said Hijazi, who will be 
resentenced next month, should not receive a stiffer penalty than James. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi and James were convicted last September of assaulting Mary Sauger, 35, 
of West Hollywood, at the St. James's Club and Hotel on Sunset Boulevard.

CLOSED COURTHOUSE DELAYS LYLE MENENDEZ CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unprecedented delay for a high-profile trial, court officials have put 
off deliberations in the Lyle Menendez murder case until at least Monday 
because of earthquake damage to the Van Nuys courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court officials had hoped to resume deliberations Thursday. But the 
courthouse, in the San Fernando Valley just a few miles east of the quake's 
epicenter, remained closed as inspectors tested for asbestos exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said the long and traumatic layoff will inevitably have a 
substantial impact on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major life events change people's perspectives," said Laurie Levenson, a 
professor at Loyola law school. "They may have a new perspective on the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, are charged with murder in the Aug. 
20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their wealthy parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and 
Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 The sons admit they shot the parents Aug. 20, 1989, in the TV room of the 
family's Beverly Hills mansion. But they testified during the six-month trial 
that they fired in fear and self-defense after years of physical, emotional and 
sexual abuse. Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and 
greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries heard the case because some evidence was admitted against only one 
brother. Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg declared a mistrial in the 
Erik Menendez case on Jan. 13 after that jury reported it was hopelessly 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury deliberated for a 22nd day on Jan. 14 without having 
sent any notes to the judge signaling a deadlock. Its last note, sent Jan. 13, 
asked three questions on legal definitions relating to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake caused major damage to the sixth and seventh floors of the Van 
Nuys courthouse, knocking ceiling tiles, courtroom paneling and at least one 
slab of marble to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that the shaking may have released asbestos particles into the air, 
inspectors set up specialized nozzles around the courthouse Thursday to test 
for fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Letteau, supervising judge at the courthouse, said he is hopeful of 
reopening next week. If the building can't be reopened by then, court officials 
said, the Lyle Menendez jury could be placed in one of several trailers ringing 
the courthouse -- usually used as extra courtrooms -- or in the Van Nuys 
Municipal Court building next door. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely that deliberations will be moved to Downtown Los Angeles or to 
another court location, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 All 12 Lyle Menendez jurors -- and the sole remaining alternate -- live in the 
San Fernando Valley. It did not appear that any jurors were hurt in the quake, 
but court officials said several jurors, reached Thursday morning by phone, 
reported that they were not yet ready to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said there was no question that the deliberations can resume. 
Los Angeles courts have faced delays before -- such as after the 1992 riots -- 
though not this long. 
</P>
<P>
 If the courthouse remains shut next week, the toughest question facing 
Weisberg will be how long to wait before ordering jurors back to court. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases of "extraordinary circumstances," judges have wide leeway to run 
their courtrooms as they see fit, and circumstances this week are "as 
extraordinary as they get," Levenson noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors might be angry if ordered back before they are ready, the experts said. 
But there's no way to predict how the quake will affect deliberations when they 
resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fate of the Menendez brothers and the cosmic significance of this case 
has to have been reduced in perspective, given the reality we've all gone 
through these last few days," said Robert Pugsley, a Southwestern University 
professor of criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weighing against that is the fact that they've invested six months of their 
lives and energy in the trial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think that the jurors will press quickly for any compromise that was in 
the works when the case was interrupted, if there was such a compromise," 
Pugsley added. "Or if they can quickly determine that compromise is not in the 
works without several more days of discussion, then (they) will report 
themselves hung."

BODYGUARD: HARDING WAS INVOLVED IN PLOT; CONSPIRACY: IN NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW, 
ECKARDT SAYS SKATER WAS UPSET THAT ATTACK ON KERRIGAN TOOK SO LONG TO BE 
CARRIED OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 As investigators and prosecutors continued to sift through evidence Thursday 
in the Jan. 6 attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, a Multnomah County grand 
jury heard testimony from Tonya Harding's father and coach, adding more 
intrigue to the overriding question: What, if anything, did Harding know? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Harding, who has not been charged, made her first public skating 
appearance at a rink outside Portland and later faced reporters, skirting all 
questions about the latest allegations implicating her in the conspiracy to 
keep Kerrigan from competing in the national championships. Through her 
attorney, Harding has denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregonian reported Thursday that during a three-hour interview with the 
newspaper, Shawn Eckardt, Harding's bodyguard, said that the skater not only 
knew of the plot but was upset that it was taking so long to carry out. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt said that at a midnight practice session, Harding skated up to him and 
asked him about a back condition he was suffering from. "And then she said that 
she was (upset) . . . and disappointed that these guys weren't able to do what 
they said they were going to do," Eckardt said. "And why hasn't it happened 
yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt, along with Derrick Smith, Shane Stant and Jeff Gillooly, Harding's 
former husband, have been charged with conspiracy to commit second-degree 
assault on Kerrigan. In the interview, Eckardt details a conspiracy that 
included a plan to "do" Kerrigan in her hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff wanted this guy to go to her room and do his business with her and then 
leave," Eckardt said. "And duct-tape her up so she wouldn't be able to call out 
-- so they'd find her in the morning with a damaged leg of some sort, wrapped 
up in duct tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, investigators say that Stant used a collapsible police baton to club 
Kerrigan on her right leg after a practice session, rammed his head through a 
plexiglass door to escape from the arena and jumped into a getaway car driven 
by Smith. Stant was released Thursday from Multnomah County jail after posting 
bond. He left the jail and stood on the curb waiting for a ride. But after a 
horde of reporters descended on him, he went back to the jail and asked to be 
let back in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked here for seven years and he's the first one to ever ask to come 
back," said William Krasner, a correctional counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Correction officers found a back door for Stant to leave through. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have told the Associated Press that Eckardt, Stant and Smith are 
trying to work a plea bargain in exchange for their cooperation. However, 
Gillooly was not trying to cut a deal, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and police from Detroit met in Portland with law enforcement 
officials to review the investigation and determine where the case should be 
tried. Detroit officials returned home Thursday night and said the 
investigation was ongoing and the jurisdiction was still unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne County prosecutor John O'Hair, when asked if anything pointed to 
Harding's involvement, said: "It would be terribly unfair to make any premature 
judgments on that." 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado Springs, Colo., U.S. Figure Skating officials, who previously said 
they would poll members to see if Harding should stay on the Olympic team, 
backed off. Officials said a ballot still could be taken, but only after a 
formal notice and hearing with Harding has been held. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, meantime, did a midmorning skate before about 100 cheering fans at a 
shopping mall rink. 
</P>
<P>
 "My skating is my life, and that's the only place I'm getting enjoyment at 
all," Harding said. "My life is on the ice. My life out of skating I don't 
think I will see it for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury heard testimony from Al Harding, Tonya's father and Diane 
Rawlinson, her coach, and Dennis Rawlinson, Harding's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Other testimony was given by Gerry Crowe, a private investigator, and Eugene 
Saunders, a pastor who allegedly told of the conspiracy by Eckardt. Eckardt 
reportedly took a tape to Saunders that recorded the meeting in which the 
attack was planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saunders said Thursday that the tape was unintelligible and he relied on 
what Eckardt told him. Saunders took the information to Crowe, who went to the 
FBI. The tape was said to have been subsequently destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was my moral obligation to pass along the information," Saunders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Portland official said that if indictments are handed down, it would not be 
this be week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart Gori, a spokesman for the FBI, said the bureau will continue to oversee 
the case, but it will not be prosecuted federally. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been violation of federal law," Gori said. "The investigation is 
still going on and we're not just saying that."

NFL PLAYOFFS; HIS METHODS WERE NOT ALWAYS POPULAR, BUT WITH SUCCESS, OWNER 
JERRY JONES HAS THEM . . .; DELIGHTED IN DALLAS

 The most powerful man in the NFL is holding a plastic cup filled with iced 
tea. 
</P>
<P>
 The cup begins to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 The man gasps for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "That used to be me," Jerry Jones says, suddenly calm and smiling. "Really 
nervous. Up against it. Feeling it. Bad." 
</P>
<P>
 In his right hand are his reading glasses. Before he bought the Dallas Cowboys 
in 1989, he didn't need them. 
</P>
<P>
 Also nearby are his heart pills. He didn't need those, either, until doctors 
discovered an irregular heartbeat two years after he had bought the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it was from abuse," Jones says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like working every day until 4 a.m., trying to figure out how to build a 
football team as if it was an oil business. 
</P>
<P>
 Like insisting on standing on the sidelines that first season, even though 
fans would curse him and call him a thief. 
</P>
<P>
 Like insisting on reading his mail that first season, even though it often 
included death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors say I've got what some people call a good-time heart," Jones says. 
</P>
<P>
 So where were the good times? 
</P>
<P>
 Other owners compared him to a child with a new toy. His own head coach 
insinuated that he didn't know anything about football. 
</P>
<P>
 His team won one game, then seven games, and Jerry Jones could not work hard 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time here that my father was close to going over the edge," son 
Stephen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, friends say the shaking has stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys are on the verge of their second consecutive NFC title. The NFL is 
headed in a vastly different direction. 
</P>
<P>
 And much of it is because of the man who still likes his iced tea in tall 
plastic cups. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Cowboys face the San Francisco 49ers here Sunday for the conference 
championship, Jones will be embraced by everyone from Texas Gov. Ann Richards 
to Hank Williams Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 When he walks through the press box during the game, nobody will snicker. 
</P>
<P>
 When he goes onto the field before the end of the game, everybody will cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 When he goes home afterward, well, he will probably start working again and 
not stop until early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a man who still arrives at work some days and stays in the parking 
lot, talking on his car phone for 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe if you're the most powerful man in the NFL, the shaking never 
stops. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The day after Thanksgiving, with the rest of the football world chuckling over 
Leon Lett and wondering about the future of the Dallas Cowboys, their owner was 
hip-deep in pond water. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jones and his family, including his only daughter, were duck hunting in 
an Arkansas hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing thing was not that they fought over every duck shot, but that 
Jones talked only about the ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has finally realized that he can enjoy what has happened," said 
Stephen, 29, a Cowboy vice president and the club's contract negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 And who wouldn't? In the last two years, this former oilman has: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Restored glamour to the NFL's premier money-making franchise. He took a 
team that had not been to a championship game in six years to two title games 
in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing this, he was not afraid to cut loose legendary coach Tom Landry and 
top player Herschel Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got the team, nobody gave me a manual on how to do this," Jones said. 
"But I knew I wanted to win football games." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Negotiated and closed a stunning $4.4-billion television contract, giving 
the owners about $6 million more apiece than if they had followed Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue's advice to accept a cheaper contract extension last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was not reluctant to dump CBS, a longtime partner, and add the 
innovative Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I wanted Fox," he said. "They brought something potentially tremendous 
to the table." 
</P>
<P>
 He has made some mistakes, notably his ill-advised decision to make Emmitt 
Smith wait two regular-season games before signing him to a $13.6-million 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But he learned. When it was time to pay Troy Aikman $50 million a couple of 
months later, he did not hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry is the leader of the new breed of NFL owners looking to take the sport 
into the next century," said Leigh Steinberg, Aikman's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Other owners might not like Jones' brazen style, but they grudgingly respect 
him. Profits talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a significant contributor to the welfare of the NFL," said Art 
Modell, the Cleveland Browns' owner. "He's a fast learner. He's been very good 
for the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Just wait until the league hears what he wants to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the NFL's Competition Committee, expect Jones to propose rules 
changes bringing in the two-point conversion, reducing situation substitution 
and even punishing teams for missing field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he would not reveal details of his plans, they could involve forcing 
a team to surrender the ball 15 or 20 yards behind the spot of an attempted 
field goal if the kick is missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that everything else has been settled, it's time to look at the game," 
Jones said. "We need more decision making there. We need more appeal for the 
'90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Expect something to happen. Even in thickly paneled NFL meeting rooms where 
the money is old and the cigar smoke Havana, Jones has earned the right to be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if he could only get his coach to understand him. 
</P>
<P>
 The pebble in Jones' shoe remains, ironically enough, former college roommate 
Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring Johnson from the University of Miami soon after buying the team was 
Jones' first big risk. They had been college teammates at the University of 
Arkansas, even road roommates, but there were questions about Johnson's 
leadership and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Johnson has been around long enough to have answered those questions, 
he is asking them back. 
</P>
<P>
 He questions Jones' football knowledge. He questions Jones' input, even though 
the owner has made no secret that he wants to be involved as the team's general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 And Johnson never passes up a chance to note that he and Jones are not best 
friends, that they do not even socialize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry is better at making money than anybody I've ever met," Johnson said 
this week. "Me, I win football games." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones hears these comments and sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts are, I have been very active for a long time in helping Jimmy's 
career," Jones said. "And the facts are that every big trade that is made, 
every transaction, it's a we decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't need Jimmy to say that. His willingness to do that or not do 
that, that is just Jimmy." 
</P>
<P>
 And this is Jerry. Ask him if he worries about replacing Johnson, and he 
smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something should happen to Jimmy, God forbid, worrying about who would 
coach the Cowboys is not exactly high on my list," Jones says. "The situation 
we have here now, who wouldn't want to coach the Cowboys?" SUNDAY'S GAMES

NFL PLAYOFFS; BUFFALO'S SUCCESS IN RECENT YEARS CLEARLY SHOWS THAT COACH MARV 
LEVY IS. . . ; FITTING THE BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Christmas Day, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills, hoping to clinch the AFC East title the next day in Rich 
Stadium against the New York Jets, had gone through a light workout before 
hurriedly departing to celebrate the holiday with family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 With a wind-chill factor the equivalent of minus-28 degrees predicted for game 
day, Coach Marv Levy figured he would check on the condition of the field 
before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Most coaches have their heads so full of X's and O's the day before a game, 
they couldn't tell you what temperature it was. 
</P>
<P>
 But Levy is not like most coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 He not only noticed the bitter cold, but also the workers spread out across 
Rich Stadium, clearing snow off the 80,290 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy learned that most of them were otherwise unemployed, many of them 
homeless. He found out they were making only $5 an hour. He was told that they 
would put in 10-12 hours that day, working to make conditions somewhat bearable 
for a game they couldn't afford to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 And Levy was touched. 
</P>
<P>
 He went into the stands, gathered the workers around him and gave them the 
kind of pep talk coaches normally reserve for their team. 
</P>
<P>
 In Levy's eyes, the workers were part of the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope our team shows as much spunk tomorrow as you are showing right now," 
he told the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he went to the team equipment room, found as many ski caps as he could 
and handed them out to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Levy is not like any other coach. 
</P>
<P>
 How many coaches count Charles Dickens among their favorite authors? 
</P>
<P>
 How many coaches consider Winston Churchill their greatest hero? 
</P>
<P>
 How many coaches claim no credit for designing offenses or inspiring their 
players? 
</P>
<P>
 Levy is all of the above. And he has paid the price for it in terms of 
personal glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a guy who will send his team into Rich Stadium on Sunday to try to beat 
the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC championship game and win a fourth 
consecutive Super Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Shula never got into four in a row. Nor Tom Landry. Nor Bill Walsh. Nor 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet you never hear Levy's name mentioned with theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it mentioned when coaching honors are being considered. Levy didn't 
receive a vote this season for coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try to blame that on his working in Buffalo, far from the media centers. 
That hasn't stopped quarterback Jim Kelly or running back Thurman Thomas from 
becoming nationally known. It hasn't stopped defensive lineman Bruce Smith from 
starring in a national potato-chip commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Levy seems to be overlooked because he sells himself short so often. Ask 
him his greatest strength and he'll tell you, "Picking assistant coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to Levy and you would think his only job was to pass information from 
the assistants in the press box to the players. Just a high-priced messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills have become an innovative and potent force in the NFL over the last 
five years with a high-powered, no-huddle offense. Buffalo led the AFC in 
points in each of the four seasons before this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit to Levy? 
</P>
<P>
 Not according to him. He'll be quick to give it to Ted Marchibroda, his 
offensive coordinator before Marchibroda took the head coaching job with the 
Indianapolis Colts two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And the defense? That area is tightly run by Walt Corey. 
</P>
<P>
 The only times Levy takes a hands-on approach are short-yardage and goal-line 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bills rallied from a 35-3 third-quarter deficit to beat the Houston 
Oilers in last year's playoffs, 41-38, in overtime in the greatest comeback in 
NFL history, was it Levy's Knute Rockne-type halftime speech full of fire and 
brimstone? Did Levy believe the day wasn't yet lost and pass that faith on to 
his players? 
</P>
<P>
 No way. 
</P>
<P>
 The only halftime speech was a blistering address by Corey. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did I feel our chances were?" said Levy after the game. "The same as our 
chances of winning the New York lottery." 
</P>
<P>
 Players acknowledge that they motivate themselves, that they don't depend on 
Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the 65-year-old coach sometimes seems out of touch with them. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bills had lost to the Raiders in early December, their third defeat 
in four games, they could see their season sliding away as they headed to 
Philadelphia to play the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Cornelius Bennett gave an emotional speech to his teammates and 
later told reporters, "all hell would have broken loose" had the Bills lost. 
</P>
<P>
 And the next week, Buffalo won a crucial game at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy's reaction was to sing a decades-old song recorded by Bing Crosby's 
brother, Bob. It was Bob and the Bobcats' "It Ain't What You Do, It's the Way 
What You Do It." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy's players had never heard of Bob Crosby. Many had never even heard of 
Bing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Nor does Levy worry if his references to Churchill and other 
historical figures sometimes go over the heads of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 After coaching at every level in a career that began at the St. Louis Country 
Day School in 1951, extended through college and the pros, including both the 
Canadian Football League and the NFL, and has climaxed with his incredibly 
successful run in Buffalo beginning in 1986, the man has developed a style. 
</P>
<P>
 And whatever one thinks of it, it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he may be a master at delegating authority. And yes, he may not always 
relate to the younger generation that he coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But a man who is 60 minutes away from his fourth consecutive trip to the Super 
Bowl must be contributing something to his team. SUNDAY'S GAMES

MIKE DOWNEY: REWARD COMES IN THE GIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Omar Marquez is, oh, three feet tall, four tops, and he is digging in at home 
plate against an actual New York Yankee. The month is January, which is not 
exactly spring, but this does not matter one bit to Omar because today happens 
to be a beautiful day to be playing baseball. And besides, this is his first 
official at-bat against a pitcher from the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar taps his bat on the plate. You have heard of a belt-high fastball? Omar 
is a belt-high batter. He only comes up to the pitcher's waist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now batting," the P.A. announcer announces, "a 32-time All-Star, lifetime 
average of .733 -- Omar!" 
</P>
<P>
 The pitcher, Jim Abbott, shoots the batter a look. Minutes before, Abbott had 
been giving young Omar some pitching tips. Now the kid was up there looking to 
rip one. Up there looking confident, aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Abbott fires a fastball five feet behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ball -- way inside!" the shocked announcer says, as the ball bangs off the 
backstop. "Abbott looks wild out there today!" 
</P>
<P>
 Omar backs out of the box. He makes a face. He gives Abbott a look. Back into 
the batter's box he steps, cautiously. He takes his stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott changes speeds. In comes the pitch, slowly. Omar takes his cut. He 
makes contact. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball goes flying, 300, 350 . . . uh, inches. "Run!" one of Omar's 
teammates yells. Off he goes, in his long red pants with the gray shorts pulled 
over them. Abbott pounces off the mound. Omar huffs and puffs toward first base 
with every short stride. Abbott has the ball now. Omar makes a second effort to 
go faster, then a third effort. Abbott throws the ball slightly wide of the 
base. Omar takes one long, last step. His foot hits the sack. Safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The smile on his face is the size of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abbott obviously doesn't have it out there today," the announcer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, this is true. Everybody knows that last summer he pitched a no-hitter 
for the Yankees. But so far today, at least 40 or 50 batters have stepped up 
against Abbott, and even he would have to admit that every single one of them 
got a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott has taken a day of his free time to pitch and talk baseball to a whole 
park of kids much like Omar, who is 12. They are very special kids who spend 
every day of their young lives dealing with physical or psychological 
challenges, not unlike Jim himself, who is missing the fingers of his right 
hand. Dozens of these children have come to Stevens Field on a sunny afternoon 
in Diamond Bar to play a little ball with a real big leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a couple of things I know," Abbott tells the boys, gathering them 
together before the game. "One is baseball and being outdoors on a great day 
like today. And the other thing is that everyone should have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doors were ever closed to me when I was your age. Don't let anyone close 
any doors to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming a professional, Abbott has become part of an international help 
movement called the Challenger program that gives children like these a chance 
-- if not a chance to play baseball, then at least a chance to be children like 
any other children. They do this with the generous assistance of corporate 
sponsors, such as Bubblicious gum, and through volunteer nonprofit 
organizations such as Amigos de los Ninos (Friends of the Children), 
representatives of whom have helped arrange today's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Many adult men and women donate their time and money to make days like this 
possible. Tim Brundige, for example. He is president of a glass company in La 
Habra that bears his name and is a busy man, particularly in a region that has 
earthquakes. But he is not too busy to serve on the board of Amigos de los 
Ninos, or to be here today, introducing every batter on the P.A. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is Rick Burleson, for another example. He, too, is here today. 
Long before ending his illustrious career as an infielder with the Angels and 
Boston Red Sox, he began giving his support to projects like these. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a lot to me," says Burleson, who also lives in La Habra. "And I know 
how much it means to these kids when someone like Jim Abbott offers his time 
and encouragement to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of kids from Harlem knew this same feeling after Abbott interrupted 
his playing schedule last season in New York to come spend a day playing ball 
with them. Their parents and coaches were surprised and the children were 
thrilled. Not many celebrities had ever come around and spent any time with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott enjoyed that experience immensely. It reminded him of his first effort 
for this program, while he was still with the Angels, when he volunteered for a 
day at a Mesa, Ariz., playground to play ball with some kids. That day took 
pieces of Jim's heart. Kids with very severe physical challenges got out there 
and did the best they could. He can still picture that boy who pushed himself 
all the way to first base with both arms, using a walker. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Diamond Bar, every player is every bit as determined. There's Daniel, 
who says he ate his Wheaties this morning. There's Steve, no taller than 
Abbott's knee. There's Scott, who wants to shake Jim's bad hand. There's Sam, 
who remembers first seeing Abbott pitch on TV in the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's Gregory Maris, 9, whose mom looks on from the bleachers as he goes 
up to home plate to face Jim Abbott of the New York Yankees -- in his 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory hits the ball. A friend helps push his wheelchair to first base. He 
makes it there safely. That Abbott sure is getting rocked for hits today. 
</P>
<P>
 He hands out free souvenirs afterward and signs everyone's ball. He says, "I 
hope it means something to them, because I know what it means to me. It's 
probably a selfish thing, because I'm the one who gets the most out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing troubles Abbott, that being any credit he might get. Better nobody 
knew about these days at all, except for one detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sorry about the publicity we got in Harlem, until the response we got," 
Abbott says. 
</P>
<P>
 See, sometimes others pitch in, any way they can. Amigos de los Ninos 
donations can be sent to P.O. Box 2602, La Habra, Calif., 90632-2602, or 
inquiries faxed to (310) 694-0224. Some kids can get to first base by 
themselves. Some could use a push.

WHITE TO RESIGN AS NL PRESIDENT; WEBER WON'T BE COMMISSIONER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill White plans to resign as National League president, baseball officials 
said Thursday, and Northwestern University President Arnold Weber withdrew his 
name from consideration as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 White, the highest-ranking black official in professional sports, has been 
unhappy with his job for years.His term was to end nearly 11 months ago, but he 
grudgingly agreed to stay until a successor was found. White wouldn't say if 
his departure was imminent and refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resigned on March 31, 1993," he said, a reference to the original 
expiration date of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, speaking of the condition they not be identified, said White was 
angered that the power of league presidents was vastly reduced under the 
restructuring report adopted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being solely responsible to owners in their leagues, league 
presidents will be responsible to the commissioner, who will have the power to 
hire them. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said he thought the owners misled him by saying a new commissioner would 
be named in January. Owners decided to delay that decision until the completion 
of labor talks with players.

PROSPECT JC-BOUND AFTER TEST; FOOTBALL: TOP USC RECRUIT MCCULLOUGH FAILS TO 
QUALIFY IN ACT EXAM AND APPEARS EN ROUTE TO PASADENA CITY COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC football prospect Saladin McCullough, who was at the center of a 
test-score controversy last summer, scored a nonqualifying 14 recently on his 
American College Testing (ACT) exam. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough, an all-state running back from Pasadena's Muir High, needed a 
minimum 17 ACT score for NCAA eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough signed a letter of intent to enroll at USC after his 1992 senior 
season, when he gained 2,142 yards and scored 36 touchdowns. He averaged 8.7 
yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 He posted a qualifying score of about 1,200 on his Scholastic Aptitude Test 
(SAT), but unsigned letters sent to Educational Testing Service, administrators 
of the SAT, in Princeton, N.J., and to the Pasadena Star-News challenged the 
score, which was about 300 points higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough and his uncle, Muir High teacher Michael Harrison, went through 
arbitration over the SAT challenge, but lost their case. 
</P>
<P>
 USC football people said this week that McCullough will attend Pasadena City 
College the next two seasons, after which he could transfer to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll have to go to junior college, that's what it looks like now," USC 
offensive coordinator Mike Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison said, however, that his nephew might elect to take the ACT test 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACT test is in four parts: English, math, reading and science reasoning. 
ACT spokesman Kelly Hayden said that of 875,603 high school seniors who took 
the test in 1993, about 7% scored 14 or lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The national average score, he said, was 20.7.

 In a boast reminiscent of Joe Namath, Dallas Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson has 
guaranteed a victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will win the ballgame," Johnson exclaimed on Ft. Worth's WBAP-AM. "You can 
put it in three-inch headlines: We will win the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson made the comments during a talk show hosted by Dallas Morning News 
columnist Randy Galloway.

 Emmitt Smith of the Cowboys said he should not have tried to play the second 
half and overtime of the final regular-season game against the New York Giants 
with a separated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he expected to be close to full strength Sunday in the NFC 
championship game against the San Francisco 49ers at Irving, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he had learned anything about his injury since that season finale, 
Smith said: "I haven't learned anything, except that I was foolish to continue 
to play (against the Giants). But if they want me to carry the ball 30 times 
Sunday, I'll be ready. It will take a broken leg to keep me out of there." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 (Jimmy) Johnson said that preferential treatment is given to the eight Cowboys 
who are former members of the University of Miami football team, where Johnson 
used to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just last Tuesday, in our two-minute drill where I'm the referee, Michael 
Irvin made a catch on the boundary behind the end zone," Johnson said. "I gave 
it to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'That's the least I can do because he played for me at UM.' The 
players all understand this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Newton of the Cowboys, when comparing the two weekend title games, said: 
"Everybody is trying to build up Buffalo and Kansas City, but everybody really 
knows that the NFC championship game is the hottest game in the NFL. It has 
been for the last several years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if he wanted to make history with the Cowboys, who have enough 
talent to win several consecutive Super Bowls, Johnson said: "When I'm long 
gone, maybe somebody will punch me and say, 'You were part of history.' I hope 
somebody punches me from somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if that meant he hopes to spend eternity with Buddy Ryan, Houston's 
defensive coordinator, Johnson said: "Buddy is probably going to be in the 
other place." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid laughter, Johnson paused and added: "It's up to you to figure out which 
of us is going where." BILL PLASCHKE

HUBBARD LOSES OUT IN HIS BID TO BUY PIMLICO, LAUREL TRACKS; HOLLYWOOD PARK: 
JACK KENT COOKE BUYS 100 ACRES IN MARYLAND TO BUILD A NEW STADIUM FOR THE NFL'S 
REDSKINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hollywood Park's bid to buy Pimlico and Laurel racetracks in Maryland fell 
apart Thursday, with the tracks' principal shareholder retaining control and 
completing a sale of 100 acres on the Laurel site to Jack Kent Cooke, owner of 
the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke said that he will use the property to build a 78,600-seat stadium, which 
is expected to be ready for the Redskins' 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe De Francis, who has been running Pimlico and Laurel since the death of his 
father in 1989, announced the deal with Cooke and also said that he will make 
today's deadline for paying off his estranged partners, Bob and Tommy Manfuso. 
Under a condition in his contract with the Manfuso brothers, De Francis is 
required to pay them $8.2 million by today to keep the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke would not say what he paid for the Laurel property, but sources familiar 
with the transaction said that the price was in the $8-million range. Laurel 
Race Course is located halfway between Baltimore and Washington, about 20 miles 
from RFK Stadium, where the Redskins now play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke estimated that his discussions with De Francis about the Laurel property 
began about seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While De Francis went about his 11th-hour wheeling and dealing, 
representatives of R.D. Hubbard, the chairman of Hollywood Park, left Baltimore 
empty-handed. It was reported last week that Hollywood Park had offered $15 
million for an 80% interest in Pimlico and Laurel and would have assumed the 
tracks' debt, estimated at $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 De Francis, 38, said Thursday that his sister, Karin Van Dyke, played a 
significant role in the family's decision to keep the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karin was the deciding factor," De Francis said. "She didn't want to sell and 
was dealing with the possibility of selling from a personal level. She didn't 
want to be forced out. She has quite an attachment to these tracks. She 
believes in their future and wants to remain a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Had De Francis sold to Hollywood Park, he would have remained president of the 
track, but would have had less control and his annual salary reportedly was 
going to be slashed more than 70%, to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard was out of the country Thursday and couldn't be reached for comment.

<P>
 Meafara, the 5-year-old filly who missed by two necks of winning the last two 
runnings of the Breeders' Cup Sprint, has been retired because of knee and 
ankle problems, trainer Gary Jones said Thursday at Santa Anita. In her last 
race, Meafara won the Underwood Stakes at Hollywood Park on Dec. 11. Her record 
was 10 victories in 17 starts and earnings of $838,594. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Jones trainee, Best Pal, drew the rail for Saturday's $150,000 San 
Pasqual Handicap at Santa Anita. The rest of the lineup, starting with the No. 
2 post, is Ibero, Manny's Prospect, Johann Quatz, Star Recruit, Lottery Winner 
and Hill Pass. . . . In the $75,000 Santa Catalina Stakes, also Saturday, Duca 
drew the inside in a five-horse field. The others are Heavenly Crusade, Dream 
Trapp, Gracious Host and Wekiva Springs. . . . Tabasco Cat, third in the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile, will face Robannier, Flying Sensation and five other 
3-year-old rivals Saturday in the $200,000 El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows.

OFFICIALS BELIEVE BODY MAY BE JOCKEY HANSEN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities believe a body found Thursday could be the remains of jockey Ron 
Hansen, who mysteriously disappeared in early October. 
</P>
<P>
 The badly decomposed body was found in the mud flats of Hayward, near the San 
Mateo Bridge, Alameda police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's dental records were sent to the Department of Justice, Lt. David 
Guarnieri said, and the coroner's office could be slowed in the identification 
process. He said it could take more than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The size of the body and the clothing the body had on was pretty consistent 
with what Mr. Hansen had on when he was last seen and reported missing," said 
Guarnieri. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen, 33, one of the Northern California circuit's top riders with nearly 
3,700 victories, was last seen late Friday, Oct. 1. Early the next morning, his 
1990 Jaguar was involved in a hit-and-run accident on a bridge spanning San 
Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was found abandoned near the bridge. There was no sign of Hansen.

KOTASHAAN RUNS ON THE LEAD; ECLIPSE AWARDS: AFTER BEATING LURE FOR BEST MALE ON 
GRASS, 5-YEAR-OLD IS SHOO-IN FOR HORSE OF THE YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The horse-of-the-year vote for 1993 won't be revealed until Feb. 4, but 
Kotashaan was guaranteed the title Thursday when it was announced that he had 
beaten Lure in a close Eclipse Awards election for best male grass horse. 
</P>
<P>
 With last year's dirt horses unable to establish any consistency, Kotashaan 
will become the first grass horse to win horse-of-the-year honors since John 
Henry in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 In the voting for best male on grass, Kotashaan defeated Lure, 150-107, as 276 
turf writers, track racing secretaries and Daily Racing Form staffers cast 
ballots. To win, a horse must receive a plurality from at least two of the 
three voting blocs, and Kotashaan was ahead on all three ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotashaan and Lure never raced against one another, both horses winning stakes 
on Breeders' Cup day at Santa Anita. Kotashaan made one more start, finishing 
second three weeks later in the Japan Cup in Tokyo when jockey Kent Desormeaux 
stood up before the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 With six victories and three seconds in 10 starts, Kotashaan led the country 
in earnings with $2.6 million. The 5-year-old French-bred finished fourth in 
his first start on New Year's Day, then was first or second in all his other 
races. His major victories were the San Luis Rey and the San Juan Capistrano 
Handicap at Santa Anita last winter, the Eddie Read Handicap at Del Mar and the 
Oak Tree Invitational and the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of Kotashaan's triumphs were at 1 1/2 miles or farther. Shorter 
distances were Lure's forte. His victory in the Breeders' Cup Mile closed out 
his year with six victories in eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Richard Mandella, Kotashaan raced for his breeders, Jacques and 
Gerard Werthheimer, brothers in the French family that makes Chanel perfume. 
Kotashaan, a son of Darshaan and Haute Autorite, an Elocutionist mare, has been 
retired from racing and was sold for an estimated $4.5 million to a syndicate 
that will stand him at stud in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella trained another 1993 Eclipse Award winner, Phone Chatter, who was 
voted best 2-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Eclipse results announced Thursday, Dehere edged out Brocco for best 
2-year-old male in a contest that was decided by one vote. Dehere won the turf 
writers' vote, 71-57. Brocco was the 52-39 leader on the Racing Form ballots, 
and the racing secretaries broke the tie in favor of Dehere, 15-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Two mares repeated as Eclipse winners, Paseana winning in the division for 
older distaffers on dirt and Flawlessly taking the female grass title. Other 
winners were Prairie Bayou, 3-year-old colt; Hollywood Wildcat, 3-year-old 
filly; Bertrando, older males on dirt; Cardmania, sprinter; and Lonesome Glory, 
best steeplechaser for the second consecutive year. Prairie Bayou, winner of 
the Preakness Stakes, broke down in the Belmont and was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Frankel, whose barn led the money list with almost $9 million, was voted 
outstanding trainer. Mike Smith, whose horses earned $14 million, giving him a 
record 62 stakes victories, won the jockey award, and Juan Umana was voted best 
apprentice rider. John Franks won the Eclipse for outstanding owner for the 
third time, and Allen Paulson was voted best breeder. (COVER) ECLIPSE WINNERS

SOCCER / WORLD CUP NOTES; U.S., SWITZERLAND IGNORING TABOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. national soccer team has been busy this week preparing for a game on 
Saturday that, according to soccer tradition, should not be played. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States plays host to Switzerland at noon at Cal State Fullerton, 
but soccer teams in the same World Cup group normally do not play one another 
before the tournament. The United States and Switzerland are in Group A for 
next summer's tournament. This game, however, was scheduled last September, 
before Switzerland had qualified for World Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that most coaches would be reluctant to play under such circumstances, 
Swiss Coach Roy Hodgson sought out U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic at the final 
draw last month in Las Vegas. They agreed to go ahead with the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The taboo against playing a World Cup opponent is strong. The United States 
was scheduled to play Colombia, another Group A team, in a tournament next 
month, but the tournament schedule was revised so that the teams would not have 
to meet. Asked to explain the thinking behind that, most soccer coaches speak 
vaguely about not showing their hands or revealing new tactical wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when even practices are routinely videotaped and the most pedestrian 
international friendly match is televised around the world, there would seem to 
be few secrets. Milutinovic, however, must believe there are things worth 
hiding, because when Hodgson requested a tape of last week's game against 
Norway, Milutinovic would not give him one. The Swiss got one anyway. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Swiss have brought a strong team, the players are on an extended 
break and are not at full fitness. They haven't played since Dec. 8. For Coach 
Roy Hodgson, the team's trip to the United States is a chance to conduct 
practices in excellent weather and good training conditions. Hodgson is without 
the services of his four German-based players, all of whom play in the front or 
midfield. He expressed the commonly heard frustration of national coaches 
unable to pry loose club players for international matches. "We attempted to 
get them (released)," Hodgson said. "But we don't have the right to get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland has not been in the World Cup since it was the host country in 
1966 and although soccer is a popular sport, the country is not a major power. 
Thus, like American internationals, Swiss players sometime find it difficult to 
get released for national team games. Hodgson might have been able to get his 
players released from the powerful Bundesliga for World Cup qualifying matches, 
but this trip was not deemed crucial. "Germany doesn't consider Switzerland to 
be a football country," Hodgson said. "It considers us to be a yodeling 
country."

NATIONAL GUARD TO ERECT TENT CITIES; HOUSING: NO SITES ARE DESIGNATED FOR THE 
RAIN-RESISTANT SHELTERS TO BE SET UP FOR THOUSANDS OF DISPLACED RESIDENTS, MANY 
OF WHOM HAVE BEEN SLEEPING IN PARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a request by the state, the National Guard began preparing 
Thursday to set up tents to house 6,000 displaced residents, many of whom have 
been sleeping in parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be able to at least provide them shelter from the elements," 
said Lt. Bob Stern, spokesman for the California National Guard. "As soon as we 
have been notified by the state Office of Emergency Services where to erect 
these tents, we will move to that site." 
</P>
<P>
 Like those used in Florida after Hurricane Andrew, the canvas tents are 
rain-resistant and can be wired for electricity, Stern said. It was unclear 
where the tents would be set up or for how long. 
</P>
<P>
 The state made the request Thursday based on an appeal by local officials, 
said Kati Corsaut, spokeswoman for the state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 With rain forecast for this weekend, the tents could provide relief for 
residents already living under desperate condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing shelter is the latest addition to he National Guard's mission in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Since being activated Monday, National Guard troops have become a familiar 
sight in the Valley, patrolling mini-malls and parks to deter looters, 
delivering water, directing traffic at busy intersections and providing water 
to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 They are here, they said, to perform whatever duties local officials request. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to provide a presence," said 1st Lt. Thom) Thomas of Company C, 
3rd Battalion 160 Infantry based in Inglewood. "It's a desperate situation for 
people in the parks." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick said quake-weary residents are 
pleased to see the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just their presence is calming and reassuring," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the peak deployment, about 2,604 Guard troops were activated in California 
this week. Of these, 2,300 were assigned to spots in the Valley. The number has 
fluctuated depending on need, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the Guard troops actually began even before they started 
patrolling the Valley. Shortly after the quake, Air National Guard aircraft 
helped transport doctors from San Diego to replace those at a Granada Hills 
hospital, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guard also flew security guards from state universities in other areas of 
California to relieve guards patrolling Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we were activated Monday afternoon, we have flown more than 1,300 
passengers around the Valley," said Maj. Daniel L. Nation of the Air National 
Guard's 144 Fighter Wing based in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guard has been flying about 300 sheriff's deputies and officials and 200 
firefighters by helicopters daily to various sites, such as Santa Clarita, that 
are virtually cut off by damaged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In shelters and parks filled with weary residents, the Guard has been called 
on to help ensure that frustration does not evolve into violence or mass 
confusion -- or more destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sepulveda Recreation Center earlier this week, the Guard was called to 
help restore order after some of the 1,500 people sleeping there rushed a truck 
that was delivering blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 troops were stationed at the site of a collapsed apartment building 
in Northridge where 16 people died. Soldiers helped with the evacuation of 
residents and later patrolled the complex to deter looters and prevent 
residents from trying to enter the dangerous rubble to retrieve belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers are armed with M-16 rifles, but some of the weapons are not 
loaded, Nation said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commander has the discretion to determine if they need ammunition," he 
said. Before Rain Arrives 
</P>
<P>
 If professional help is unavailable, homeowners can bandage roofs or walls in 
advance of the rain that is forecast for this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 IF ROOF IS DAMAGED: 
</P>
<P>
 Place tarps across roof peaks. Barriers not draped over a peak would allow 
water to seep underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor edges of plastic tarps with boards and nails. Plastic will tear if 
anchored by nils alone. For best results, wrap plastic around a thin strip of 
board several times, then nail. 
</P>
<P>
 On tile roofs, anchor edges with cinder blocks or bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 IF CHIMNEY IS LOOSE: 
</P>
<P>
 CHIMNEYS THAT SWAYED OR BROKE IN THE QUAKE MAY HAVE WORKED THEMSELVES AWAY 
FROM THE HOUSE. Caulk the seams or minor cracks. For major gaps between the 
roof and the chimney use a tarp or aluminum flashing. Tarp must be draped over 
the top. (Beware of possible column failure as you work around damaged 
chimney.) 
</P>
<P>
 IF WALLS OR WINDOWS ARE BROKEN: 
</P>
<P>
 Broken windows should be boarded with plywood, both a a weather-tight measure 
and for security. 
</P>
<P>
 Even is stucco walls are cracked, weatherproof building paper underneath may 
provide a rain barrier. For major cracks, or when the building paper is torn, 
use a tarp. Hairline cracks are nothing to worry about for the short term.

DRIVER SURVIVES DIVE OFF FREEWAY OVERPASS; ACCIDENT: HE SUFFERS ONLY MINOR 
INJURIES. A POLICE OFFICER DIED AT SAME SITE MONDAY.

 Luckily for Tony MouFarrege, history does not always repeat itself the same 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 MouFarrege on Thursday became the second person to drive off the 
quake-collapsed Antelope Valley Freeway overpass -- sailing a van through a 
30-foot dive that ended in a perfect nose-down landing in a bulldozer scoop, 
like a movie stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the overpass' first victim -- a motorcycle police officer who was 
killed -- MouFarrege received only minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing that he survived such an impact," said California Highway Patrol 
Sgt. Ernie Garcia, who said MouFarrege apparently "became disoriented" and did 
not heed the barricade blocking the entrance to the freeway ramp, which now 
ends in mid-air. Also, observers said, the sun would have been in MouFarrege's 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to CHP officers and witnesses, MouFarrege, a supervisor with Quality 
Catering, had dropped off an employee under the sheared-off section of ramp 
shortly after 1 p.m., to provide food for highway workers gathered there. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of returning down San Fernando Road, however, MouFarrege drove up the 
ramp and, apparently without slowing, hurtled off the edge, Garcia said. Many 
of the 30 or so highway workers gazed in stunned amazement as his blue and gray 
van dropped like a bomb into the bulldozer scoop and sat there, tail in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 As Los Angeles County firefighters freed him from the wreckage, MouFarrege 
repeated in a daze several times: "I'm alive, I'm alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident took place at the same spot where Los Angeles police motorcycle 
Officer Clarence Wayne Dean fell to his death Monday shortly after the quake 
severed the ramp. But MouFarrege, 43, of Sun Valley, received only minor 
injuries and was in fair condition late Thursday at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia, according to a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He must have gotten lost," said Maria E. Castro, the catering employee he 
dropped off.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WESTBOUND LANES OF FREEWAY COULD REOPEN IN 60 
DAYS; ROADS: WORK ON THE DAMAGED EASTBOUND PART OF THE SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY 
COULD TAKE A YEAR. ALTERNATE ROUTES ARE SUGGESTED FOR THOSE USING STILL-OPEN 
SEGMENTS. 
</P>

 The westbound lanes of a five-mile stretch of the earthquake-damaged Simi 
Valley Freeway could be reopened in two months, but it could be a year before 
motorists can use an eastbound portion near Hayvenhurst Avenue, a Caltrans 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 350-foot-long segment of the eastbound lanes, between the Hayvenhurst Avenue 
ramps eastward to where the freeway passes over Gothic Avenue, collapsed during 
Monday's 6.6-magnitude earthquake and must be replaced, said Jim Roberts, 
Caltrans' chief engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The westbound lanes along this segment fell, but did not fully collapse, he 
said. "We're not convinced we have to tear down the westbound part -- we can 
shore it up," Roberts said Thursday, three days after the earthquake forced 
closure of the freeway between Reseda Boulevard on the west and the Foothill 
Freeway on the east. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this time, when we rebuild that eastbound section, we'll put more pilings 
and stronger columns under them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts and his staff inspected the damage as crews with heavy equipment 
worked day and night dismantling the collapsed portion -- a project that began 
early Tuesday. He said they expect to finish by week's end -- at a cost of 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost about $1.5 million to replace the eastbound lanes alone, Roberts 
said, adding that this sum would double if engineers decide the westbound lanes 
must also be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Also closed -- and slightly damaged by the earthquake -- is the freeway's 
Balboa Boulevard overpass, about half a mile west of Hayvenhurst Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, torrents from a water main that burst on Balboa Boulevard just north of 
the freeway washed out portions of soil and underpinnings at the eastbound exit 
and entry ramps, Hoadley said. Also, he said, two concrete pillars that extend 
from the freeway median to the overpass have cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said the bridge can be repaired quickly, without having to be torn 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor damage, he said, occurred on ramps that connect the freeway with the San 
Diego Freeway, as well as along portions near the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials suggest the following alternate routes for motorists who 
use the still-open portions of the Simi Valley Freeway: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 EASTBOUND: Exit at De Soto Avenue or Tampa Avenue south to Devonshire Street. 
Left on Devonshire Street to the southbound San Diego Freeway -- or right on 
Arleta Avenue, then left on Van Nuys Boulevard to the Golden State Freeway or 
the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WESTBOUND: From the northbound San Diego Freeway, exit at Roscoe Boulevard or 
Devonshire Street, left to Tampa Avenue or De Soto Avenue, right to the 
westbound Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 From the westbound Foothill Freeway, exit on Foothill Boulevard, west to Van 
Nuys Boulevard to northbound Arleta Avenue. Continue west on Devonshire Street, 
north on Tampa Avenue or De Soto Avenue to the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as work crews tore apart the freeway's collapsed segment they 
kicked up clouds of dust amid an almost nonstop, rat-a-tat racket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between the aftershocks and this, if you get an hour of sleep each night, 
you're lucky," said Florence Hoffman, who lives on nearby Swinton Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Clarence, stood in front of a small house and watched heavy 
equipment operators knock down chunks of concrete, separating them from tangles 
of gnarled reinforcing steel, as a seemingly interminable procession of trucks 
hauled away the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how any of these men can stand the noise," he said. Simi Valley 
Freeway Damage 
</P>
<P>
 It could be two months before the westbound Simi Valley Freeway between Reseda 
Boulevard and the Foothill Freeway reopens - and a year before a collapsed 
eastbound portion near Hayvenhurst Avenue is rebuilt. Monday's earthquake also 
caused damage to the Balboa boulevard overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alternate Routes * Eastbound: Exit onto southbound DeSoto Avenue or Tampa 
Avenue to Devonshire Street, left on Devonshire Street to southbound San Diego 
Freeway or right on Arleta Avenue, left on Van Nuys Boulevard to the Golden 
State Freeway or the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Westbound: From northbound San Diego Freeway, exit at Roscoe Boulevard or 
Devonshire Street, left to Tampa Avenue or DeSoto Avenue, right to westbound 
Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 From westbound Foothill Freeway (210), exit on Foothill Boulevard, west to Van 
Nurys Boulevard to northbound Arleta Avenue, proceed west on Devonshire Street, 
north on Tampa Avenue to DeSoto Avenue to the Simi Valley Freeway.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; MANY STILL LACK WATER AND GAS IN SANTA CLARITA 
VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN and JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 Residents of the earthquake-ravaged Santa Clarita Valley, anxious to get their 
utilities restored, their homes repaired and their lives returned to normal, 
ran into a wall of frustration Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands learned that they would have to wait several more days -- and in 
some neighborhoods up to two weeks -- before water and gas would again flow 
into their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was no better for school officials in Newhall, who estimated that it 
could cost up to $20 million to repair damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of quake victims were turned away at the opening of a 
joint state-federal disaster aid center because it did not have enough workers 
to help all of those who sought low-cost loans and other assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 people had packed the city's Canyon Country Park for the 
scheduled 1 p.m. center opening, some arriving as early at 7:30 a.m. But relief 
workers said they could only accept applications from about 100 people during 
the center's first afternoon of business. The center is scheduled to remain 
open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., including weekends, until the demand 
subsides, relief officials said. For assistance by phone, call (800) 462-9029. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the city, utility workers scrambled to restore service to houses 
that have been without water and natural gas since Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, electricity had been restored to all but a handful of homes and 
businesses in the Santa Clarita Valley, but many residents still lacked natural 
gas and water service. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those whose faucets were running were told to boil the water for at least 
five minutes before using it for drinking or cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials said boiling should eliminate any bacterial contamination that 
may have occurred because of broken pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most outages were reported by customers of the Valencia Water Co., which 
provides water to Valencia, parts of Saugus and Newhall within the city of 
Santa Clarita and to Stevenson Ranch, Sunset Pointe and parts of Castaic 
outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As of Thursday, about half of the 15,000 households and businesses served by 
Valencia Water were still without water, said Greg Milleman, the company's 
controller. Service to most residents will be restored in four to six days, but 
Stevenson Ranch and Sunset Pointe, located west of the Golden State Freeway, 
may be without water for up to two weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake caused severe damage to three water tanks and to the pipelines 
carrying water out of four other tanks. Aftershocks have slowed the repair 
work, Milleman said. "It's like taking two steps forward and then one step 
back" as new damage appears, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For customers who are without service, Valencia Water has placed a trailer 
containing 6,500 gallons of drinking water in the parking lot at the United 
Methodist Church in Valencia, across from Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital. It will 
be open from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the supply is depleted too quickly, "we're letting people have as much 
as they want," said Milleman. "They just need to bring their own container." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall County Water District, which serves 6,400 households and 
businesses in the Newhall area, reported Thursday that service had been 
restored to 80% of its users. The remaining customers should have water within 
a few days, said Jim Jinks, the district's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Water Co., serving 19,000 households and businesses in 
Canyon Country, and parts of Saugus and Newhall, expected to have service 
restored to all customers by late Thursday, said Dennis Rolfe, a staff 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 County Waterworks District 36, which serves the Val Verde and Hasley Canyon 
communities, had restored water to all but six of its 750 customers by 
Thursday, said Donna Guyovich, a spokeswoman for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gas Co. estimated that 60% of its customers in the Santa Clarita Valley 
still had no service early Thursday. The company dispatched 150 workers to go 
door-to-door throughout the valley to check for leaks and restore service, said 
Norm Williams, a spokesman for the utility. 
</P>
<P>
 He said most of the outages stemmed from residents who became concerned 
because of the earthquake and shut off the main valve to their house. In such 
cases, the company requires that its own workers restart the service after 
checking for leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the company believes that virtually all gas service to the Santa 
Clarita Valley will be restored by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Area schools were to remain closed through the end of the week, including 
those in the William S. Hart Union, Newhall, Saugus Union, Sulphur Springs and 
Castaic Union districts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several buildings at Placerita Junior High School and William S. Hart High 
School, both in Newhall, sustained severe structural damage in the earthquake, 
Walter Swanson, the district's superintendent, said Thursday. After an initial 
inspection, Swanson estimated that repairs could cost as much as $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling in the auditorium at Hart High School collapsed and the cafeteria 
floor buckled, he said. Two gyms and a building that houses about 20 classrooms 
were also damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters also struggled to cope with quake damage. Metrolink has become a 
major transportation link for residents in north Los Angeles County since the 
6.6-magnitude Northridge Quake caused a portion of an Antelope Valley Freeway 
overpass to crash onto the Golden State Freeway, cutting off direct freeway 
access from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Antelope Valley commuters are expected to take Metrolink when it 
begins its first-ever service Monday to the region, and more trains are being 
added in Santa Clarita to meet the increased demand, Metrolink officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two trains are expected to make stops in Lancaster and Palmdale each weekday 
morning and return each evening. The trains will travel from the Antelope 
Valley to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, with stops in Santa Clarita, 
Burbank and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Metrolink carried a record 8,000 people to and from Santa 
Clarita. That record was broken Thursday, according to Metrolink officials, 
when 8,500 people took the train to and from Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Metrolink car can transport up to 300 people, with seating for 150. The 
trains serving the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys will each have between 
five and eight cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The 84-mile trip from Lancaster to Union Station is expected to take a little 
more than two hours on the train. Trains will leave Lancaster at 4:11 a.m. and 
4:40 a.m., departing from Palmdale 15 minutes later. The return trains to the 
Antelope Valley will leave Union Station at 6:15 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AID STATIONS; HUNDREDS VISIT DISASTER 
ASSISTANCE CENTERS IN SEARCH OF FEDERAL AGENCIES' FINANCIAL HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After the earthquake hit, Jerry and Sue Slater's Simi Valley house was a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 A wall for the chimney and fireplace was split in two. A gaping hole in the 
roof left part of the structure exposed to the sky. The furnace and water 
heater were both severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're living in our motor home now," Sue Slater said. "We don't have any 
water or gas in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 As her husband picked up loan application forms Thursday at the federal 
emergency office at Simi Valley's Sycamore Drive Community Center, Slater 
sighed and shook her head anxiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be grateful for anything we can get," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Slaters were among hundreds of quake victims who descended on disaster 
assistance centers in Simi Valley and Fillmore to seek financial relief from 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents stood in line for up to two hours, hoping to qualify for 
low-interest loans and grants to repair their homes and businesses. As they 
waited, many exchanged horror stories of the 6.6 magnitude temblor that shook 
up their homes, businesses and lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Simi Valley office, residents began lining up before 7 a.m. By 1:30 
p.m. more than 1,100 people had arrived to make appointments to return later 
and fill out applications with FEMA workers. FEMA officials said they are 
meeting with residents by appointment only. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea people would be waiting when we got here at 7 this morning," 
said Ed Kirk, a FEMA volunteer who began giving people appointments 
immediately. "I didn't want them to wait until this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley FEMA center was not supposed to open until 1 p.m., but 
officials threw open the doors half an hour early to begin processing the first 
disaster relief applications. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Darby, manager of the Simi Valley center, estimated that FEMA workers 
will be able to help about 20 people an hour. Centers will be open seven days a 
week from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. for as long as there is need. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people won't have appointments until two weeks or longer," Darby said. 
"I'm sure it's disappointing to some of them." 
</P>
<P>
 At Fillmore's FEMA center, housed at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, 
officials said that within an hour of opening their doors they had appointments 
scheduled through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "However long it takes, I'm waiting," said Ron Stewart, who owns Ballard 
Furniture in Fillmore. The store has been in his family for three generations, 
and he's not sure if he can rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now what I have to do is unload all the merchandise," Stewart said. 
"This is a big tragedy. I'll have to be paying for this one for a lot of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims will have to wait at least a week and maybe longer before they 
receive any financial assistance, FEMA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darby said emergency housing may be available for displaced residents in as 
little as a few days, depending on how quickly FEMA officials can approve 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a case-by-case thing," said FEMA spokesman Earl Armstrong. 
"There'll likely be a tremendous backlog of applications." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom and Linda Nolan, who live in Granada Hills, said they expect to wait 
awhile before receiving any federal aid. They have some earthquake insurance, 
but it will not fully cover their losses, Tom Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their home, which is near the Northridge epicenter, suffered extensive damage 
in the temblor, Linda Nolan said. They had purchased the house, their first, 
only a year ago. Now it is uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house is off the foundation, we have cracks all over the house, and our 
pool looks like something from a 'Poltergeist' scene," Nolan said. "This makes 
me wonder why I moved from New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Campbell, a Fillmore city councilman whose house was destroyed in the 
quake, said he wished there had been a faster response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why the hell weren't they here yesterday?" he said, as he stood in line and 
talked to Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he had asked President Clinton the same question, and was told 
that a bureaucratic snafu had delayed Ventura County from getting federal 
disaster assistance. FEMA officials said they do not yet know how much 
financial assistance the county will ultimately receive. Nearly $4 million was 
made available immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Cardenas, whose Fillmore home was knocked off its foundation, said he 
didn't know what kind of federal relief he could expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we just need temporary housing, but we'd like to rebuild," Cardenas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents, such as Amelia Wilson of Simi Valley, did not have any 
earthquake insurance and are hoping to use low-interest federal loans to 
rebuild their battered houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any money to fix our house," Wilson said. "My husband is at 
home calling the mortgage company to see if they'll give us a deferred 
payment." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said she and her husband had purchased their first house about a year 
ago. Now the back-yard wall is damaged, and the brick columns holding her front 
porch have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Chieruzzi, a Simi Valley resident, said her house for the most part 
escaped major damage, but she is seeking federal assistance to pay for 
repairing her partially crumbled back-yard wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been worse," Chieruzzi said, looking at the crowds in line. "We 
made it here -- we need to thank God we're all alive." How to Get Help 
</P>
<P>
 Several agencies are providing relief to Ventura County residents affected by 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency can help residents obtain the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rent payments for temporary housing for up to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grants to make minimal repairs to homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grants of up to $12,200 to meet serious disaster-related needs not covered 
by other federal aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unemployment payments of up to 26 weeks for workers left jobless by the 
disaster who do not qualify for state benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Low-interest loans from 3.625% to 7.25% to cover uninsured private property 
losses and from 4% to 8% for business property losses. Loans are available up 
to $100,000 for primary residences; $20,000 for personal property, including 
renter losses, and $1.5 million for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loans of up to $1.5 million for small businesses with disaster-related 
cash-flow problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loans of up to $500,000 for farmers to cover production and property losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development also is providing rent 
vouchers and home-replacement aid. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply for FEMA or HUD aid, go to one of the county's two disaster centers: 
Sycamore Drive Community Center, 1692 Sycamore Drive, Simi Valley, or Community 
Hall at St. Francis Catholic Church, 1058 Ventura St., Fillmore. The centers 
are open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. Or you can contact FEMA 24 hours a day at 
1-800-462-9029. 
</P>
<P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DAMAGE NOT AS SERIOUS AS FIRST BELIEVED; SIMI 
VALLEY: 'UNSAFE' SIGNS ARE POSTED AT 100 STRUCTURES, BUT OFFICIALS SAY MANY 
OTHERS NEED ONLY COSMETIC REPAIRS.

 As the pace of building inspections picked up in Simi Valley on Thursday, city 
officials said they were pleased to find that the homes and businesses checked 
so far were less severely damaged than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials held to their previous estimate that the earthquake damaged 5,000 
homes, or one-sixth of the city's households. But as 45 workers fanned out in 
response to 2,000 calls for inspection, city officials said much of the damage 
was cosmetic, or at least posed no danger to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not as alarming" as many residents had reported to city officials 
when requesting the inspections, city building official Gaddis Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the building inspectors who traveled across the city Thursday posted 
red "Unsafe to Enter" signs on about 100 mobile homes, apartments and houses. 
Officials estimated that 250 to 300 homes around the city will be ruled unsafe 
to enter. So far, 622 mobile homes of about 800 to 900 in the city have been 
declared uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors also slapped the red signs on at least 17 churches and commercial 
and industrial buildings. One of the city's two cinema complexes -- the Mann 6 
on Cochran Street -- was roped off and tacked with a sign saying "Danger, 
Uninhabitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Most houses and mobile homes that are deemed unsafe to enter will be 
inhabitable once they are repaired, Farmer said. Even mobile homes that were 
knocked off their foundations or split in two can be lifted up or put back 
together, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighborhoods other than mobile home parks, two of the most common problems 
inspectors noted were fireplaces that had fallen or shifted out of place, and 
outside staircases at apartment buildings that are unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such problems need immediate attention, most of the time they can be 
repaired, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem for residents may be paying for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hundreds of Simi Valley residents who came to the local federal 
disaster assistance office Thursday said he has no hope of salvaging his home 
without federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 John Holley said the earthquake knocked down walls in his 27-year-old house, 
causing damage that he estimated at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has earthquake insurance that will cover most of the cost, Holley 
has to pay the first $5,000. And Holley, 62, a laid-off aerospace worker, said 
he doesn't have that kind of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm drawing Social Security, which is nothing at 62," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to damaging homes and businesses, the earthquake took its toll on 
the city's cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearly 200-year-old adobe house that is the oldest dwelling in Ventura 
County sustained so much structural damage that it will be closed to the public 
indefinitely, Simi Valley City Historian Pat Havens said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in Robert P. Strathearn Historical Park off Madera Road, the adobe had 
been proposed for seismic retrofitting to reinforce its 3-foot-thick walls 
against earthquakes. But the local park district that owns the building had not 
been able to raise the $250,000 needed for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the park district will have to keep the adobe closed to school groups and 
other visitors until it finds the money to repair the building and bring it 
into compliance with state earthquake safety codes, Havens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simi Valley residents may be more upset about the damage to their 
houses, Havens said closing the adobe represents a real loss to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a great deal," she said. "If we don't have our roots with the past, 
it's hard for us to know how we got where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents won't have to worry about the fate of their local 
library, courthouse or other public buildings. City inspectors said Wednesday 
that all public, city-owned buildings had been spared structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to surveying damage, a key role of building inspectors following a 
disaster is to put the public at ease, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some residents said they felt more relaxed and calm Thursday than at 
any time since the temblor, mostly because of the lack of severe aftershocks 
during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents took advantage of the calm to climb on their roofs to repair 
chimneys and cover holes with plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel better," said Julie Mason, who spent Thursday cleaning house as her 
husband and a relative fixed her home's chimney. "But if we get another big 
aftershock, I know I'm going to be back where I was."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RESIDENTIAL AREA, LIBRARY SUFFER MOST OF 
DAMAGE; THOUSAND OAKS: ALL 188 HOMES IN A GATED COMMUNITY ARE HIT. BUT 
OFFICIALS SAY THE CITY WAS FORTUNATE. 
</P>

 Building inspectors and private contractors in Thousand Oaks moved house to 
house through an exclusive gated community hit by some of the city's most 
serious earthquake damage Thursday as officials continued to assess losses at 
the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake caused more than $1-million damage to city property, Senior City 
Financial Analyst Stacy Park estimated. She said she had not determined the 
total cost of the quake to the city and its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As the damage assessment continued, some Thousand Oaks residents remained 
jittery from the quake and its aftershocks. Some families in the exclusive 
Chanteclair Estates spent their third straight night sleeping outside in cars 
and tents. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most of Thousand Oaks, Thursday was a time to return to normal 
schedules in a city whose officials expressed relief at having -- for the most 
part -- avoided serious damage from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prevailing thought here is how fortunate we were to come through this as 
well as we did," Councilman Frank Schillo said. "The whole of Thousand Oaks was 
not treated evenly, but for the most part we feel fortunate."  
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the majority of the damage was limited to the Thousand 
Oaks Library and the gated community where all 188 homes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the $400,000 homes at Chanteclair Estates in northeast Thousand Oaks 
was deemed unsafe Wednesday and three more were expected to be closed by week's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners in the community said they believe the damage, which was the 
most significant residential quake damage in Thousand Oaks, may have been the 
result of poor construction or design. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had contractors out here since the earthquake and they're finding 
problems with the way parts of these houses were put together," said Wanda 
Rusch, a board member for the community homeowner association.  
</P>
<P>
 Several of the community's residents have been forced from their homes, which 
have cracked walls, damaged garage doors and crumbling masonry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stay in a place that's not safe," said Lee Sanders, whose home was 
found unsafe by Thousand Oaks building inspectors Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to gather up all the things we need and we're going to have to find 
somewhere else to live," Sanders said. "It's amazing -- I'm 42 years old and 
everything I've got is gone in 50 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 For others, even though damage was less severe, safety could only be found 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids in particular didn't feel comfortable sleeping inside," said Debbie 
Moore, whose son and daughter slept in tents Wednesday night. "Considering what 
we went through, I think it will take a little time before we're comfortable 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hodge, who recently moved to the area from Toronto, said he's ready to 
brave Canada's winter again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until Monday morning, this was the greatest place on Earth," Hodge said. 
"This kind of shook us into reality."  
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the exclusive community near Sunset Hills Boulevard, most of 
Thousand Oaks escaped the quake with minor damage. According to Mayor Elois 
Zeanah, who toured the city after the quake, the bulk of the damage came inside 
homes, where people reported losing glassware, crystal and valuable antiques. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 inspectors worked all day Thursday checking cracked walls and fallen 
chimneys to determine which homes were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly we saw problems with fireplaces and some damage to some older homes," 
said Barry Branagan, director of building safety. "There are a lot of nervous 
people out their." 
</P>
<P>
 Branagan said six homes in Thousand Oaks had been deemed unsafe and several 
others were posted as "limited entry" until damage could be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to commercial property was light, Branagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Thousand Oaks Library, however, falling steel ceiling panels ruptured 
water lines and crushed books and shelves. There too, city inspectors are 
looking into the possibility that design or construction flaws may have 
contributed to the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having people come in to evaluate what the problem was with the 
ceiling," City Manager Grant Brimhall said. "It looks as though the ceiling 
caused the bulk of the damage." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brimhall said that as fire crews began cleaning the library, the damage 
appeared to be less severe than originally feared. 
</P>
<P>
 A new computer system, installed the day before the earthquake, was working 
despite being sprayed with water. And books from the library's collection were 
being transferred to the Newbury Park Library a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best news is that the library appears to be structurally sound," Brimhall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brimhall said the city had not decided whether to take further action against 
the Los Angeles-based firm that designed the library. Thousand Oaks has already 
sued Alber C. Martin & Associates for alleged flaws in the $9-million 
building's roof and ducts. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also caused problems for La Reina High School, a private Catholic 
school on West Janss Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was forced to close 10 classrooms after falling ceiling panels 
released asbestos into the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were always told that the asbestos wouldn't be a problem if nothing shook 
it up, but now something has shaken it up," said the school's principal, Sister 
M. Lisa Megaffin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making do by holding classes in the cafeteria, and the library and 
anywhere else we can find space," Megaffin said. "We're hoping we can have it 
fixed by next Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 Megaffin said the damage would cost the school about $25,000 to repair. The 
nonprofit school is attempting to raise the money through private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be difficult for us," Megaffin said. "But we're just thankful 
it wasn't more serious here. We were very fortunate."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CHILDREN IN FILLMORE AND PIRU HEAD BACK TO 
SCHOOL; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS SAY AT LEAST 17 CAMPUSES IN SIMI VALLEY ARE 
EXPECTED TO REOPEN MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Leaving behind their earthquake-torn homes, children in Fillmore and Piru on 
Thursday returned to school for the first time since the devastating shaker 
ripped through the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, school officials in Simi Valley -- the only other Ventura County 
city to cancel classes because of the disaster -- said at least 17 of 27 
schools are expected to reopen Monday and the rest could reopen Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore school officials said about 1,325 students -- less than 40% of those 
enrolled at the district's six schools -- came back for classes. Most of the 
others, officials said, were still with their families, coping with the damage 
from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 David S. Haney, superintendent of the Fillmore Unified School District, said 
although officials expected low attendance Thursday, they wanted to reopen the 
schools to give residents a chance to resume their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to educate kids," Haney said. "The sooner we can get things back 
to normal, the sooner everyone's lives will move right ahead. It doesn't do the 
students any good to be out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he anticipates that attendance levels in the district, which suffered 
minor damage in the quake, will be back to normal by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, teachers in Fillmore gave the students the morning to share their 
experiences with their classmates before getting back to their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the children said they were worried that something would happen 
to their parents while they were at school, others said they were glad to 
return to class to see their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's boring at my house," said Tony Arceo, a sixth-grader at Sespe School. 
"You just wait there for another aftershock. I was glad to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rebekah Montejano, a fifth-grader, said she would have preferred to stay 
at her north Fillmore home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so scared something is going to happen to my family," she said. "I didn't 
want to come to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Wojciechowski, who teaches fourth and fifth grades at the school, said 
teachers tried to ease the youngsters' fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "One mom came in and said, 'Can you please keep an eye on my daughter? She's 
really, really nervous,' " Wojciechowski said. "I've kept her close to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, most of the students who returned to class Thursday were handling 
events of the past few days pretty well, said Marsha J. Porter, the principal 
of Sespe School. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have been in very good shape," Porter said. "We expected we might 
have kids crying and upset, but we've had little of that." 
</P>
<P>
 At Fillmore High School, students spent the day exchanging stories with their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sleep," 11th-grader Kim Ritchey told her history class. "It seems 
like I can still hear the ground rumbling. I'm just afraid it's going to happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jose Macedo, another 11th-grade student, was unfazed by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost slept through it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fillmore's San Cayetano School, where volunteers had set up the largest Red 
Cross shelter in the county, school officials ordered 200 pizzas for lunch for 
the 270 youngsters who returned to class. The cafeteria had been closed because 
the natural gas was shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the day, the children seemed to be going home in a relaxed 
manner," Principal Karen Cooksey said. "All and all, we were just happy that 
the kids who were here, were here. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the rest of the kids are ready, and their parents are ready, they will 
be back."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; METROLINK LURES NEW RIDERS AS SERVICE RESUMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hoping to avoid post-quake traffic tangles, Ventura County commuters hopped 
aboard Metrolink on Thursday morning as the trains resumed operation for the 
first time since Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a fugitive from the freeway," Agoura resident John Batcheldor said in 
Moorpark as he readied himself in the early morning chill for his first ride on 
Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting to be zipped past tumbled freeways to his job in the Los Angeles area, 
Batcheldor explained his decision to try the train. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't stand the thought of the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents whose homes were badly shaken in the quake found refuge in the 
train's air-conditioned cars, equipped with restrooms, fold-out tables and 
padded, high-backed chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent the whole day yesterday cleaning up," Dodi Autry said. "It's sort of 
a relief to get away from it for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Although smaller than usual crowds gathered at the Moorpark and Simi Valley 
platforms, Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission, said she expected the commuter load to skyrocket 
next week as residents return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're anticipating that the demand is going to go way up," she said. "We want 
to be ready when it does." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are seeking earthquake relief funds to handle the expected 
increase in passenger load on the trains, which usually carry about 600 riders 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to add additional cars and speed up plans to extend the service into 
the west county, with stops in Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi said funding for Ventura County was "second priority" behind plans to 
expand service to Sylmar and Santa Clarita, where the Foothill Freeway was 
severely damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 If the funding is approved, trains may be running to the west county as early 
as next week and would run for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to check and make sure the tracks are in good shape and that our 
times aren't going to conflict with other trains on the line," said Mary 
Travis, transit manager for the commission. "It would be great if we can make 
it all happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Some county officials have been working to extend service to the west county 
since the service opened in October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as a third of the riders who board in Moorpark drive from the west 
county, said Travis, who added that the expanded service could entice many 
residents who want to try Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they try it, I think they'll get hooked," Travis said. "It's hard to 
give up that extra time to read the paper and relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene Miller, a secretary whose house on the east end of Simi Valley was 
damaged in the quake, is a regular Metrolink rider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the earthquake, I took the train three times a week," Miller said. 
"Now the freeway is out of the question, so I'll be on the train every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Dosick and Judy Hedrick decided to take Metrolink rather than drive to 
a trade show in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never taken it before," Dosick said. "But we talked it over on the 
phone last night and we decided the only way to get there in time is to take 
the train." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedrick added: "The only problem is that if we have a bad aftershock, we might 
not get back." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Individual round-trip Metrolink tickets are $12 from Moorpark and $10 from 
Simi Valley. Ten-trip ticket passes are $55 and $45, respectively. Monthly 
passes cost $176 from Moorpark and $144 from Simi Valley, and can be used the 
rest of this month and through February. The Moorpark Metrolink station is at 
300 High St.; the Simi Valley station is at 5050 Los Angeles Ave. For schedule 
information, call (800) 438-1112 or (800) 371-5465.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; EMERGENCY CREWS RUSH TO REPAIR TOXIC LEAKS; 
HAZARDS: WORKERS NEAR VAN NUYS AIRPORT ARE EVACUATED AS TEAMS DRAIN LIQUID 
PROPANE FROM LEAKY PIPES AT KAISER MARQUARDT PLANT. ASBESTOS CLEANUPS AT 
COURTHOUSES BEGIN.

 Authorities scrambled Thursday to cope with a rash of hazardous materials 
incidents following the massive earthquake that shook asbestos from building 
fixtures and rocked fuel and chemical tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Van Nuys, about 600 workers were evacuated from businesses next to Van Nuys 
Airport as Fire Department hazardous materials teams began draining explosive 
liquid propane from leaky piping at the Kaiser Marquardt plant on Saticoy 
Street at Hayvenhurst Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The propane leak, discovered before 8 a.m. Thursday, was from piping 
connecting three 30,000-gallon storage tanks, each believed to be about half 
full of propane. The quake or aftershocks apparently caused the giant tanks to 
shift in their saddles, rupturing the pipe, said Los Angeles Fire Department 
spokesman Bob Collis. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews were using a 6,000-gallon tanker truck to drain the explosive 
fuel, said Collis, who said he thought that the operation would last at least 
until Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials said the episode did not affect airport operations, but 
police closed off sections of nearby streets, and employees of several 
businesses were sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At county courthouses in Van Nuys, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica -- where 
structural safety inspections are required before the buildings can reopen -- 
county officials were forced to delay the inspections to clean up asbestos 
loosened by the shaker. 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Nuys Superior Court, contractors hired by the county were cleaning up 
asbestos fire-proofing material that fell from ceiling beams, said Jan Pollard, 
spokeswoman for Los Angeles County's Internal Services Department. Pollard had 
no estimate of the cost of the cleanup, which will be followed by air testing 
before the building's structural integrity can be assessed sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollard said asbestos cleanups are also under way at the courts in Santa 
Monica and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 State environmental officials, surveying area businesses for quake-related 
hazardous waste leaks, said Thursday that they have encountered only minor 
problems so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Varenchik, spokesman for the California Department of Toxic Substances 
Control, said department officials are canvassing businesses with hazardous 
waste permits within 25 miles of the epicenter to check for quake-related 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 288 businesses reached by phone by Thursday afternoon, 244 reported no 
problems while 44 reported minor damage to waste storage areas or small leaks 
or spills, Varenchik said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 others could not be reached, and Varenchik said agency staff members 
were fanning out to visit those sites in person. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if companies would be tempted to understate their problems, Varenchik 
said, "We don't have the manpower to send people out to every one of these 
places, so you've sort of got to take people on their honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Varenchik also said agency staff have begun to assist local building 
inspectors, accompanying them to damaged buildings to look for problems with 
hazardous chemicals or asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, cleanup crews Thursday continued siphoning oil from the Santa Clara 
River, stained by sticky crude from a pipeline broken by the quake. An 
estimated 3,500 to 4,000 barrels of crude leaked from the pipeline, most of it 
reaching the river in Santa Clarita and spreading downstream about 12 to 15 
miles into Ventura County. Officials estimated that 1,600 barrels had been 
sucked from the river by Thursday.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; VALLEY FIRMS STRUGGLE TO RESUME OPERATIONS; 
AFTERMATH: WITH QUAKE CLEANUP UNDER WAY, PACKARD BELL'S PLANS TO RELOCATE OUT 
OF STATE ARE PUT ON HOLD.

 Still shaking from aftershocks but with the cleanup from the first major quake 
well under way, businesses across the San Fernando Valley struggled to get back 
to business Thursday and put the worst behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 At Packard Bell's six-building headquarters complex in Chatsworth, movers were 
busy loading files and equipment. For months the personal computer maker has 
been negotiating with several states about relocating its operations and 1,500 
jobs, but the quake put those plans on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell said it was now moving its headquarters and part of its 
production to Westlake Village, where it will stay for at least a year before 
consolidating all of its operations under one roof, presumably somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't our original plan," said Mal Ransom, Packard Bell's vice 
president of marketing. Ransom said the company had called back 350 workers so 
far, and most are expected to return next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moving plans will also be delayed for about 2,000 employees at the U.S. Postal 
Service's mail-processing center in Van Nuys. The center, which sorts letters 
from the Valley area, was supposed to move to a new $100-million-plus complex 
in the Santa Clarita Valley this April. 
</P>
<P>
 But postal officials said that facility sustained heavy damage, including 
broken water pipes and cracked floors. Spokeswoman Terri Bouffiou said she had 
no idea when the move would be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be some explanation why there was so much damage there," she 
said, adding that engineers have yet to inspect the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other major employers in the Valley were wrapping up their cleanup work, 
but they were uncertain when their employees would be called back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cleanup is going swiftly, but what we have to make sure is that we have 
tested all the electrical systems and water lines," said Ian Campbell, a senior 
vice president at Great Western Financial Corp. On Thursday, only one of the 14 
buildings in the company's big complex in Chatsworth was open, and only 100 
workers out of 3,000 were there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of a trailer equipped with flashlights and walkie-talkies, 
Campbell said some employees were temporarily transferred to El Segundo, Los 
Angeles and elsewhere in the Southland where departments such as 
check-processing and customer services have been set up in temporary quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 All but five of the thrift's 300 California branches were in business 
Thursday, he said. As for the 2,900 idle employees, he said they would get paid 
during their time off. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canoga Park, Rocketdyne said 750 people had been called back to work so far 
out of about 5,900. Jeff Charney, spokesman for the unit of Rockwell 
International, which makes rocket engines for NASA and commercial satellite 
launchers, said electric power came up Wednesday and cleanup crews were working 
round the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked when the rest of the workers would return, he said, "It's a gradual 
phase-in. We're taking it one day at a time." Charney said the company was busy 
setting up centers to help employees financially and to get through the shock 
of personal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among companies that reopened its headquarters Thursday was 20th Century 
Insurance Co. in Woodland Hills. For the last three days, the company took 
claims from policyholders in the parking lot where employees worked under 
canopies. By early Thursday, the insurer had received 5,000 homeowner and 700 
automobile claims, said spokesman Ric Dinon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are close to normal in our operations," he said, only to quickly add, 
"close to normal under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It clearly was no ordinary work week. Top executives such as Jeff Ornstein, 
chief financial officer at Superior Industries, the Van Nuys wheel maker, came 
to work clad in jeans and sneakers, and with a flashlight. Like others, he 
spent most of this week picking up files and straightening out the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone is up, the lights are on," he said Wednesday. "Overall people are 
in good spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the company's 200 office workers were at hand by midweek, 
Ornstein said, and the company was making a limited supply of aluminum wheels 
Thursday. He said he hoped that production at Van Nuys would resume by the end 
of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But most big employers in the Valley weren't quite so sure when operations 
would be back in full swing. Glenn Hillin, spokesman for Hughes Missile Systems 
Co. in Canoga Park, said some workers would be called back on Monday. But he 
had no idea when all 1,100 workers would be back on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillin said the quake, which significantly damaged two of the company's 
buildings, would not affect the company's plans to relocate to Tucson by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gradual return of employees, workplaces remained tense. 
Aftershocks continued to rattle workers, and others tried to get through the 
days by sharing their experiences with a touch of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it a little difficult to concentrate," admitted Keith Mordoff, 
spokesman for Lockheed in Calabasas, where more than half of the company's 350 
corporate employees were back by midweek. "People get frazzled" by the 
aftershocks, adding that during one of his phone conversations he told a 
caller, "I might have to finish this interview under my desk."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FILLMORE EXPEDITING BUILDING PERMITS IN BID FOR 
QUICK RECOVERY; CONSTRUCTION: CITY OFFICIALS, BUSINESSES RESPOND TO DISASTER 
WITH URGENCY AS CLEANUP CREWS BEGIN WORK. RED CROSS WILL BEGIN FINDING 
TEMPORARY SHELTERS FOR RESIDENTS.

 Brick by brick, cleanup crews started removing the rubble littering Central 
Avenue in Fillmore on Thursday as residents struggled to bring their town back 
to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just me; everybody wants to get back in business," said Don Duddy, 
whose Central Avenue sewing-machine store was heavily damaged in Monday's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Duddy and other residents were already applying for construction permits at 
the city's temporary building office at 340 Fillmore St. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving at a pretty good pace," said Stephen Stuart, disaster 
coordinator for Fillmore's building and safety department. "It's difficult and 
some people think it's slow and they're frustrated with the process, but we're 
already in the recovery stage and it's only Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
 A quick recovery seemed to be on everybody's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they were expediting permits to rebuild and setting up 
temporary shelters for displaced businesses. The Red Cross said that by today 
they would start finding temporary homes for people still crowded into the two 
temporary shelters in town.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way this town is," said City Councilman Roger Campbell, pausing to 
clear the emotion welling up in his voice. "I've lost everything like a lot of 
other people. I've already had a contractor and architect to take a look at it 
and we're going to start next week to rebuild. That's the kind of resolve you 
have here."  
</P>
<P>
 Businesses in town have responded with the same urgency, hiring contractors 
and builders to assess damage and make plans for rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I was retained Monday morning right after the quake," said Bill 
Crouch, a structural engineer working with the Saticoy Lemon Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we just want to make some temporary repairs so we can get goods 
out. We've got several million dollars worth of lemons in there and they've got 
to be processed in the next 30 days or they're no good." 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore officials seemed most concerned about how much federal money will be 
available to help put their town back together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't do it on our own; there's got to be federal money or we won't be 
able to do it," City Manager Roy Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds lined up at the federal disaster center at St. Francis of Assisi 
Catholic Church for loans to rebuild. Some came up with interim ways to reopen 
their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A destroyed medical clinic for the poor on Central Avenue will start seeing 
some patients today out of a 33-foot trailer that was expected to be parked 
along Santa Clara Street downtown. The trailer has one examining room and will 
be staffed by two doctors and two nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials said they are worried about the spread of infectious diseases 
in shelters, chronically ill patients who need regular treatment, and injuries 
as people sift through debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the first patients at the trailer are going to be expectant 
women. That's an extreme emergency at this time," said Roberto Rojas, manager 
of Centro de Salud Familiar de Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic officials said that the trailer is only a temporary solution while they 
search for a short-term home and decide whether to rebuild their Central Avenue 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic sustained an estimated $750,000 in structural and equipment damage, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While businesses and residents coped with disaster, a television crew kept to 
their schedule and filmed an episode of "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Men dressed in chaps and cowboy hats strolled to the set where horses and 
camels stood for the next scene. Rick McCallum, the producer, said he and his 
company had been through worse in their grueling film schedule, and only one 
day of shooting was missed since production began Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 For Fillmore, the quake is much more of a setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take some time," City Manager Payne said. "The disruption in 
people's lives and even some of their misery might continue. Our job is to get 
through this as fast as we can."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CLEANUP OF OIL SPILL NEAR PIRU CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cleanup continued Thursday on a 168,000-gallon oil spill east of Piru that 
spoiled a 12-mile stretch of the Santa Clara River following Monday's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, workers had vacuumed up about 67,000 gallons of the sticky crude, 
which spilled from a pipeline in Valencia that ruptured in the quake. The spill 
created a shiny slick on the water and coated river-side vegetation that 
provides habitat for wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go," said Albert Greenstein, spokesman for Arco, 
the parent company of Four Corners Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein said the cleanup temporarily lost momentum Thursday morning when a 
helicopter pilot and a pipeline official who were inspecting a parallel pipe 
died in a crash near Fort Tejon in southern Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot was not identified, but the passenger was Michael A. Scully, 33, of 
Bakersfield, son of Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Vin Scully. Michael Scully 
was an engineering supervisor for the pipeline company. He leaves a wife and 
young son. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 workers were involved in the oil cleanup, including nearly 100 
members of the California Conservation Corps, Arco crews, California Department 
of Fish and Game officials, wildlife rescue workers and volunteers. The cleanup 
area extends from east of Piru into Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only one or two dead fish have been found and only two oiled 
waterfowl, one dead and one alive. More oily birds will probably turn up in the 
next few days, said Mary Gale, spokeswoman for Fish and Game's Office of Oil 
Spill Prevention and Response. 
</P>
<P>
 They will then be taken to the Ventura County's Animal Regulation Department, 
where Fish and Game has a mobile wildlife cleaning and rehabilitation trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup effort is expected to continue for weeks, Gale said. A weather 
forecast for up to half an inch of rain this weekend will only delay the 
efforts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Valencia sewage treatment plant, which discharges into the 
river, stopped releasing chlorine in waste water at midday Thursday after 
officials determined that the plant was operating properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that the quake might have damaged the plant, officials added chlorine 
to kill any bacteria that might have passed through the treatment system. 
Chlorine is routinely added to waste water, but is usually removed before the 
water is discharged into rivers, to protect fish and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of oil and chlorine is not friendly to fish or plant life," 
Gale said. "It's toxic."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WATER AN ON-AND-OFF PROBLEM FOR MANY SIMI 
VALLEY CUSTOMERS; CONSERVATION: OFFICIALS EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO REDUCE USE AS 
AFTERSHOCKS RUPTURE PIPES AND INTERRUPT SERVICE FOR A SECOND TIME.

 Simi Valley water officials were struggling Thursday to restore water to as 
many as 5,000 customers who lost service for the second time as aftershocks 
ruptured mains and burst pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ever-changing situation," Deputy City Manager Laura Herron said. "It 
gets better and then something happens and it takes a turn for the worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Herron emphasized the importance of continuing conservation to stretch the 
city's water supply to as many homes as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking people to cut back wherever they can," Herron said. "They should 
hold off on watering their lawns and washing their cars and take quick 
showers." 
</P>
<P>
 Barring any additional disruptions, Herron said, officials hope to have water 
flowing to all homes and businesses in the city by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's water district serves about two-thirds of Simi Valley's 120,000 
residents. The rest are supplied by Southern California Water Co., which has 
restored water to all of its customers, district Supt. Skip Faria said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Faria said individual homes or apartment complexes may be without water 
because of water line breaks on the premises. If that is the case, it is up to 
the owner to have the line repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't realize that if there's a break on the property they need 
to fix it themselves," Faria said. "Wherever we found breaks (on private 
property) we've contacted the owners and most of them have fixed the lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents met the water fluctuations with patience and humor. 
"It's like Russian roulette," said Jim Thomas, an engineer who said the water 
in his east-end home has been off and on several times since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You turn it on and it works, then you turn it on again and it doesn't," 
Thomas said. "So you gotta grab a shower while you can." 
</P>
<P>
 City workers are continuing to give out five gallons of free drinking water 
per household per day at Santa Susana Park, Ralphs supermarket in Wood Ranch, 
the city's Metrolink station, Royal High School and all elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck and Erma Burt stopped by the Metrolink station early Thursday to pick up 
jugs of bottled water. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Burt said the couple did not think it was safe to drink tap water, which 
had returned to their home on the city's east end Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we did was take a shower," Burt said. But his wife disagreed: 
"No, the first thing we did was flush the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
 A health advisory will remain in effect today, warning Simi Valley residents 
to boil water before drinking it. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents unable to cook because of gas shut-offs should add a few drops of 
unscented household bleach to their water, officials said. Add eight drops per 
gallon if the water is clear from the tap. If the water runs cloudy, use 16 
drops. Allow the water to stand for 30 minutes before drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Calleguas Municipal Water District, which supplies water to the 
city's water district and to Southern California Water, unearthed one of its 
two main water lines on Thursday morning for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 78-inch line, which runs under Smith Road in eastern Simi Valley, was 
severely ruptured during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Bergh, advanced planning administrator for the district, said he hoped to 
have the line repaired by today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bergh said repair crews were having a hard time patching the pipe because 
the ground around it was saturated with water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking a pit 20 feet into the ground," Bergh said. "They're having a 
lot of difficulty getting at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The pipe is one of two that Calleguas uses to bring in water from a Los 
Angeles County filtration plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the line is repaired, the district will continue to draw from the Bard 
Reservoir in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a two-week supply in the reservoir," Bergh said. "But other 
problems could come up in the lines, so it's very important for people to 
continue to conserve."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DAMAGE TO SCHOOLS NEARS $5 MILLION; SIMI 
VALLEY: STRUCTURAL REPAIRS WILL NOT BE AS EXTENSIVE AS FEARED. THE DISTRICT, 
LIKE MOST, LACKS EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Simi Valley school buildings suffered nearly $5 million in damage in Monday's 
earthquake, officials estimated Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But damage at the most seriously affected schools was not as bad as initially 
believed, they said, and all district schools could be open by the middle of 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our structural repairs are not as extensive as we had anticipated," Simi 
Valley Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most homeowners, Ventura County school districts have no earthquake 
insurance to cover the cost of repairing cracked buildings, crumbling plaster, 
fallen tiles and shattered light fixtures from the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 So districts with damaged schools will join residents and business owners who 
hope for federal and state assistance to bail them out. The districts will 
appeal to the state Department of Education and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, Simi Valley school board members were debating how to 
trim a $2.5-million deficit from the district's $77.1-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore and Conejo Valley unified school districts received lesser damage, at 
$175,000 and $400,000, respectively, but they also hope to recover as much of 
the cleanup and repair costs as possible to avoid deepening their budget 
problems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're struggling," Fillmore Supt. David Haney said. "It's real, real bleak. 
We're going to have much bigger cuts if we don't get some help, but I'm 
optimistic that we will get help." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake insurance has proven too expensive for schools to afford, even 
though all 20 of the public districts in Ventura County pool their resources to 
get a better deal on insurance coverage, said Paul Wilhelmsen, executive 
director of the Ventura County Schools Self-Funding Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the authority's board was quoted a one-year cost of $550,000 for 
quake insurance, to be spread among the districts according to size, Wilhelmsen 
said. At that price, the deductible for each district would be $50,000, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cost for earthquake insurance is quite high, and the school districts 
have felt that they could rely on state and federal government aid," Wilhelmsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't pencil out," Haney agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most school districts in the state do not carry earthquake insurance because 
of the cost, Wilhelmsen said. Also, if school districts had earthquake 
insurance they might not qualify for government aid after a disaster, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County schools are covered through existing policies for fires or 
floods that might occur as a result of an earthquake, Conejo Valley Assistant 
Supt. Sarah Hart said. Those are more common than structural damage from the 
shaking, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be covered as far as what we feel is fiscally responsible, but we 
also need to be fiscally prudent," Hart said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; PANIC SUBSIDES, BUT COUNTY RESIDENTS STILL 
STOCKPILING GOODS; PREPAREDNESS: STORES REPORT EMERGENCY SUPPLIES SUCH AS 
BATTERIES, FLASHLIGHTS AND GENERATORS ARE GOING FAST. AT ONE SITE, 50 WATER 
HEATERS ARE SOLD IN ONE DAY.

 Ventura County residents are still stockpiling batteries, bottled water, 
canned food and other emergency supplies, although the frenzied buying pace in 
the immediate aftermath of this week's 6.6 temblor has slowed, merchants said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hughes Market in Moorpark, people were buying "just about what you'd 
expect -- water, batteries, canned goods," said assistant manager Dana DeSain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just buying more quantities of items," DeSain said. "We're quite a 
bit busier." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many hardware outlets, Sears, Roebuck & Co. in Oxnard was selling 
supplies for lighting quake-darkened homes -- flashlights, batteries, camping 
lanterns and portable generators -- said store manager Roger Teel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a surprise -- we sold a lot of water heaters," Teel said 
Thursday. "This time of year we average three or four. We've been selling 50 a 
day for the last couple of days," in addition to quake-resistant flexible water 
hookups and straps to anchor the heavy appliances to the wall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, customers had lined up earlier in the week outside 
supermarkets, department stores and building supply outlets, waiting for store 
employees to escort them through the stores a few at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the HomeBase store in hard-hit Simi Valley, where water and power outages 
left residents dark and dry, the store's shelves of C and D batteries were 
depleted within 30 minutes of opening Monday, and supplies of quake-resistant 
flexible water pipes for ruptured water heater connections dwindled fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty much the same with all of them," said Alex Conserva, a clerk at 
HomeBase. "They all weren't prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday afternoon, the Hughes store in Moorpark was waiting to restock 
supplies of batteries that had sold out within a few hours of Monday's 
earthquake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the customers have been asking when more batteries will come in, DeSain 
said, "I can't guarantee anything till I see it come in through the back door." 
</P>
<P>
 HomeBase employee Angela Cerrillo said that store received a new shipment of 
water heaters and half of those have already been sold. More water heaters and 
plumbing supplies will be shipped in today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quake's aftermath, other items including flashlights, fire 
extinguishers and other home safety equipment were plucked off the shelves at 
hardware outlets, while supermarkets and convenience stores did brisk business 
in blackout necessities -- water, milk, ice, charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Ralph's supermarket in Wood Ranch was limiting purchases to 
five emergency items per family Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing nearly 100 deep, customers cheered as the power came on, scurried out 
from under the awning as an aftershock rocked the store, and groaned when the 
power failed again moments later. 
</P>
<P>
 But most shoppers stayed civil. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant manager Mark Zema said the five-item restriction was lifted when the 
store reopened Tuesday at 8 a.m. Sales of batteries, flashlights, charcoal and 
dairy products have been brisk, but business has slowed to near-normal, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today for us is like a good Saturday," Zema said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, panic buying at Gelson's in Thousand Oaks had switched from 
emergency supplies to all supplies. Shoppers from Westlake Village crammed the 
aisles alongside Angelenos whose quake-rattled grocery stores in the San 
Fernando Valley remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Store manager John Austin juggled duties -- fielding phone calls, bagging 
groceries and dispatching clerks to regulate the flow of customers into the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take a look around the store and see -- everything is selling," said 
Austin, raising his voice over the clatter of shopping carts and the beep of a 
fully staffed row of cash registers. "The place is going bananas." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardware stores have felt the crush too. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake smashed two major Central Avenue stores in Fillmore -- Garren's 
Hardware and Patterson Hardware -- stores in Santa Paula and Ventura took up 
the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave's Building Supplies in Santa Paula did brisk business, selling Fillmore 
residents 2-by-4s and joist hardware to shore up their quake-twisted house 
frames, and pipes to repair their shattered plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really busy," said sales clerk Jerry Finley. 
</P>
<P>
 Store owner Pat Drake frowned on reports of opportunist merchants jacking up 
their prices in the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someplace was selling D batteries for $9 apiece," she said. "We think it's 
terrible -- to get people down like that and then kick 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 At Contractor's Warehouse in Ventura, Fillmore residents Jeff Morford and Pete 
Munoz stocked up on flexible water heater pipes for themselves and their 
neighbors, and slammed the profiteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a gas station in Fillmore charging $2 for a Coke," Morford said 
grimly. "I think it sucks . . . any time anybody capitalizes on someone else's 
misfortune." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the week, Contractor's Warehouse in Ventura sold all four of its 
gas-powered generators -- at $500 to $900 a pop -- within a few hours, and the 
store's supply of batteries and water heaters went quickly, said assistant 
manager Rick Machuca. 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the store's lumberyard, plywood and window frames were hot items, 
selling fast to glass repair shops and Los Angeles residents, said Mark Moon, 
the yard manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Even in Ventura, one of the lesser-hit cities, shoppers wanted water, 
charcoal, ice and food. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ralph's store on Victoria Avenue in Ventura opened at 3 p.m. Monday and 
sold $10,000 of the disaster staples in a few hours, said store manager Dave 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Most said they wish they had bought batteries and other emergency supplies 
earlier, Jordan said, adding, "But then, we all say that."

POLICE SEIZE WEAPONS, ARREST COUPLE IN ASSAULTS

 Santa Paula police have arrested a man and his wife after linking them to two 
recent assaults and gang activity in the city, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers Wednesday searched the apartment of Donald Smith, 32, and his 
wife, Brenda, 31, and found a 12-gauge shotgun, .22-caliber rifle and 
.38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Sgt. George Brink said Donald Smith flushed a stash of 
methamphetamine down a toilet as officers tried to break into the bathroom. 
Police also found a small amount of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Brink said the search warrant was executed after a two-week investigation 
prompted by allegations that the Smiths were hiding guns in their apartment on 
West Harvard Avenue for members of a Santa Paula gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Brink said he believes that one of the guns found in the apartment belongs to 
a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have also linked the couple to an alleged assault on a girl whose 
stolen property had been recovered from the Smith apartment. And they believe 
that Donald Smith is responsible for a December assault and robbery attempt on 
a man who lived in the same apartment complex. The man's skull was fractured 
when he was struck from behind, Brink said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Smith is being held in County Jail in lieu of $20,000 bail. He was 
booked on suspicion of attempted robbery, kidnaping and two counts of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Smith was booked on suspicion of kidnaping. She is also being held in 
County Jail in lieu of $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Smiths are scheduled to appear in Ventura County Municipal Court today 
for arraignment.

CHARGE ADDED IN BOY'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acharge of first-degree burglary was added Thursday to a list of crimes filed 
against a Ventura man who prosecutors say shot a boy who had struck his car 
with a baseball by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Adams, 21, pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted first-degree 
murder and first-degree burglary in Ventura County Municipal Court on Thursday, 
prosecutors said.He also denied a special allegation that he used a firearm in 
the commission of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams is accused of forcing his way into the home of Kevin Natale, a 
14-year-old neighbor who last year had accidentally hit Adams' car with a 
baseball. According to prosecutors, Adams forced his way into the Natale home 
Jan. 12 and fired several shots before striking the boy in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy Ratner said Adams could receive 25 years to life in 
state prison if he is convicted of attempted first-degree murder and a jury 
finds the special allegation to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' mother told reporters last week she could not explain her son's alleged 
action, and that she had no idea where the 9-millimeter handgun might have come 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin, who was playing video games with a neighbor when Adams allegedly forced 
his way into the residence, earlier this week was transferred to a special 
rehabilitation center at St. John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet lodged in his shoulder, threatening to paralyze the boy. He was 
listed in fair condition Thursday, but hospital officials would not say whether 
he might be able to walk again.

OXNARD MAN, 21, SENTENCED TO PRISON IN LANDLORD'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Oxnard man was sentenced to 16 years to life in state prison for 
his role in an attempted robbery that turned deadly for a Port Hueneme 
landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Lee Soto, who pleaded guilty earlier to second-degree murder and agreed 
to testify against three other defendants in the Ventura County Superior Court 
case, received 15 years to life for the murder plea, plus an additional year 
for using a firearm during the commission of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted his part in the attempted robbery of Richard Schell, a 55-year-old 
Santa Barbara man who was killed Dec. 1, 1992, as the four men tried to take 
rent money that Schell was collecting from tenants in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Martinez, Jose Arreguin and George Pena also were convicted in the 
case. But Martinez, the 16-year-old who prosecutors believe fired the shot that 
killed Schell, was acquitted of murder and found guilty of the lesser charge of 
attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn said Soto's plea and 
subsequent testimony helped prosecutors win the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not have a lot of credibility" on the witness stand, Glynn said. But 
"I needed him to fill in the blank spaces, so it was a necessary plea 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn dropped a charge of attempted burglary after the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state guidelines, Soto could have received no less than 15 years to life 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena and Arreguin were convicted of first-degree murder. Pena was sentenced to 
25 years to life in prison, and Arreguin to live in prison without possibility 
of parole.

PARKING LIMITS OKD NEAR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing crowded conditions at Bubbling Springs Park, the Port Hueneme City 
Council has approved a zone that will restrict parking on adjacent streets to 
residents during summer weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning April 1 for six months, only residents and guests with parking 
passes will be allowed to park on Park Avenue from Bard Road to 6th Street or 
on the south side of Bard from J Street to 7th Avenue on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also construct an additional 33 parking spaces to supplement the 
existing 39. 
</P>
<P>
 The city developed the parking plan after park neighbors complained that 
increasing use had led to traffic congestion, excessive noise, littering, 
vandalism, unlicensed vendors and inappropriate behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the problems that are associated with the park are due to the 
extremely large numbers of commuters who frequent the park on weekends," said 
Brady Cherry, the city's recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
 The park was designed with the limited facilities of a community park, but has 
increasingly been used on a regional basis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents at Wednesday's council meeting criticized the plan, saying 
it would make both residents outside the parking zone and visitors feel 
unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan will be evaluated in three months.

VENTURA MOTHER PLEADS GUILTY TO CHILD STEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura mother of two who fled to Sri Lanka rather than give up her children 
pleaded guilty to four felonies on Thursday, but will likely avoid prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Niki Lynn Ruberoe, 33, on Thursday admitted to charges of child stealing, 
violating a custody agreement, conspiracy and aiding and abetting failure to 
appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 She could have received eight years in state prison for her crimes but agreed 
to the plea on the condition she receive probation. Sentencing is scheduled for 
Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruberoe was granted temporary custody of her two children last summer. But 
when her husband, the children's stepfather, was convicted of multiple counts 
of child molestation, she chose to take the children out of the country rather 
than return them to their biological father, Ruberoe's ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruberoe admitted taking the children, ages 10 and 13, to France and then 
arranging for them to meet her husband, Channa Ruberoe, in Sri Lanka, where he 
is a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Niki Ruberoe was returned to Ventura County last month, but authorities are 
still attempting to bring back her husband, who is fighting extradition because 
he still faces sentencing on the molestation charges and would probably face 
additional penalties for failing to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Steve P. Pell on Thursday called the plea bargain reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't belong in prison," said Pell, who added that his client would be 
filing for divorce from her husband soon.

FASHION; FITNESS CHIC HITS ITS STRIDE IN STRIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's a reaction to the frivolity of high fashion. Or perhaps it relates 
to the dress-down, comfort-first attitude of the '90s. Call it a response to 
the popular fixation with physical fitness -- which is not going away anytime 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, tennis skirts, sneakers, workout leggings and sports bras 
are no longer being left court-side or at the gym. They are sliding into 
wardrobes and showing up at nightclubs and dinner parties as designers, from 
couture to street wear, stripe their collections and sprint full force into '94 
with locker chic. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems no designer is sitting out this trend. Renditions of the real thing 
hit the stores in fabrics fit for exercise, and others -- like sparkling 
sequins or itchy vintage polyester -- that only seem real amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even accessories such as solid headbands, white ankle socks, multifunction 
watches and streamlined backpacks (instead of shoulder bags) are becoming 
required equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 Sneakers, which have become as standard in everyone's wardrobe as underwear, 
are de rigueur to the uniform, whether they're canvas or velvet. High-tech 
super shoes will do, but the winners are simple, retro models such as Gazelles 
and Rod Lavers from Adidas or Puma's Suedes and Clydes. 
</P>
<P>
 There were indicators to the eventual rise of this latest game with active 
wear: Urban divas and dudes have long played with clothes originally reserved 
for cycling, hiking and even scuba diving (remember that neoprene Body Glove 
club wear a few years back?). And let's not forget the ubiquitous head gear of 
the decade -- the baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, the obvious influence in the deluge of fashionable 
fitness-inspired gear is Adidas, whose side-striped exercise suits and athletic 
shoes, as well as anything with the trefoil logo, have long been staples of 
hip-hop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall Run DMC's 1983 ode "My Adidas" as well as the rap trio's penchant for 
anything by the international athletic wear company. Counterculture's ongoing 
plunder of anything retro has led it past the disco-and-bell-bottom part of the 
'70s (which became mainstream last year) to that decade's "old school" mode, 
which includes everything from the rap of Grand Master Flash to the animated TV 
series "Fat Albert." 
</P>
<P>
 Adidas style has made such an impact among the new generation that the company 
has had to play legal hardball to prevent its legendary trefoil logo from being 
altered into a marijuana leaf and screened onto T-shirts and ball caps. 
</P>
<P>
 John Fread, a spokesman for Portland-based Adidas America, attributes the 
label's long-standing appeal to its "no-hype attitude," which is very much in 
line with '90s sentiment. "There's a real simplicity in Adidas design. 
Consumers are looking for the same comfort they get (in what they wear) playing 
basketball or working out at the gym as dancing at a nightclub. Fashion is just 
responding to this lifestyle attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Laura Whitcomb sees the trend as part of a larger "sensibility of the 
'90s which is eliminating the hierarchy in fashion. For the first time we're 
seeing street wear merging with couture quality fashion that can be worn to a 
party or some other event." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitcomb's take on the look, complete with an officially licensed Adidas 
trefoil logo, has been spotted on Madonna, Wynona Ryder and model Naomi 
Campbell at splashy forums such as the MTV and Academy awards.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the collection has expanded to include a range of striped wear, the 
$300 dress remains among the most sought-after. Whitcomb says recent trade 
shows pulled in more than 20,000 orders for the dress, although considerably 
fewer will actually be shipped. "We want to keep it limited," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based designer contrived the dress three years ago as a fashion 
stylist putting together a spread on designer gowns that incorporated athletic 
wear motifs. "The Adidas one came out best," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 She resurrected the style last year under her collection, Label, sponsored by 
hip-hop hit maker Tommy Boy records. "I didn't think '90s fashion offered 
anything that was signature of the decade." Performance-oriented fashion that 
reveals being physically fit is the answer, she adds. "It's what people will 
see as something truly from the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 And even though this truly '90s trend is rooted in hip-hop culture of the 
'70s, it's the fact that fashion pundits are taking it to another level with 
greater style, better fabrics and innovative silhouette applications that is 
giving it its modern identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking the whole Adidas look, but using that idea creatively," says 
designer Julia (Joolz) Andersen of Fusion in Los Angeles. Fusion released a 
complete line of striped gear: leggings, hot pants, skirts (both ankle length 
and barely covering) and a long hooded dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many young street-wear companies, Fusion was among the first to market 
the look early last year, responding to counterculture interest in vintage 
athletic wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen and her peers at other street-wear labels see the higher-priced 
"knock-offs" by the likes of everyone from Donna Karan to Chanel as a boost to 
their lines, with most items priced under $80. "We know every little girl in 
America is going to want it next season when it hits the malls," says Andersen, 
who is already considering a sports stripe for Fusion's menswear line for 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For several seasons now, Los Angeles-based lines Pleasure Swell and Mondorama 
have been striping jackets, shirts, tees and hats in their menswear collections 
with bars that evoke auto racing more than track. But the message is the same, 
say the designers.

 "Stripes are clean," notes Mondorama's David Miller. "They act as a finish 
that accentuates, be it the body or the flow of a silhouette."  
</P>
<P>
 Even with the eventual saturation of this trend, Label's Whitcomb predicts the 
look will "carry on for several seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, if fashion in the '90s is about being fit, these clothes represent 
vitality and health of mind and body. Dressing the part could at least set you 
in that frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Even greater is the "marriage between function and style," says Joel 
Fitzpatrick, designer and co-owner of L.A.-based Pleasure Swell. "Part of the 
birth of urban street wear is this marriage, with comfort playing a big part of 
that."

 The holidays may be past, but for fashion mavens there's still time to 
celebrate -- with mid-winter sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you hit the stores, make a list of your wardrobe's missing links.Before 
you buy, ask yourself if you'd want it if it weren't marked down and factor in 
any alteration costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask if your bargain is really a bargain," says Elaine Stone, a professor at 
the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. "If I'm going to have to pay 
for a lot of alterations, it loses its aura." 
</P>
<P>
 Eschew the outlandish. Stone says you should consider whether, when you get it 
home, you will say, "That's still not me." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not the kind of person who would normally feel comfortable wearing 
it," she says, "I don't care what the price is." 
</P>
<P>
 Also steer clear of any item whose best attribute is "sensible." 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing you can do is get hypnotized by stuff that is absolutely 
rainy-day wear," says Bud Konheim, CEO of Nicole Miller.

PERFORMING ARTS CENTER ENDS '93 BARELY IN BLACK; BUDGET: THE ORANGE COUNTY 
VENUE MISSED ITS FUND-RAISING GOAL AND HAD TO DIP INTO A 'PROGRAMMING SUBSIDY' 
TO AVOID RED INK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Performing Arts Center ended 1993 in the black, but missed 
its fund-raising goal by nearly 20% and wound up with the lowest operating 
surplus in its eight-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Center expenses in 1993 totaled $19.9 million while revenue totaled $15.5 
million, officials announced Thursday. To offset the difference, which had been 
anticipated at the nonprofit center, a fund-raising goal of $5 million had been 
established and budgeted. But only $4.1 million was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Center officials nevertheless were able to avoid red ink by taking $510,000 
from a "programming subsidy" established two years ago. In a prepared 
statement, officials said the center thus ended the year "in a strong financial 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 But executive director Tom Tomlinson later acknowledged that the surplus -- 
reported at $205,284 -- is the center's smallest ever. Last year's, for 
instance, was more than half a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson maintained that "a smaller surplus at the end of this year than the 
previous year is . . . inconsequential." 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the continued downturn in the economy," he said, "this institution 
has remained strong, and over eight years, developed a very strong financial 
figure. . . . Our (total) attendance (for center-presented events) was up by 
12%, which is a phenomenal feat." 
</P>
<P>
 Average paid attendance, however, was 82.8% of capacity, down from the 
previous year, according to figures the center provided. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tomlinson acknowledged that the total contributions, including those to 
the center's endowment and building funds, also are down from last year, by 
5.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he insisted that the center's "strong financial" status, not the 
decrease in contributions or in operating surplus, is the "real story" of its 
year-end report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "1993 was a challenging year," center Chairman Thomas H. Nielsen said in a 
prepared statement, "not only for the center but for most charitable groups in 
the Southland and many national and international arts organizations 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the global recession, 1993 was the year that the international supply 
of top-quality attractions available to the center was sharply reduced," 
Nielsen continued. "For the first time, (the center's) dance season did not 
feature a single foreign company." 
</P>
<P>
 But "with forecasts for improved economic conditions throughout the U.S., Asia 
and Europe, I am pleased to note that both national and international touring 
appear to be recovering, although the cost of presenting touring attractions is 
continuing to rise." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, center officials reported that "careful cost controls" in '93 
enabled them to reduce expenses from the previous year by $2.5 million, or 
7.5%.

OPERA PACIFIC BENEFIT FALLS $50,000 SHORT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Though it was intended as a benefit for Opera Pacific, a presentation of 
Placido Domingo in Manuel Penella's "El Gato Montes" at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center on Saturday ended up costing the company $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket sales brought in about $322,000 -- not enough to cover total costs, 
which included busing in about 2,000 students for the dress rehearsal and a 
post-performance reception for 200 who'd purchased tickets at $500 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Pacific's general director, David DiChiera, noted Thursday that paid 
attendance was 98%, "but we had actually hoped to sell 300 tickets at the 
benefit price. That would have made up the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a repertory point of view and educational point of view, it was still a 
very worthwhile project for us," DiChiera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was presented in cooperation with the Los Angeles Music Center 
Opera, which is presenting "El Gato" through Jan. 29. CHRIS PASLES

WALLY GEORGE IN HOSPITAL FACING PROSTATE SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Conservative talk show host Wally George is recuperating after what he called 
a near brush with death over the weekend, but he faces surgery for a prostate 
condition in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 George said doctors told him he was experiencing almost complete kidney 
failure Sunday when he was rushed to a hospital in the San Fernando Valley. He 
said he had been feeling ill for several weeks and had assumed it was a virus 
of some kind. But Sunday morning "I got up and felt like I was dying," and his 
wife, Janis, took him to Panorama Community Hospital, near his Sherman Oaks 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking at death in the mirror," the host of KDOC-TV's "Hot Seat" said 
Thursday, on the phone from his hospital bed. "I really scared myself." 
</P>
<P>
 George said doctors discovered that his prostate was so enlarged that it had 
blocked his kidney ducts, and that his heart was beating erratically and his 
blood pressure was dangerously high. George, 61, said he had known of his 
prostate condition but had chosen to ignore it as he is "a chicken" about 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the hospital is working to stabilize his condition and probably will 
release him this weekend, and that he will remain at home until he is strong 
enough to undergo the surgery. The extent of the surgery is undetermined -- 
part of the prostate has hardened, George said, indicating a possible tumor. 
Biopsy results are due next week. 
</P>
<P>
 George said he has received cards, flowers and phone calls from fans of "Hot 
Seat," which is taped in Anaheim and syndicated nationally. "My viewers have 
been so wonderful to me. . . . That has really, really kept my spirits up." A 
KDOC spokesperson said the channel will show reruns until George's return, 
which could be six weeks or more away. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two weeks, George has also been doing a weekly radio show on 
local country station KIK-FM (94.3). He had been scheduled to emcee a punk rock 
show at the Ice House in Fullerton on Jan. 28. Promoters of that event could 
not be reached Thursday, but a recording indicated that plans for the concert 
are moving forward. (714) 323-8683.

AN EXCHANGE OF MUSICAL IDEAS; JAZZ: ROB MULLINS PERFORMED 'TAKE 5' IN VIETNAM 
AND HEARS ORIGINAL WORKS. HE PLAYS SATURDAY AT OCC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Before he left for Hanoi last month, Rob Mullins saw Oliver Stone's latest 
film, "Heaven and Earth," which chronicles four decades of a Vietnamese woman's 
life. But it didn't prepare him for what he found there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a place where time is still stuck back somewhere in the past," the 
keyboardist from Huntington Beach said. "They're still trying to develop basic 
things like electricity, public transportation, systems of distribution for 
their products. It's going to be a long time before they catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins, 36, visited Hanoi to play in the city's opera house. The trip was 
sponsored by Colorado-based International Exposure, a nonprofit group that 
encourages humanitarianism through cultural exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Mullins brought an unfamiliar art form to the Southeast Asian 
country, one that that populace seems hungry for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese have a lot of respect for their traditional art forms and 
music, forms that are fascinating and very unique in character," he said. "But 
they're still trying to find their way in terms of identity in pop music and 
jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Year's Eve concert at the Hanoi Opera House was the central event in 
Mullins' 12-day odyssey. The 750-seat facility, built by the French in 1911, 
was filled to capacity for Mullins' performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the place where Ho Chi Minh would watch performances by the Vietnamese 
National Orchestra as well as traditional bands from the local conservatory," 
Mullins said. "For my concert, there were 5-year-old kids in tattered clothes 
sitting next to government officials. It was so crowded that people were 
standing in the wings and the aisles." 
</P>
<P>
 After introductory speeches by the head of the city's music conservatory and 
Terrianne Steinhauer, head of International Exposure, "It was time to rock," 
Mullins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working solo, Mullins employed prerecorded digital tapes to provide his own 
backing, while playing the synthesizer he brought with him as well as the opera 
house's grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recorded all the tracks in advance back in my studio, and they sounded 
huge. I had a digital representation of the world's finest jazz band." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins, who plays Saturday at Orange Coast College's Robert B. Moore Theatre, 
opened with his "Welcome to New York," then played his Grammy-nominated "Making 
Love" before moving into the Paul Desmond-Dave Brubeck tune, "Take 5."  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in the audience knew the song from when it was a pop hit in the 
'50s, and they applauded. Then, I started playing (the strings) inside the 
piano, playing percussively and hitting the low-end strings with my hand for a 
bass sound, and people just went off, cheering and clapping." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Mullins closed his solo part of the concert with "Peace," a mid-tempo 
ballad composed especially for the concert. "It's my musical gift and wish for 
positive relationships for Vietnam and the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, Mullins brought up the members of the city's only jazz 
ensemble, the Orient Band, to jam with him on "Caravan." 
</P>
<P>
 "People went crazy," Mullins recalled, "and everyone on stage was hugging and 
smiling. Then it was time to meet the audience. Many came up who could speak 
English; those who couldn't spoke through my translator. You could see they 
were really touched, some were even crying. It was a very emotional moment for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before the concert, Mullins visited the Hanoi Music Conservatory 
to meet with his fellow musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was . . . down a dirt lane, just three buildings, all in a state of 
disrepair." He toured the conservatory's various departments -- vocal, 
symphonic, pop music and traditional Vietnamese music. He was appalled at what 
he found in the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only books they had were Russian editions of European classical 
masterworks. If a student wanted to go into the library for sheet music to a 
pop song, they'd be out of luck. They've never seen sheet music for that type 
of thing. The entire music collection consists of 40 CDs, all classical, and 
one machine to play them on. I gave them five of my recordings, and it was the 
first jazz CDs they had." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Mullins heard from the students, including a young keyboardist with an 
ear for boogie-woogie, and from the Orient Band. 
</P>
<P>
 "They presented a few American jazz tunes as well as some original music that 
was fantastic; like Chick Corea-meets-Vietnam. I was very impressed with the 
ability levels, especially since it is so difficult to get their hands on 
material to learn from." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins also was influenced musically by his journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll hear it in my work in the future," he said. "When I went to Japan in 
the late '80s, it influenced my work and I came out with 'Tokyo Nights.' Now I 
would like to work with the sounds of American jazz, funk and Vietnamese 
traditional music as well as European symphonic music to create a new style of 
world music." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins also felt empathy for his fellow musicians in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talking to them, I found that a lot of the conditions that we face are 
similar. It's very difficult for musicians to eat and earn a living strictly 
from their music.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the impression most people around the world have is that music 
is something for fun. It's too bad that people don't take musicians more 
seriously and understand their personal battles. I've fought the same problems 
the Vietnamese musicians face my whole life: finding jobs, doing the work and, 
afterward, collecting the money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important lessons learned from his travels are those that have to 
do with life itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any idea how lucky I was to be part of American life until I 
lived there for a week. The things we take for granted here -- hot and cold 
running water, a variety of foods to choose from, being able to drive somewhere 
in your car, the basic things we have as part of our daily lives -- those 
things don't exist there." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that in my travels, I've only scratched the surface of understanding 
their culture. But I hope to know more about their hopes and dreams in 
subsequent trips." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins released two albums last year, "Plays for Lovers" and "One Night in 
Houston," for the San Clemente-based Audioquest label, both of which charted on 
various radio play lists.  
</P>
<P>
 He promises to spin tales from his journey when he appears at Orange Coast 
College with his regular band: saxophonist Wilton Felder, drummer Ndugu 
Chancler and bassist Larry Kimpel. He hopes to release a video detailing his 
adventures in Vietnam (Mullins traveled with a six-member crew from 
International Exposure). And, as you might expect, he's planning to return. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rob Mullins Band plays Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Robert B. Moore 
Theatre, Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. $7-$12 
(advance); $12-$15 (at the door). (714) 432-5880.

LINKE TROUPE OPENS CARPENTER CENTER IN LONG BEACH SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center at Cal State Long 
Beach opens Sunday at 8 p.m. with a performance by the Susanne Linke Dance 
Company of Frankfurt, Germany. The troupe will offer the first West Coast 
performance of Linke's piece RUHR-ORT.Tickets are $15. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, at 6200 Atherton St., will be used for a wide variety of arts 
events. Five concerts ranging from jazz to comedy to country music are 
scheduled in the main, 1,162-seat hall: the Nat Adderley jazz quintet on Feb. 
12, comedian Paul Rodriguez on March 12, the San Francisco Girls Chorus on 
March 27, the Joe Goode Performance Group on April 16 and country/Tejano singer 
Tish Hinojosa on May 5. For information on all programs, call (310) 985-7000. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater can be scaled down to 765 seats for smaller events; the center 
also houses the Martha B. Knoebel Theater, a 250-seat hall designed exclusively 
for dance. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has been financed with $27 million in state bonds but will operate 
without additional government subsidy. Richard Carpenter has donated $1 million 
toward its endowment. Carpenter and his late sister, Karen, majored in music at 
Cal State Long Beach before going on to fame as a pop singing duo.

DANA PARSONS: THIS SCORE JUST IN ON JUMBOTRON: GREED DEFEATS NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I tried laughing. That didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did crying. 
</P>
<P>
 All I'm left with is to pound my fist into my mitt and mutter, "Say it ain't 
so, say it ain't so." 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me they didn't really say that. Tell me that nobody can be that out of 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me ask you, when you think of federal disaster relief, what comes to mind? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you think of Midwestern floods and the possessions of a lifetime 
floating downriver? Don't you think of Hurricane Andrew pummeling the South? 
Don't you think of tornadoes ripping the heart out of a small town? 
</P>
<P>
 And most passionately this week, don't you think of a Los Angeles earthquake 
and 20,000 people living in tents? Of food shortages? Of emergency health 
problems? Of unsafe houses? Of schools shut down? Of psyches shattered? Of more 
than 50 people killed, for God sakes? 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, we think of the Sony Jumbotron. We think of an 
instant-replay scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother, can you lend a dime? 
</P>
<P>
 How about a few mil? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, thousands of our neighbors in Los Angeles are homeless, but, hey, what 
about us? We got a dead scoreboard down here, for Pete's sake! You try to live 
without instant replay and see how you like it! 
</P>
<P>
 I wish I were kidding, but that is the message sent out by Orange County 
public officials. The Board of Supervisors declared our county a state of 
emergency this week, a first step toward going after some federal disaster 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 The board noted, apparently without any hint of sheepishness, that the city of 
Anaheim is most eager for some federal assistance, partly because the 
city-owned stadium was damaged. That damage occurred when the giant Jumbotron 
scoreboard collapsed into the left-field stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the overwhelming devastation in Los Angeles, the reaction of most people 
to the scoreboard collapse likely was a big "So what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not Orange County. We didn't develop the stereotype out of thin air that we're 
an isolated, unfeeling, materialistic bastion of self-aggrandizement. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked flat-out whether stadium damage should qualify for assistance, 
Supervisor Tom Riley should have spotted that as a fast ball down the middle. 
You prayed he'd have said something like, "Given the massive destruction in Los 
Angeles, I doubt any of us would feel too comfortable asking for money to 
repair a scoreboard that could go to people in need." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the board chairman, he of the good life down here, replied: "If the 
criteria makes it eligible under the law, I think you should get your share." 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Antoinette would have loved this place. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if the county writes a real spiffy application grant, it can ace out a 
school or an orphanage for the last few thousand bucks of federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next, Newport Beach asking for funds to replace the giant guitar atop 
the Hard Rock Cafe? (HEY, I'M JUST KIDDING; IT WASN'T DAMAGED). 
</P>
<P>
 I presume this is all handled through paperwork. I almost wish it weren't; I 
wish someone had to go in person and ask for the relief money. 
</P>
<P>
 Call me a softie, but I'd hate to be the guy standing in line asking for money 
for Jumbotron when the person next to me was asking for food and water. "Well, 
you see, sir, we have this real cool scoreboard and it fell down and made a 
helluva mess." 
</P>
<P>
 In applying for state-of-emergency status, the board noted that part of the 
justification is because the county chipped in to help Los Angeles and, 
therefore, should get some money back. Whatever sense that made was obliterated 
by the open declaration that Anaheim also wanted money for the scoreboard 
repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, someone needs to pay for Jumbotron, although my initial question 
would be why the quake caused the thing to collapse in the first place, given 
that not much else was damaged in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure the government works in mysterious ways, but it's hard to imagine any 
federal relief official approving the Anaheim request. The underpinning of 
American public support for disaster relief is that any of us can picture 
ourselves in the place of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 We can picture working into the night with sandbags against the floodwaters, 
only to lose everything. We can imagine carrying heirlooms from the house 
before disaster strikes. We can empathize with people huddled in the basement 
as the twister strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But an electronic blinking scoreboard that happens to topple into the cheap 
seats? 
</P>
<P>
 Go to the end of the line, buddy. We're trying to help people whose lives have 
unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably, our local officials won't understand why people will be outraged 
when they hear that Orange County wants to elbow its way up to the trough to 
repair ol' Jumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they don't, that's exactly the point.

BOARD TO CENSURE BRANCH; INQUIRY: SUPERVISORS WILL ACT FOLLOWING INVESTIGATION 
THAT UPHELD ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND MISMANAGEMENT AGAINST THE 
COUNTY RECORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Board of Supervisors plans to censure Orange County Recorder Lee A. Branch 
now that the county's investigation has upheld allegations of sexual harassment 
and serious mismanagement and portrayed Branch's office as "out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 In reports made public Thursday, county personnel investigators said Branch's 
favored treatment of a female department supervisor with whom he was 
romantically involved created such a hostile work environment that at least 
nine employees sought medical or psychological treatment for stress and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees told investigators that office supervisor Nancy L. Smith "wielded 
tremendous power" as a result of her relationship with Branch and used that 
authority to "intimidate" employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the employees we interviewed believed that Ms. Smith was the 
recorder," investigators wrote. "As one employee put it, 'You don't cross Nancy 
or you're dead meat.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Branch and Smith have denied any wrongdoing. Branch has vowed to seek 
reelection this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his home Thursday, Branch said he had not seen the county reports 
and declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Lloyd Charton, said there were "no surprises" in the county's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sexual harassment allegations are as laughable as they were before," he 
said. "If Lee Branch can go through life and this is the worst he has done, 
then he'll die a happy man." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the board's planned censure action, Charton said: "Lee Branch 
hereby censures (board Chairman) Tom Riley. That means the same as the board's 
censure and that's nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the employee complaints, repeated calls by top officials for the 
recorder to resign and now the supervisors' planned censure, Branch remains 
virtually untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, 57, who presides over the obscure repository for real estate and loan 
transactions, is elected by the voters. He has been in office since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury could engage in removal proceedings. The Grand 
Jury has requested information regarding the recorder's office, but it is 
unclear whether the panel is pursuing misconduct allegations.  
</P>
<P>
 County Affirmative Action Officer Ben Alvillar, whose office conducted the 
wide-ranging probe, recommended that Branch resign. 
</P>
<P>
 In a censure letter to Branch, Riley said the evidence supports the misconduct 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your management style has resulted in low morale and inefficiency," Riley 
wrote. "It is a tribute to recorder employees that they have continued to get 
the job done in spite of you." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Riley said he did not believe Branch could ever assume control of 
his office in light the reports' findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to consider the Branch reports Tuesday. The planned 
censure could be the first time the board has taken such an action, County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recorder's office Thursday, emotions were running high among some 
employees who have said that they fear possible retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like chaos around here," said one employee who declined to be 
named. The employee said office copy machines were buzzing all day, running off 
copies of the county report for employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate reports, investigators in the county's Affirmative Action Office 
analyzed the employee-related complaints while a top county official reviewed 
the management of Branch's office. The reports recommended that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Branch apologize to an employee who accused him of making lewd remarks 
interpreted by the employee as conveying a "sexual overture." 
</P>
<P>
 * Branch take "absolutely no type of retaliation" against any of the 50 
employees interviewed by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smith be transferred to another county department. 
</P>
<P>
 * The recorder make no decisions on routine employee discipline matters 
without approval from the county administrative officer, personnel director and 
county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The management review, conducted by Deputy Social Services Agency Director 
Robert A. Griffith, found a "definite leadership failure" in the office "with 
the recorder allowing himself to become isolated and unresponsive to many 
serious situations requiring management attention." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a doubt, the management problems in the recorder's office are the 
most severe I have observed in almost 25 years as a manager in Orange County," 
Griffith wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was launched in late October, when a female employee 
complained that Branch made lewd comments during an Oct. 22 meeting in his 
office. The inquiry expanded to include allegations of physical abuse against 
both Branch and Smith, as well as the complaints of mismanagement. During the 
Oct. 22 incident, Branch allegedly became "visibly angry" with the female 
employee and began shouting. Later, the report states, Branch used crude 
language and suggested a possible sexual liaison. 
</P>
<P>
 "When questioned about her reaction," the report said, the employee "stated 
that she was shocked and horrified at Mr. Branch's language and his insinuation 
of a possible liaison between them since her relationship with him had been 
strictly business-like up to that point." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said a "preponderance of evidence" supported the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials also said it was "reasonable to believe" that Branch engaged 
in a second incident of sexual harassment involving another female employee 
during a 1985 Christmas party. The employee said Branch "was getting overly 
friendly," brushing up against her when she "became frightened of more sexual 
advances." 
</P>
<P>
 The following week, the employee went to Smith for advice about Branch's 
behavior, not knowing that Branch and Smith had a personal relationship, the 
report stated. Shortly after that meeting, the employee said she was "deluged 
with extra work." The report stated that the employee later resigned and sought 
psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found that separate physical abuse allegations against both 
Branch and Smith were inconclusive.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the strongest employee concerns, however, involved how general office 
operations were affected by Branch's relationship with Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Recorder Ella M. Murphy told investigators that Smith refused to 
acknowledge Murphy's authority and "frequently end-ran" Murphy and went to 
Branch with her concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This all occurred despite the fact that Ms. Murphy is Ms. Smith's 
supervisor," the report stated. "Ms. Murphy also explained that she had not 
given Ms. Smith a performance evaluation in nine years because Mr. Branch would 
not permit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy has since said that she will run against Branch for the recorder's 
post.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith could not be reached Thursday. But she told investigators that Branch 
never showed any favoritism toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith told investigators that she was a victim of sexual harassment involving 
an individual who investigators identified only as "Person No. 2." The report, 
however, provided no details of the incident, stating only that it remained 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith "claimed to be a hard worker and an employee dedicated to the recorder's 
office," the report stated. "She blamed Ms. Murphy for the problems in the 
recorder's office, alleging that Ms. Murphy and Person No. 2 were conspiring 
against Mr. Branch, thereby disrupting smooth operations of the department."

STUCK ON PLAYING SANTA; FIREFIGHTERS RESCUE SANTA ANA BOY, 5, AFTER PLUNGE DOWN 
CHIMNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, Jo Jo, there is a Santa Claus. But no, you can't slide down the chimney 
like he does. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year-old Joseph Hernandez, found that out Thursday morning after he 
jumped down his grandparents' chimney -- and got stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, 35-year-old Helen Hernandez, said she had brought her three 
children from their home down the street to stay at their grandparents' house 
on Sullivan Street so she could do errands. 
</P>
<P>
 But their grandmother was working, their grandfather was out and the door was 
locked. So Hernandez waited in front and told her brood to go through the side 
gate to play in the back yard, which has a swing set and playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 That was fine with Jo Jo's twin, Sandy, and 4-year-old Mike, but not for Jo 
Jo. He wanted to get inside to play Nintendo computer games. Immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 So with his younger brother's help, Jo Jo stacked a lawn chair on a table 
against a wall, climbed onto the roof and jumped down the chimney.  
</P>
<P>
 "He told me later that he thought he could do it if Santa, who's round and 
fat, could do it," said his grandfather, Steve Silbas.  
</P>
<P>
 But Jo Jo became stuck about 10 feet down the chimney, Santa Ana Police Sgt. 
Dick Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, still waiting in front, heard his howl. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't even yelling for help," Hernandez said. "There were no words. He 
was just screaming. I panicked." 
</P>
<P>
 She could not tell where his cries were coming from until Sandy told her. 
Hernandez then climbed onto the roof and looked down the chimney, "but it was 
dark and I couldn't see anything. I was so scared." 
</P>
<P>
 So she ran next door to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 10 a.m., firefighters lowered a rope down and got Jo Jo out in 10 
minutes, said Eric Evans, a spokesman for the Santa Ana Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in good shape except for the soot in his eyes, and some scratches on 
his knees and elbows," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center with minor scratches 
and was back at his grandparents' house in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Jo Jo run outside to show reporters how he had climbed onto the roof, 
his grandmother, Dolores Silbas, said Jo Jo hadn't cried when firefighters 
rescued him.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was just afraid of what had happened. But even in the hospital, he was 
saying he wanted to go home to play Nintendo." 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Jo had managed to fall down the chimney on his grandfather's 61st birthday, 
Steve Silbas pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a present," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Jo said he still believes in Santa Claus but now realizes there's a trick 
to what Santa does. 
</P>
<P>
 "He do magic," Jo Jo said.

TRASH TRUCK DRIVERS STAGE 5-HOUR STRIKE; LABOR: THE WORK STOPPAGE, TO PROTEST 
THE DISMISSAL OF THREE CO-WORKERS AT WASTE MANAGEMENT INC., DELAYS PICKUPS IN 
FIVE SOUTH COUNTY CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 South County trash truck drivers walked off their jobs without 
warning Thursday morning to protest the firing of three co-workers, then just 
as suddenly returned to work five hours later and opened talks with their 
bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 The short-lived wildcat strike delayed garbage pickups in five cities -- 
Irvine, Laguna Hills, Lake Forest, Laguna Beach and Mission Viejo -- as well as 
some unincorporated parts of the county. All are served by Waste Management 
Inc. of Orange County through government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash pickups resumed in late morning, but officials said some homes and 
businesses would have to wait until today to get their trash removed from 
curbs. Government officials and representatives of the trash-hauling giant were 
uncertain how many people were affected by the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers are not organized in a labor union but said they decided to stage 
the protest because many were angry over the firings earlier this week of three 
workers whom management accused of "taking unauthorized breaks on company 
time." The company refused to release the workers' names. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, (the fired workers) were on company time and had their trucks 
stopped for several hours, talking and -- in our opinion -- cheating the 
company and cheating the residents they served," said Michele Blair, a 
spokeswoman for the Santa Ana-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 But several drivers -- who demanded anonymity because of concern about their 
job security -- insisted that the firings were unwarranted and came during a 
time of increasingly burdensome regulations imposed by Waste Management on its 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing began about eight to 10 months ago," said one driver. "We 
got some new administrators, and right away they told us we had to make more 
stops, pick up more trash and, at the same time, keep a clean safety record, 
which meant no accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 "All this for the same salary," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers have also complained that Waste Management has threatened harsher 
discipline for relatively small infractions and has cut back vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
 When a group of senior drivers tried to talk to their managers about such 
issues recently, they were refused an audience, several said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers said Thursday's strike was an unplanned outburst of frustration. A job 
action was discussed during the week, drivers said, but they never agreed on 
any formal plans for a protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the drivers showed up for work Thursday and decided en masse to 
participate in the walkout, they said, adding that there were no protest 
leaders. For the most part, they stayed in the vicinity of the company's Irvine 
yard, demonstrating peacefully, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said that police monitored the informal 
picketing at the Construction Circle site to guard against trouble, but there 
was none. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very quiet out on the site. There's been no violence, and things 
have been very peaceful," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quiet meant difficulties for people hoping to get rid of a week's 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash pickups ordinarily begin before 6 a.m., but company spokeswoman Blair 
said that all of the 100 or so drivers on Thursday's 94 local routes clocked in 
and almost immediately clocked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just decided to walk out," she said. "But just walking out on the job, 
we don't feel that's any way to deal with a situation like this, or not the 
best way." 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management responded by bringing in drivers from its Inland Empire 
plants, although officials acknowledged that they faced significant delays 
because this week's Northridge earthquake had already strained the company's 
staffing and resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hours into the work stoppage, Waste Management officials agreed to sit 
down with representatives for the drivers to discuss their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers in turn agreed to return to work around 11 a.m. Talks were 
expected to continue into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all trying to see if we can work this out," Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cymantha Atkinson, a spokeswoman for the county's Integrated Waste Management 
Department, which contracts with Waste Management to haul trash in some 
unincorporated parts of South County, said the company had asked for extended 
hours today to dump its trash at the county's Frank R. Bowerman Landfill in 
Irvine because of Thursday's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county wants to wait to see if extended hours are necessary, Atkinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said Waste Management was hoping to cover half its regular routes on 
Thursday, coming back for the rest today or over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 She could not say how many homes and businesses might have to leave their 
garbage on the curb for an extra day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even give you a rough estimate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste Management, which employs 67,000 people nationwide and describes itself 
as the largest environmental services company in the world, has contracts 
through its local offices to provide trash hauling for seven Orange County 
municipalities and parts of the county itself.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: LA PALMA; ORDINANCE PASSED TO RESTRICT GARAGE 
SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of complaints about residents conducting an excessive number of garage 
sales, the City Council unanimously approved an ordinance this week limiting 
residents to two such sales a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which passed the measure in a 5-0 vote Tuesday night, also hopes 
the restrictions will help clear neighborhoods of the homemade signs 
advertising the sales.The ordinance prohibits posting signs on public property 
such as utility poles, street signs, walls and trees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to frequency and sign restrictions, the ordinance requires 
residents to register with the city's Building Department or Business License 
Division before a sale. Also, the sales can only be held from 7 a.m. to sunset. 
Contrary to previous proposals, residents will not be charged a fee for holding 
a sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns were raised by council members about proper enforcement of the 
ordinance. But city employees said that neighbors and police volunteers should 
be able to notify authorities of infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this is enough to deter people from having more than two garage 
sales," said Councilman David Lim. "I hope we don't have to take steps to 
impose heavier penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Violators of the ordinance could be charged with a misdemeanor and could face 
six months in jail, fines or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday night, the council approved allocating $762 for supplies to 
help start a Meals on Wheels program. The program, which has been absent from 
the city for 16 years, delivers meals to shut-in, elderly and convalescing 
residents.MARTIN MILLER

 Thursday morning brought not only fog and mist but also a shipment of about 
10,000 pounds of baby diapers, canned tomatoes, bottled water, boxed orange 
juice and cereal for Los Angeles-area earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Those and other needed items landed at the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Los 
Alamitos, courtesy of a donation from the Good Shepherd Center, a 
Sacramento-based organization offering relief to earthquake victims in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The relief mission -- one of many taking place this week to assist Los Angeles 
earthquake victims -- got underway about 8 a.m. when a C-130 Coast Guard 
airplane carrying two pallets of supplies departed from Sacramento, touching 
down at the reserve center on schedule at 9:10 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, a giant forklift pulled up to the plane to pull out the first 
pallet, which contained box upon box of mostly non-perishables such as baby 
formula and dehydrated potatoes. The second pallet was loaded with 5,000 more 
pounds of boxes containing similar items. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Petty Officer William Atkinson, who was overseeing the shipment, 
the food and supplies are expected to be distributed by the American Red Cross 
to those hit hardest by the earthquake, but Red Cross officials said Thursday 
afternoon that they were unaware of the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's disaster-relief flight was one of many the Coast Guard has 
conducted this week. The Federal Emergency Management Agency asked the Coast 
Guard for 24 hours of flight time to aid victims of Monday morning's 
earthquake, which hit the San Fernando Valley hardest. In addition to 
Thursday's shipment of food, Coast Guard planes transported the Urban Search 
and Rescue Task Force to Los Angeles to help find those missing in the 
earthquake, said Michael Douglass, assistant chief at the governor's Office of 
Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the plane shipment of food was emptied Thursday, it was reloaded with 
almost $1 million of the task force's search equipment and then headed back to 
Sacramento, Douglass said. The task force has completed its search, which 
focused on the Northridge Meadows apartment building, where at least 14 people 
died, Douglass said. ELAINE TASSY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH: DANA POINT; BOARD OKS SANITARY, 
WATER DISTRICT UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The directors of a small, 46-year-old water district in Capistrano Beach this 
week voted unanimously to merge with a neighboring sanitary district, setting 
the stage for the first of several special district consolidations expected 
this year in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member board of the Capistrano Beach County Water District Wednesday 
voted to merge with the 66-year-old Capistrano Beach Sanitary District, a move 
that had been resisted for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Now is finally the time to act, water district officials said. The water 
district vote to consolidate comes while a county commission is studying the 
possibility of merging all six water-related districts in the city into one 
"super" district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the single-district scenario would be a mess," said director Jim 
Hayton, a carwash owner in Dana Point. "This allows us to protect our assets, 
which our customers have paid for all these years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Beach County Water District, which serves about 6,000 customers 
in Dana Point Harbor, north San Clemente, Dana Point and Capistrano Beach, owns 
several properties including the district office on Victoria Boulevard, the 
neighboring county fire station, two reservoirs and about 12 inactive well 
sites in San Juan Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district also has about $3 million in the bank, according to 
district records. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2-year-old study of a possible merger of the two districts done by Boyle 
Engineering Corp. of Newport Beach estimates that there would be a savings of 
between $150,000 to $250,000 annually because of such things as combining 
personnel and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The five directors of the sanitary district have agreed to the merger in 
concept although they have not taken a formal action, said Jim Forrester, the 
board president and a county firefighter. He said his board has attempted to 
merge with the water district for several years but have been rebuffed by the 
water board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our board has always been interested in this," said Forrester, 35, a 
nine-year board member. He suggested the new members elected to the water board 
in 1992 were more "positive" toward consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Forrester said the sanitary district directors had also approached the Dana 
Point Sanitary District board and suggested they join in the merger but "it 
seems they would rather wait a little longer" than accept consolidation at this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitary district serves about 3,500 customers, nearly all within the 
boundaries of the water district in the Capistrano Beach and north San Clemente 
area. The sanitary district has "slightly less than $1 million" in savings and 
owns a treatment plant and 30 acres of undeveloped land along the creek that 
could be used by both districts, Forrester said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two districts can merge by vote of the directors but the action must still 
be approved by the county's Local Agency Formation Commission. LEN HALL

 Students at Ladera Vista Junior High School are in the midst of a drive to 
raise $1,000 to help victims of the recent earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Andi Goettinger said students took coffee cans around the school 
Wednesday to collect money from teachers and other students. About $300 has 
been raised so far and the drive will continue through today, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goettinger said students also raised about $1,000 after the Loma Prieta 
earthquake for victims in Northern California. All the money will go to the 
American Red Cross, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students have been eager to raise money, Goettinger said. "As long as those 
aftershocks keep shaking, people are real interested." WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BUSINESS OWNER IS SHOT BY 
INTRUDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 54-year-old owner of a contracting business was shot twice by an intruder 
shortly after he arrived at work Thursday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Dwight Ferguson of Huntington Beach, was taken to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where he was in fair condition late Thursday, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place just before 8 a.m. inside Southern California 
Construction, in the 15000 block of Computer Lane, said Police Lt. Charles Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Ferguson) showed up for work, he walked towards the back of the 
business, and someone came out of the dark and shot him twice," Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman fled, and Ferguson staggered across the street to get help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked out the window and I saw him in the street, so I tapped on the 
window and told him to come inside," said Don Gascoigne, who called paramedics. 
"He looked terrible, like he was going to collapse. I asked him if he needed 
anything, and he asked for a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Gascoigne said that Ferguson, who was shot once in the chest and once in the 
side, was able to provide some details of the shooting to police over the 
speaker phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said someone was in there waiting for him," Gascoigne said. "He didn't 
know who the guy was or why he was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were unable to determine a motive for the attack because they 
had not yet been able to interview the victim in depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be anything," Poe said. The gunman "could be a random robber or 
someone who was there to kill the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's company was open for business several hours after the shooting. An 
employee who declined to be identified said it appeared that Ferguson may have 
walked in on a burglary in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman was described as a Latino, 25 to 28 years old, 5 feet, 5 inches 
tall, about 140 pounds, with collar-length black hair. He was wearing dark 
pants, a red jacket, yellow socks and brown shoes, police said. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; DANCE TEAM TO HOLD FUND-RAISER 
TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They love to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 But to keep on dancing, members of Fountain Valley High School's dance team 
have to hold fund-raisers to maintain the program on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the performing arts troupe, students and parents raised between $8,000 
and $10,000 a year, said Gary Wampler,director of bands, who also oversees the 
dance program. The program had been cut six years ago because of budget 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just feel dance is important," Wampler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Gary Ernst also said the dance program is part of the school's 
efforts to meet the diversity of the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some, dance is very important," Ernst said. "It's a positive way of 
expression for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Carwashes, garage sales and candy sales are held to pay for costumes, expenses 
and a dance specialist to teach the class. 
</P>
<P>
 As a way to raise money and also show off their talents, the performing group 
of 21 students is putting on a dance concert tonight at Huntington Beach High 
School Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8 p.m. event will also feature dancers from the School for the Performing 
Arts at Huntington Beach High, co-host of the event, as well as students from 
Brea Olinda, Corona del Mar and University high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Sheila Michels,whose daughter, Tricia, 15, is on the team, said she is 
willing to help support the program if that's what it takes to keep it at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being on the dance team gives each of the girls not only the opportunity to 
feel good about themselves, but also develop the qualities of sportsmanship, 
mutual support and friendship," Michelssaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Larisa Waterman,the team's dance director, said that the program is a 
beneficial part of their education, in which students receive performing arts 
or physical education credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterman, a 1987 graduate of Ocean View High and a UCI student, added that the 
dancers learn discipline, teamwork, organizational skills, self-confidence, 
and, most all, they learn to perfect the art form. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterman said dance programs are just as important as sports and music in the 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learn so much," she said. "And they have something else to do. It keeps 
them off the streets and out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who attend the six high schools in Huntington Beach Union High School 
District also have the option of attending the School for the Performing Arts, 
a program for dancing, acting and singing. 
</P>
<P>
 But students at Fountain Valley High prefer to keep their own dance team, in 
which they perform concerts at school and in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also put in long hours at rehearsals. Yet, they said, being involved 
is worth the hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you feel proud of yourself," said freshman Brooke Hayward,14. "And 
it's fun and a good experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Stephen Rush,15, and the only male on the team, agreed: "It feels 
great to get out there and dance." 
</P>
<P>
 The dancers also choreograph the dances and use contemporary expressive dance 
forms as well as tap, ballet and jazz. "It's a place where everybody can bring 
their own style and express themselves in their own way," said Tricia Michels. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for tonight's performance are $3 before the event and $5 at the door. 
Tickets are available by calling Fountain Valley High at (714) 962-3301. 
Huntington Beach High School is at 1905 Main St. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: CITY ATTY. DENIES HE DROVE WHILE DRUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Point City Atty. Jerry Patterson, arrested on Dec. 15 in Newport Beach on 
suspicion of drunk driving, on Thursday denied he was driving while 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be arraigned on Jan. 31 on two counts of driving under the influence, 
according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Lance Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, 59, a former congressman, was arrested in the pre-dawn hours as he 
was driving westbound on Coast Highway in Newport Beach. According to a report 
by arresting officer J. R. Rocker, Patterson was driving his 1991 Volkswagen 
van at about 85 miles per hour in a 50-mile speed zone and failed to stop at a 
red light. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocker said Patterson emerged from his vehicle after being stopped, at which 
time "I observed that (Patterson's) balance was poor and he seemed unsteady on 
his feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The officer's report said he detected "a moderate odor of an alcoholic 
beverage" on Patterson, who also "displayed symptoms of intoxication." The 
report said Patterson failed a field sobriety test. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson told the officer, according to the report, that he had three glasses 
of wine and hadn't eaten since 8 a.m. the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they administered a breath test at the police station that showed 
Patterson's blood alcohol was 0.08, which is considered drunk under California 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson said Thursday a blood test given to him 50 minutes after the breath 
test determined his blood alcohol content to be 0.07, which is legally 
permissible for California motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support sobriety laws and they should be enforced, but in my case, I wasn't 
driving" drunk, Patterson said. He also said he did not go through a red light, 
but rather "I went through a changing light." 
</P>
<P>
 He said police never performed a breath test on him and that the reason he 
appeared wobbly to Rocker is because he wears an artificial leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only objective report was the blood test. That's the end of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson has been a controversial figure in county politics. A Democrat, 
Patterson represented much of the district in the U.S. Congress before being 
defeated in 1984 by Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he and former State Democratic Party Chairman Richard O'Neill paid 
$10,000 each to settle civil charges of having failed to disclose the source of 
nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 And in November, 1992, Patterson, who works for the law firm of Burke, 
Williams and Sorensen, was fired as city manager in Cypress because of 
perceived bad legal advice he gave to council members and other problems of a 
political nature. That same year, at his request, he was replaced as city 
manager of Lake Forest.FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CHURCH TO REAPPLY FOR 
RELOCATION PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to satisfy unhappy residents in their prospective neighborhood, 
First Chinese Baptist Church officials have agreed to relinquish an existing 
permit and reapply to the city for permission to move their church from 
Westminster to a former private school on Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came last week in the wake of a lawsuit filed last year against 
the church and Fountain Valley by resident Alex Gilbert, who challenged the 
environmental review process of the project by Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Alan R. Burns conceded last week that there were "some technical 
errors made in doing the last environmental review in terms of noticing and 
filings that were done." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the mistakes in the process by city planning staff, church officials 
agreed to withdraw their conditional-use permit application. The City Council 
last September voted to allow the church to move to the Brookhurst Street site, 
which is next to homes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the church's decision to relinquish the existing 
conditional-use permit, a Superior Court judge last week dismissed Gilbert's 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 First Chinese Baptist Church Pastor Murphy Lum said the church is willing to 
go through the city approval process again to ensure that the project meets 
legal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still would like to move to Fountain Valley, and, of course, we want to be 
legal and do everything step by step. That's our intention," he said, adding 
that the suit has delayed the church's planned moved, which is needed because 
existing church facilities are at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 A new conditional-use permit hearing will be held, and a new environmental 
review is underway, Burns said. No date has been set for the new hearing, which 
will be before the Planning Commission. The new environmental review is 
expected to be available for public comment in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert filed the lawsuit last October, a month after the two-hour public 
hearing on the project, where neighbors complained about the potential for 
traffic and parking problems from the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert filed the lawsuit because he said the city violated citizens' rights 
regarding the environmental review process. He also claimed that the city 
refused to give him public documents during the environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident since 1969, Gilbert said he's not opposed to the church moving to 
the neighborhood, but rather, "I'm opposed to not having open government." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the lawsuit, Gilbert said, he hopes the city will follow the 
legal requirements that allow residents to review environmental studies on 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 With the project under new environmental review, Gilbert said, "I think things 
will be corrected; then it'll be a fair process."DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / CENTRAL: SANTA ANA; TAX FOR POLICE STATION AND JAIL STIRS 
DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents will see higher taxes on their utility bills if Santa Ana goes ahead 
with its plan to build a police headquarters and a large jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed utility users tax increase, expected to be 1%, has been the 
target of a bitter debate in recent months.About 30 people attended this week's 
City Council meeting to protest the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will have another chance to tell the City Council how they feel 
about the increase at a public hearing at 6 p.m. Feb. 22 at Santa Ana council 
chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the tax hike is necessary to support a bond that will pay 
for the jail and police facility, which will cost $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they must build the jail because the county jail is too crowded and 
criminals are quickly freed after they are arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The 390,000-square-foot building is proposed for a site on Shelton Street 
between Civic Center Drive and 6th Street, near the Santa Ana Municipal 
Stadium. It would augment the 48-cell Santa Ana Detention Facility, and would 
have 256 cells that would house up to 420 male and female inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have spoken against the utility users tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does the city talk jail, while what they really want is a shiny, new, 
large, well-equipped police headquarters?" asked Judy Buffin-Edge, a Santa Ana 
resident. Buffin-Edge, one of the leaders of a campaign against the proposed 
tax, insists the city should allow residents to vote on the issue. ALICIA DI

 Jane Kim wants to become an athletic trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old made her career choice Thursday at a conference held at Cal 
State Fullerton to introduce teen-agers to math- and science-related 
professions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always see guys in the physical education training field, but now I see 
we're equal and I can do it too," said Jane, a student at D. Russell Parks 
Junior High School in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 She was among 905 junior high and high school students -- more than 95% girls 
-- from throughout North County at the 10th annual Math-Science Conference, 
sponsored by the American Assn. of University Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said it was geared toward encouraging girls to study math and 
science so they can pursue careers in such professions as medicine, seismology 
and space shuttle engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are occupations that these students, girls particularly, don't know 
about, and we want them to realize that they are there and (the students) can 
get into them," said Wilma Sauer, president of the Brea/La Habra branch of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-nine women specialists in aeronautics, petroleum engineering, 
pharmacology, transportation, zoology, chemistry, occupational therapy, 
forensic science, marine biology and dozens of other scientific, high-tech and 
mathematics-related fields presented workshops at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody did it for me when I was a teen-ager," said Diane Clemens-Knott, an 
assistant geology professor at Cal State Fullerton who specializes in isotope 
geochemistry. "It's important to give these students role models to encourage 
them to take courses in math because there are so many careers that depend upon 
math for training." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sharon K. Kawai, director of medical rehabilitation administration at St. 
Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, delivered the keynote speech, which inspired 
Jeanne Miserendino, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh-grader at St. Juliana Falconieri School in Fullerton said she 
dreams of becoming a marine biologist and knows now that her dream can be made 
a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawai "let me know that nothing's impossible," Jeanne said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE: WORK ON 2 FREEWAYS WILL REQUIRE DETOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning today, scheduled construction work on the Costa Mesa and Artesia 
freeways are requiring some detours, highway officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The northbound Costa Mesa Freeway from Edinger Avenue to the Santa Ana Freeway 
interchange will be closed from midnight today to 6 a.m. Saturday, according to 
Pam Gorniak of Caltrans.Detour signs will direct drivers to alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The northbound connector of the Costa Mesa Freeway to the southbound Santa Ana 
Freeway will close from 2 to 5 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 The private company building express toll lanes on the Artesia Freeway has 
closed the Santiago Boulevard on-ramp to the northbound Costa Mesa until 
further notice. To implement the ramp closure, it was necessary to close the 
northbound connector to the westbound Artesia until 5 a.m. today, according to 
spokesman Frank Wilson.

UCI STUDENTS PROTEST PROPOSED $620 FEE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN BALLOU and RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small group of UC Irvine students held a two-hour protest Thursday that 
culminated with a request that the University of California regents postpone 
today's scheduled vote in San Francisco on a 16.6% fee increase. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to drum up student support on campus, the Committee for a 
Responsible University, which is composed of three undergraduate students, 
marched with about 50 supporters through the student union and made an 
unsuccessful recruitment trip through a political science class in session. The 
students then made their way to the office of Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are absolutely fed up with these constant fee increases," said Domenico 
Pagone, a leader of the student group and a senior engineering student. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I'm graduating this year, I know of at least 10 friends who won't 
be able to go to school next year if this latest hike goes through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration came as a committee of the Board of Regents, meeting in San 
Francisco, voted to increase undergraduate fees for the 1994-95 academic year 
by $620 and approved a new policy that allows administrators at the nine-campus 
system to start using the money for instruction, including faculty salaries. 
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education called for student fees to be used 
strictly for support services, such as libraries, but not for instruction, 
which was considered the responsibility of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also agreed to institute a new $2,000 "differential" charge for 
graduate students enrolled in the professional schools of medicine, veterinary 
medicine, dentistry, law and business. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee increases are scheduled for consideration today by the full Board of 
Regents, which typically goes along with committee recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 As UCI students chanted "no more fee hikes," in Wilkening's crowded office 
lobby, Pagone gave Wilkening's secretary a list of four demands to forward to 
UC President Jack W. Peltason. Both officials were attending the Regents 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The group demanded that students be heard before a final vote is taken. It 
also demanded the resignation of Peltason if its demand for a reconsideration 
of the fee increase is not met. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagone and fellow group members Martin Rizzo and Eric Merkt said they were 
hoping to voice their opposition to the fee increase in person at the regents 
meeting, originally scheduled to be held at UCLA. But the meeting was moved to 
UC San Francisco because of Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Misch, a junior studying sociology, said she decided to join the protest 
Wednesday on her way to class when she saw Pagone asking for student support in 
front of the Administration Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Misch said she can barely handle this year's fees, and may have to drop out of 
school if the latest hikes are approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Student fees at UCI have risen sharply since 1990-91, when the annual cost of 
attending the university was $1,820 for an undergraduate resident student. This 
year, students are paying $3,727. The newest proposal would set fees at $4,347 
for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2,000 differential charge for professional school students would be added 
to the undergraduate amount. 
</P>
<P>
 UC spokesman Michael Alva said the system would net about $60 million from the 
proposed increases -- money that would come on top of a $58-million increase 
that Gov. Pete Wilson has proposed in his 1994-1995 state budget. But that 
still is about $100 million short of what administrators say is needed to 
stabilize the university. Rising University Fees 
</P>
<P>
 A fee increase for the 1994-95 school year, approved by a committee of the 
University of California regents Thursday, would bring fee increases in the 
university system to 180% over six years. The $620 fee hike is scheduled for 
consideration by the full Board of Regents today. How fees have changed for 
resident students: 03,09,08,12 Percentage Year Fee increase 1988-89 $1,554 4.2% 
1989-90 1,634 5.1 1990-91 1,820 11.4 1991-92 2,486 36.6 1992-93 3,044 22.4 
1993-94 3,727 22.4 1994-95 4,347 16.6 Note: Total includes average 
miscellaneous fees, assessed by student vote and varying by campus.

TRUCK FIRE JAMS SAN DIEGO FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire on the back of a one-ton flatbed truck carrying empty propane tanks 
caused a large rush-hour traffic jam Thursday that radiated in three directions 
from the southbound San Diego Freeway at Seal Beach Boulevard, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vapors from the four-foot-wide, four-foot-long tanks caught fire about 4:30 
p.m., according to the Orange County Fire Department. Firefighters extinguished 
the fire, which started in the truck cab. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, but the fire briefly closed all lanes of the San Diego 
Freeway in each direction. At one point, a California Highway Patrol dispatcher 
said, southbound traffic on the freeway was backed up to the Long Beach 
Airport.

HEARTWARMING GESTURE TO OPEN RED CROSS TISSUE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kaitlin Symsek, who was born missing a heart valve and couldn't walk or crawl 
until she received a valve transplant, will cut the ribbon today at the grand 
opening of the American Red Cross Western Regional Tissue Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very, very lucky that at the time she needed (a heart valve) one was 
even available," said Kaitlin's mother, Debby Symsek. 
</P>
<P>
 Symsek said she is grateful to the Red Cross for its tissue program, which 
gave her 5-year-old daughter the valve, and she wants to communicate the 
importance of donating hearts and other organs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross center, which this week completed a move from downtown Los 
Angeles to 3535 Hyland Ave. in Costa Mesa, is the only place in the nation 
where the Red Cross prepares donated heart valves for transplant into cardiac 
patients. Six other heart valve processing centers in the United States are run 
by private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a severe shortage of child-size valves, said Cheryl McMahon, a Red 
Cross director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have about a 20th of the pediatric valves that we need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 K. David Campagnari, a Red Cross regional director, said the Costa Mesa 
facility "will be the premier tissue banking center for the entire Red Cross 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 Its sophisticated equipment, Red Cross officials said, protects the valves 
from bacterial contamination when they are being treated before they are sent 
by couriers to surgeons throughout the country. The center, staffed 24 hours a 
day to process hearts sent from coroners' offices and hospitals within a day of 
the donor's death, supplies about 600 heart valves a year, Campagnari said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will also prepare veins for use in coronary bypass surgery, collect 
and distribute skin for burn victims and bones for limb repair and spinal 
surgery. It also will operate a national bone marrow donor registry, Campagnari 
said.

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS SMALL-TIME, NOT SMALL-MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In itself, revenue sharing for major league baseball is a fine idea, lined 
with good intentions. It is baseball's welfare program, designed to help those 
who cannot help themselves, but as with America's welfare program, there are 
those who would abuse it by simply trolling for a handout. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to name names or anything, but when George Steinbrenner wondered aloud how 
the Angels of Orange County could be classified a "small-market team," I had to 
nod in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a first-time life experience for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "My geography teacher must not have taught me very well," George says, and the 
almanacs, encyclopedias and baseball media guides must all be screwed up as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels play in a county with a population base of 2.3 million, the 
sixth-largest in the United States, with one of the 10 highest per-capita 
incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Their games are carried on the same television station, KTLA, as the 
"big-market" Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 They have drawn at least 2 million in home attendance for 12 consecutive 
seasons, surpassing 2.5 million seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's total attendance -- 2,057,460 -- was the Angels' lowest in a 
non-strike season since 1978, yet it still ranked the Angels 18th out of 28 
teams overall, pretty much in the middle of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Jackie Autry has cried poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Her team receives the seventh-smallest revenue in baseball, she claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, whose fault is that? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a difference between a small market and a mismanaged market. How does 
a major-league baseball team go starving in Orange County, Land of 10,000 
Batting Cages, where every male infant (and a good many female) is assigned a 
bat and a glove at birth, right after being swatted on the rear? 
</P>
<P>
 By running the best and most popular players out of town, year after year 
after year? 
</P>
<P>
 By throwing away $3 million in 1994 on an over-the-hill third baseman who was 
released in 1993? 
</P>
<P>
 By finishing under .500 six times in the last seven years? 
</P>
<P>
 By losing 181 games the last two seasons? 
</P>
<P>
 By systematically turning your single greatest resource -- the ready and 
willing disposable income -- into a rabid supporter of ice hockey? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels were an OPEC nation, they'd be petitioning the U.N. for 
humanitarian aid. If they were Columbia Records, they'd have trashed their 
compact-disc division in order to bring back the eight-track tape. If they were 
CBS, they'd have lost professional football to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why the "big market" teams held out so long before relenting this week 
on the issue of revenue-sharing. Why should we have to pay for your 
boneheadedness, they asked the Angels and the Padres. Revenue-sharing ought to 
help the truly disadvantaged -- the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Milwaukee Brewers, 
the Minnesota Twins. But fritter away a gold mine? Don't come begging to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, baseball's ownership finally gave in, because it believes it needs 
revenue-sharing as a lure to get the players union to bite on a salary cap. 
(Good luck on that.) As a result, eight "big-market" teams will annually assist 
in the bailing out of the neediest eight, which is expected to change every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, those lucky recipients, who stand to divide $55 million or so, would 
include Milwaukee, Minnesota, Montreal, Pittsburgh, San Diego, Seattle and the 
Angels. I know what you're thinking: Where was this plan when Bryan Harvey was 
around? 
</P>
<P>
 In a related move, three-division realignment for 1994 has been made official, 
again to the Angels' good fortune. Just like that, the Angels moved up from 
sixth place to fourth. And look at the division they're in -- two teams, 
Seattle and Texas, have never made the playoffs and the third, Oakland, is 
coming off a 68-94 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, these four teams combined to play .474 baseball. Texas would have 
won the division with 86 victories -- and the Rangers have since lost Nolan 
Ryan, Rafael Palmeiro and Julio Franco. Seattle would have placed second at 
82-80 -- and the Mariners have no bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what the Angels might do in this division with revenue-sharing 
coupons. An additional $7 million would bring their payroll up to $26 million, 
about half of Toronto's, which means they could afford to pay Harvey and Jim 
Abbott, which means they wouldn't have to take out classified ads to fill out 
their pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners and losers this week in Ft. Lauderdale included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dodgers, who get rid of Atlanta in the NL West, but now will be 
required to help pay the bills for division rival San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Philadelphia, which now gets to bang heads with Atlanta in the NL East, 
some reward for winning the pennant in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Houston, which finished 19 games behind Atlanta in last year's NL West, but 
would have placed a close second, two games behind St. Louis, in the new NL 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The White Sox, whose primary competition in the AL Central this season 
figures to come from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, however, gained more than the Angels. Now they get to play in a 
diluted division, easily the weakest in baseball, while being subsidized by the 
Yankees, Dodgers and Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels can't contend under these conditions, they ought to move the 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Pacific Coast League.

MATADOR COACH TRIES TO CONTACT ATHLETES; EARTHQUAKE AFTERMATH: STRAMETZ CAN'T 
FIND THREE MEMBERS OF TRACK AND FIELD SQUAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Don Strametz has heard about the yellow tape and he wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the Cal State Northridge track and field program is confident 
everyone is safe yet he is troubled by a gnawing sense of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Ishio, Amy Myers and Mike McClintock, members of the school's men's 
and women's track teams, remained unaccounted for Thursday in the wake of 
Monday morning's devastating 6.6 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Strametz has "cauliflower ear" from placing dozens of calls to their homes. No 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows the apartment complexes where they once lived are now draped in 
yellow, condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids," Strametz calls them. He wishes they would call, if only to leave a 
message on his office answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been very difficult," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's track and field opener is Jan. 29, a quadrangular meet against UC 
Irvine, Southern Utah and Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Ariz. That event is 
buried on Strametz's list of priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the Northridge men's and women's teams comprise approximately 60 
athletes. Strametz said Thursday about 20 have no permanent place to live and 
an additional 25 who live in student dormitories do not know whether their 
living quarters are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to find these kids a place to stay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Thursday in the bleachers of the school's softball field, other 
Northridge coaches expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Cassidy, Northridge's basketball coach, and his team were scheduled to 
play at California Saturday night, but the game was postponed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday morning, John Kasser, Cal's athletic director, called Northridge 
officials asking that the game be moved to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hiegert, Northridge's athletic director, conferred with Cassidy, then 
declined, adding that he hopes the game could be rescheduled later in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get my schedule and my notes and talk to him myself," Cassidy 
said, "but they happen to be in the drawer in my office, which I can't get to 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday afternoon, a Cal spokesman said the school considers the game 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's basketball players won't meet again until Monday. Cassidy said 
they "need to get their lives bolted back together." 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of 13 basketball players have been displaced from their homes. A 
trip might provide short-term relief but greater difficulty in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their problems are still going to be here when they get back, only worse, 
because some of the places (to live) they might have found will be gone," 
Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jen Fleming, a senior outfielder on the Northridge softball team, has 10 
teammates staying at her family's home in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people know how many people from out of the area come here as 
athletes," softball Coach Gary Torgeson said. "My biggest problem is not 
preparing for the season. It's finding housing for the kids so they can get 
their lives together." 
</P>
<P>
 John Price, Northridge's volleyball coach, said several members of his team 
have found homes to lease but cannot afford the required first and last month's 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now our (scholarship) checks are in the mail," said basketball player 
Andre Chevalier. "I'm as broke as the day is long." 
</P>
<P>
 Many athletes whose apartments were damaged would prefer to find single-story 
houses to rent. "People don't trust apartments no matter how new or old," said 
distance runner Rich Gitahi. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses seem to be in short supply, however. "A friend of mine went to a 
Northridge home this morning and there already were eight other people there," 
Gitahi said, "and she left at 7:30." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Trice, tailback on the Matador football team, is staying with friends 
while waiting for state officials to inspect his dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can move back in," said Trice, a senior who is finishing work on 
his degree, "but if they tell us we can't, there go all my plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Gitahi, a member of the Northridge Athletes Congress, urged the coaches to 
advise displaced athletes to apply for disaster relief at Federal Emergency 
Management Agency locations at Granada Hills High, Balboa Park and the Winnetka 
Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge suspended play by its athletic teams through Sunday, and Hiegert 
told the coaches that practices before Monday, when the campus is scheduled to 
reopen will be considered voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches also were instructed to keep records of any aid to athletes they 
personally provide, such as paying for meals or arranging shelter, acts that 
normally would violate NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing "a common sense provision," Hiegert said Northridge will file a report. 
He does not expect the NCAA to take disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 While helping to place their athletes in homes, many coaches also are faced 
with finding alternative practice facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's volleyball team will practice at Occidental College today and Hoover 
High on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy has not secured a gym for the basketball team. "We'll get back into 
the basketball world when we get more important things settled," he said.

TUSTIN'S GOTTLIEB DEVELOPS HIS SKILLS UNDER A SPECIAL TUTOR; BASKETBALL: JUNIOR 
POINT GUARD, SON OF A FORMER COLLEGE COACH, AVERAGES 18 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basketball is more than an after-school activity for Doug Gottlieb . . . it's 
a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin High junior point guard often can be found on a basketball court 
or, at least, with a ball in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love playing basketball," said Gottlieb, who just turned 18. "It's my 
passion. For some people it's a book, watching television or playing video 
games. Basketball is my escape from everything." 
</P>
<P>
 But, with his brother playing basketball at a Division I school, and his 
father a former Division I coach, basketball is more than a pastime for 
everybody in the Gottlieb household. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Gottlieb, 21, was twice an All-Century League selection while at El 
Modena. He attended UCLA for three years but didn't play basketball until this 
season, after he had transferred to Drake, where he made the team as a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Gottlieb, who has been an assistant coach at Oregon, Creighton and Long 
Beach State and a head coach at Jacksonville and Wisconsin Milwaukee, has 
overseen the development of both sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug has matured much earlier than Gregg," said Bob Gottlieb, who owns a 
design firm specializing in hospital and health-care facilities. "Gregg has 
enjoyed playing basketball, whereas Doug has always been driven to play and get 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Gottlieb's initial organized basketball experience came in first grade. 
But his indoctrination began even earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad would always take me to the park and throw me into pick-up games 
against old men," Gottlieb said. "You learned the game real quick that way, or 
else you didn't get to play anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing time is no longer a concern for Gottlieb, who leads the visiting 
Tillers (12-6, 5-1 in league) against the Sea View League's top team, Santa 
Margarita (14-4, 6-0), tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has real solid point-guard abilities," Tustin Coach Andy Ground said. "He 
can pass, especially in the open court, and in the last year he has improved 
his shot and he's gotten a lot more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 A point guard from the time he he began dribbling a ball, Gottlieb attributes 
much of his success to experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to spending the last three seasons at Tustin, Gottlieb has 
participated in summer leagues, including the Amateur Athletic Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of the confidence he's gotten has come from playing in the 
summer leagues," Ground said. "He's played really well against some really good 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb has played with, and against, some of the most sought-after high 
school players in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he has played in front of some of the country's top college 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played in a game this summer where I turned around and saw Mike Krzyzewski, 
Dean Smith, John Thompson and Jim Boeheim," Gottlieb said. "If you play well 
there, you can pick between a whole list of schools." 
</P>
<P>
 At the forefront of Gottlieb's development once again has been his father, who 
has coached his son's summer-league teams. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bob Gottlieb said he hasn't put burdensome expectations on Doug, and 
that he has pushed him only because that's what his son wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug's accomplishments are the result of his ability and the fact he loves 
the game so much," Bob Gottlieb said. "It would be a mistake to say that he's 
where he is because of me. He's where he is because he's put in the work." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to taking 1,000 shots a day, running regularly, lifting weights 
and practicing several times a day, every day, Gottlieb has enlisted a personal 
trainer, Eric Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, who also worked with Duke's Cherokee Parks while Parks was at Marina, 
has been helping Gottlieb for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Moreno) has been great," Gottlieb said. "He's worked with me on my weight 
training, and I think it's the weight training and the work I do by myself that 
is the difference between myself and other players." 
</P>
<P>
 This season Gottlieb said he hasn't been pleased with his play. Despite 
averaging 18 points and more than seven assists, Gottlieb said his game has 
been erratic; however, opposing coaches praise his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such an intelligent player," Santa Margarita Coach Jerry DeBusk said. 
"He really adds an extra dimension to that team because he's such a good passer 
and so heady." 
</P>
<P>
 This season is just a small part of Gottlieb's master plan. He has one more 
year with the Tillers, but said he's concentrating on peaking for the upcoming 
summer league, when he hopes colleges will look at him more closely and begin 
talking scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still need to improve a lot before that time," Gottlieb said. "I'm a good 
passer right now, but I need to work on my shooting and on becoming a good 
all-around scorer." 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb has colleges such as Syracuse, Florida, UCLA, Washington, Stanford, 
Georgia Tech and Iowa in mind. Despite the fact they've all contacted him, he 
realizes it's still early. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb is considered by many experts to be one of the state's top point 
guards. However, his height (6-0), average speed and inconsistent shot have 
some of the same experts questioning where he'll end up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real good talent," scout Don Mead said. "He's a very smart player and 
a great passer. I think he can play Division I basketball, I'm just not sure 
where he fits in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Gottlieb said he understands the work he has put in thus far is 
just the start of what's to come, and that's why it has to be his way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize I work really hard," he said. "Basketball doesn't come 
easy to me. I've had to work very hard at shooting baskets, lifting weights and 
in school, too. But that is what is going to get me to the next level."

VALLEY DIGEST: HART QUARTERBACK KOCICKA COMMITS ORALLY TO UNLV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Mike Kocicka of Hart High, The Times' Valley back of the year, has 
made an oral commitment to attend Nevada Las Vegas, the second area quarterback 
to commit to the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Kocicka, who passed for 2,966 yards and 32 touchdowns as a first-year starting 
quarterback last season, said he was unaware that quarterback Kevin Crook of 
Westlake also has committed to the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The winter signing period starts Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Kocicka, 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, said he liked the Rebels because of their 
run-and-shoot offense and an opportunity to play right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offense is basically like Hart's (except) with a tight end," Kocicka 
said. "The offense will let me throw about 50 times a game and give me a chance 
to give me the exposure to possibly play in the NFL. I'm going to be to 
competing for the job as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kocicka chose UNLV over Oregon, San Diego State, Colorado State and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs tackle Mike Reily, a 6-3, 285-pound All-Valley selection, also has 
chosen UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be sort of weird blocking for somebody (Kocicka) I tried to kill a 
couple months ago," he said. "That'll be fun. That'll be exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame received an oral commitment from Hart linebacker John McLaughlin, 
winning a recruiting battle with Florida State, Colorado, UCLA and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ultimately came down to Notre Dame and Arizona," said McLaughlin, 6-4 and 
220. "When I got (to South Bend), I liked the essence of the place." High 
School Football 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Cuccia, who coached Poly High to a City Section 3-A Division championship 
in 1990, has accepted the head coaching position at Monroe, pending approval 
from Poly Principal Carolyn Burch. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuccia, 48, had a 30-24 record in five seasons at Poly, winning a Mid-Valley 
League title last season. Bowling 
</P>

 Robert Smith of Moorpark was in second place, 50 pins behind, with a pinfall 
of 3,972 after three rounds of the $220,000 AC-Delco tournament in Lakewood.

UNIVERSITY WRESTLING MUST FORFEIT 11 VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 University High's wrestling team, tied for 10th with San Clemente in the 
Orange County poll, will forfeit 11 dual-meet victories, Athletic Director Mark 
Cunningham said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The team competed using an ineligible player, Cunningham discovered.The 
Trojans were in violation of Southern Section rule 213 regarding transfer 
eligibility; the athlete, who competed for another school last year, did not 
have a bona fide change of address. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be aboveboard about this," said Cunningham, who declined to 
name the wrestler. "It was an oversight; there was some miscommunication 
between the athlete and the administration. The worst part of it is he was a JV 
wrestler who was filling in at two 10-way tournaments for us." 
</P>
<P>
 University used the ineligible wrestler in 11 matches. The Trojans new record, 
including the tournament forfeitures, is 11-13-1. Cunningham informed the team 
after Wednesday's 54-6 victory over Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't affect us much for playoffs as long as we take care of 
business," Cunningham said. "The only way it could hurt us is if we get into a 
wild-card situation." 
</P>
<P>
 University retains its 4-0-1 Sea View League mark and is tied for first with 
eighth-ranked Irvine. Should both schools win their final two meets, the league 
championship would be decided by the greatest point differential against league 
opponents because the Trojans and Vaqueros wrestled to a 27-27 tie Jan. 11. The 
league champion would receive an automatic berth in the Southern Section 
dual-meet championships. MARTIN HENDERSON

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; GEARING UP AND SHUTTING DOWN; BUILDING SUPPLY 
STORE SCRAMBLES TO KEEP VITAL ITEMS IN STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are a few things victims urgently need in the aftermath of a big 
earthquake. Food. Water. Warmth. And, as HomeBase executives discovered this 
week, water line connectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Never seen one? It's the copper tubing that connects your water heater to its 
water source. On a normal day, the HomeBase building supply store in North 
Hollywood might sell a dozen of the 18-inch pipes. But in the aftermath of 
Monday's earthquake that shook many homes from their foundations -- and piping 
from their water heaters -- the store has sold more than 8,000. In fact, it has 
sold out its entire stock of the $6.37 gadgets every day since the 
6.6-magnitude temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The store -- which was severely damaged itself by the quake -- has put out the 
retail equivalent of an SOS for these items -- along with other heavily 
demanded consumer supplies, including ceiling tiles, drywall and flashlight 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The store nags its corporate headquarters office in Irvine. It begs and 
borrows items from other HomeBase stores statewide. It places dozens of urgent 
calls to vendors as far away as Arizona. And when all else fails, it has even 
cajoled vendor salespeople to load up their own cars and lug the supplies to 
the stores themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 After an earthquake, there simply is no standard operating procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the retail business -- especially after an earthquake -- you have to 
develop a sixth sense," said Manny Urbina, who is logging 16-hour days this 
week. "We know most people aren't out planting flowers in their gardens right 
now. I told everyone in the store to think only of this: What do people 
urgently need for cleanup and repair?" 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake damage at the HomeBase store in North Hollywood -- which exceeded 
$500,000 -- forced it to close for a day of harried cleanup Monday. Windows 
were shattered, supplies had tumbled from the shelves and there was no power. 
But dozens of store employees still arrived and cleaned up in the store aisles 
that were dimly lit with the help of whirring generators. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday morning, the store was back in limited operation. Before it opened, 
Urbina met with about 60 of the store's 170 employees to discuss how to keep 
anxious consumers happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put yourself in their place," Urbina told store employees. "Whatever you do, 
don't get into arguments. Give them whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
 While customers weren't allowed to step into the store on Tuesday, store 
employees fetched repair items for anxious patrons who lined up 100 deep at the 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
 The store sold 600 sheets of plywood within three hours of opening Tuesday. It 
sold 200 cases of ceiling tile that day -- more than 20 times the amount it 
normally sells. While the store might typically sell 100 water heaters in a 
week, it's now selling more than 100 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Few items, however, flew out the door faster than batteries. The first two 
days after the quake, the store sold 16,000 packs of flashlight batteries. 
Normally, it might sell 50 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The store has temporarily junked the computerized way it usually tracks 
inventory because its computers can't handle too much deviation from the usual 
routine. "The computer doesn't know there was an earthquake," said Donna Hoyt, 
receiving manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's receiving department, which usually closes by 3 p.m., has extended 
its hours to 8:30 p.m. "We're taking items off the back of the truck directly 
to the sales floor," said Evelio Fonticiella, a sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees who previously lacked authorization were given special 
permission to place orders to replenish stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, store phone operators -- who typically handle 120 calls 
an hour -- are handling closer to 400. "One lady called and said she just 
wanted to know if we were still alive," Hilda Juarez said. "I told her we 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the long lines, frayed nerves and occasional aftershocks, the cashiers 
-- who deal directly with more customers than do any other employees -- must 
somehow keep smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Martha Lopez, who has been a cashier at HomeBase for five years. She was 
at the register when the store reopened Tuesday, even though severe earthquake 
damage has forced Lopez and her family to move out of their Reseda apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It amazes me how many customers -- busy as they are -- stop to ask me, 'How 
are you doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring the fact that the earthquake destroyed her apartment, she tells them 
she's doing just fine. And then she smiles.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; GEARING UP AND SHUTTING DOWN; SMALL FIRMS FACE 
A GRUELING AND UNCERTAIN RECOVERY EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE and DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Il Byun stepped inside his Hollywood Boulevard clothing store Monday morning 
and could hardly believe his eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake a few hours earlier had jarred ceiling tiles loose, collapsed 
an interior wall and crumbled a piece of the store's facade into the street. 
Looters had carted off about $8,000 worth of goods. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second major blow to Byun's small business in as many years: His 
former clothing store in South-Central Los Angeles had burned to the ground 
during the riots of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so frustrating and so sad," Byun said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Byun is one of uncounted thousands of small business owners -- merchants, 
grocers and restaurateurs, some of whom had just bounced back from the L.A. 
riots -- for whom the quake of '94 is the beginning of a long, grueling process 
of recovery. If the 1992 riots are any guide, that process could end in failure 
for two out of five. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no good estimates of how many businesses were affected by the quake. 
But the response at newly opened federal disaster centers Thursday suggests 
quake damage was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred people seeking relief for their homes or businesses were 
waiting outside the Department of Water and Power building on Crenshaw 
Boulevard when it opened at 1 p.m. Some had been waiting since before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 By opening time, many in the crowd seemed to be nearing open revolt. Several 
said that one man had grabbed a handful of aid applications and tried to sell 
them to people for $5, fleeing the scene before police could be alerted. Los 
Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas grabbed a police bullhorn to calm 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Dun & Bradstreet estimates that about 175,000 businesses, employing 1.5 
million people, lie within a 20-mile radius of the epicenter of the quake. But 
only 19% of the small businesses in California that think they are vulnerable 
to earthquakes are likely to have earthquake insurance, according to the 
Insurance Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that sustained damage and do not have insurance will have to rely 
on public or private aid, loans, savings or friends for the money to restock 
lost inventory, to pay expenses while they clean up or to rebuild entirely. 
After the riots, for example, such help has been too little too late.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Oaks Liquor store in the Jefferson Park section of South-Central Los 
Angeles, the quake knocked virtually everything off the shelves, co-owner 
Brenda Robinson said. "There was a bunch of broken bottles everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Oaks has no earthquake insurance to cover the lost inventory, which Robinson 
estimated to be worth between $30,000 and $40,000. That's because Oaks' owners 
couldn't afford the $2,500-a-year premium on the $10,000-deductible policy.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Oaks will have to rely on a Small Business Administration 
disaster loan to recover. "But a lot of the losses we'll have to eat," she 
said. "We understand that doing business in Los Angeles, that's one of the 
risks you live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Past experience suggests that quake-damaged business owners can expect to run 
a gantlet of red tape, government regulations, confusing forms and bureaucratic 
foot dragging on the way to recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 The Korean-American Grocers Assn. of California reported that of 200 stores 
destroyed in the riots, only six are back in business. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor success rate is due to a lack of insurance, regulatory hurdles and 
delays in receiving federal assistance, said Ryan Song, executive director of 
the grocers group. 
</P>
<P>
 A broader survey by Dun & Bradstreet, meanwhile, found that more than 40% of 
522 South-Central and Koreatown businesses damaged in the riots are no longer 
in operation. Of those that did rebuild, 37% said insurance paid for less than 
half the costs of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, government officials promised that things will be different 
this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Kulik, the SBA's assistant administrator for disaster assistance, said 
the agency has cut its loan application process in half since the Midwest 
floods of last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson said Thursday that the state will underwrite loans of up to 
$200,000 to help small-business owners get back on their feet quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 City, county, state and federal officials have met to begin coordinating 
relief efforts to business, said Kim Shaw, program manager of the county's 
Community Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 And RLA, formerly Rebuild L.A., said it will begin coordinating information on 
sources of rebuilding money, and the agency encouraged affected small-business 
owners to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the riots, the SBA says it approved 74% of the applications it 
received for disaster relief, most from small businesses, amounting to 5,582 
loans worth $330.7 million. Of that money, more than 84% was disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 But a survey by the Korean American Inter-Agency Council, a consortium of 
community groups, found that much of the money was given out in amounts too 
small to get a business back on its feet. The council blamed shortsighted SBA 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA spokesman Richard Jenkins said the goal this time around is to get 
applicants their money within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia DeAlba, 71, was one of the people who made it inside the Crenshaw 
disaster relief center. 
</P>
<P>
 She owns a 24-unit apartment building in Glendale that sustained an estimated 
$150,000 damage during Monday's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Six apartments were badly damaged. Many of her tenants have moved out and say 
they don't want to go back in. DeAlba said the rents she receives are her only 
source of income besides Social Security, and now she faces a $6,175 monthly 
mortgage payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to her tenants, she said: "Now the people are scared to death and 
they want their deposits back. But how am I going to make my mortgage payments? 
I'm very, very scared myself."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; GEARING UP AND SHUTTING DOWN; LOW-INCOME 
RENTERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE AMONG THE HARDEST HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 While the earthquake and its aftershocks damaged thousands of apartments from 
the San Fernando Valley to San Pedro, the temblors have severely damaged only a 
relatively small number of the rental units in Los Angeles County and should 
not affect rents paid by most tenants, real estate experts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, low-income renters will probably suffer the most in the quake's 
aftermath because most of the apartments that sustained severe damage were 
low-rent, older complexes built before strict seismic laws were put in place, 
experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the economic scale, high-income tenants in luxurious 
apartments will be able to continue getting discounts or other concessions from 
developers because most newer buildings emerged from the quake unscathed and 
the market for high-priced rentals is still soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the pain is being suffered by the poorest of the poor," said Susan 
Delaguch, an aide to Hollywood area City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. "We had 
so little affordable housing to begin with, and now much of that is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, harried apartment owners continued to comb through their properties 
Thursday, frantically trying to assess their damage and line up repair workers 
while also attempting to ease their tenants' jangled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 Building owners who suffered damage faced the frustrating task of finding 
reliable contractors who can make repairs quickly, while those whose property 
was spared by the 6.6-magnitude temblor breathed a collective sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 weary government inspectors fanned out across the county again 
Thursday, toting bundles of colored tags to hammer or staple on the doors of 
buildings they had surveyed.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Los Angeles Building and Safety Department had hoped their 
initial work would be completed by this evening, but then said the inspectors 
would probably work well into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 While landlords expressed sympathy for tenants who could not enter their 
apartments to retrieve their belongings, they said compassion sometimes had to 
take a back seat to legal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Ham, who manages three small apartment buildings in the San Fernando 
Valley, said he could not let one family back into its home because a beam 
supporting the roof had split down the middle and he feared it might collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I let these people in and an aftershock comes, they could get hurt and the 
owner will get sued," Ham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if nothing happens, the city might cite me for letting them into a 
building that's unsafe. I can't afford to be a nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although reliable figures were not available, estimates of the number of 
people temporarily left homeless by the quake ranged from 10,000 to 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the damage, building inspectors have so far found only 2,500 homes and 
apartment units to be uninhabitable in Los Angeles County. The county has more 
than a million apartment units and the overall vacancy rate remains well above 
10% -- about twice the level of what officials consider normal. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, experts said, the quake will put little upward pressure on rents 
for a typical two-bedroom apartment and will not result in a construction boom, 
because too many units will remain empty even after displaced tenants have 
found new housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who thinks that replacing a few thousand apartment units will give the 
economy a big shot in the arm is mistaken," said Ben Bartolotto, an economist 
at the Construction Industry Research Board in Burbank. "Most of the gains we 
get by a pickup in construction over the next several months are going to be 
offset by the losses that the economy is suffering right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, which represents 
about 11,000 landlords in the area, had fielded more than 50 calls in the first 
few hours their office was open Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some landlords are looking for lawyers, but others are just looking for trash 
haulers," said Kevin Postema, a spokesman for the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Phones were also ringing nonstop at the offices of independent engineers and 
architects who are trained to determine whether buildings are safe to live in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the buildings I've seen are seriously damaged, but a lot of others 
look much worse off than they really are," said Barry Schweiger, president of 
Building Surveys & Architecture in Torrance. "They've got lots of cracks and 
plaster is strewn all over the place, but structurally they're quite sound."

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HOMES JUMPS 7.1% IN '93 TO HIGHEST LEVEL IN 4 YEARS; 
ECONOMY: MIXED FIGURES ALSO SHOW PERSONAL INCOME ADVANCING 0.7%, WHILE 
FIRST-TIME JOBLESS APPLICANTS JUMPED SHARPLY.

 Construction of new homes jumped by 7.1% in 1993 to 1.29 million units, the 
highest level of housing starts in four years, the Commerce Department said 
Thursday. It was the second straight advance and lifted construction to the 
highest level since 1.38 million new single-family homes and apartments were 
built in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Low mortgage rates, better employment gains and improved consumer confidence 
have served to boost single-family housing starts in the second half of 1993," 
said economist John E. Silvia of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "These 
same factors should sustain housing starts in the first half of 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Activity improved in every region but the Northeast, where it slipped 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Western region, which has been struggling to emerge from recession, 
December housing starts shot up 14.7% to an annualized rate of 374,000 units, 
compared to 326,000 units in November, despite California's lingering 
recession. For the full year, housing starts were up 4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 In other economic reports Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance 
jumped by 23,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 380,000. This was the 
highest level since July 24, 1993, when 395,000 people filed initial 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Commerce Department said personal income grew 0.7% nationally in the 
third quarter, advancing in all but 11 states. In California, personal income 
was up 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing starts for December ended the year on a strong note, shooting up 6.2% 
to a seasonally adjusted 1.54 million annual rate. This was the highest since a 
1.55 million rate in January, 1990, and the fifth straight increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Merrill Lynch economists suggested severe winter weather in much of 
the Midwest and Northeast this month and the Los Angeles earthquake probably 
would curb construction early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Once rebuilding begins in Los Angeles and the frigid winter weather lifts, 
housing starts should pick up again, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for building permits also appeared to confirm the optimism. Often 
a gauge of future activity, applications jumped 7.4% in December, to a 1.48 
million annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, home building was led by single-family construction, which surged 
9.1% to 1.12 million. This was the highest since 1.15 million homes were built 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment construction slipped 4.7% to 161,700, the smallest in more than a 
decade. Housing Starts

 Saturn Workers to Get Bonuses: General Motors Corp. said its 8,543 Saturn 
workers will receive payments of about $2,867 at the end of the month, 
reflecting the division's ability to meet its quality and productivity goals 
while earning a profit last year.Under Saturn's innovative labor agreement with 
the United Auto Workers union, employees are rewarded for meeting certain 
targets. Employees must also complete 92 hours of training a year in order to 
bring their base pay to the same level as other auto workers'. Saturn employees 
received about $5,100 in reward payments in 1993.

 Fixed-Rate Mortgage Rate Rises to 7.05%: The average interest rate on the 
30-year loans rose this week from 6.99% last week, the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corp. said.The figure is still below the recent peak of 7.31% reached 
in late November. The average hit a 25-year low of 6.74% in October. 
Fifteen-year mortgages, an increasingly popular option, averaged 6.57% this 
week, up from 6.48% a week earlier. On one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, 
lenders were asking an average initial rate of 4.24%, up from 4.20% last week. 
The rates do not include points.

 Price/Costco to Shut Four Stores: Closing Jan. 30 are a Costco store in 
Riverside and Price Club stores in Bakersfield; Richmond, Calif., and New 
Britain, Conn.As many as 350 employees may be affected, said Richard Galanti, 
Price/Costco's chief financial officer. The stores were targeted for closure 
because they are in markets that overlap with other stores as a result of last 
year's $2.3-billion merger of Kirkland, Wash.-based Costco Wholesale Corp. and 
San Diego-based Price Inc. No further closures are planned, Galanti said.

 Fraud Suspect Arrested: Michael Gartner, former president of an Orange County 
company accused of defrauding 450 investors of more than $10 million, was 
arrested in Washington state on contempt charges by the U.S. Customs Service. 
Agents arrested Gartner on Wednesday in Blaine, Wash., as he was in the process 
of crossing the Canadian border into the United States, said David Schindler, 
an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. A federal judge in Los Angeles 
issued an arrest warrant for Gartner last fall after he failed to account for 
or repay money raised from investors in his Costa Mesa-based company, Interlink 
Data Network of Los Angeles Inc., Securities and Exchange Commission officials 
said.

ANOTHER DOW RECORD; BOND YIELDS DROP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Stocks pulled ahead to new highs on continued strong share 
volume, despite some disappointing corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields eased as some traders speculated that the economy's growth rate 
is losing steam. Gold prices tumbled on fears of a sudden supply glut. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The market's trend of recent days -- slow advances on heavy turnover -- 
remained intact Thursday: The Dow industrials inched up 7.59 points to a record 
3,891.96, on Big Board volume of 310 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners edged losers on both the Big Board and Nasdaq, and the Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller stocks made a new high by a sliver: It gained 
3.75 points to 793.03, topping the previous record of 793.02 set Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-quarter earnings reports from railroads CSX and Union Pacific failed to 
impress Wall Street and the stocks were pummeled. CSX lost 2 3/8 to 86 1/2 and 
Union Pacific slumped 2 1/2 to 63 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market got a lift from better than expected reports from some 
high-tech firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, like a faucet that won't shut off, money continues to flow into 
industrial stocks that should benefit from a stronger economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Nasdaq market was pulled up as Microsoft shares jumped 3 to 86 1/4 
following its report that quarterly earnings rose 22%. Personal computer maker 
AST Research soared 4 3/8 to 29 1/8 after reporting quarterly earnings of 55 
cents a share. Wall Street had expected 43 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also gaining on earnings reports were Tandem Computer, up 1 5/8 to 13 3/4; 
PPG Industries, up 7/8 to 77 1/2; Kimberly-Clark, up 3 5/8 to 56 1/8, and 
Bearings, up 1 3/8 to 29 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, software firm Computer Associates tumbled 3 1/2 to 41 
despite reporting fourth-quarter earnings up 50%. Some investors had expected 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical giant Monsanto gave up 1 7/8 to 78 1/8 after reporting quarterly 
earnings of 49 cents a share, versus a loss a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another loser was computer chip maker Altera, off 5 5/8 to 30 on its 
quarterly report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Circus Circus slumped 2 1/4 to 36 7/8 after it said the general manager of 
its new Luxor hotel-casino in Las Vegas had resigned to join an Australian 
company. 
</P>
<P>

 Bond yields rose early in the day, following the release of a Commerce 
Department report that showed a larger than expected rise in housing starts 
during December.

<P>
 But yields fell back later after the Labor Department said the number of 
Americans filing initial jobless claims surged 23,000 to the highest level in 
six months during the week ended Jan. 15. That suggested the economy's growth 
might not be as robust as expected this quarter.

 Viacom May Sue Paramount: In a letter to Paramount Communications Inc., Viacom 
Inc. formally notified the company that it is reserving the right to sue for 
the $100-million breakup fee originally negotiated in a friendly merger deal in 
September. That merger agreement was scrapped Dec. 22 after the Paramount board 
decided to recommend a QVC Network Inc. bid to its shareholders instead. 
However, Viacom said it will not pursue the legal action while Paramount is in 
the midst of its auction.

INSURED QUAKE LOSSES LIKELY TO TOP $2 BILLION; CLAIMS: ESTIMATES REMAIN 
SKETCHY, BUT COSTS APPEAR HIGHER THAN IN LOMA PRIETA QUAKE.

 Damage reports continued to pour into insurance company offices Thursday, 
increasing the likelihood that the Northridge earthquake will surpass the 1989 
Loma Prieta quake in both numbers of claims and insured losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's seven largest issuers of homeowners insurance -- 
accounting for more than half the market -- reported Thursday morning that they 
had fielded more than 42,000 loss reports in the three days after the quake.The 
figure includes commercial and auto claims.  
</P>
<P>
 Insurance company representatives continued to resist estimating the dollar 
amount of claims, but one industry analyst said $2 billion might be 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Spehar of Merrill Lynch noted that insured losses in the Loma Prieta 
earthquake came to $960 million and that total damage reached $7 billion. If a 
similar ratio between covered and uncovered losses holds true in the Northridge 
quake -- no sure bet, he cautioned -- then insured losses could well exceed $2 
billion, since total destruction has been estimated at $15 billion to $30 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers have imposed a 30-day moratorium on issuing new earthquake insurance 
policies. The area affected by the moratorium varies by insurer. Policies will 
still be sold, but they will not become effective until the moratorium expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Many carriers saw their damage report totals double between Wednesday and 
Thursday as they added extra telephone lines and personnel to deal with the 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, the largest insurer, had no firm estimate of claims received as of 
Thursday, except that they exceeded 10,000. Allstate Insurance, second-largest, 
had received 12,086 loss reports by midday. No. 3 Farmers Insurance had more 
than 8,000 reports -- up from 3,000 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century Insurance had 5,000 claims, USAA 4,000, Safeco 2,300 and 
Fireman's Fund 1,100 -- all as of Thursday morning, spokespersons said.

CONTINUED COLD KEEPS BUSINESSES AT A HALT; WEATHER: ECONOMISTS SAY RECORD LOWS 
GRIPPING THE EAST AND MIDWEST COULD COST THE NATION BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The record low temperatures gripping much of the East and Midwest began to 
ease Thursday, but many businesses continued to face weather-related 
disruptions as snowbound cities dug themselves out and utilities strained to 
keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kentucky, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia, economic activity was 
at a virtual halt as local authorities declared states of emergency and workers 
stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation-related businesses were especially hard hit, with United Parcel 
Service alone forced to spend $65 million to deal with the emergency even as it 
lost $52 million in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was more or less business as usual in many places, including New 
York City. Economists said the weather might ultimately cost the national 
economy billions of dollars. But they noted that many business will be able to 
make up their losses later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a knockout punch for the economic recovery," said Ken Goldstein, 
an economist with the Conference Board, a business research group. "More like a 
light jab." 
</P>
<P>
 An Arctic air mass stretching from Alabama to Maine and as far west as 
Minnesota produced record low temperatures Wednesday in many areas, with the 
mercury falling to 36 below zero in Whiteland, Ind.; 2 below in New York, and 4 
below in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Electric utilities that imposed blackouts Wednesday were able to avoid them 
Thursday, with temperatures rising above zero and residents and businesses 
responding to calls for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Ohio River Valley, where the extreme cold was immediately preceded 
by a major snowstorm, many problems remained. Highways were closed across 
Kentucky, and many businesses were shuttered in the absence of both employees 
and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Ford Motor Co. plants -- two in Louisville, Ky., and one in Michigan -- 
were closed Thursday, and 10 to 11 others were on short shifts, a spokesman 
said. General Motors Corp. said three factories were on reduced schedules but 
that the situation was improving. 
</P>
<P>
 United Parcel, which has its main hub in Louisville, has been in crisis mode 
since Tuesday. On that day, only 150 of 9,000 employees made it to work and all 
planes were grounded. A spokeswoman said the company had contacted 100,000 
affected customers; UPS leased 60 Lear jets to help clear the package backlog. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington was a virtual ghost town Thursday after Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly 
ordered all nonessential businesses to close. Almost every retail shop, 
business office and law firm was affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists noted that most companies will be able to make up lost business 
later, especially if the cold weather does not persist. Still, the snap could 
put a temporary damper on the reviving construction and real estate industries 
and on retailing, said David Pitcher, corporate economist at Bell Atlantic 
Corp. in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants and other establishments that cater to immediate needs will 
probably be the most affected, he said. In addition, many municipalities are 
facing strains because they have exhausted their snow-removal budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 For some businesses, though, the weather is a boon. Bell Atlantic has had a 
big increase in calling volume. Morton Salt is having a banner year, as are 
hardware suppliers and tow truck operators. 
</P>

NO FRAUD EVIDENT IN PRUDENTIAL FUND FAILURE, WITNESS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Expert witnesses for Prudential Securities Inc. testified Thursday that they 
had found no sign of fraud in the firm's failed, $1.44-billion oil and gas 
limited partnership program known as the Energy Income Funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no villains to look for, there are no culprits," said Ben C. Ball 
Jr., an oil and gas consultant and former Gulf Oil executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The second day of a federal court hearing marked Prudential's first 
opportunity to call witnesses in open court to dispute allegations that the 
partnerships falsely promised steep returns to elderly investors and paid them 
their own money back in the guise of profits. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. is holding the hearing to decide if 
he should approve a class-action settlement that would pay $90.7 million to 
about 125,000 investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball testified that the partnerships' projections for oil and gas prices were 
in line with industry and federal government standards. He said investors lost 
money only because oil prices in the mid-1980s confounded the projections, 
plunging instead of rising. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnerships would have made money even if oil prices had been flat, Ball 
contended. "It was the unpredictable events in the oil and gas industry which 
account for all of the out-of-pocket losses of investors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination by investors' lawyer Stuart C. Goldberg, however, Ball 
acknowledged that individual Energy Income partnerships lost money even though 
they were formed during periods in the late 1980s when oil prices were rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg and Jeff D. Ferentz of Newport Beach are the only attorneys opposing 
approval of the settlement, which they argue is grossly inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential's other expert witness, Kenneth M. Burke, a senior accountant with 
Ernst & Young and a longtime specialist in oil and gas accounting, said he had 
found nothing improper in the Energy Income funds' prospectuses or in the way 
Prudential accounted for the money paid out to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is due to conclude today.

GOLDEN WEST TURNS ITS EYES TO FORD'S S&L; THRIFTS: THE MOVE REPRESENTS THE 
LATEST EFFORT TO EXPAND WORLD SAVINGS. OVERTURES TOWARD CALFED HAVE BEEN 
REBUFFED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With its pursuit of California Federal Bank apparently stalled, Oakland-based 
Golden West Financial has turned its attention across San Francisco Bay to the 
headquarters of First Nationwide Savings, the troubled savings and loan 
subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources confirmed that Golden West, whose operating arm is World Savings, is 
one of several financial institutions now examining First Nationwide's books as 
a prelude to a possible offer for the San Francisco-based financial 
institution.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Golden West, First Nationwide and CalFed all declined to comment, 
but the talks were confirmed by officials close to the financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The move represents the latest effort by Golden West Chairman Herb Sandler to 
expand the highly successful World Savings, one of the only major thrifts to 
emerge largely unscathed from the S&L disaster of the 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 It is also another move in what has become a chess match between Sandler and 
CalFed Chief Executive Edward Harshfield. While Sandler's overtures to the Los 
Angeles-based thrift so far have been rebuffed, few observers think he has 
given up. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Golden West made a $630-million offer to buy CalFed in a highly 
conditional package that included a cash payment to common stockholders of 
$21.50 a share, minus losses and write-downs of bad loans. CalFed's board 
rejected the offer.  
</P>
<P>
 Financially troubled CalFed, the nation's fifth-largest thrift, then announced 
a strategy to raise up to $300 million in stock offerings, followed by the 
possible sale of the thrift.  
</P>
<P>
 Sandler took his case directly to CalFed's major shareholders, arguing that 
they might be better off taking Golden West's offer now than risking continued 
losses that would deplete shareholders equity. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed's Harshfield countered by saying the money raised from the proposed 
stock offerings would enable the company to dispose of its bad loans while 
keeping its capital above minimum levels. Harshfield said the cleanup, followed 
by a possible sale, could be accomplished in six months or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is important because most of CalFed's large investors are former 
bondholders who converted their holdings to stock as part of a reorganization 
and are now anxious to realize their profits. Those investors paid as little as 
$3 a share. CalFed's stock closed Thursday at 14.375, off 12.5 cents, in 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ball now in Golden West's court, Sandler has several options. One is 
to forget CalFed completely and pursue First Nationwide; another is pursue both 
at the same time. Another is to get CalFed shareholders to sign so-called 
lockup agreements committing their shares to Sandler at certain terms for a 
specified period.

 Billy Crystal Won't Host Academy Awards: The comedian's publicist confirmed 
that Crystal is bowing out after four consecutive years of the duties.Rumors 
have circulated in Hollywood that Crystal would not repeat as host of the March 
21 event. Oscar show producer Gil Cates said he does not have a replacement for 
Crystal. In a statement, Crystal said: "I'm going to take a break from my 
hosting duties. I always felt honored to host the show and did my best to carry 
on the tradition of Bob Hope and Johnny Carson." Hope hosted the show 10 years 
on his own and co-hosted four other years. Carson hosted five years.

 Pacific Telesis Posts $391-Million 4th-Quarter Loss: The company attributed 
the loss of 92 cents a share for the period ended Dec 31. largely to 
restructuring costs.A year earlier, Pacific Telesis earned $287 million, or 71 
cents per share. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up 1% from $2.27 billion in the 
fourth quarter of 1992. Its earnings for the latest period were reduced by $670 
million because of special onetime charges for a restructuring that is expected 
to eliminate 10,000 jobs by the end of 1997. Without the charges, the company 
said, it would have earned $279 million, or 66 cents a share, which is still 
below its performance a year ago.

 Just days before Monday's big quake, two of Wall Street's major brokerages had 
come to the same conclusion about the California economy: Things were looking 
up. Time to start fishing around for recovery-related stock opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly $30 billion in quake damage later, the analysts at Goldman, Sachs & 
Co. and Salomon Bros.--whose respective reports were titled "California 
Dreamin' " and "California is Turning"--admit that their clients may find the 
buy-California concept hard to swallow now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm agonized over how to make sense of this," conceded David Hensley, author 
of the Salomon report and a former UCLA economist who left Los Angeles for New 
York last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward F. McKelvey, co-author of the Goldman report, said he believes "the 
broad brush of our report wouldn't change," though he adds that it's difficult 
to judge the magnitude of the loss in business activity in L.A. in the near 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Wall Street wasn't in any hurry to jump on the California 
recovery wagon, even before the quake. While the stock market overall is 
hitting record highs, shares of most companies that are heavily dependent on 
the California economy remain far below their peaks of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, is the point that Salomon and Goldman were making: If you 
believe that a recovery is in the wings, this would be the time to buy--before 
the crowd catches on and bids the stocks higher, anticipating an earnings 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-quake, Salomon's Hensley had based his optimism about a California upswing 
partly on a plunge in aerospace-related layoff announcements. Aerospace firms 
statewide have announced 5,800 job cuts since April, versus 36,605 in all of 
1992, Hensley calculated. Because there is an average lag time of about 11 
months between announcements and layoffs, he figured the relative dearth of 
announcements since April suggested a stabilizing of aerospace employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, McKelvey said that although there are few obvious signs of a 
California recovery in macro-economic statistics, "Our analysts have uncovered 
a great deal of . . . anecdotal data to that effect"--for example, better sales 
trends at some retailers and stronger home sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the quake now kill off any nascent recovery by casting new gloom over the 
Southland, which accounts for the lion's share of California's economic output? 
That is the $30-billion question, Hensley and McKelvey concede. Certainly, 
there will be some boost from the rebuilding effort and from replacement of 
damaged goods. But Hensley worries more about the damaged psychology of the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think so many people are disenchanted with life there, for whatever reason, 
that they don't have a strong enough attachment to the place to want to get 
over this," said Hensley, who professes to still be a big fan of L.A. himself. 
If, instead of rebuilding, many people give up and leave, he said, "That would 
obviously blow a hole in our paper." 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot would be that stocks of California-dependent companies--in 
particular, banks, retailers and home builders--could suffer fresh declines or 
just stay depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Southland money managers, however, warn against taking a simplistic, 
broad-stroke approach to "California" stocks. Even in the deep recession of the 
past three years, some California-dependent firms have managed to cope quite 
well. That suggests they may not need much help in the form of a healthier 
state economy to keep their turnarounds on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rodriguez, head of the FPA Capital stock fund in Los Angeles, cites 
electronics retailer Good Guys, in which he owns a big stake. Thursday, Good 
Guys reported record fourth-quarter earnings despite the sour state economy. 
(And looking ahead, people will need to replace quake-damaged electronics, 
Rodriguez reminded.) 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Kaufman & Broad Home sold a record number of homes in California 
last year by focusing on the first-time buyer and has begun to target the same 
market in Las Vegas and Phoenix. And grocer Smart & Final now is exporting its 
small-store wholesaling concept to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Point is, rather than bet on or against California as a theme, investors would 
be smarter to zero-in on good companies run by savvy managers who just happen 
to have a big stake in California's future. Those are the stocks likely to get 
the biggest lift when a California recovery arrives--or when the rest of Wall 
Street begins to anticipate it. The Californians

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: FAST-BUCK ARTISTS FOLLOW DISASTERS

 Price gouging is the first of many pitfalls that survivors of Monday's quake 
may face, law enforcement officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As the aftershocks subside and water and electricity are restored to homes, 
prices on water, batteries and other items--inflated to two to three times 
their usual levels in some areas--should fall.  
</P>
<P>
 As they begin to pick up the pieces in earnest, San Fernando Valley residents 
are likely to encounter a small army of con artists posing as loan expediters, 
contractors and fund-raisers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called loan expediters typically promise they can get you a government 
loan faster for a fee. In fact, many of them are scam artists who will take the 
fee and run. City Atty. James K. Hahn said people should "be wary of anyone who 
says they can get you special assistance for a fee." 
</P>
<P>
 Head Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas A. Papageorge warned against doing business 
with unlicensed contractors, some of whom may demand large payments up front or 
liens on your property. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also warn of charity scams, in which con artists pose as 
fund-raisers for schools or homes in need of repair. Authorities said people 
should not donate to unfamiliar charities over the phone and should instead ask 
for a mailing. Anyone who solicits funds in Los Angeles must first obtain a 
permit from the city's Department of Social Services, and notice of the 
charity's permit should be included in the mailing. 
</P>
<P>
 People who think they've been victimized or approached by a con artist, or who 
are looking for further information on how to protect themselves, can call the 
Earthquake Fraud Prevention Task Force Hotline at (800) 897-6677 between 8:30 
a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Officials said more than 100 people have already used the 
line.

 Nothing to sneeze at: Early results on sales of cold remedies are in, with 
some types of products showing healthy gains. For the 12 weeks ended Dec. 5, 
sales of over-the-counter sore throat remedies were up 11.2%. Sales of cold 
tablets jumped 5.8% from the same period in 1992, according to the marketing 
firm International Resources Inc. Sales of cough syrups fell 1.3% as consumers 
reached for cough medications in pill or tablet form and boosted sales of those 
products 2.3%. Among the new remedies contributing to sales, according to New 
Product News, were capsules containing liquid cold medication, called 
liquicaps.

 Buckling up: More parents are using child safety seats in the wake of a 
year-old law that increased the penalty for not using them, a recent state 
survey shows. But use of safety seats still lags behind compliance with the 
seat belt law. 
</P>
<P>
 In its annual survey, the state Office of Traffic Safety found that 73.8% of 
infants and toddlers traveling in automobiles in November were strapped into 
safety seats, compared to 59.3% in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The same survey found that more than 80% of adults were using seat belts last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 People involved in child safety say that raising the fine for not using safety 
seats to $100 from $20 has prompted more parents to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety advocates say ignorance of the dangers of not using a safety seat, 
as well as the cost of the seats--as much as $80 each--are reasons more parents 
don't install them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think (an accident) will never happen to them," said 
Stephanie M. Tombrello, executive director of Inglewood-based Safety Belt Safe 
USA.  
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that many parents who use the safety seats don't use them 
correctly, Tombrello said. In a roadside spot check her group conducted last 
year with Signal Hill police, only one of 49 motorists carrying a child in a 
safety seat had secured the seat properly. Very often, the seat belt holding 
down the seat was too loose. But this problem can be corrected by attaching an 
inexpensive "locking clip" to the belt, Tombrello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Belt Safe provides information about child safety seats and can tell 
low-income parents where to get the seats at the lowest price. The organization 
can be reached at (800) 745-SAFE. Buckling Up

 Use of child safety seats has not kept pace with increasing use of seat belts 
by adults. Figures are for November of each year. 04,06,09,12,09 Year Drivers

CASTLE ROCK ELEVATES LIZ GLOTZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Castle Rock Entertainment named Liz Glotzer to the new post of president of 
production, overseeing development and production at the maker of such films as 
"In the Line of Fire," "A Few Good Men," "City Slickers" and the upcoming 
"North." 
</P>
<P>
 The move is a sign of formerly independent Castle Rock's desire to boost 
production now that the production company is owned by Turner Broadcasting 
System.Glotzer has been with Castle Rock since it was founded in 1987 and most 
recently was vice president of production. "This sends a signal (that Glotzer) 
is the person they can look to for answers in terms of development," Castle 
Rock President Martin Shafer said. The company plans to boost output to up to 
seven films in '94, possibly to 12 within a few years.

HOLLYWOOD GETS BACK TO DOING LUNCH; QUAKE: SHOWS ARE DELAYED AS STUDIOS MOP UP. 
SOME EATERIES BOUNCE BACK.

 Morton's missed the first Monday night at its new location. Shooting of 
"Seinfeld" has been delayed, and some executives still have not returned to 
their wrecked offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show went on in Hollywood on Thursday, at least for the most part, as 
the studios reclaimed soaked sound stages and frazzled employees car-pooled 
through the torn streets left by Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is still being conducted gingerly, and many people are still not 
working," said entertainment attorney David Colden. "Others are preoccupied 
with the well being of the individuals they're dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a brief status report. 
</P>
<P>
 * Studios: Sprinkler systems gone berserk made for water damage at nearly all 
studios. Jeffrey Katzenberg's office was flooded with nearly a foot of water, 
forcing the Disney chairman to work out of his conference room. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's marketing and international distribution staffs have been moved off 
the Burbank lot because of severe damage to the Roy Disney building, which 
rests on supposedly earthquake-proof rollers. (One explanation: The 
earthquake's vertical movement negated the rollers' cushioning effect.) 
</P>
<P>
 Warner's glass and steel marketing building was largely shattered and five 
sound stages were damaged. Several of the studio's TV shows were planning to 
wait until Monday to resume shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony, Paramount and 20th Century Fox sustained cosmetic damage. MGM was back 
to work Wednesday, but carpets remained drenched from sprinklers bursting on 
the fourth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restaurants: Nearly all of Hollywood's favorite haunts were closed at the 
beginning of the week. A few of them, such as Pinot Bistro in Sherman Oaks, 
won't be open for lunch until next week. Pinot manager Doug Flohr said dozens 
of wine bottles were broken in the quake, but he was optimistic. "I think 
people are starting to get a little bit of cabin fever," he said. "Business 
should pick right back up." 
</P>
<P>
 He may be right: The Grill in Beverly Hills was packed Thursday with industry 
heavyweights, most of them looking to compare earthquake tales. Delmonico 
Seafood Grille in West Los Angeles also reported that its business was back, 
and Spago was said to be packed as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morton's elite Monday night crowd will have to wait awhile for the 
rescheduling of a benefit planned to mark the restaurant's opening across the 
street from its old location on Melrose. Art's Deli in Studio City was also 
closed temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fast lane: Entertainment executives -- along with other Angelenos who 
have electric garage door openers -- went scrambling for their instruction 
manuals Monday, as power outages raised the frightening specter of being cut 
off from their cars. Now, with power restored to most of the damaged areas, the 
problem is commuting. For those who live on the Westside and travel to Burbank 
every day, the traffic is adding hours to their days. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer people are going to the movies since the quake. Theme park attendance is 
down. "Sure, revenues are off," said Skip Paul, executive vice president at 
MCA, "but no one is talking about that. In a funny way, that's good for 
business every once in a while. It's been heartening to see the sincere concern 
and people in this business coming together to help each other." AMY HARMON

TIME WARNER TAKES SHELTER IN A 'CHEWABLE POISON PILL'; TAKEOVERS: SEAGRAM'S 
LATEST RAISING OF ITS STAKE SEEMS TO SPUR THE MOVE, BUT BOARD SAYS NO 
PARTICULAR INVESTOR IS THE TARGET. 
</P>

<P>
 Time Warner Inc.'s board abruptly enacted an anti-takeover measure Thursday, a 
day after beverage and liquor giant Seagram Co. disclosed that it had raised 
its stake in the media and entertainment company to 11.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, a "poison pill" designed to protect against hostile takeover 
attempts, activates special securities that would theoretically make such a 
deal prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner, whose directors eliminated a stronger poison pill in 1991, said 
the new pill would, in effect, limit any individual's or group's stake to no 
more than 15% of shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the exact percentage that Montreal-based Seagram has said it plans to 
accumulate. Entertainment industry sources and investors speculated that Time 
Warner's move reflects growing nervousness on the part of Chief Executive 
Gerald M. Levin and other senior officials that Seagram may try to go further. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about Seagram's ultimate intention toward Time Warner has heated 
up as the beverage company and its chairman, Edgar M. Bronfman, continue to 
build a position in the entertainment conglomerate. Seagram has been involved 
in high-stakes takeover battles before, notably for Conoco oil in the early 
1980s, before Conoco was acquired by DuPont. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagram insists that it plans to stop at 15% of Time Warner, and it reiterated 
that position in a response to the Time Warner disclosure. Seagram said in its 
statement that it has continually reassured Time Warner, both publicly and 
privately. It said it generally opposes poison pills because they "can 
interfere with shareholder choice and adversely affect shareholder values." 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner downplayed the influence of Seagram's moves on its action. It said 
the plan "does not preclude a bona fide all-cash offer for all Time Warner's 
outstanding stock which treats all shareholders equally." 
</P>
<P>
 It also suggested that the rising value of media and entertainment assets -- 
as reflected in the wild bidding for Paramount Communications Inc. -- made it 
necessary to use devices to assure that no single investor gains control of the 
company on the cheap. One company source also noted that the plan would 
prohibit a hostile "two-tier" takeover bid -- in which a chunk of cash is 
offered to gain control and securities of uncertain value are offered for the 
rest of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner suggested that the action was taken at the behest of its strategic 
partners, such as regional telephone company U.S. West, and institutional 
shareholders, such as the California Public Employee Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 But CalPERS general counsel Rich Koppes said Time Warner executives broached 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was CalPERS who suggested the modified "chewable pill" that was 
enacted. Koppes described it as less stringent, allowing board members time to 
consider offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Seagram purchases, a strong overall stock market and the 
perception that entertainment and media stocks have soared in value, Time 
Warner shares have performed poorly recently. The stock has dropped from $44.25 
at year-end. It closed Thursday at $40 a share, up 87.5 cents, on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Seagram fell 12.5 cents to $29.625 a share on the NYSE.

DEALS: RECORD GIANTS SETTLE USED-CD ANTITRUST SUIT; MUSIC: MOM-AND-POP STORES 
WILL GET MILLIONS FOR WITHHELD AD SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The nation's four largest record corporations quietly resolved a high-profile 
antitrust case Thursday by agreeing to pay millions of dollars in advertising 
support withheld last year from hundreds of record store owners who sell used 
compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, members of the Independent Music Retailers Assn., which 
represents more than 300 mom-and-pop used-CD stores across the nation -- are 
expected to receive payment starting in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey-based group filed a class-action claim in August against the 
distribution arms of Sony Music, Warner Elektra Atlantic, EMI Music and MCA 
Music Entertainment Group, accusing the firms of conspiring to restrain trade 
and restrict the availability of secondhand CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for IMRA and the record companies confirmed the settlement 
Thursday but declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement does not include money for Wherehouse Entertainment, the 
Torrance-based, 340-outlet company that ignited the battle over secondhand disc 
sales 13 months ago when it became the first major chain to enter the used-CD 
market. Wherehouse, which filed a separate lawsuit against the same four record 
firms in August, has been separately reimbursed for lost advertising funds. 
</P>
<P>
 These settlements, however, will have no impact on the Federal Trade 
Commission's ongoing antitrust probe of Sony, WEA, EMI and MCA, which is 
exploring price-fixing allegations in the $5-billion market for new CDs. 
According to sources inside the government and record firms, that investigation 
is not expected to be completed before July. CHUCK PHILIPS

QUAKE COSTS HOTELS SOME BUSINESS

 Los Angeles area hotels have reported scattered room cancellations and 
postponed meetings in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 However, hotel and tourist officials expect business to return to normal 
levels by summer.In fact, many area hotels will be sold out this week with 
pre-booked meetings and the arrival of insurance adjusters, as well as 
residents whose homes were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we will lose business," hotel consultant Bruce Baltin at PKF 
Consulting said. "Occupancies in the first quarter should be lower. But by the 
summer, the economic impact will be over." 
</P>
<P>
 Marriott and Hilton hotels reported a relatively small number of room 
cancellations. However, the Beverly Hilton, for example, has been sold out with 
participants of a medical convention that began Tuesday. The Los Angeles 
Airport Marriott expects to be sold out next Saturday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are faring very well," Marriott spokeswoman Catherine Boire said. "We are 
seeing some insurance adjuster business, which is substantial." 
</P>
<P>
 But many visitors remain concerned. The California Gift Show said at least 70 
exhibitors have decided against participating in the trade show, which begins 
Saturday at the Los Angeles Convention Center. However, show general manager 
Jack Chalden said more than 2,000 exhibitors are still expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, several airlines have waived fees and penalties for passengers 
wanting to postpone their flights into and out of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 American and Continental airlines, for example, will give customers until 
Monday to reschedule flights without paying a fee.

Isuzu Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers have frowned and wondered why Honda -- manufacturer of the 
impeccable Accord, holder of enviable records for dealer efficiency and 
customer satisfaction -- would bet its reputations on bald rebadging of a 
product from less prominent, narrowly specialized Isuzu. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is that specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 Isuzu -- builder of the perky Amigo and up-market Trooper -- does trucks very, 
very well. It has a six-decade involvement in the building of buses and other 
commercial vehicles. The Isuzu Rodeo, first sold during the 1991 model year, is 
America's hottest selling sport-utility import. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda builds cars to levels of sophistication and reliability that are world 
standards. It does not do trucks. Last year, however, a survey of Hondarians 
revealed that more than 14% wanted a sport-utility as their next vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 With Japan's economic present slowing faster than disc brakes, Honda had 
neither time nor billions to burn on developing a 4x4 of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 So it contracted with Isuzu for an initial purchase of 20,000 robust Rodeos 
that would be brushed here, tickled there, rebadged and sold as the Honda 
Passport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good thing for us and a convenience for customers who can now buy a 
quality sport-utility without losing the relationship they enjoy with Honda 
dealerships," Honda spokesman Chris Marshall explains. "We have 1,000 dealers 
while Isuzu has only 300. . . . Without putting Isuzu down, that's the 
difference between driving 20 miles to an Isuzu dealer or driving only 10 miles 
to a Honda dealer." 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, it's a canny maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, by jumping the gun Honda may have shot itself in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 For no matter the badging, no matter the sleight of commerce and commercials 
trumpeting Honda's entrance into the truck market, the company is still selling 
a 4-year-old sport-utility that's on the downside of its design cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's Explorer is a perennial bestseller. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is only in 
its second season and recently earned a Best Buy listing from Consumer Guide. 
All are within the Passport/Rodeo price range. And let's not forget the 
Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Against that formidable combination comes Honda Passport, which will strain 
brand loyalty to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Base price of an Isuzu Rodeo S is $14,969 for the 2WD, five-door wagon with 
a 120-horsepower, four-cylinder engine. The base Passport DX is identical to 
the Rodeo S but sells for $700 more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Top of the Rodeo line is the LS 4WD with a 175-horsepower V-6 selling for 
$24,899. The halo Passport EX -- same old same-o as the Rodeo LS -- costs 
$1,700 more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Passport comes with Honda's three-year, 36,000-mile warranty. The Rodeo 
carries a tougher, three-year, 50,000-mile warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from a chromium "H" centered on the grille instead of "ISUZU," and a 
body-colored D-pillar for the Passport versus a contrasting color on the rear 
column of a Rodeo, there are no important differences between the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the 1994 Passport wears lines the Rodeo has been showing since 1991 
-- a squared-off, retro and aging interior that never rose above 
almost-handsome when it was fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that mechanically, from the pulling power of both engines, to 
suspension and handling that favors a passenger sedan ride, the rear-drive 
Rodeo always was one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those qualities are transferred to the Passport. So are standard anti-lock 
brakes, power steering even on base models, a 4,500-pound towing capacity, 
four-speed automatic with a tamer setting for winter slipperies, and 35 cubic 
feet of cargo space expanding to 74 cubic feet with rear seats folded down. 
</P>
<P>
 Space, back and front, is close to throne room. The sedan ride is not so mushy 
that the Passport becomes a wallowing fool off-road. High range is good in 
crumbling dirt or slush up to 50 m.p.h. In low, it could pull a small condo 
from a deep sinkhole. 
</P>
<P>
 Acceleration is respectable, and storage space with the rear seats down is 
almost six feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching modes to obtain four-wheel-drive, however, is an antediluvian pain 
in the gearbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most other sport-utilities, shifting is not on the fly. The Passport 
must be rolling at less than 5 m.p.h. before engaging 4WD. The only way to 
unhook 4WD is stop, reverse to disengage, then proceed in 2WD. 
</P>
<P>
 Rear access is equally awful. 
</P>
<P>
 First the spare wheel and vehicle-wide carrier must be unlatched and moved 
aside. Then the top window must be opened and raised. Now the rear tailgate can 
be pulled down and set flat. By this time you will have dropped two bags of 
groceries over your Nike Airs. 
</P>
<P>
 What these are, of course, are first edition flaws. Honda knows it. Isuzu has 
been listening to critics since 1991. And Isuzu is working on a second 
generation Rodeo that will address all shortcomings. Especially the shortage of 
air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, buying a Passport over a Rodeo remains an issue solely for those 
who examine labels before looking at the suit. 1994 Honda Passport EX

BIG APPLE DOESN'T GET L.A.'S APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's just another Big Apple disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 After a bone-chilling subway ride, I've put my nephew on a train to 
Philadelphia at Pennsylvania Station. Suddenly, clouds of smoke fill the huge 
waiting room. Hundreds of people begin coughing and racing for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
 As I push and shove my way to the door, I'm wedged up against a man in a black 
coat from Pakistan who holds a transistor radio to his ear. He's listening to 
the latest news from Los Angeles, and it isn't good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very bad quake," he mutters. "I have family there. No phone now." 
</P>
<P>
 With a final heave, the crowd bursts through the doors and we make it out to 
the sidewalk, where snow is falling and the wind chill is a spine-cracking 10 
below. Someone shouts that a train tunnel caught fire and people shrug their 
shoulders, forgetting it instantly. The man from Pakistan disappears in the 
confusion, his tiny radio blurting out reports from the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Gotham has been upstaged. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a kid growing up in Los Angeles, New York was the Big Bad City. The 
kind of place that scared you but also had a dark allure. Maybe it was because 
I played my recording of "West Side Story" too many times. Or because I was 
born in Manhattan and had heard so many stories about the glory days. Long 
before fright, blight and middle-class flight gave the town a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Los Angeles was paradise. Nobody liked smog, but nobody died from 
it, either. If you wanted apocalypse, you looked east to New York: Home of mad 
bombers, subway disasters, mind-boggling blackouts and the Kitty Genovese 
killing. New York was the media -- and disaster -- center of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. These days, Los Angeles and its biblical plagues take top billing. 
Indeed, those New Yorkers who pride themselves on their toughness and 
willingness to put up with anything have grudgingly yielded the crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the La-La jokes. People here who used to diss the coast aren't laughing 
now, because bad news from L.A. has been breaking into their TV broadcasts with 
alarming frequency. They've seen more live news about California disasters than 
they ever dreamed possible, and it's got them shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people threaten me, people who want to steal my money, and this 
rotten winter is no bargain," says Morris Spector, a longtime Brooklyn resident 
and New York cabby for more than 40 years. "But you can have L.A., pal. I've 
seen it all on TV. People gotta be nuts to live there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spector is not alone. Take Alex Almedina, the doorman at an Upper West Side 
apartment building. He's bundled up against the cold as a merciless wind 
whistles down the icy street. It's the worst winter in 10 years. Is he 
miserable? Next question. Would he trade places with an Angeleno? Get real. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got floods. You got fires. You got quakes," Almedina says, stamping his 
feet to keep warm. "Am I forgetting something? Oh yeah. You got riots. That's 
all we ever see these days. Crazy stuff on TV from L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 It began with the verdicts in the first Rodney King beating trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the L.A. riots broke out in 1992, New York went on alert. Not 
because racial tensions were boiling over, but because the social fabric had 
unraveled 3,000 miles away and people here were convinced that their city was 
next. It was all they could see on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Mayor David Dinkins implored New Yorkers to stay cool, and thousands 
responded by fleeing work early, anxious to avoid a riot that never happened. 
Using logic that only politicians understand, Dinkins claimed credit for this 
non-event, proudly telling voters that New York wasn't Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 They bounced him out of office last November, but even that story had to 
compete for attention with a California calamity. On Election Night, supporters 
of Rudy Giuliani jammed into a hotel ballroom for a victory party. Their eyes 
were glued to TV sets . . . all showing the Malibu fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaws dropped in disbelief. Even the most jaded reporters stopped what they 
were doing and clustered around TVs to watch the smoldering devastation as Los 
Angeles once again hijacked the news. New York voters had just unseated their 
first African American mayor after only one term -- the first time this had 
happened in a U.S. city -- yet the really big headlines were a continent away. 
</P>
<P>
 All night, local news anchors were yanked off the air in mid-sentence and 
replaced by KTLA's Stan Chambers, who brought the latest fire news to millions 
of startled viewers. As if Pacific Coast Highway were just down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think I'd ever visit that cockamamie state again?" asked my 
mother-in-law, who lives in New Jersey. "Thank goodness you kids left 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, she was more pragmatic: "Call your folks," she ordered, alerting me 
to the quake with an early morning call. "That is, if you can." 
</P>
<P>
 It's become a familiar drill: Turn on the TV. Watch L.A. burn. Call home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, I got through the first time and learned that my parents in 
Beverly-Fairfax were shaken but all right.  
</P>
<P>
 We're fine, some things were broken, but we're OK, they kept saying. They were 
lucky, and they knew it. And then they asked: What about that awful weather 
you've been having? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what about it? 
</P>
<P>
 At least 72 deaths have been blamed nationwide on the latest cold spell, and 
New York is gripped with an arctic chill. But the city has seen worse, and it 
isn't the end of the world. Meanwhile, we're watching the news from L.A. like 
everyone else. Wondering when it will all end, and if California will ever be 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us make endless calls to the coast, hearing the same terrible stories: 
A family that had to sleep in the car. A child nearly killed by a falling 
bookcase. The numbing litany of road closures and ruined stores. 
</P>
<P>
 After awhile, the trials and tribulations of New York pale in comparison. 
Sure, they're nightmarish and often heart-breaking. But they're distinctly 
human scale. They almost never summon up the specter of an angry god. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't wake up in the middle of the night, wondering if the earth is giving 
way. A lone tenement fire in the Bronx doesn't pose the epic danger of a blaze 
in Laurel Canyon. The biggest floods we see come from fire hydrants. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, most New Yorkers are chilly, hassled and uncomfortable. We're 
bundling up in the city that never sleeps . . . or rattles and rolls.

MAKEUP TESTS; FOR TEEN-AGE GIRLS, PLAYING WITH COSMETICS IS A RITE OF PASSAGE. 
MOMS ENDURE IT. DADS HATE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was a teen-ager, I had to buy orange-flavored Tangee lipstick and 
liquid black eyeliner on the sly and sneak it out of the house. I'd spend a 
good 20 minutes in the girls' bath room at school painting on the forbidden 
makeup. Twiggy lashes take time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the bus ride home, I'd scrape it all off with a dry tissue. My 
friends were doing the same thing, and it wasn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, makeup styles have lightened up since the high-contrast embalmed 
look of my day. So have many mothers' rules prohibiting makeup. But the 
practice of friends copying friends' makeup hasn't changed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 As it has gotten easier for girls making the transition to young womanhood to 
call attention to their metamorphosis, it has become makeup makers' mission to 
hook them early. After all, women tend to remain loyal to the brands of their 
youth. And Americans ages 12 to 19 spent $89 billion last year on products and 
services of all kinds, according to Teenage Research Unlimited of Northbrook, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Give a teen-age girl $50 and she'll buy jeans or sneakers; give her $15 and 
she'll spend it on CDs, tapes and cosmetics, reports Los Angeles-based Teen 
magazine, whose average reader is, demographically speaking, 15.4 years old. 
That first tube of Erase or Wet N' Wild lipstick is the seed that grows like 
Jack's beanstalk into a makeup collection overflowing drawers, cabinets and 
handbags. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers may be ready and willing to begin the cosmetic-enriched life -- 
dated by lipstick tubes -- but they can be a tough bunch to reach. Word of 
mouth carries much more weight than any advertising campaign, cosmetics makers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Kay aggressively courts the teen market through mother-daughter skin-care 
and make-over classes. "We also work with cheerleading camps, targeting opinion 
leaders," says Curran Dandurand, vice president of the Dallas-based cosmetics 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage girl talk about its products, Lancome plans to put trial-size 
packets of its Maquimat foundation in a spring issue of Seventeen magazine, 
whose pass-along rate (number of readers per copy) is higher than that of most 
other teen magazines, says Karen Young, vice president of the New York-based 
company. "(The foundation) is lightweight, fairly sheer, and the price is $20 
for an ounce. Plus it comes in a tube, which is perfect for a young market. A 
teen-age girl can try it and get a feel for the product." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers certainly like to feel the product. A 1991 Maybelline study found 
that girls apply lipstick 2.6 times a day, lip gloss 2.7 times, mascara 1.2 
times and blush 1.5 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't experiment with makeup when they are teens, they do really 
heinous things (later on) that look disturbing to people in their workplace," 
says B.J. Gillian, a makeup artist and spokesperson for Cover Girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lab work for perfecting a look happens in middle school, he notes. 
"In the past, people got it together and toned down their look by the first 
year of college. Now, most high school students have a lighter hand. The 
festive interpretations, the ones where they apply (makeup) with a trowel, are 
seen in junior high." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the many teen magazines currently endorsing the oxymoronic "natural makeup" 
look, at least one has the decency to point out that it takes as much work to 
create subtle style as it does a flagrant one. An article titled "The Naked 
Truth About the Natural Look" appears in the January issue of Seventeen, whose 
readers are mostly in their early teens. 
</P>
<P>
 But over at YM (Young & Modern), which also caters to girls barely into their 
double-digits, the text touts big, bright-red lips in "Lip Reading: What Your 
Lipstick Says About Your Personality." (A sample: "If you love tomato-red 
lipstick . . . you're adventurous, and you love experimenting with new trends 
and ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Like their peers elsewhere, Los Angeles-area teen-agers often wear as much 
lipstick on their orthodontia as they do on their lips. A look around any 
middle school will turn up fresh-faced girls who don't own makeup yet, those 
who own it but don't regularly wear it, and, of course, serious abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just trying to show off to their friends," says 11-year-old ("almost 
12") Dalia Regos, a sixth-grader at Paul Revere Middle School in Pacific 
Palisades, of peers who are a tad too liberal with the eye shadow. "They keep 
mirrors in their lockers and they put it on all day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If mothers don't approve, they may have only themselves to blame. Girls' first 
makeup often comes in a mother-daughter rite of passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalia's mother, Nancy Regos, allowed her daughter to start wearing makeup to 
school this year. "She doesn't use unusual amounts," Regos says, "and there are 
occasions when I ask her not to wear any, like when she sees her grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalia's personal stock of cosmetics -- lipsticks, eye shadows, clear and navy 
blue mascaras, and blush -- is a mix of hand-me-downs from mom and her own 
purchases. Even with that arsenal, she looks as if she spends more time playing 
with dolls than with cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Adina Brown, 11, inherited her first eye shadows and blush from her older 
sister. And her mom gave her a lipstick that was left in a car and melted. "I 
can't roll it up, but I can use my fingers to put it on," the Calabasas 
sixth-grader says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mothers not only pass along their old makeup but also buy new items for 
their daughters. Kim Clerx, 14, of Woodland Hills, occasionally wears Borghese 
cosmetics. "Lipstick and foundation. I asked my mom for some makeup and that's 
what she got me," she says. It's Kim's dad who sometimes disapproves of her 
lipstick, no matter the shade, she says: "(Fathers) don't want to see their 
babies growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Huettinger, 15, of Woodland Hills, drags her mom off to Thrifty, K mart 
or Target every three months to ante up $20 for Maybelline eye products, 
lipsticks and Cover Girl foundation. She exhibits a trait common among women: 
They stay true to their foundation and mascara. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what their age, women will absolutely not swap their foundation or 
mascara," says Young of Lancome. Color products such as eye shadows, nail 
polishes and blushers tend to be impulse buys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often see mothers and daughters together at the mid-priced Estee Lauder, 
Origins and M.A.C counters," says Jackie Kolla, cosmetic buyer for Nordstrom. 
"The moms are comfortable with their daughters wearing makeup, and they help 
them pick out colors and experiment. The girls' biggest concern seems to be 
skin care and covering blemishes; they are always interested in concealers or 
foundations." 
</P>
<P>
 M.A.C (Makeup Art Cosmetics) has a rabid teen-age following. What? Never heard 
of it? The line is sold in two eponymous Los Angeles stores and in Nordstrom. 
It's the cosmetic of choice on the set of "Beverly Hills, 90210." Gordon 
Espinet, senior technical trainer for M.A.C, says girls constantly stream into 
the stores asking, "What color did Tori (Spelling) wear on last night's show?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although M.A.C doesn't advertise, it's a hot item with the Alpha teens, a 
group of too-cool kids who signal trends for the Zandl Group, a New York City 
tracker of buying trends. "It's part of the teen collective, it's all word of 
mouth," Espinet says. 
</P>
<P>
 And the opinions of one's peers still mean the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to wear a really dark red lipstick, everyone was complaining -- my 
family, neighbors, my aunt and uncle. A baby cousin even asked what happened to 
my lips. That's when I changed to a lighter color," says Leyna Gravitt, 13, a 
Woodland Hills eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Leyna admits, had her best friend told her she was making a cosmetic 
misstep, she would have switched on the spot. "Rachel, I'd listen to Rachel," 
she says, throwing her arm around her dear friend.

 CONTRAPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Dirty Hat Tricks 
</P>
<P>
 So what if his Miami Dolphins baseball cap is as grimy as the underbelly of a 
Ford Mustang? Ryan Hurley, 13, of Anaheim, isn't about to send it through the 
washer and take a chance on a dislocated bill. Or worse, a detached sizing 
strap. "Besides," he reasons, "grunge is a fashion trend, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but not one we usually want to wear on our heads. So Dave Fortney and 
Hal Finney, two cap collectors from Laguna Niguel, developed a way to clean 
their hats. They created the Ball-Cap Buddy, a lobster trap-like plastic 
contraption that gently holds a cap's shape as it spins through the wash cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave saw that his hat was dirty and wanted to figure out a way to wash it 
without ruining it," explains Doug Bell, whose Sun Gear Marketing Co. in 
Anaheim placed the $4 product in Target, Sav-on and Wal-Mart. It can also be 
purchased via Sun Gear, (714) 693-7500. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Buddy has been tested to ensure it won't damage a standard 
washer, it also easily fits on the top shelf of a dishwasher, which generates 
less turbulence than the average Maytag. FADS 
</P>
<P>
 Shell Shocked 
</P>
<P>
 We may be sticking our necks out here, but it seems puka shells are back. Oh, 
come on, you remember those round, fingernail-size Hawaiian beads that 
mainlanders appropriated about 1975 and paired with Reyn Spooner floral shirts 
and OP corduroy shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 International Male featured the bleached shell beads in its spring catalogue. 
Garrett Locker, the clothing chain's catalogue buyer, says what started as a 
fluke may become a major statement. "It's part of a trend we call the South

 Stephen Sotnick, a Placentia-based jewelry maker and West Coast puka supplier, 
says his business has jumped 50% in the past six months, with orders from 
Millers Outpost and Nordstrom, among others. Incidentally, he says, most of the 
pukas come from the white sands of Mexico, not Hawaii. "Everyone seems to be 
interested in these things now, especially young men." 
</P>
<P>
 Sotnick's inventory includes necklaces, bracelets and pendants, many in new 
variations on the old theme. "We've had the most interest in puka's combined 
with African beads, penn shells, bleached clam shells and heishis (a rough, 
tortoise-like shell)."

 Could reverse-print aloha shirts, like the one from Pendleton shown here 
accompanying Sotnick's pukas, be far off? FITNESS

 A Dry Idea 
</P>
<P>
 If you love the idea of an aquatic workout but can't squeeze a lap pool in 
your apartment, rejoice. Stanford University's Richard Quick and Skip Kenney, 
who trained Olympic medalists Summer Sanders and Pablo Morales, and USC's Mark 
Shubert, who coached superstar Janet Evans, say the Vasa Swim Trainer can be 
just as effective as a cool dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by Williston, Vt.-based Rob Sleamaker, an exercise physiologist and 
author of "Serious Training for Serious Athletes," the $695 Vasa -- similar in 
size and shape to a rowing machine -- offers a multiple-muscle aerobic workout. 
Users such as triathlete Ray Browning (pictured) can practice a variety of 
strokes, but not kicking. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleamaker, a onetime director of sports medicine for the U.S. Biathlon team, 
believes using the Vasa may be even better than a pool workout. "It actually 
improves your swimming ability because it forces you to use the correct 
technique," he says. "For instance, if you drop your elbows when you swim, your 
hand changes pitch and you lose your grip on the water. . . . With the Vasa, 
you can actually see if you're dropping your elbows." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes such as Sanders, Morales and Evans use the Vasa to improve the 
strength of the triceps, lats, pectorals, rhomboids and deltoids. "(But) even 
if you are not an Olympic swimmer and want to develop your upper body, with one 
easy motion you can do it," Sleamaker says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vasa Swim Trainer is available through Competitive Aquatic Supply of 
Huntington Beach or by calling (800) 488-VASA. ACCESSORIES

 First Refusal 
</P>
<P>
 Ever wonder what happens to discarded license plates, bottle tops and 
punctured tire tubes after they've made their way to the landfill? Well, if 
Jorge Hansen and his wife and business partner, Suzanne Deputy-Hansen, 
intervene, such trash winds up at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who met in Los Angeles "sometime around Earth Day" but now live in 
Bowling Green, Ky., have found a way to reduce, reuse and recycle garbage into 
wearable art. Their company, Recycle Revolution, gets most of its materials for 
belts and backpacks from America's wastelands. Scavenging adventures have taken 
the couple to junk stores, through run-down gas stations, down alleys and old 
country roads, even to a few landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said to one another, 'Why create more materials, more fabrics when you can 
use what's already out there?' " recalls Hansen, who had studied architecture 
before discovering recycling. But it was Deputy-Hansen, a fashion designer, who 
seized on the notion of transforming common objects into new and useful items. 
</P>
<P>
 Eco-sensitive men bring in about 60% of the business, the Hansens say, noting 
that looks also play a big part in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can recognize the history of the product, what it was before," Hansen 
says. "We don't melt anything down to transform it." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple eventually plans to add vests and bustiers made from old 
parachutes, American flags and weathered flannel to their merchandise mix. 
"You'd be amazed what can be done with industrial straps, recycled canvas, 
rewoven cottons and other fabrics from factory waste," Hansen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycled Revolution's belts and bags sell for $39 to $150 at Nordstrom, 
Dungarees in Studio City, Jumping Dog at Santa Monica Place mall and Worn Out 
West in Los Angeles. SPORTSWEAR

 Hey, Jute 
</P>
<P>
 America loves cotton, and clothing makers say there's not always enough of it 
to go around. So they've turned to silk, lightweight wool, linen, flax, even 
hemp to satisfy the demand for natural fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Positano, a division of Los Angeles-based Magic Sportswear, is showing 
men's shirts, tunics, shorts, vests, trousers, blazers and overalls made out of 
a tightly woven fabric called jute. For the uninitiated, jute is a 
consumer-friendly name for burlap, the durable cloth farmers sometimes use to 
tote potatoes and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Ofer Kashanian, who started Positano with brother Eitan and partner Michael 
Schobert, believes that burlap's time has come, "because of all this interest 
in earthy, natural fibers and colors." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time local designers have experimented with utilitarian 
fabrics. Back in 1986, entrepreneur Michael Carr had a company called French 
Fryzz that sold surgical shirts, shorts and pull-on pants made from printed 
cotton rice bags and burlap potato sacks. It folded the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that point, burlap, which is itchy and tends to shed, was portrayed as a 
joke in the fashion world. (Remember Lucy and Ethel in Paris cajoling their 
husbands into buying them designer dresses, only to end up wearing burlap 
ensembles created by Ricky and Fred?) 
</P>
<P>
 Burlap has a better image now, Kashanian says, noting that modern technology 
can make the fabric soft. He describes Positano's burlap, or jute, sportswear, 
priced from $32 to $65 and available in shades of mocha and indigo blue as well 
as natural, as "a step beyond grunge but on a level that a more sophisticated, 
contemporary customer will understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Positano's collection of burlap will reach stores in March. For more 
information, call (213) 892-0801.

ROCK'S HALL OF FAMERS TAME THE NIGHT; ALL ARE POLITE AT THE NINTH CEREMONY; 
EVEN THE JAM MINIMIZES PREVIOUS CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA ROBBINS, NEWSDAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul McCartney read a fond letter to John Lennon. Bono riffed a poem of 
freedom and solidarity about reggae great Bob Marley. Bruce Springsteen and Axl 
Rose came together to sing the Beatles' "Come Together." Eric Clapton, who 
admitted that he traveled to Woodstock in the late '60s hoping to join the 
Band, got his wish by singing and playing guitar on a rousing grand finale of 
"The Weight." Bruce Hornsby talked about being a teen-age Deadhead and an adult 
member of the Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, a relatively uneventful year in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth annual ceremony, relocated to Manhattan after 1993's sojourn in Los 
Angeles, was a smoothly run cavalcade of stars. Like the middle-aged veterans 
it celebrates, the gala was tame and polite. Even the jam session that ended 
the four-hour extravaganza after midnight was organized to diminish the chaos 
of pre-'93 years: Each song featured a different agglomeration of players and 
singers, avoiding past displays of everyone-in-the-pool sonic confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was jammed with celebs, including Kings hockey star 
Wayne Gretzky, QVC mogul Barry Diller, RuPaul, Phil Spector and U2. But the 
ceremony was just as notable for its absences. Of the 10 awards, three were 
made posthumously, to Bob Marley, John Lennon and Willie Dixon. For various 
other reasons, ranging from the Los Angeles earthquake to overseas commitments, 
Rod Stewart, Eric Burdon of the Animals, Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead and 
Levon Helm of the Band were not present.  
</P>
<P>
 Elton John accepted his statuette from Guns N' Roses leader Axl Rose, who 
characterized the flamboyant pop star as his greatest inspiration. Twang guitar 
star Duane Eddy got his from Foreigner's Mick Jones (subbing for an absent John 
Fogerty). Enough members of the Band, the Dead and the Animals were there to 
make it all seem right and proper -- maybe a bit too right and proper: The 
sight of the Grateful Dead in tuxedos was an unexpected culture shock. But 
there was a diminished sense of the majesty that usually attends music's most 
honorific night. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Jeff Beck provided the first sparks of the evening, both as a 
musician and with a comically wry presentation speech for Stewart. Backed by 
keyboardist Paul Shaffer's group, Beck played a soaring rendition of Curtis 
Mayfield's "People Get Ready" and then, after a short film recapping Stewart's 
career, fondly teased his old bandmate, for whom he also accepted the award. 
"People say we have a love-hate relationship," Beck quipped. "It's true. He 
loves me and I hate him." 
</P>
<P>
 Largely misunderstood throughout his 50-year career, R&B legend Johnny Otis 
was inducted as a "non-performer" by Hall of Famer Etta James; Chuck Berry, a 
1986 inductee, did the honors for the late Willie Dixon, the bassist, 
songwriter and producer who shaped Chess Records' blues and R&B sound in the 
'50s. "He was on the first 20 records I recorded," recalled Berry. "He made me 
what I am, the basis of my music." 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of debt to African American music wove throughout the evening. 
Clapton praised the all-white Band's sense of "black music," Elton John cited 
such artists as Ray Charles and Little Richard, alongside Jerry Lee Lewis and 
George Shearing, as formative influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum, on hand to induct the Animals, praised the English 
group as "the key link in the transition from black R&B and punk rock." Even 
Paul McCartney, in the touching details of his fond Lennon reminiscence, 
mentioned the Beatles' early days playing the Cavern Club in Liverpool. "It was 
officially a blues club," he said. "So we told 'em (the Everly Brothers') 'Wake 
Up Little Susie' was by (American bluesman) Big Bill Broonzy." In a related 
vein, Bono called Bob Marley "Dr. King in dreads." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoko Ono, accompanied by her son Sean Lennon, accepted the honor for her late 
husband. Moments later, in a backstage press room, McCartney spoke lovingly of 
his old friend as "a beautiful person, a serious dude" and joked that had 
Lennon been at the ceremony, he would have heckled it. Standing with Ono and 
the young Lennon, McCartney downplayed the recently announced Beatles reunion. 
"We're doing this TV documentary, and we thought we'd try and do some 
incidental music. For old time's sake we're going to give it a whirl. We're not 
trying to better the Beatles." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's only genuine surprise came when Elton John said, "I feel like 
I'm cheating up here." He then called his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin 
onstage and handed him the award; this emotional display brought the Grand 
Ballroom to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 After the speeches, the program switched to live music, beginning with a 
lengthy rendition of Dixon's "Wang Dang Doodle," performed by Chuck Berry, the 
Dead, John Popper of Blues Traveler on harmonica and Dixon's daughter, Shirli, 
on lead vocals. Berry then geared the company into a more compact "Roll Over 
Beethoven." That was followed by "One Love," the Bob Marley classic sung by his 
widow, Rita, along with assorted Wailers, Marley offspring, Bono and Whoopi 
Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Elton John and McCartney were scheduled to perform the Beatles' "Come 
Together," Springsteen and Rose appeared instead, trading verses on a 
respectably tight version of the song. But Chuck Berry, on whose music the tune 
was based, was -- typical of the night -- missing from the action.

'I'LL DO ANYTHING': TERMS OF ENDUREMENT; MOVIES: JAMES L. BROOKS' FILM, REVISED 
FROM MUSICAL TO ROMANTIC COMEDY AFTER A TEST SCREENING, HAS SECURED A PLACE IN 
HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Writer-director James L. Brooks' "I'll Do Anything" drew a lot of unwanted 
attention last summer when people recruited for a test screening said some of 
the musical numbers, performed by actors not known for their voices, stopped 
the action cold. Drastically revising his movie, Brooks took most of the music 
out, and audiences responded more favorably. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Brooks was determined to make a musical about Hollywood. So he tried 
again -- this time using voice-over renditions of songs by Prince and Sinead 
O'Connor. That version pleased him least of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lesser version of the thing I couldn't win acceptance for and that 
didn't work," the 53-year-old director said recently over a lunch of tuna 
carpaccio. "I'm glad I got off that horse." In late November, eight songs 
commissioned for the movie -- all except for one Carole King number performed 
by then-5-year-old Whittni Wright -- were removed for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens at the box office after "I'll Do Anything" hits the screens 
next month, the musical-turned-romantic-comedy, starring Nick Nolte and Albert 
Brooks, has already secured a place in film history. The director himself 
cannot recall another instance in modern filmmaking when a major studio movie 
that started life in one form metamorphosed into another. 
</P>
<P>
 Though battle-scarred from his ordeal, Brooks, who also wrote and directed the 
Academy Award-winning "Terms of Endearment" (1983) and the Oscar-nominated 
"Broadcast News" (1987), is finally as much at peace as this complicated, 
emotionally turbulent man with a movie about to open may ever be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture we're releasing is my film," he said. "It's startlingly different 
in terms I never would have imagined in a million years. . . . But I don't 
think there's anybody who's made pictures who didn't end up doing something at 
the end that they couldn't imagine doing at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which Brooks -- also its co-producer -- estimates cost just under 
$43 million -- is being closely monitored throughout the movie industry not 
only because of this unprecedented transformation but also because it is the 
first release this year from Columbia Pictures, which is trying to recover from 
a dismal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he could offer no breakdown of how much the musical numbers added to 
the movie's cost, Brooks admits that taking them out was expensive; the film 
was originally budgeted at $35 million, according to a knowledgeable source. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Anything," Nolte plays Matt Hobbs, a character actor who suddenly finds 
himself forced to take care of his troubled young daughter, Jeannie (Wright). 
Unable to land a movie role with producer Burke Adler (Brooks), he takes a job 
as Adler's driver. Self-centered and arrogant, the producer begins a 
relationship with Nan Mulhanney (Julie Kavner), an outspoken woman who, to the 
amusement of preview audiences at earlier incarnations of Brooks' movie, runs a 
company that administers test screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many movie directors are scornful of research screenings, but Brooks, who 
began his career in television ("The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "Lou Grant"), 
is a staunch believer in the process, though he maintains it is just one of a 
number of influences on his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nobody who's ever gone to one of these screenings who doesn't feel 
differently about the picture after watching it with an audience," he said. 
"They'll tell you when it's funny, and you'll know when it's confusing and when 
it's slow." He held seven research screenings each for the two other movies he 
directed and six for "Anything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the controversy about "Anything" focused mainly on the musical numbers, 
the director himself also had another major concern. Test audiences kept doing 
flip-flops on the character of Cathy Breslow (Joely Richardson), a movie 
development executive who gets involved with Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing his screenplay, Brooks said, his own view of Breslow became more 
complex as he began to see her as a metaphor for his feelings about Hollywood. 
As a result, he did not want audiences either to forgive her failings or resent 
her so much that they could not see why Hobbs would be attracted to her. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve the "delicate balance" he was after, Brooks, who normally does the 
bulk of his reshaping in the editing room rather than by rewriting and 
reshooting scenes, eventually had to go back to the word processor. These and 
other changes necessitated three days of reshooting in mid-December -- a 
surprisingly small number, considering the film's permutations. But the 
director said he worked frenetically, cramming six days' work into three. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks had wanted "Anything" to be a musical for the sake of what he describes 
as "emotional resonance." Once the music was gone, he felt he needed to restore 
what now seemed to him a missing element. "Every scene I went back and did (in 
reshooting) was designed to put back some of the emotion that I believed I was 
getting from the (deleted) song," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the emotion revolves around the struggle faced by actors like the 
Nolte character. "Matt Hobbs is a decent guy," Brooks said. "He lives in a 
place where that's special. In the best of all worlds, that's not special at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 That rather unflattering view of the entertainment industry permeates 
"Anything," although his movie is scarcely a scathing attack like "The Player" 
(1992) or "S.O.B." (1981). Still it seems fair to ask why Brooks is biting the 
hand that has fed him so well. For the first time in a lengthy conversation, 
his voice rises in protest. "This is not about me saying, 'Look at these 
terrible people in my life,' " he said. "This is me looking at my life." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Albert Brooks character, though reportedly inspired by producer 
Joel Silver ("Lethal Weapon"), actually represents one facet of James Brooks, 
whose producing credits include "Big" (1988) and "The War of the Roses" (1989). 
Unlike his fictional producer, Brooks is generally revered by actors who have 
worked with him. Yet he said: "It just knocks me out when people say Burke is 
based on somebody because I think Burke is the worst in any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood is also the subject of Brooks' other new project, "The Critic," an 
animated series featuring Jon Lovett as the voice of the title character. The 
show, teaming Brooks once again with Jean and Mike Reiss, the producers he 
worked with in developing "The Simpsons," debuts Wednesday on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has no other plans for now, but at some point hopes to revive the 
discarded musical numbers from "I'll Do Anything," although he refuses to make 
them public at this point. Danny DeVito has offered to help him tell the story 
of the movie's evolution on laser disc. Someone -- he won't say who -- has 
approached him about adapting the movie as a stage musical. 
</P>
<P>
 At its root, he insists, "I'll Do Anything" is still the picture he wanted to 
make. "The characters never changed. What the picture wants to say never 
changed, and it's as honest as I know how to make it," he said. "The characters 
live for me, and I could write more about any of them."

 Piles of broken drinking glasses, liquor and wine bottles strewn 
helter-skelter at the foot of the bar, heaps of smashed dinnerware in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes like this were typical of the damage suffered by Los Angeles-area jazz 
clubs as a result of Monday's earthquake. Almost all of the clubs closed Monday 
through Wednesday, then reopened Thursday. "People want to get away from it all 
and go out," said Betty Borian hostess of Chadney's in Burbank. Here's a 
rundown of the situations at some of the area's jazz nightspots and their 
lineups for tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catalina Bar & Grill: "We had a little damage, a broken pipe -- which has been 
fixed -- and some glasses and bottles," said Bob Popescu, owner of the 
Hollywood club, who estimated the damage at a few thousand dollars. Tonight 
through Sunday: Pharoah Sanders. (213) 466-2210. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz Bakery: "A lot of bottles of Perrier broke, some speakers fell and a 
heavily framed photograph fell down between the sound mixer and piano. That 
could have been a disaster but wasn't," said Ruth Price, who runs the Culver 
City venue. On tap tonight: guitarist Tommy Tedesco; Saturday, it's pianist 
Pete Jolly's trio. (310) 271-9039. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chadney's: "It was quite a mess on Monday, but we're all right," said Dennis 
Duke, who books the Burbank eatery-nightspot. "Lots of plates broken in the 
kitchen, and lots of wine glasses, too, but we're open." Jack Sheldon performs 
tonight, John Bolivar on Saturday. (818) 843-5333. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Room Upstairs at Le Cafe: "The kitchen and the bar area were disasters," 
said owner Dale Jaffe of the Sherman Oaks nightspot. "We lost 90% of our 
glassware, dinnerware and wine and liquor. In the Room Upstairs, we had some 
damage to the mixing console, but we're operating, at least in some capacity." 
Jaffe estimated his damages at between $25,000 and $30,000. Appearing tonight 
and Saturday is guitarist-composer Dori Caymmi; on Sunday, it's bassist Jeff 
Berlin. (818) 986-2662. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Club Brasserie, in the Bel Age Hotel, West Hollywood: "Nothing happened here," 
says guitarist Sid Jacobs, who books the room. "We were open as of Tuesday. We 
had to accommodate the people in the hotel, and the curfew violators." Tonight 
and Saturday: New York-based drummer Gerry Gibbs' quartet. (310) 854-1111. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vine Street Bar & Grill, Hollywood: "We've survived amazingly well," said 
owner Ron Berenstein. "A few drinking glasses were broken and one bottle of 
liquor. The biggest problem to me is the current events: everybody else's 
problems." Performing tonight and Saturday will be Hadda Brooks. (213) 
463-4375. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baked Potato, North Hollywood: "We're all right," says Potato owner-pianist 
Don Randi. "We had a lot of broken glasses, and some of the ceiling came down, 
but it's nothing that can't be fixed." Randi estimated the damage at $3,000. On 
tap tonight: Burning Water, with Randi performing Saturday. "Well, at least we 
can still play the blues," Randi quips. (818) 980-1615. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Legends of Hollywood: "We had two broken windows, and some ceiling panels fell 
down," said Bob Marks, the drummer-singer who owns the jazz joint-delicatessen. 
Legends spotlights the blues band Fever tonight and recent New York arrival, 
tenorist Dave Jensen, Saturday. (213) 464-7780. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 La Ve Lee: "We're fine," said Eddie Arbi, owner of the Studio City nightspot. 
Arbi, who estimated his damages at $5,000, said he lost liquor, wine and 
glassware. Appearing tonight, Abraham Laboreil; on Saturday, it's Poncho 
Sanchez. (818) 980-8158. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Monteleone's West in Tarzana, (818) 996-0662; J.P.'s Money Tree in Toluca 
Lake, (818) 769-8800, and J.P.'s Lounge in North Hollywood, (818) 845-1800, all 
sustained moderate damage but were able to open by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A few other clubs that suffered little or no damage: Lunaria, Baked Potato 
Pasadena, Nucleus Nuance, Jax, St. Mark's, Atlas Bar & Grill and the Strand. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Mel Torme postponed his performance Wednesday at Ambassador Auditorium. 
A new date has not yet been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choices: Fiery New York-based drummer Gerry Gibbs is ensconced at the 
Club Brasserie with a pair of dashing quartets. Tonight and Saturday, he's 
surrounded by an equally incendiary threesome: saxman Ravi Coltrane, 
keyboardist Billy Childs and bassist Andy Simpkins. On Jan. 27-29, Patrice 
Rushen replaces Childs. . . . Another New Yorker, tenorist Walt Weiskopf, makes 
his L.A. club debut at the Brasserie, leading a bracing sextet Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Weiskopf, whose latest album is "Simplicity" (Criss Cross), states 
seemingly familiar themes and ideas in striking, sometimes singular ways.

O.C. FIRMS MAKE DREAM HOUSE OF 1994 COME TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to home building and design, some of the industry's most 
innovative companies are in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems to be the opinion of the National Assn. of Home Builders, a trade 
group that selected a team of mostly Orange County builders and architects to 
construct its annual dream home, which showcases the latest in design and 
construction trends. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.9-million luxury home goes on display today as part of the group's 
annual conference in Las Vegas. Five Orange County firms were picked for the 
seven-member building team. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the "1994 New American Home," the 5,200-square-foot house is 12 miles 
outside of the nation's gaming capital and features recyclable materials, such 
as recycled steel studs and special Styrofoam blocks into which concrete is 
poured. The Styrofoam is made from recycled plastics. 
</P>
<P>
 The single-story house has modern design elements, such as a state-of-the-art 
media room, a separate living area for 20-somethings who return home for 
extended periods of time, and spaces where family members can be alone but not 
isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything innovative has always come out of California," said Andrew 
Youngquist, president of Birtcher Construction Ltd. in Laguna Niguel, the 
contractor that built the home. "I think the heavy presence of Orange County 
firms on the team shows that our architects and builders are on the cutting 
edge of design trends. We try things here before anyone else does." 
</P>
<P>
 Targeted for an affluent couple in their 30s or 40s with one child living at 
home and an adult child, parent or grandparent who visits occasionally, the 
home has a dramatic entryway and it wraps around an outdoor central courtyard 
that features a fireplace. With five bedrooms and four baths, the home was 
constructed of mostly concrete and steel with lots of glass blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Orange County companies that worked on the dream house are: Birtcher 
Construction; Land Concern Ltd., a Santa Ana landscape architect; McLarand 
Vasquez and Partners, a Costa Mesa architecture firm; Carole Eichen Interiors, 
a Santa Ana interior designer; and Residential Concept Inc., a Lake Forest 
product development company.  
</P>
<P>
 A Las Vegas home builder, Heartland Homes, was the project builder and Kulli 
Marketing of Malibu was the marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting, because I think Orange County tends to lead the new housing 
styles for most of the nation," said Ernesto Vasquez, the architect on the 
project. "We were asked to look at '90s trends. So we looked at the home having 
more flexibility, where rooms can change as the family grows and stays in the 
home a lot longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said the home is a 1990s "wake-up call" to builders, who need to focus 
on building components that can be recycled, energy-efficient materials and 
more flexibility in the living spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Eichen, who founded her company 28 years ago, said the model home is 
built for entertaining and that it showcases the latest in upscale design 
trends. One special feature, she said, were rooms like the bedroom that easily 
allow two people to do separate activities, such as watch television and read. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've created a word for this," Eichen said. "Instead of lifestyles, we need 
life spaces -- individual rooms to give us private space and security in this 
stressful world. The family does not need to be together in every room, we need 
to have quiet and peace." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the master bedroom is designed with a fireplace and glass shelf 
dividers that separate the media area from a reading area. A small kitchen is 
also included. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, the couple can be in the same room but not in the same room," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In designing the home's front and back yards, Land Concern used 
drought-tolerant plants indigenous to the Las Vegas area. The house is also 
designed for indoor-outdoor entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the house to flow from the inside out," said Jim Hanke, assistant 
project manager for Land Concern. "California, especially Southern California, 
has led in the design of houses with strong indoor-outdoor space flow, and this 
house reflects that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the landscaping is also designed to give the home a real sense of 
place, by using local colors found in nature in the stone and plants 
surrounding the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pulled out the colors you can see in the mountain range behind the house, 
and used those terra-cotta, burgundy and deep red colors in the landscaping."

INTERLINK DATA'S GARTNER HELD ON CONTEMPT ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Gartner, former president of an Orange County company accused of 
defrauding 450 investors of more than $10 million, was arrested in Washington 
state on contempt charges by the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents arrested Gartner on Wednesday in Blaine, Wash., as he was crossing the 
Canadian border into the United States, said David Schindler, an assistant U.S. 
attorney in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge in Los Angeles issued an arrest warrant for Gartner last fall 
after he failed to account for or repay money raised from investors in his 
Costa Mesa-based company, Interlink Data Network of Los Angeles Inc., 
Securities and Exchange Commission officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, has denied any 
wrongdoing in the past and said he has tried to comply with court orders for 
financial disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Robert C. Rosen of Lewis, d'Amato, Brisbois & Bisgaard in Los 
Angeles, called the contempt order "overzealous prosecution" that violated 
Gartner's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC sued Gartner and three companies he controlled last July and won a 
$12.3-million default judgment. Gartner told investors that his company planned 
to build a fiber-optic network that would link 140 downtown Los Angeles 
buildings in a futuristic videophone network. The network was never built, 
according to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is an illegal and overzealous order," Rosen said. "He has to 
choose between putting up $30,000 (in reimbursement) or have his deposition 
taken even though he has taken the Fifth Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has filed financial disclosures that show he cannot pay the money," Rosen 
said. "There is no such thing as a debtor's prison in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials could not be reached for comment Thursday. No criminal charges 
have been filed against Gartner. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner was being held Thursday by the U.S. marshal in Seattle until he could 
be transferred to Los Angeles for a hearing on the contempt of court charges, 
said Jack Tate, a spokesman for the U.S. marshal's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Manuel Real in Los Angeles held Gartner in contempt in August for 
violating an order freezing all assets of Interlink Data Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner once lived in a $3.8-million home in San Juan Capistrano and was 
making $20,000 monthly rent payments with investor money, the SEC alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as U.S. marshals began seizing his assets last fall, Gartner 
continued to spend money and dispose of assets, the SEC said, and a warrant for 
his arrest was issued in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ordered Gartner to either repay $30,000 in investor funds or provide 
financial records showing that he was not using money raised from investors and 
that he could not afford to repay the money.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: SHARES OF AST HIT A 52-WEEK HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of AST Research Inc. hit a 52-week high Thursday as the company 
reported sales and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations and 
reflected a surge in overall demand for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based PC manufacturer reported net income of $17.9 million for the 
second fiscal quarter ended Jan. 1, up 23% from $14.6 million a year earlier. 
Earnings per share were 54 cents for the quarter, compared to 46 cents a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consumer market is becoming a bigger part of our market, and so a bigger 
portion of our sales is coming from Christmas purchases," said Safi Qureshey, 
chairman and chief executive of AST. 
</P>
<P>
 After rising to a 52-week peak of $29.50 Thursday afternoon, AST shares fell 
back to $29.12, up 17.6% in heavy Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales bounded 95% to $677 million from $346 million a year earlier, thanks in 
large part to strong holiday sales and added revenue from AST's $105-million 
acquisition of the computer manufacturing assets of Tandy Corp. in Fort Worth 
last July. The acquisition made AST into the fourth-largest PC maker in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a great quarter, with sales and earnings above expectations. It 
seems as if they are doing the right things toward integrating the two 
companies together," said Todd Bakar, analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, an 
investment bank in San Francisco. "They're fortunate that the overall demand in 
the industry is strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakar noted that AST's net profit margin was 2.6% of sales for the quarter, 
down from 4.2% a year ago but significantly improved from the first fiscal 
quarter of 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry price war has subsided because of growing demand for new products 
such as portable computers and multimedia computers, those that combine the 
features of computers, compact disc players and TVs, Bakar said. AST's North 
American sales rose 123% to $451 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no desire to sell a $295 computer in our industry," Qureshey said. 
"But we are trying to pack the most functionality into a computer at key prices 
like $995 or $1,995." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that AST and other large players such as IBM and Compaq are 
taking market share from smaller companies because customers are choosing brand 
names as there is little difference in price between them and the so-called 
clones. 
</P>
<P>
 AST said it shipped 420,000 PCs in the second fiscal quarter, a 116% increase 
over a year ago. The total included more than 72,000 notebook systems, or 
portable computers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Qureshey said he was frustrated that the company's long-awaited 
sub-notebook computer, one that weighs under five pounds, has been delayed at 
least one quarter until mid-1994 because of component shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 AST is in the process of laying off 650 employees in Orange County and 
shifting production of some computers to the newly acquired Tandy plants in 
Texas. Qureshey declined to comment on trade news reports that AST had landed a 
deal to use its Fountain Valley plant to produce portable computers for 
Austin-based Dell Computer Corp., which scrapped its product line last year.

TAKECARE INC. STOCK SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betting on a bidding war regarding TakeCare Inc., a health maintenance 
organization that recently agreed to merge with FHP International Inc. in 
Fountain Valley, investors flocked to the company Thursday, driving its stock 
up 4.5%.Shares of Concord-based TakeCare traded at 100 times its normal volume 
Thursday, which followed an announcement that a group of disgruntled 
shareholders are suing TakeCare for agreeing to be bought out by FHP, when 
another offer by a Minnesota company was more lucrative. TakeCare stock closed 
$63.25 a share on the Nasdaq market, up $2.75 a share from Wednesday. FHP stock 
closed at $28.75 on Nasdaq trading, down 25 cents.

2 COUNTY HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS TO BUY OTHER FIRMS; MEDICINE: ACQUISITIONS BY 
PACIFICARE AND ABBEY HEALTHCARE ARE PART OF A TREND SPURRED BY WHITE HOUSE 
REFORM PLANS. 
</P>

<P>
 The wave of health-care mergers that has shaken up the industry in recent 
years continued unabated Thursday as two Orange County companies announced 
separate acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. said it has agreed to pay $12 million in cash and 
an unspecified amount of stock to acquire a Boston company that will help the 
Costa Mesa firm push its health-care products and services throughout the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 And PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in Cypress said it has agreed to buy a 
small Seattle company for an undisclosed sum to help it expand its business in 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies already are among a group of health-care firms that have been 
on a buying binge as they jockey to take advantage of benefits that the health 
care industry expects under proposed Clinton Administration reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, PacifiCare picked up California Dental Health Plan, a dental HMO, 
for $20 million. Abbey bought Total Pharmaceutical Care for $195 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Their latest acquisitions come only a week after FHP International Corp. in 
Fountain Valley said it would buy a competing health maintenance organization 
in Northern California in a blockbuster deal worth $829 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Wellpoint Health Networks Inc., a Woodland Hills HMO, said 
Thursday that it has completed its $154-million purchase of UniCare Financial 
Corp., an Irvine workers' compensation company. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare, which already has operations in Washington, hopes that its 
purchase of 13-year-old Preferred Health Resources Inc. will give it a strong 
presence in the Seattle market, especially among elderly members. Preferred has 
13,000 senior citizens among its 72,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has passed its own health-care reform package, which we believe is 
going to expand the marketplace for managed health care over the next few 
years," said Alan Hoops, PacifiCare's president. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare, with earnings of $63 million on revenue of $2.2 billion last year, 
is expected to reveal more details about the deal later. Preferred, a privately 
held HMO, earned more than $1 million on revenue of $80 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey Healthcare will step into the field of home nursing services with its 
planned purchase of Protocare Inc. in Boston, said Susan J. Turkell, an Abbey 
spokeswoman. Protocare provides nursing services from 16 locations on the East 
Coast, mostly in New England. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition also will help Abbey expand in the New England market, which 
it entered with its purchase of Total Pharmaceutical. It also makes Abbey the 
nation's largest distribution network of home health-care products and services 
with 229 branches in 45 states. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase of Protocare is subject to a number of conditions, including the 
approval of Protocare's shareholders and various regulatory agencies. Abbey 
said it hopes to close the deal by the end of March.

 Troubled Bank of Newport sued its longtime former president Thursday, alleging 
that he and his wife used expense accounts over five years to help them live 
the good life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach bank charged that Ronald L. and Verna Rodgers picked up more 
than $335,000 for expenses that were "unauthorized personal indulgences and 
acquisitions."The suit did not detail what the couple purchased, and the bank's 
lawyer, Ronald Rus of Irvine, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Rodgers, who helped found the bank in 1972, resigned under pressure 
last March when federal regulators criticized directors when they became 
alarmed about the bank's continued losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1992, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued a wake-up call to 
directors in the form of a cease-and-desist order, its most severe directive. 
The FDIC said directors were not paying enough attention to what management was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's lawsuit contends that Rodgers "orchestrated a scheme" with his 
secretary, Verna Johnson, whom he married in 1992, to conceal the charges for 
personal gifts among legitimate expenditures on his expense account. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Rodgers already has acknowledged that he and his wife 
owe $22,000 for unauthorized expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Rodgers nor his lawyer could be reached Thursday for comment.

BORDERS BOOKSTORE WILL DEBUT AT NEW MISSION VIEJO MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Borders Inc., a national chain of book and music super-stores owned by Kmart 
Corp., will open its first store in Orange County, possibly as early as 
midsummer, the Mission Viejo Co. said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, whose mega-bookstores are popular in other areas of the nation for 
their vast selection, homey feel and in-store coffee bar, has closed escrow on 
land for a 30,000-square-foot store in a new Mission Viejo mall, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real thrilled," said Steve Delson, executive vice president of sales at 
the Mission Viejo Co. "They picked the site because of our center's location 
right near the freeway and because of the growing population in south Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction could start in about two months on Borders Books & Music, which 
typically features natural-wood bookshelves, corner sofas and armchairs where 
browsers can read, and a coffee bar where customers can play chess and other 
board games. Sometimes live music is featured. Delson said the Orange County 
store will have a large selection of music titles -- focusing on jazz and 
classical -- and a play area and theater for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Borders, which is based in Ann Arbor, Mich., announced that it 
would build its first California store on 45,000 square feet in West Los 
Angeles. Borders has about 50 stores nationwide, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a great market for books in Mission Viejo. Books are something that 
always sell," said Jillian Moreno, spokeswoman for Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will be one of several tenants in the new 290,000-square-foot 
open-air Mission Viejo Freeway Center, located at Interstate 5 just south of La 
Paz Road in Mission Viejo, Delson said. The site plan was approved by the city 
last year. With 65% of the center's property already sold, the mall is expected 
to be completed by the spring of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Mission Viejo has really fast-tracked the processing for all 
these retailers," Delson said. "It changed these users' impression of doing 
business in California." 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, the Mission Viejo Co. had explored putting an auto mall on the 
site but opted for a retail center instead. The site is within the city of 
Mission Viejo's redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Mission Viejo Co. said, it recently closed escrow on a deal 
with Linens 'n Things Inc., a national retailer based in Clifton, N.J. That 
company, which has more than 140 stores nationwide, purchased land for a 
36,000-square-foot store in the center. And Best Buy Electronics Inc., a 
Minnesota-based retailer, bought land for a 40,000-square-foot store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo location will be the first in Southern California for Linens 
'n Things. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, New Jersey-based Toys R Us has purchased land for a 
45,000-square-foot store, and Sportmart Inc., a Chicago-based retailer with 42 
stores nationwide, bought land for a 42,000-square-foot store in the new mall, 
according to the Mission Viejo Co.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: WESTERN FINANCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The holding company for Western Financial Savings Bank said it earned $3.5 
million in the fourth quarter, or 15 cents a share, contrasted with a loss of 
$8.1 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Financial said earnings for the year were $12.9 million, 65 cents a 
share, compared to profit of $2.3 million, 13 cents a share, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said earnings increased because it wrote more home and consumer loans 
during the year. The bank originated $512 million worth of loans in the fourth 
quarter, compared to $309 million in fourth-quarter 1992 -- a 65% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the bank said, it wrote better loans this year, too. Loans delinquent two 
months or more were 1.53% of all loans at the end of the year, compared to 
2.67% at the end of 1992. The bank had $75 million worth of bad loans at the 
end of the year, compared to $102 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The holding company had assets of $2.2 billion at the end of the year, down 
from $2.5 billion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: The company said it had stepped up the selling of its mortgages in 
the secondary market and the sale of consumer loans -- mostly auto loans -- on 
Wall Street. Western Financial is the fourth-largest in the nation as a 
packager of auto loans into securities for sale to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Deposits declined to $1.4 billion, compared to $1.7 billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Financial Savings Bank operates 26 branches and 29 loan offices around 
California. MICHAEL FLAGG

 PPG Industries Inc., a Pittsburgh glass and resin maker, said Thursday that 
its annual profit plummeted 21% as it took a $44.2-million charge because of a 
pending sale of its biomedical division to Irvine-based Enhanced Imaging 
Technologies Inc. PPG announced last month that it was selling its biomedical 
systems division to Enhanced Imaging for $55 million. That deal is expected to

20 S&LS RECORD $75.3 MILLION IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's 20 savings and loans, controlling their problem loans and 
profiting from low interest rates, recorded combined earnings of $75.3 million 
for the third quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The hefty earnings were similar to the previous two quarters and gave the 
once-battered local industry net income of $235.3 million for the first nine 
months last year, according to statistics released by the Office of Thrift 
Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar earnings for the final quarter, to be released in two months, would 
push the county's thrifts beyond $302.1 million earned in 1992 and give them 
back-to-back years of profits for the first time in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, all of the county's S&Ls, except for three failed ones run by 
thrift regulators, exceed federal levels for capital adequacy, which is the 
amount of cash an institution has as its last resort against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of everybody's loan portfolio generally has improved," said 
Stephen W. Prough, president of Western Financial Savings Bank in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Prough and other S&L leaders said they believe that thrifts have straightened 
out most loan problems and don't have new ones cropping up. That has allowed 
the thrifts to halt the excessive amount of money they had been taking from the 
bottom line and stashing in reserves to cover potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying the Southern California economy is getting any better; it's 
just not getting worse," Prough said. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed wave of mortgage refinancing last summer and fall was not much of 
a help to thrifts, said Thomas E. Prince, chief financial officer at Downey 
Savings & Loan in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for mortgage banking operators like Plaza Home Mortgage Bank, a Santa 
Ana thrift that sells all the loans it makes, refinancing essentially does 
little more than move loans around and cause additional expenses, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a refinancing market where borrowers are paying off current 
loans, you're just churning your loan portfolio," he said. "The only way to get 
loan growth (through refinancing) is in a market where borrowers are taking out 
more money than what they need to pay off mortgages." 
</P>
<P>
 The key, he and others said, would be an improved statewide economy that would 
provide long-term growth and ignite the long-dormant market for home purchase 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The local industry's profits were led by its bigger S&Ls. Household Bank in 
Newport Beach recorded $31.4 million in profits; American Savings Bank in 
Irvine earned $24.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one large thrift, Union Federal Savings Bank, generated red ink. The Los 
Angeles thrift, run by its troubled Brea parent company, lost $4.1 million for 
the third quarter. But in public offerings, parent UnionFed Financial Corp. 
picked up $39 million in capital for the thrift in September.

ADVANCED LOGIC REPORTS PROFIT 
</P>

<P>
 Advanced Logic Research Inc. on Thursday reported a profit for the first time 
in five quarters as cost-cutting moves and increasing demand for personal 
computers helped improve its bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 ALR reported earnings of $521,000, or 5 cents a share, for its first fiscal 
quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of $1.8 million, or 16 cents a share, 
for the same quarter a year ago.Quarterly sales rose 17%, to $49.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results are a culmination of the work we did to reorient our distribution 
strategy and restructure our work force in the last year," said Ron Sipkovich, 
chief financial officer of the Irvine-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, ALR laid off 10% of its 550-person work force and turned its 
attention to the high end of the corporate PC market instead of supplying a 
broad range of computers for all types of computer users. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition, forced by price-cutting by larger rivals in the industry, led 
ALR to post a $10.6-million loss for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The company churned out machines based on Intel Corp.'s fastest computer chip, 
the Pentium microprocessor, which serves as the brain of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipkovich said ALR also got a boost from a slowdown in the price war among 
personal computer manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has cut back to the bone in the last 18 months, and there's not a 
lot of room left to cut," he said.

AS DRESSING FOR MEN AND WOMEN SOFTENS UP, KNIT PICKS WEAVE WARM MAGIC, FROM 
SWEATER VESTS AND TUNICS TO COZY CARDIGANS AND PLAYFUL PULLOVERS; DREAM WEAVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who treasure things that are warm, handmade and one-of-a-kind are 
getting hooked on sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 They're forgoing plain, run-of-the-mill cardigans and seeking out winter's 
plentiful assortment of unusual knits that are like woven works of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether hand-knit or hand-loomed (both of which involve machine-knitting), 
these sweaters look like they could have been made by Grandma's knitting 
needles. Yet, thanks to innovative styling, they're anything but old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are finding sweaters with romantic crocheted details and vintage-looking 
buttons in contemporary tunic, vest and crop-top styles. Men can relax in 
simple cashmere Polo-style shirts or show some personality with novelty 
sweaters that have woven motifs illustrating a favorite interest such as golf 
or antique autos. 
</P>
<P>
 Knit cardigans, pullovers and vests are part of the layered, easy dressing 
that is taking hold in men's and women's fashions. For spring, designers showed 
layer upon layer of soft garments made from natural materials such as cotton, 
linen and silk dyed the colors of the earth. Sweaters woven by hand from 
organic fibers are the perfect spin-off to these natural, comfortable clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dressing is getting much softer, and whenever it gets less structured, people 
gravitate to sweaters," says Laura Downing, owner of the Laura Downing boutique 
for men and women in Laguna Beach. "Plus, people want to be comfortable. It's 
part of all that pajama dressing -- the palazzo pants and (flowing) tops." 
</P>
<P>
 Downing carries a large collection of one-of-a-kind sweaters made by hand from 
organic fibers. Most come in muted earth tones such as sand, taupe, ivory and 
brown. One company called Eggplant makes sweaters out of undyed, recycled 
cotton, including a long tunic that falls to the knees with a ribbed turtleneck 
and hem ($290). 
</P>
<P>
 Many hand-knit sweaters have a vintage look thanks to crocheted details and 
antique-style buttons. Designer Lianne Barnes' pale peach cardigan has a 
romantic crocheted front and cameo buttons ($275), while Annie M's 
terra-cotta-colored vest has buttons made of terra-cotta clay adorned with 
angel faces ($170). Laguna Beach designer Suzette Merrill found wooden buttons 
to adorn her taupe-colored crocheted cardigan ($210). 
</P>
<P>
 "These sweaters are really feminine," Downing says. 
</P>
<P>
 Men, too, are wearing comfortable sweaters spun from natural fibers. Laura 
Downing has a Polo-style shirt made of luxurious heather-colored cashmere by 
Raffi ($150), a ribbed cable knit pull-over in black and taupe linen and cotton 
by Mackinaw ($100), and an indigo-dyed cotton vest by Michael Ross ($190) 
guaranteed to fade like a pair of jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweaters are easy to wear. They're not complicated," says Flora Hills, owner 
of the Flora Hills women's boutique in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the easy pieces in the boutique's sweater collection: a velvety chenille 
cardigan in burnt brown with a floppy crocheted collar and cuffs and 
vintage-looking portrait buttons ($269), a charcoal-colored tunic made of a 
patchwork of knits, raw silk and thermal materials ($134) and a waffle-weave 
cotton cardigan ($226) layered over a longer matching tunic ($160), both 
hand-painted with flowers, chairs and other whimsical designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People appreciate the novelty of the handmade item," Hills says. 
</P>
<P>
 Appreciation for sweaters grows during hard times, and people turn to sweaters 
for comfort, according to Tom Fuller, owner of Fuller's For Men & Women in Dana 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweaters are warm and homey. They have a nice feel to them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty sweaters that reflect the wearer's personality have been especially 
hot, Fuller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller's hand-knit cotton sweaters have colorful motifs to fit all kinds of 
fetishes. Men can choose from a line of hand-knitted sweaters from Polo with 
motifs such as antique trucks and teddy bears (about $300), while women can 
find sweaters adorned with everything from sailboats and seashells ($500 to 
$600) to a teddy bear sporting a tartan kilt ($130). 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine hearts, Americana, dogs, sunflowers and gardening are among the many 
themes found on novelty sweaters for women and children at Ducks & Co. in South 
Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. The vests, cardigans and pullovers range from $70 to 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play off what people like or identify with, either through a profession 
or hobby," says Mariann Reynolds, owner and buyer for Ducks & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The uneven quality of the hand-knit sweaters only adds to their charm, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell hand-knit stitches because they're more irregular. It adds to 
the sweater's appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can't find the perfect sweater on store racks can have one 
custom-made. Hare's to Ewe in Orange not only knits sweaters according to one's 
specifications, they'll also spin the yarn out of any fiber. A basic custom 
sweater costs about $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Some customers grow their own cotton or brush the fur off of their pet rabbits 
and have it spun into a sweater, says Hare's to Ewe owner Sharon Bernheimer. 
She has knit sweaters out of dog hair, cat fur, musk ox, camel and even yak

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: FLAIR BY THE YARD; * ELEGANCE PARIS FABRICS SELLS THE 
KIND OF LUSCIOUS AND UNUSUAL MATERIAL ASSOCIATED WITH HAUTE COUTURE.

 Years ago, I was thrilled at uncovering a fabric store in an out-of-the way 
location, where the ultimate in women's high-fashion fabrics was available at 
heavily discounted prices. Elegance Paris Fabrics has since moved to a more 
traveled area -- Beverly Boulevard -- and much higher visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 One visit to this beautifully appointed catalogue outlet store makes you want 
to learn the fine art of dressmaking or find someone who already has mastered 
it. The fabrics are so elegant, so luscious, that they are comparable to those 
textures and patterns found only in haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
 The remnants are wonderful. Neatly arranged on hangers, they come in garment 
lengths, which can be from one yard for a skirt to between three and four yards 
for a suit, dress or blouse. These fabrics, in 55- or 60-inch widths, are shown 
in recent editions of the Elegance catalogue or in the fabric catalogues from 
Valentino and Ungaro. They have been discontinued and cannot be special 
ordered, but this is what brings the prices down, sometimes to 70% below the 
original cost. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-yard remnant of a 60-inch multicolored rayon-wool fabric that listed 
in the Valentino catalogue for $120 a yard is $90 for all three yards. A pink 
and silver glace (93% silk and 7% polyester) is on Page 113 of the Valentino 
catalogue for $180 a yard. A two-yard remnant that would make a dreamy blouse 
is $144. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Ungaro catalogue comes an Italian wool alpaca that looks like the 
$245-a-yard price that it sold for originally, but the three-yard remnant is 
$220. 
</P>
<P>
 The fabrics from Valentino and Ungaro, as well as the Elegance catalogues, 
cannot be found elsewhere in town. Bolts of material are also available, some 
at the same reduced prices as the remnants. Look for the cut-out pages from 
Elegance's catalogue to locate the bolts of these discontinued fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Remnants of silk and cotton Versace prints are on the remnant racks as well as 
on the bolts in the wall bins. They are marked between 25% and 50% off the 
original prices. 
</P>
<P>
 A posted fabric conversion chart is helpful in figuring the needed yardage. 
The sales personnel, all experts, can assist with any problems. For those who 
don't sew, the store maintains a list of dressmakers from Santa Barbara to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 To enhance the finished garments are thousands of imported buttons beautifully 
displayed for visibility, and priced from $1 to $125. These are not discounted, 
but look at the money you'll save on the fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Elegance Paris Fabrics is an international company, this is the only 
outlet store in the United States. That explains why you'll find top California 
designers shopping here with their clients, and why this is one of the first 
stops for the international woman who comes to Los Angeles.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; ONE OF THE BEST OF BREED; BENVENUTO CAFFE IS AN INTIMATE, 
RUSTIC ITALIAN EATERY, THOUGH MR. HYDE SOMETIMES SHOWS HIS FACE AT LUNCHTIME.

 Sometimes, when daydreaming, I imagine that long after mankind disappears, 
even after the last species of insect has ceased to exist, there will still be 
an Italian restaurant out there somewhere. And in it, an android will be 
pushing the tiramisu for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian restaurants are to our industry what hydrogen is to the universe, the 
most prevalent of all substances. Everywhere you turn these days, or so it 
seems, a new one is opening, an old one closing. We know this food well and we 
rarely tire of eating it: pizzas, pastas, simply grilled meats. Menus are 
planned to be within a sharply defined eating curve. Only a few daring, 
cutting-edge chefs surprise you with dishes like bottarga (fish roe) or lumache 
(snails). Tiramisu, once an exotic confection, has become as commonplace as the 
lemon peel on your espresso saucer. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Benvenuto Caffe, genus late 20th-Century Italian cafe. This small 
storefront is located on the spot that once housed the positively tiny (and 
perfectly fine) Bellablue, but that doesn't prevent it from being a proper 
venue. It's a rustic-looking joint with a handsome, earth-toned tile floor, 
softly sponged walls, a marble bar, chairs crafted from wicker and wood, 
flickering candlelight and the odd exposed duct peering out at you from above. 
The new owners have enlarged the seating area from when it was Bellablue but at 
the same time have made this space more intimate. You might even call it 
romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank a well-traveled chef by the name of Mustafa Saad for the restaurant's 
good cooking. Some of you may remember Saad from a nice little neighborhood 
place called Farfalle on Hillhurst Avenue in Los Feliz. Saad cooks with skill 
and occasional touches of personality, adding chicken sausage to a staid 
lasagna recipe, for instance. This place is a virtual extension of his original 
-- and equally fine -- Benvenuto Caffe in West Hollywood. The public just 
hasn't caught on to it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jekyll and Hyde play bit parts here, depending on whether you come for lunch 
or dinner. It's more of Mr. Hyde at lunch, when the service is spottier and you 
can never be sure who is cooking. Evenings, things run more smoothly. Pizza 
crusts are cracker crisp, pastas are chewy, the pace is more leisurely. It's 
also a lot prettier in this restaurant by candlelight. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 As good as many of these dishes are, I enjoyed nothing so much as the 
delicious house flat bread, a thin, crisp bread brushed with herbs and baked in 
a wood-fired pizza oven. You'll get a small plateful of extra virgin olive oil 
into which garlic has been crushed, and it is a task to stop the dipping and 
eating. One evening two of us ate three baskets of this bread and who knows how 
much oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The best antipasti are probably a workmanlike, razor-thin carpaccio piled up 
in a mound on a pile of fresh greens, and grilled eggplant with roasted 
peppers, but I wouldn't call appetizers this restaurant's strong suit. It's a 
better idea to head right into these wonderful pizzas, with names like 
Calabrese, Adriatico, rustica. Rustica is a joy -- sliced tomato, mozzarella, 
tomato sauce, fresh basil and more garlic -- but I wouldn't quibble if 
Calabrese -- goat cheese and black olives, basically -- was substituted for it. 
Adriatico has shrimp, pesto and lots of mozzarella cheese.  
</P>
<P>
 Pastas are house-made in a kitchen that really understands the concept of al 
dente. There's a great, creamy spaghetti carbonara , a giant tangle of perfect 
noodles in a white ceramic bowl. I'll ask the chef to use a bit more pancetta 
and a bit less cream next time, but it's already heaven. Tagliolini rosso al 
pollo is an oddball beet pasta with chicken, broccoli, sun-dried tomato, garlic 
and oil. The fine, fat gnocchi, an acid test for any Italian kitchen, pass with 
flying colors. These little potato dumplings practically melt in your mouth. 
</P>

 There's also a compelling reason for ordering the grills here: They are quite 
reasonably priced. Where else around here can you get a full-fledged veal chop, 
on the bone, for only $14, the top price on Benvenuto's menu? Pollo arrosto al 
forno is chicken baked in the wood oven with rosemary, served with terrific 
roasted potatoes and a medley of vegetables. You'll find fresh fish daily, too. 
I had a great piece of salmon in a Play-Doh green pesto sauce, daunting at 
first, but tasty to the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Have the flourless chocolate torte or a rich, crusted apple tart for dessert 
and a frothy cappuccino. Their tiramisu is a thin layer of chocolate-dusted 
mascarpone atop some nicely soaked ladyfingers, and I did sneak in a bite or 
two. Psst -- don't tell anybody, OK? Where and When 
</P>
